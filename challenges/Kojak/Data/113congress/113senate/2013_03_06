Assad grows increasingly desperate as rebels continue to \ngain ground despite the full force of Assad's military arsenal of \nplanes, bombs, and rockets. President Assad should understand the world \nis watching his every action and will not tolerate his unforgivable \nslaughter of innocent citizens, including the potential future use of \nchemical weapons.\n  President Obama has made clear--and I support him 100 percent--the \nuse of such chemical weapons would constitute a red line for the United \nStates and for the national community. Rather than continue to kill his \nown people, Assad should end the bloodshed and relinquish power to \nSyria's citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1137-8", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1137-S1138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BRENNAN NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as America closely observes the unfolding of \nevents in Syria and deals with varying threats around the world, it is \ncrucial that President Obama has a seasoned national security team in \nplace.\n  It is often said there is no substitute for experience, so it is \nnatural that a 25-year CIA veteran, John Brennan, was reported out of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee by a wide margin on a bipartisan \nvote.\n  Mr. Brennan is a highly qualified nominee and should be confirmed \nimmediately. As Deputy National Security Adviser since 2009, John \nBrennan has been President Obama's chief homeland security and \ncounterterrorism adviser. He has been at the forefront of every major \nnational security decision made during the Obama administration. He is \nresponsible for the White House response to pandemics, cyber threats, \nnatural disasters, and terrorism attacks. He has played an instrumental \nrole in finding Osama bin Laden, killing bin Laden, and, in effect, \ndecimating al-Qaida.\n\n[[Page S1138]]\n\n  His distinguished intelligence career began more than 30 years ago \nwhen he joined the CIA as a career trainee straight out of graduate \nschool. Mr. Brennan worked his way up through the agency to serve in \nsenior management roles in the CIA, including as Deputy Executive \nDirector under George Tenant. Years spent working on covert and \nanalytical missions and as chief of station in Saudi Arabia give him a \ncomprehensive understanding of the CIA's capabilities and inner \nworkings. His knowledge of the Middle East will be essential as we \ncontinue to work to defeat al-Qaida and other terrorist threats.\n  Mr. Brennan has distinguished himself outside of government as well. \nHe spent 4 years in the private sector as president and CEO of the \nAnalysis Corporation. His extensive intelligence background and \nexecutive experience uniquely qualify him to lead the Central \nIntelligence Agency.\n  Just as CIA faces the challenges abroad, it also faces significant \ndecisions about its future. John Brennan must guide the CIA through a \nseries of considerations dealing with the Agency's relationship with \nour military, how the Agency should respond to the conclusions of a \nrecent Senate Intelligence Committee report on interrogation techniques \nand practices, and, finally, the Agency's response to demands for \ntransparency. These considerations must not be made lightly, and John \nBrennan will give them the attention they deserve in his role as \nDirector.\n  The Senate must also approach its duty to advise and consent with the \nsolemnity it deserves. Unfortunately, the confirmation process has \nfocused too much this year and the last two Congresses on partisan \npolitical considerations and not enough on the quality of the nominees.\n  I am very disappointed that I am forced to file cloture on John \nBrennan's nomination. What does that accomplish? If someone doesn't \nlike him, come here and give a big speech, wave your arms, scream and \nshout, and vote against him. But why hold up the entire Senate over a \nmeaningless vote?\n  My Republican colleagues have already obstructed several critical \nnominations this year. I hope that pattern of obstructionist behavior \nwill not persist. I do hope for the sake of the country the obstruction \nof the last two Congresses will vanish. I feel very certain that in Mr. \nBrennan's case concerns for national security will outweigh the desire \nto grandstand for the weakened tea party.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1138-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1138-S1146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the issue before us is Caitlin Halligan's \nnomination for the DC Circuit Court. I spoke yesterday in support of \nher nomination. It is unfortunate she is going to be forced to face a \nfilibuster; in other words, that the Republicans are going to insist on \na 60-vote margin for her approval. That is unfortunate because we have \ntried in the beginning of this Senate session to avoid this kind of \nfilibuster confrontation.\n  In the last several years, we have had over 400 filibusters, a \nrecordbreaking number of filibusters in the Senate. What that means is \nthe ordinary business of the Senate has been stopped 400 times, when \nthose who were trying to bring up a nomination or bill or amendment \nfaced a filibuster which required literally stretching the vote out \nover days and sometimes even over 1 week. That is unnecessary. It is \nfrustrating as well.\n  There are a lot of things we need to do and a lot of issues we need \nto face. I am not afraid of taking on controversial votes on the floor. \nI think that was part of the job assignment coming here. I quoted many \ntimes my late friend, my colleague in the House, Mike Synar of \nOklahoma, who used to get right in the face of his colleagues at the \nDemocratic caucus when they complained about controversial votes on the \nfloor and he said: If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a \nfirefighter. If you don't want to vote on controversial issues, don't \nrun for Congress. That is what this job is about.\n  I agree with that. As painful as some of these votes have been for me \nand others, we should never use that as an excuse for not tackling the \nimportant issues of our time. But this has become routine now--routine \nfilibusters, trying to stop the Senate time and time again. What is \nparticularly insidious about this strategy on this nominee is she is an \nextraordinarily well-qualified person. ``Unanimously well qualified,'' \nthat is the rating she received from the American Bar Association. When \nwe look at her resume and the things she has done, she stands out as \nnot only an excellent candidate for DC Circuit but one of the best we \nhave had for any judicial position. She is being stopped by the \nRepublicans.\n  What is their argument? She was the solicitor general for the State \nof New York. The solicitor general is the hired attorney for a client \nknown as the State of New York. So many times she was sent into court \nto argue a position that had been taken by the State or by the \nGovernor, and she did her job as their counsel, to argue their position \nas convincingly as possible. That is what lawyers do every day in \ncourtrooms all across America.\n  Back in the day when I practiced law, I didn't measure every client \nwho came through the door to ask: Do I agree with every position my \nclient has taken? Of course not. The belief is in our system of justice \nboth sides deserve a voice in the courtroom and both sides, doing their \nbest, give justice an opportunity. That is what Caitlin Halligan did as \nthe solicitor general for the State of New York.\n  Listen to this. One of the arguments being made against her was that \nwhile she was solicitor general she served on a bar committee that \nissued a report that favored using article III courts for the \nprosecution of terrorists. Article III courts are the ordinary criminal \ncourts of the land under our Constitution. The report argued that \nposition. Many Republicans take an opposite position, that anyone \naccused of terrorism should be tried in a military tribunal, not an \nordinary criminal court. They have held that position. They argue that \nposition. They get red in the face saying that is the only way to take \ncare of terrorists and they ignore reality.\n  The reality is, since 9/11, President Bush, as well as President \nObama, had a choice between prosecuting terrorists in article III \ncourts, the criminal courts or in military tribunals. In over 400 \ncases, they successfully, both Presidents, chose to prosecute accused \nterrorists in the article III courts--successfully. In only five \ncases--I believe it is five--have they used military tribunals. The \noverwhelming evidence is that the article III criminal courts have \nworked well. Prosecutions have been successful. This argument: Oh, if \nyou have to read Miranda rights to an accused terrorist, we will never \nbe able to prosecute them, they will lawyer up in a hurry. It doesn't \nquite work that way. In fact, we found the opposite to be true. When \nmany of these folks with connections through terrorism are taken \nthrough the ordinary criminal process, they end up being more \ncooperative than through a military tribunal. That is a fact. A \nPresident and the Attorney General have to make that decision. So here \nis Caitlin Halligan, solicitor general for the State of New York, whose \nname is on a bar committee report favoring the use of article III \ncourts, which overwhelmingly President Bush and President Obama decided \nto do, and now the Republicans say that disqualifies her, that \ndisqualifies her from serving on the DC Circuit Court.\n  It also is ridiculous position to argue that because an attorney \nargues a point of view in a case, that is her own point of view. I \nrefer my colleagues to the testimony of Justice Roberts when he was up \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, when he was asked point blank: \nYou have represented some pretty unsavory clients, some people we might \ndisagree with, does this reflect your point of view? He reminded us \nwhat jurisprudence and justice are about in this country, that you will \nhave attorneys arguing their clients' point of view, doing their best \nfor their client, whether they happen to agree with that client's \nphilosophy or not.\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\n  Every attorney is bound to stand by the truth when it comes to \ntestimony. You can never ever allow a client to misstate the truth \nknowingly in a courtroom. That is hard and fast. But when it comes to a \npoint of view, for goodness' sake, good attorneys argue the best case \nthey can for the people they represent, as Caitlin Halligan did. As \nJustice Roberts reminded us, it is central to the issue of American \njustice. One of our most famous Presidents, John Adams, you would think \nruined his political career because when the Boston Massacre occurred, \nJohn Adams, the attorney in Boston, stood and said I will defend the \nBritish soldiers. He was defending the British soldiers who had killed \nAmerican soldiers. He did it. That was his responsibility as an \nattorney. He went on to be elected President.\n  This argument against Caitlin Halligan, from this point of view, is \nas empty as any argument I have heard on the floor of the Senate and \nthe Republicans insist on filibustering again her nomination over such \na week reed of an argument. It is embarrassing. It is troubling. It \ncalls into question whether the agreement earlier this year on rules \nchanges in the Senate, a bipartisan effort to try to get this Chamber \nback on track to solving problems on a bipartisan basis, did the job.\n\n  We had the first filibuster in history of a Secretary of Defense--the \nfirst. Chuck Hagel was held up for 10 days because of a Republican \nfilibuster, the first time that has ever occurred. Now we follow it \nwith this filibuster of this DC Circuit nominee? I don't think we have \nachieved much in our rules reform. I don't think our spirit of \nbipartisanship has shown much in terms of results.\n  I hate to suggest this, but if this is an indication of where we are \nheaded, we need to revisit the rules again. We need to go back to them \nagain. I am sorry to say it because I was hopeful a bipartisan approach \nto dealing with these issues would work. It is the best thing for this \nChamber--for the people serving and for the history of this \ninstitution. But if this Caitlin Halligan nomination is an indication \nof things to come, we have to revisit the rules. If we are now going to \nfilibuster based on such weak arguments, then I think we need to \nrevisit the rules.\n  They said in politics when I was growing up--one of the great \npoliticians I worked for, a man named Cecil Partee, used to say for \nevery political position you take there is a good reason--and a real \nreason. So the good reason, at least in their eyes, on the Republican \nside, is that Caitlin Halligan argued in court for positions they do \nnot agree with. As I said earlier, I think that is an empty accusation. \nWhat is the real reason? There is a real reason why they are opposing \nCaitlin Halligan time and again. It is because the DC Circuit Court is \none of the most important courts in America, some argue as important as \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, because the DC Circuit Court, time and again, \nconsiders the rules and regulations and laws which are promulgated in \nWashington. It is the first court of review and if that bench on the DC \nCircuit is tipped one way or the other, too conservative or too \nliberal, it shows.\n  Right now it has been tipped toward the conservative side. \nRepublicans engineered a deal when we were, years ago, embroiled in \ncontroversy over this issue of filibustering judicial nominees. They \nengineered and brokered a deal to make several appointments to the DC \nCircuit that tipped the balance toward the conservative side.\n  Now, out of the 11 positions in the DC Circuit, only 7 are filled. We \nare trying to fill the 8th, and they are worried that if Caitlin \nHalligan comes in--and she is not as conservative as they wish--it may \nbe closer to balance. Isn't that what we want, a more balanced court? \nIt is what we should want. It is the real reason the Republicans oppose \nher nomination.\n  I am sorry for her that she has to be a victim of this political \nstrategy. It doesn't have much to do with her personally, and I hope a \nfew Republicans who are necessary will step up and give us a chance to \nvote on her nomination; otherwise, we are back into the doldrums again \nin terms of the Senate embroiled in controversy, stuck on filibusters.\n  Since no one else is seeking the floor at this moment, I ask \nunanimous consent that the time consumed during quorum calls be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on cloture \non the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe DC Circuit. I will again oppose invoking cloture on the nomination, \nand I will explain why.\n  In short, Ms. Halligan's record of advocacy and her activist view of \nthe judiciary lead me to conclude she would bring that activism right \nto the court. As I have said many times before, the role of a judge in \nour system is to determine what the law says, not what they or anybody \nelse wants it to be. That is not Ms. Halligan's view of the courts. She \nviews them as a means to ``enable enviable social progress and \nmobility''--to ``enable enviable social progress and mobility'' with \nthe judges, not the American people, using their office to determine \nwhat ``progress'' is ``enviable.'' That is the view of Ms. Halligan.\n  When she was in a position of authority, she put that activist view \ninto practice time and time again. On the subject of second amendment \nrights, Ms. Halligan, as solicitor general of New York, advanced the \ndubious legal theory that those who make firearms should be liable for \nthe criminal acts of third parties who misuse them.\n  Imposing potentially massive tort liability against the makers of a \nlawful product because of the criminal acts of someone else did not \nseem much like ``enviable social progress'' to Randall Casseday, who is \nwith Kahr Arms, which sells firearms to the New York City Police \nDepartment. Here is what he said:\n\n       I can't see how Kahr Arms can be responsible for misuse of \n     its product. I don't see how you can do that. One lawsuit \n     would put us out of business.\n\n  Fortunately, the State court in New York followed the law and \nrejected Ms. Halligan's entreaty that it make up new law in order to \nachieve the so-called social progress she envisioned. The court \nobserved that it had never recognized the novel claim pursued by Ms. \nHalligan, nor had other courts, for that matter. Moreover, the State \ncourt called what she wanted it to do to manufacturers of a legal \nproduct ``legally inappropriate'' and said the power she wanted the \ncourts to assert was the responsibility of ``the Legislative and the \nExecutive branches.''\n  So out of bounds were the types of frivolous lawsuits pursued by Ms. \nHalligan that Congress did something rare: It actually passed tort \nreform to stop them, and it passed by a wide bipartisan majority. In \nher zeal for these frivolous lawsuits, Ms. Halligan then chose to \ncriticize the Congress for having the temerity to exercise its \npolicymaking responsibility to protect a lawful industry. However, she \ndidn't just criticize the Congress for trying to stop the frivolous \nlawsuits she was pursuing, she chose to exaggerate the scope of the \nbill by claiming that it would stop State legislatures by ``cutting off \nat the pass any attempt to find solutions that might reduce gun \ncrime.'' This assertion was false. It strains credulity that nearly \nhalf the Senate Democratic Conference who supported the legislation \nwould vote not only for tort reform but would vote for Federal \nlegislation that would block States from passing anything at all \nrelated to gun crime. Her mischaracterization of the legislation \nunderscores her zeal for the frivolous lawsuits she was pursuing.\n  True to the adage ``frequently wrong but never in doubt,'' Ms. \nHalligan was undeterred. Having had both her State court and the \nCongress repudiate her novel legal theories, Ms. Halligan then filed an \namicus brief in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in another \nfrivolous case against firearms manufacturers. This time she claimed \nthe new law Congress passed was unconstitutional. Not surprisingly, she \nlost that case too.\n  Ms. Halligan's stubborn pursuit of frivolous claims against gun \nmanufacturers is a textbook example of judicial activism--using the \ncourts to achieve a political agenda no matter what the law says.\n  Her pursuit of losing legal theories in the service of her own \npersonal views\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\ndoesn't stop there. On enemy combatants, Ms. Halligan signed a report \nas a bar association member that asserted that the authorization for \nuse of military force did not authorize long-term detention of enemy \ncombatants. In 2005 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld \nthat the President did, in fact, have this authority. Yet despite this \nprecedent, Ms. Halligan chose to file an amicus brief years later \narguing that the President did not possess this legal authority that \nthe Supreme Court had already upheld.\n  On immigration, Ms. Halligan filed an amicus brief in the Supreme \nCourt arguing that the National Labor Relations Board should have the \nlegal authority to grant back pay to illegal aliens. However, Federal \nlaw prohibits illegal aliens from working in the United States in the \nfirst place. Fortunately, the Court sided with the law and disagreed \nwith Ms. Halligan on that novel legal theory as well.\n  The point here is that even in cases where the law is clear or the \ncourts have already spoken--including the Supreme Court--Ms. Halligan \nchose to get involved anyway by using arguments that had already been \nrejected either by the courts, the legislature, or, in the case of \nfrivolous claims against the gun manufacturers, by both.\n  In other words, Ms. Halligan has time and again sought to push her \nviews over and above those of the courts or those of the people as \nreflected in the law. Ms. Halligan's record strongly suggests she would \nnot view a seat on the U.S. appeals court as an opportunity to \nadjudicate, evenhandedly, disputes between parties based on the law but \ninstead as an opportunity to put her thumb on the scale in favor of \nwhatever individual or group or cause she happened to believe in.\n  I have nothing against this nominee personally. I just believe, as I \nthink most other Americans do, that we should be putting people on the \nbench who are committed to an evenhanded interpretation of the law so \nthat everyone who walks into the courtroom knows he or she will have a \nfair shake. In my view, Ms. Halligan is not such a nominee.\n  I will be voting against cloture on this nomination, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Our decision to do so is not unprecedented--far from it. Many of our \nDemocratic colleagues who are expressing shock and utter amazement that \nwe denied cloture on Ms. Halligan's nomination for a second time felt \nno compunction about denying cloture on Miguel Estrada's nomination to \nthe very same court. They denied nomination for him seven times, in \nfact, even though--unlike Ms. Halligan's record--Mr. Estrada's \nbackground did not evidence a penchant for judicial activism.\n  We have begun this Congress by making progress on filling judicial \nvacancies. I am happy to resume working with the majority on doing so, \nbut because of her record of activism, giving Ms. Halligan a lifetime \nappointment to the DC Circuit is a bridge too far.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in full support of Caitlin \nHalligan and must strongly disagree with my friend from Kentucky, the \nRepublican leader. The bottom line is very simple: She is a well-\nqualified nominee, and we know that.\n  The Republican leader acts as if Ms. Halligan were acting on her own. \nWhether the Senator from Kentucky agrees or disagrees, the Republican \nleader cannot cite a single instance where Ms. Halligan was not acting \nas an attorney representing the views of someone else. The same was \ntrue with what John Roberts did, and the same was true for what Sam \nAlito did. When those issues were brought up, our colleagues on the \nother side justifiably said we cannot attribute those views to them \nwhen they are representing somebody as an attorney. We all know that \nthe obligation of an attorney is to represent his or her client, \nwhether we agree or disagree with those views.\n  When one works as solicitor general, they represent the State of New \nYork. The State of New York's views on guns were clear, and Ms. \nHalligan ably represented those views. But nothing she has said about \nguns that was cited by my good friend the Republican leader was her own \nview. Similarly on the terrorism cases, she was representing an office \nthat was prosecuting, not her views, so the comparison to Miguel \nEstrada is like night and day. Miguel Estrada had his own very, very \nclear views on the law, and he stated them in speeches, in articles, \nand in other ways. That is not so with Ms. Halligan. In fact, I \nchallenge the other side to give me one instance where they disagree \nwith something Ms. Halligan stated as her own views as opposed to \nrepresenting someone as a lawyer should.\n  What is really going on here? What is going on is that our colleagues \nwant to keep the second most important court in the land, the DC \nCircuit, vacant because right now there are four vacancies and the \nmajority of those on the court have been appointees of Republican \nPresidents and, in fact, are very conservative. That is what is going \non. Let's call it what it is. This has nothing to do with Ms. Halligan. \nThis has to do with keeping a court they care about from having someone \nwho doesn't have those same very conservative views. Ms. Halligan is a \nmoderate, and that bothers people on the other side. It bothers the \nhard right who use the DC Circuit in their court cases to try to \nconstrict government.\n  I say this to my good colleagues: We have come to an agreement on \ndistrict court judges and on other nominees. We have come to a general \nagreement that there ought to be more comity. The Republican leader, my \nfriend from Tennessee, and so many others have said we should do that. \nThe filibustering of Caitlin Halligan is not, I will admit, against the \nletter of our agreement because it simply applies to district court \njudges, but it sure is against the spirit.\n  All those on our side who said we should change the rules because \nissues such as the filibuster of Ms. Halligan would occur are being \nvindicated even though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwould not want that type of option to be on the table.\n  I say this to my colleagues because I believe and I think most of us \nbelieve that this is nothing about Ms. Halligan, but it is about \nkeeping the DC Circuit vacant and not allowing our President to \nrightfully fill those vacancies. We are going to bring nominee after \nnominee after nominee up to fill that DC Circuit. Are they going to \ncontinue to filibuster every nominee and find some trivial excuse to \nfilibuster him or her? Because that is what is going to happen.\n  The obstructionist views that some on the other side have held and \nimplemented--which served them so poorly in the election of 2012, in \nthe polls, and in what the American people want, which is for us to \ncome together--will be exposed.\n  I would urge my colleagues to forgo this charade. Don't vote for \nHalligan if you don't like her, but don't filibuster her, because we \nare going to come back time after time after time with nominees to this \ncircuit who are qualified, who are moderate, and who have fine personal \nethics. Are they going to ObamaCare each one of them? Because that is \nthe challenge they will face.\n  I urge and plead with my colleagues, based on the new comity we are \ndesperately seeking in this Chamber, to avoid this filibuster, allow \nCaitlin Halligan to have an up-or-down vote. She is extremely worthy of \nthe position for which she was nominated. It is only ideology, only a \nview that this important circuit should not be filled with nominees \nwhom our Democratic President nominates that is motivating, in my \njudgment, this action.\n  I think my time has expired, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I realize we have not gone in the regular \norder with the manager of the nomination speaking first. We are having \na hearing right now with the Attorney General. So I ask unanimous \nconsent, when the distinguished Senator finishes his\n\n[[Page S1141]]\n\nspeech, whatever length it is, and all time will have then been used up \nso there would not be any time reserved for the manager of this \nnomination, to speak for 2 minutes at the conclusion of Senator \nGrassley's remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask to speak for 15 minutes on this \nnomination that is before the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination \nof Caitlin Halligan, the President's nominee for the United States \nCircuit Court for the District of Columbia. I wish to take a few \nminutes to explain to my colleagues why we should not change our prior \nposition regarding this nomination. It was previously rejected and \nshould be rejected again.\n  Before I talk about Ms. Halligan's record, I want to comment on the \nprocess. While I recognize the majority leader's right to bring up this \nnomination, I question why we are spending time on a politically \ncharged and divisive nomination. I wish the Senate instead would focus \non the critical fiscal, national security, and domestic issues we face.\n  The Senate determined more than a year ago that this nomination \nshould not be confirmed. Rather than accepting the Senate's decision, \nthe President has renominated Ms. Halligan. It is time for the \nPresident and Senate Democrats to accept the fact that this nomination \nis not going to be confirmed by the Senate. We need to move on.\n  It is well understood and accepted that nominations to the DC Circuit \ndeserve special scrutiny. The Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit hears \ncases affecting all Americans. It is frequently the last stop for cases \ninvolving Federal statutes and regulations. Many view this court as \nsecond in importance only to the Supreme Court. And as we all know, \njudges who sit on the DC Circuit are frequently considered for the \nSupreme Court. So there is a lot at stake with nominations to this \ncourt. This is a court where we can least afford to confirm an activist \njudge.\n  I have a number of concerns regarding Ms. Halligan's views that \nindicate she will be an activist judge. There are concerns regarding \nher judicial philosophy and her approach to interpreting the \nConstitution. Her stated view that courts seek ``to solve problems and \nnot just to adjudicate them'' indicates a willingness to abuse the role \nof a judge should she be confirmed. She has advocated for an ``evolving \nstandard'' of the Constitution, indicating a judicial philosophy that \nembraces the notion of a living Constitution. In adopting the ``living \nConstitution'' theory of interpretation, judges routinely substitute \ntheir own personal views in place of what the Constitution demands.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues why I have concluded that Ms. \nHalligan would approach judging with an activist bent. Let me give just \na couple examples, beginning with her record on the second amendment.\n  In 2003, Congress was debating the Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act or, as most of us called it, the Gun Liability bill. At the \ntime, gun manufacturers were facing lawsuits based on meritless legal \ntheories. This frivolous litigation was specifically designed to drive \ngun manufacturers out of business.\n  As it turns out, while many of us--both Republicans and Democrats--\nwere fighting here in Congress to stop these lawsuits, Ms. Halligan was \npursuing this precise type of litigation in the State of New York.\n  In New York v. Sturm & Ruger, Ms. Halligan advanced the novel legal \ntheory that gun manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers contributed \nto a ``public nuisance'' of illegal handguns in the State. Therefore, \nshe argued, gun manufacturers should be liable for the criminal conduct \nof third parties.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that we should not consider this \naspect of Ms. Halligan's record because at the time she was working as \nthe solicitor general of New York. But no one forced Ms. Halligan to \napprove and sign this brief. No one compelled her to advance a \ncompletely frivolous legal theory.\n  I believe a close examination of Ms. Halligan's record indicates she \nwas more than just an advocate. She was using the full weight of her \noffice to advance and promote a political agenda masked by a legal \ndoctrine that is well outside of the legal mainstream.\n  In the case I just mentioned, which was the first of two cases Ms. \nHalligan was involved in regarding gun manufacturers, the New York \nState appellate court found her argument to be completely meritless and \nexplicitly rejected her theory.\n  The court went so far as to say that it had ``never recognized [the] \ncommon-law public nuisance cause of action'' that Ms. Halligan \nadvanced, and that it would be ``legally inappropriate'' to permit the \nlawsuit to proceed. Moreover, far from accepting Ms. Halligan's \ninvitation to legislate from the bench, the court properly concluded \nthat ``the Legislative and Executive branches are better suited to \naddress the societal problems concerning the already heavily regulated \ncommercial activity at issue.''\n  I will remind my colleagues that Ms. Halligan was pursuing this legal \ntheory at the same time we were debating the gun liability bill here in \nCongress. There is no question that the dubious legal theories she was \nadvancing in court reflected her own personal views, not just a \nposition she was advocating on behalf of a client.\n  In a speech Ms. Halligan delivered on the subject in May of 2003, she \nsaid she opposed the legislation being considered by Congress because, \n``[i]f enacted, this legislation would nullify lawsuits brought by \nnearly 30 cities and counties--including one filed by my office--as \nwell as scores of lawsuits brought by individual victims or groups \nharmed by gun violence. . . . Such an action would likely cut off at \nthe pass any attempt by States to find solutions--through the legal \nsystem or their own legislatures--that might reduce gun crime or \npromote greater responsibility among gun dealers.''\n  Later in that same speech, Ms. Halligan expressed her view of the law \nand legal system. She said, ``Courts are the special friend of liberty. \nTime and time again we have seen how the dynamics of our rule of law \nenables enviable social progress and mobility.''\n  I find this statement troubling, especially as it relates to the \nnuisance lawsuits against gun manufacturers. Those lawsuits are a prime \nexample of how activists on the far left try to use the courts to \naffect social policy changes that they are unable to achieve through \nthe ballot box. That is why I believe those lawsuits represented not \nonly bad policy but, more broadly, an activist approach to the law.\n  Now, as I said, the State appellate court rejected her legal theory, \nand Congress subsequently passed legislation--by a wide bipartisan \nmargin--to stop those lawsuits. But Ms. Halligan still forged ahead. In \n2006, notwithstanding the fact the Congress had passed tort reform in \nthis area, she attempted once again to revive the ability of States to \npursue gun manufacturers. Only this time, she advanced her claims in \nFederal court, arguing the legislation Congress passed was \nunconstitutional. Fortunately, the Federal appellate court rejected her \nlegal theory as well.\n  Ms. Halligan's record of taking far left and legally untenable \npositions is not limited to her legal briefs in gun cases. Another \nexample of how she crossed the line from advocate to activist is \nScheidler v. National Organization for Women. In that case she argued \nfor an expansive definition of extortion under the Hobbs Act. Her \nsupport of NOW's claim that pro-life groups had engaged in extortion \nwas rejected by eight Justices of the Supreme Court, including Justice \nGinsburg--one of the most liberal justices on the Court.\n  There are a number of other aspects of her record that I find \nproblematic. For instance, Ms. Halligan's views on the war on terror \nand the detention of enemy combatants are especially troublesome \nbecause Ms. Halligan is a nominee for the DC Circuit, where many of \nthese issues are heard.\n  In 2004, Ms. Halligan was a member of a New York City bar association \nthat published a report entitled: ``The Indefinite Detention of `Enemy \nCombatants' and National Security in the Context of the War on \nTerror.''\n  That report argued there were constitutional concerns with the \ndetention of terrorists in military custody. It\n\n[[Page S1142]]\n\nalso argued vigorously against trying enemy combatants in military \ntribunals. Instead, it argued in favor of trying terrorists in \ncivilian, article III courts.\n  Ms. Halligan is listed as one of the authors of that report. But when \nit came time to testify at her hearing, Ms. Halligan tried to distance \nherself from the report. She testified that she did not become aware of \nthe report until 2010. In a followup letter after her hearing, Ms. \nHalligan did concede that ``it is quite possible that [a draft of the \nreport] was sent to me,'' but that she could not recall reading the \nreport.\n  I recognize that memories fade over time. But, as I assess her \ntestimony, I think it is noteworthy that at least four other members of \nthat bar association committee abstained from the final report. Ms. \nHalligan did not.\n  I would also point out that several years later she co-authored an \namicus brief before the Supreme Court in the 2009 case of Al-Marri v. \nSpagone. Ms. Halligan's brief in that case took a position similar to \nthe 2004 report with respect to military detention of terrorists. In \nthat case, she argued that the Authorization for Use of Military Force \ndid not authorize the seizure and indefinite military detention of a \nlawful permanent resident alien who conspired with al-Qaida to execute \nterror attacks on the United States.\n  The fact that Ms. Halligan coauthored this brief, pro bono, suggests \nto me that she supported the conclusions reached by the 2004 report. \nAnd again, this issue is particularly troublesome for a nominee to the \nDC Circuit, where many of these questions are heard.\n  There are additional aspects of Ms. Halligan's record that concern \nme.\n  As New York's Solicitor General, Ms. Halligan was responsible for \nrecommending to Attorney General Spitzer that the State intervene in \nseveral high-profile Supreme Court cases. She filed amicus briefs that \nconsistently took activist positions on controversial issues such as \nabortion, affirmative action, immigration, and federalism.\n  These are just some of my concerns regarding the nominee's judicial \nphilosophy and her approach to interpreting the Constitution. These are \nneither trivial nor inconsequential grounds on which to oppose her \nnomination.\n  Based on her record, I simply do not believe she will be able to put \naside her long record of liberal advocacy and be a fair and impartial \njurist.\n  Supporters argue that out of a sense of ``fairness'' we should \nconfirm Ms. Halligan. They note that her nomination has been pending \nfor over 2 years.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that while this seat has been vacant for \nover 7 years, it has not been without a nominee for all of that time.\n  Following the elevation of then-Circuit Judge John Roberts in 2005, \nPresident George W. Bush nominated an eminently qualified individual \nfor this seat, Peter Keisler. Mr. Keisler was widely lauded as a \nconsensus, bipartisan nominee. His distinguished record of public \nservice included service as Acting Attorney General. Despite his broad \nbipartisan support and qualifications, Mr. Keisler waited 918 days for \na committee vote that never came. There was no clamor from the other \nside that we needed to fill the vacancy. There was no demand that Mr. \nKeisler be afforded an up-or-down vote. So it seems to me that too \noften, with my Democratic colleagues, ``fairness'' is a one-way street.\n  When the Democrats refused to consider Mr. Keisler's nomination--or \neven to give him a committee vote--the other side justified their \nactions based on the DC Circuit caseload. So I would like to make a few \ncomments about how the current caseload of the DC Circuit stacks up \nagainst the caseload that existed when Mr. Keisler's nomination was \nsubjected to a pocket filibuster.\n  Before doing so, I would again emphasize that given Ms. Halligan's \nrecord on a host of controversial issues, the case for rejecting her \nnomination would remain, regardless of the number of vacancies or the \ncourt's workload. However, since some of my colleagues are declaring a \n``judicial emergency'' on the DC Circuit Court, let me set the record \nstraight. Contrary to assertions we have recently heard regarding the \ncourt's workload, since 2005, the DC caseload has actually continued to \ndecline. The total number of appeals filed is down over 13 percent. The \ntotal number of appeals pending is down over 10 percent; filings per \npanel are down almost 6 percent.\n  Compared to other courts of appeals, the DC Circuit caseload measured \nby number of appeals pending per panel is 54 percent less than the \nnational average. Filings per judge are also significantly lower than \nfor the rest of the courts. While the national average of filings per \nactive judge is 361, the DC Circuit is less than half, at 170 filings \nper active judge. And if you take into consideration the fact that the \nDC Circuit now has six senior judges, all of whom continue to hear \ncases and write opinions, there is a 26-percent decrease in case \nfilings per judge on the court since 2005. So by any meaningful \nmeasure, the DC Circuit's workload pales in comparison to the other \ncircuit courts.\n  Given the concerns I have about Ms. Halligan's record on the second \namendment, the war on terror, and other issues, my concerns regarding \nher activist judicial philosophy, and the court's low workload, I \noppose this nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Finally, I would note a number of organizations have expressed their \nopposition to this nomination. They are the American Conservative \nUnion, 9/11 Families for a Safe & Strong America, the National Rifle \nAssociation, Gun Owners of America, Citizens Committee for the Right to \nKeep and Bear Arms, Committee for Justice, Concerned Women for America, \nthe American Center for Law and Justice, Heritage Action, Liberty \nCounsel Action, Family Research Council, Eagle Forum, Center for \nJudicial Accountability, Republican National Lawyers Association, \nJudicial Action Group, Susan B. Anthony List, Americans United for Life \nAction, and the Faith and Freedom Coalition.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Caitlin Halligan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  Ms. Halligan is an outstanding nominee with sterling credentials and \nbroad support among the legal community. By the accounts of everyone \nwho has worked with her or observed her work, she is a first-rate legal \nmind and a tireless worker, with great personal integrity and a \nthoughtful temperament that is perfectly suited to the Federal bench. \nHer nomination deserves prompt confirmation.\n  Ms. Halligan has spent much of her career as a dedicated and \ndistinguished public servant. She has a strong record in law \nenforcement, including in her current role as general counsel at the \nManhattan District Attorney's Office, an office that investigates and \nprosecutes 100,000 criminal cases annually.\n  She is highly esteemed by the New York and national law enforcement \ncommunities. Her nomination has been endorsed by New York City police \ncommissioner Raymond Kelly, former Manhattan district attorney Robert \nMorgenthau, the National District Attorneys Association, several \nRepublican district attorneys from New York, the New York Association \nof Chiefs of Police, and the New York State Sheriff's Association, \namong many others.\n  Ms. Halligan is also widely recognized as one of the finest appellate \nlitigators in the country. As solicitor general for the State of New \nYork, she supervised 45 appellate lawyers and represented the State of \nNew York, then-Governor George Pataki, a Republican, and other State \nofficials in both State and Federal courts. She has been counsel of \nrecord on nearly 50 cases before the Supreme Court and has argued \nbefore that court 5 times. Twenty-one of the top lawyers from across \nthe political spectrum who have worked with Ms. Halligan, including \nconservatives Miguel Estrada and Carter Phillips, have endorsed her \nnomination. She was rated unanimously ``well qualified'' by the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  President Obama first nominated Ms. Halligan in 2010. Despite Ms. \nHalligan's outstanding qualifications and broad support, our Republican \ncolleagues have refused to grant her an up-or-down vote for over 2 \nyears.\n  Some have argued, because of positions that she took in litigation at \nthe behest of a client, that she does not have adequate respect for the \nsecond amendment. Yet both at her hearing and in response to written \nquestions, she stated unequivocally that she\n\n[[Page S1143]]\n\nwould faithfully follow and apply the Supreme Court's decision in \nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller, which held that the second amendment \nprotects an individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense. \nWhen asked whether the rights conferred under the second amendment are \nfundamental, Ms. Halligan answered, ``That is clearly what the Supreme \nCourt held and I would follow that precedent.'' It doesn't get much \nclearer than that.\n  In 2011 Republicans filibustering her nomination claimed that the \ncaseload of the DC Circuit did not warrant filling that seat because \nthe other judges serving on the court had too few cases. At that time, \nMs. Halligan was nominated to fill the ninth seat out of 11 on the DC \nCircuit.\n  Even at the time, that argument was questionable. Senate Republicans \nconfirmed President Bush's nominees for the 9th, 10th, and 11th seats \non the DC Circuit without concerns about caseload. That court's \ncaseload has only gone up in since then. Also, the DC Circuit's \ncaseload is uniquely challenging, as the former chief judge of the DC \nCircuit, Patricia Wald, has explained:\n\n       The D.C. Circuit hears the most complex, time-consuming, \n     labyrinthine disputes over regulations with the greatest \n     impact on ordinary Americans' lives: clean air and water \n     regulations, nuclear plant safety, health-care reform issues, \n     insider trading and more. These cases can require thousands \n     of hours of preparation by the judges, often consuming days \n     of argument, involving hundreds of parties and interveners, \n     and necessitating dozens of briefs and thousands of pages of \n     record--all of which culminates in lengthy, technically \n     intricate legal opinions.\n\n  Even if we accept the argument that the DC Circuit did not need \nanother judge when Ms. Halligan was nominated for the ninth seat, the \ncircumstances have changed. Because an additional vacancy has opened, \nMs. Halligan is currently nominated for the eighth seat, meaning there \nare now four vacant seats on the court. To put it another way, the \ncourt is now understaffed by over one-third. At the same time, the \nAdministrative Office of U.S. Courts reports that the caseload per \nactive judge has increased by 50 percent since 2005, when the Senate \nconfirmed President Bush's nominee to fill the 11th seat on the DC \nCircuit.\n  Thus, there is no basis for debate now about whether an additional \njudge is needed on the D.C. Circuit. With an extra vacancy and a \ngrowing caseload, the court considered by many to be second only to the \nSupreme Court in its importance in our Federal judiciary desperately \nneeds help.\n  Luckily, we have the opportunity to send the court an outstanding \nlegal talent in Caitlin Halligan. I urge my colleagues to support her \nconfirmation.\n  More broadly, I hope that we can come together and return the Senate \nto its best traditions of holding up-or-down votes on judicial \nnominations. We have an opportunity this Congress to move past this \nobstruction and get back to the proper manner of handling judicial \nnominations. Doing so will bring much needed assistance to the Federal \njudiciary, which has been forced to contend with unmanageable judicial \nvacancy rates. It also will do credit to this institution, which is \nfailing in its duty to confirm Federal judges. We do not deserve the \nmoniker of the ``world's greatest deliberative body'' if we cannot do \nsomething as simple as confirming judicial nominations.\n  There have been some encouraging signs that we are making real \nprogress in this regard. For instance, the rules reforms that we voted \non in a bipartisan manner earlier this year included a provision to \nshorten the postcloture debate window on district court nominees from \n30 hours to a more reasonable 2. This change could dramatically \nstreamline the nominations process without limiting the minority's \nability to filibuster a nominee they do not like. It will expire at the \nend of this Congress, however. I hope that we can come together in \nbipartisan agreement to extend it permanently and perhaps even expand \nit to include circuit court nominees like Ms. Halligan.\n  Even with this change, there is still much to be done. The \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service recently reported that the \nconfirmation percentage for President Obama's nominees is the lowest of \nany President in the last 36 years. The effects are obvious. The \njudicial vacancy crisis in this country is real, and it is growing. As \nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has said, ``a persistent \nproblem has developed in the process of filling judicial vacancies. . . \n. This has created acute difficulties for some judicial districts. \nSitting judges in those districts have been burdened with extraordinary \ncaseloads.'' As he explained, there is ``an urgent need for the \npolitical branches to find a long-term solution to this recurring \nproblem.''\n  So let's return to the principle that barring ``extraordinary \ncircumstances'' a nominee should receive a prompt up-or-down vote on \nthe floor, and let's confirm the nomination of the outstanding nominee \nbefore us today, Caitlin Halligan.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that I must oppose cloture on the \nnomination of Caitlin Halligan to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia. During the 109th Congress, I joined 13 of my \nSenate colleagues to negotiate a compromise as part of an effort to \navoid use of the so-called nuclear option to break an organized \nfilibuster on judicial nominations. A tenet of that agreement was the \nright of ``signatories to exercise their responsibilities under the \nAdvice and Consent Clause of the United States Constitution in good \nfaith.'' Further, the agreement went on to state that ``nominees should \nbe filibustered only under extraordinary circumstances, and each \nsignatory must use his or her own discretion and judgment in \ndetermining whether such circumstances exist.''\n  In keeping with the 2005 agreement, I have decided to oppose the \nPresident's nomination of Caitlin Halligan to the U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia. Ms. Halligan's demonstrated \nrecord of judicial activism on issues ranging from holding firearm \nmanufacturers liable for the crimes of third parties, to arguments \nregarding National Labor Relations Board authorities, to her record on \nthe detention of enemy combatants, indicates to me that her activist \nrecord would only continue if granted the privilege of sitting on the \nU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n  It is for these reasons and others that I believe Ms. Halligan meets \nthe ``extraordinary circumstances'' requirement expressed in the \nagreement. An important constitutional responsibility of the executive \nbranch and the U.S. Senate is to ensure that the Federal bench is able \nto handle its caseload expeditiously. In my view, we should only oppose \ncloture in extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, I believe this \nnominee meets that requirement, and my vote to oppose is consistent \nwith the agreement made in 2005.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Caitlin Halligan to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. As \na 20-year veteran of the Judiciary Committee and the first woman to \nserve on that committee it is my great pleasure to support Ms. \nHalligan's nomination.\n  Ms. Halligan has excelled at every turn in her career. She graduated \ncum laude from Princeton University in 1988. She received her law \ndegree, magna cum laude, from Georgetown, where she was managing editor \nof the Georgetown Law Journal and inducted into the Order of the Coif.\n  She began her legal career with a clerkship with Judge Patricia Wald \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the first woman to \nserve on the D.C. Circuit.\n  She then spent a year in private practice at the Washington, DC firm \nWiley, Rein, and Fielding, after which she clerked for Justice Stephen \nBreyer on the U.S. Supreme Court. After another year in private \npractice, Ms. Halligan entered public service. She went to the Attorney \nGeneral's Office in the State of New York, first as Chief of the \nInternet Bureau.\n  She rose to become First Deputy Solicitor General and ultimately \nSolicitor General of the State of New York, the State's top appellate \nlawyer. During nearly all of Ms. Halligan's time as Solicitor General, \nGeorge Pataki--a Republican--was Governor. Her job was to represent the \nState of New York zealously, and by all accounts she did so with skill \nand dignity.\n  Judith Kaye, the former Chief Judge of New York's highest court, \nwrites on behalf of the court's entire bench that ``it was invariably a \ntreat'' to have Ms. Halligan argue before the court.\n  In fact, the National Association of Attorneys General awarded her \nthe\n\n[[Page S1144]]\n\n``Best Brief Award'' on numerous occasions, including consecutive \nawards in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005.\n  In 2007, she went into private practice to lead the appellate \npractice at the prestigious New York firm Weil, Gotshal, and Manges.\n  She returned to public service in 2010 as the General Counsel of the \nNew York County District Attorney's Office, where she has served for \nthe past 3 years. This office is one of the most distinguished \nprosecutorial offices in the Nation, and it handles more than 100,000 \ncriminal prosecutions each year.\n  Because of her strong background in law enforcement in the State of \nNew York, her nomination enjoys the support of major law enforcement \ngroups, including:\n\n       The National District Attorney's Association;\n       The National Center for Women and Policing;\n       The New York Association of Chiefs of Police;\n       The New York State Sheriff's Association; and\n       New York Women in Law Enforcement.\n\n  She also enjoys the support of many law enforcement officials from \nNew York, including New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, New \nYork County District Attorney Cyrus Vance, and numerous other County \nDistrict Attorneys across the State.\n  Over the course of her distinguished career, she has served as \ncounsel for a party or amicus in the Supreme Court more than 45 times. \nShe has argued in the Supreme Court herself in five cases, most \nrecently in March 2011. She also has argued or participated in dozens \nof other appeals in State and Federal courts.\n  In short, Ms. Halligan is an accomplished woman whose sterling \nqualifications are unassailable. She clearly deserves the ``well \nqualified'' rating from the American Bar Association she has received--\nthe ABA's highest rating.\n  Unfortunately, Ms. Halligan's nomination has been pending for a very \nlong time. She was first nominated to the D.C. Circuit in September \n2010, 29 months ago. The seat to which she has been nominated has been \nvacant since 2005, when Chief Justice Roberts was elevated.\n  Last Congress, my Republican colleagues filibustered her nomination, \nsomething that I found to be without cause or rationale. I am very \nhopeful that, in this Congress, reasonable minds will prevail, and we \nwill invoke cloture and confirm Ms. Halligan.\n  I understand that the National Rifle Association is opposed to Ms. \nHalligan's confirmation. Behind the NRA's opposition is the fact that--\nwhile Halligan was New York's Solicitor General, acting at the \ndirection of her superiors--the State pursued public nuisance \nlitigation against gun manufacturers.\n  Think about that: if this standard prevails, any time a person \nrepresents a State or local government, or the Federal Government, and \nrepresents that government on a controversial issue at the direction of \nits duly-elected leaders, that may jeopardize a later confirmation \nvote.\n  That is not fair. A government lawyer's job is to pursue the \ngovernment's interest vigorously and to do justice, and that is what \nCaitlin Halligan has done. She was appointed by the Attorney General to \nrepresent the State of New York, while the State had a Republican \nGovernor, George Pataki. Her job was to advance New York's interest, \nand she did so with vigor at the direction of her superiors. She should \nnot be penalized for it.\n  Senator Sessions made this point when the Senate was considering the \nnomination of now-Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the D.C. Circuit. Senator \nSessions said that ``[s]uggesting that service in an elective branch of \nGovernment somehow tarnishes a lawyer's reputation would be a terrible \nmessage for this body to send to the legal community and to all \ncitizens.''\n  My colleagues will recall that Judge Kavanaugh had quite an activist \nrecord from our side's perspective: he had worked on the Starr Report, \nwhich recommended grounds of impeachment of President Clinton; he had \nworked for George W. Bush during the Florida recount; he then worked in \nthe White House Counsel's office under President George W. Bush.\n  In short, while Kavanaugh may have been a fine lawyer, he had an \nundoubted Republican political pedigree. Yet I carefully considered his \nbackground, and I voted to invoke cloture on his nomination, as did \nmany of my Democratic colleagues. Now it is time for our Republican \ncolleagues to do the same on this nomination.\n  Last Congress, some of my Republican colleagues argued that the D.C. \nCircuit's caseload does not justify confirming another judge to the \nCourt.\n  The D.C. Circuit has 11 judgeships. Four of them are vacant now--more \nthan a third of the court--and three other judges are currently \neligible to go senior, so the D.C. Circuit could soon have only four of \nits 11 seats filled.\n  When my colleagues raised caseload-based objections to Halligan's \nnomination last Congress, I reminded them that, during the George W. \nBush Administration, they voted to fill the 10th seat on the D.C. \nCircuit twice and the 11th seat once. If confirmed, Halligan would only \nfill the eighth seat.\n  In addition, the D.C. Circuit's caseload per judge has grown \nsubstantially just in the last few years. The total number of cases \nterminated per active judge has grown to 280 up from 184 in 2010. \nThat's more than a 50 percent increase. Similarly, the number of \nappeals at the Court pending per active judge has also spiked. It was \n157 in 2008. Today, it is 203 so it is up by a third.\n  This hurts ordinary Americans. Most of the time, the cases heard by \nthe D.C. Circuit are not partisan or ideological. But they are critical \nto making sure that Federal regulation in almost every area operates \npredictably and rationally.\n  As Former Judge Patricia Wald recently wrote in the Washington Post:\n  The D.C. Circuit hears the most complex, time-consuming, labyrinthine \ndisputes over regulations with the greatest impact on ordinary \nAmericans' lives: clean air and water regulations, nuclear plant \nsafety, health-care reform issues, insider trading and more. These \ncases can require thousands of hours of preparation by the judges, \noften consuming days of argument, involving hundreds of parties and \ninterveners, and necessitating dozens of briefs and thousands of pages \nof record--all of which culminates in lengthy, technically intricate \nlegal opinions.\n  Moreover, President Obama has been the only President in nearly four \ndecades not to have a confirmed appointment to the D.C. Circuit. \nPresident Ford was the last such President, but there were no vacancies \nduring his Administration, and every other President since Warren \nHarding, over 90 years ago, had an appointment to this court. I fear my \nRepublican colleagues are treating President Obama differently from \nother Presidents in this regard.\n  I will conclude by simply saying that Ms. Halligan is a woman with \nsterling credentials, an exemplary record, and a wealth of experience. \nShe has been nominated to a vital court that badly needs her service. I \nbelieve she should be confirmed, and I urge my colleagues to vote for \ncloture and for confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 \nminutes of debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand the Senator from New York \nwill speak following my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate has an opportunity to act \nin a bipartisan manner to end a filibuster against an outstanding \nnominee to the D.C. Circuit. Caitlin Halligan is an exceptional \nattorney with the kind of impeccable credentials in both public service \nand private practice that make her unquestionably qualified to serve on \nthe D.C. Circuit. No one can seriously question her legal ability, her \njudgment, her character, her integrity, her ethics or her temperament. \nThose who seek to misrepresent her as a partisan or ideological \ncrusader are wrong and unfair.\n  Some have mischaracterized her record and distorted her views on \nexecutive authority and terrorism. Here is what she said about the 2004 \nNew York\n\n[[Page S1145]]\n\nCity Bar report that some are using to inflame the debate:\n\n       I was, frankly, taken aback by [this Report], for a couple \n     of reasons. First of all, the Supreme Court has clearly said \n     that indefinite detention is authorized by the AUMF statute. \n     And so the notion that the President lacks that authority, I \n     think, is clearly incorrect. I was also a little bit taken \n     aback by the tone of the report. I think that the issues of \n     indefinite detention and any issues in the national security \n     realm are very serious ones, and I think that approaching \n     those issues as respectfully as possible is the most \n     productive way to proceed. But the bottom line is that the \n     report does not represent my work. It does not reflect my \n     views.\n\n  I hope Senators who intend to make this a basis for filibustering \nthis outstanding nominee are listening and understand. Again, she \ntestified: ``[T]he bottom line is that the report does not represent my \nwork. It does not reflect my views.'' This is no basis for opposing the \nnominee, let alone filibustering her consideration. The report does not \nrepresent her views; she flat out rejected them as a statement of law.\n  During her hearing she testified that she only became aware of the \n2004 New York Bar report in 2010 while preparing for her confirmation \nhearing. She even provided minutes from the City Bar Committee's \nmeetings to show that she was not present and not part of the \nsubcommittee that drafted the report. She rejected the views in the \nreport, saying that it was ``clearly incorrect.'' So while she was one \nof 37 members of a larger Committee, she was not a member of the \nsubcommittee that drafted the report. She did not participate in the \ndrafting. To filibuster her nomination because of a report she did not \nwrite, has not endorsed and has, in fact, rejected, would be a great \ninjustice to this outstanding woman.\n  New York City's Police Commissioner Ray Kelly wrote in strong support \nof Caitlin Halligan again this week, saying:\n\n       I want to reiterate [my] support, and to stress my \n     confidence in her commitment to the vigorous prosecution of \n     our ongoing fight against the threat of terrorism here in New \n     York City.\n       Any suggestion that Ms. Halligan would thwart efforts to \n     protect our nation, and our city, against terrorist threats \n     is absurd. For over three years, Ms. Halligan has served as \n     Counsel to the New York County District Attorney. During that \n     time, she has worked extensively on key anti-terrorism cases, \n     including most recently the successful prosecution of Ahmed \n     Ferhani, who pled guilty to very serious charges under New \n     York State's anti-terrorism statute for a 2011 plot to blow \n     up Manhattan synagogues and churches.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full letter be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my statement. This is not someone soft on \nterrorism. She has helped bring terrorists to justice. Police \nCommissioner Kelly is not endorsing someone soft on terrorism. Cyrus \nVance, Jr., the New York County District Attorney, is not endorsing \nsomeone soft on terrorism.\n  This is a woman and mother who lives in downtown New York. She was \nliterally blocks away from the twin towers on September 11, 2001. She \nsaw and experienced the devastation of the 9/11 terrorist attack on New \nYork.\n  By any traditional standard, Caitlin Halligan is the kind of superbly \nqualified nominee who should be considered and confirmed by the Senate. \nThe Republican leadership's filibuster of this nomination threatens to \nset a new standard that could not be met by anyone. That is wrong, it \nis unjustified, and it is dangerous.\n  It takes only a handful of sensible Senate Republicans to do the \nright thing. This is not a time to victimize Caitlin Halligan for some \nsort of political payback or to appeal to narrow special interests. I \nask those Republican Senators who care about the judiciary and fairness \nto come forward, end this filibuster, and ratchet down the partisanship \nthat threatens this institution, our courts and the country.\n  A Republican Senator, who was a member of the ``Gang of 14'' in 2005, \ndescribed his view of what comprises the ``extraordinary \ncircumstances'' justifying a filibuster. He said: ``Ideological attacks \nare not an extraordinary circumstance.' To me, it would have to be a \ncharacter problem, an ethics problem, so allegations about the \nqualifications of a person, not an ideological bent.'' Caitlin Halligan \nhas no ``character problem,'' no ``ethics problem,'' and there is no \njustification for this filibuster. I trust that Senator will apply the \nstandard he articulated and vote to end this filibuster.\n  Another Republican Senator said just last year in voting to end a \nfilibuster against another circuit court nominee:\n\n       [W]hen I became a Senator, Democrats were blocking an up-\n     or-down vote on President Bush's judicial nominees. I said \n     then that I would not do that and did not like doing that. I \n     have held to that in almost every case since then. I believe \n     nominees for circuit judges, in all but extraordinary cases, \n     and district judges in every case ought to have an up-or-down \n     vote by the Senate.\n       If that Senator remains true to his principles, he will \n     vote to end this filibuster.\n\n  Republican Senators who signed that 2005 memorandum of understanding \ncontinue to serve here in the Senate. If they follow the standard set \nin that agreement, they will vote to end this filibuster. They \ndemonstrated what they thought that agreement entailed when they \nproceeded to invoke cloture on a number of controversial nominations of \nPresident Bush to the D.C. Circuit. If that agreement and standard had \nany meaning, they should all be voting to end this filibuster.\n  I urge all those who have said that filibusters of judicial \nnominations are unconstitutional to end this filibuster. I urge those \nwho said they would never support a filibuster of a judicial nomination \nto end this filibuster. I urge those who said that they would only \nfilibuster in ``extraordinary circumstances'' to end this filibuster. I \nurge all those who care about the judiciary, the administration of \njustice, the Senate and the American people to come forward and end \nthis filibuster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             City of New York,\n\n                                      New York, NY, March 5, 2013.\n     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kirsten Gillibrand,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand: In May 2011, I \n     wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee in strong support of \n     Caitlin Halligan's nomination to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. I want to \n     reiterate that support, and to stress my confidence in her \n     commitment to the vigorous prosecution of our ongoing fight \n     against the threat of terrorism here in New York City.\n       Any suggestion that Ms. Halligan would thwart efforts to \n     protect our nation, and our city, against terrorist threats \n     is absurd. For over three years, Ms. Halligan has served as \n     Counsel to the New York County District Attorney. During that \n     time, she has worked extensively on key anti-terrorism cases, \n     including most recently the successful prosecution of Ahmed \n     Ferhani, who pled guilty to very serious charges under New \n     York State's anti-terrorism statute for a 2011 plot to blow \n     up Manhattan synagogues and churches.\n       As I informed the Senate in 2011, I strongly recommend Ms. \n     Halligan for the position to which she has been nominated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Raymond W. Kelly,\n                                              Police Commissioner.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, so many good things about Caitlin \nHalligan have already been said. She is a woman of great intellect, has \na history of laudable achievements, a record of outstanding public \nservice, and she deserves the full support of the Senate today.\n  Caitlin has had an exceptional career as an attorney, and I am \nconfident she will make an excellent judge. She is currently the \ngeneral counsel at the New York City District Attorney's Office, an \noffice that investigates and prosecutes 100,000 criminal cases annually \nin Manhattan.\n  She served as our Solicitor General. She was awarded ``Best United \nStates Supreme Court Brief'' while she served there.\n  She has overwhelming support from law enforcement, from the New York \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the New York State Sheriffs \nAssociation, the National District Attorneys Association, the New York \nWomen in Law Enforcement, along with the support of community leaders, \nsuch as the Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia, the \nNational Conference of Women's Bar Associations, and the U.S. Women's \nChamber of Commerce.\n  The bottom line is, she is a well-qualified judge who would do great \nservice for the United States. Even New York City police commissioner \nRay Kelly said Caitlin has the ``three\n\n[[Page S1146]]\n\nqualities important for a judicial nominee: intelligence, a judicial \ntemperament, and personal integrity.'' She has a strong record.\n  As to the debate we have heard on national security, Caitlin lives in \nthe heart of New York City. She saw the Twin Towers fall. In the years \nthat followed, she worked as pro bono counsel to the board of directors \nof the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation that oversees the \nrebuilding of Lower Manhattan--helping our city to grow stronger every \nsingle day.\n  Lastly, today, women make up roughly 30 percent of the Federal bench. \nFor the first time in history, that holds true in trial courts, courts \nof appeals, and the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court.\n  It is true we have come a long way, but we still have a long way to \ngo on this journey for full equality. I think she is a superbly \nqualified nominee, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of her.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to \na close debate on the nomination of Caitlin Joan Halligan, of New York, \nto be United States Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n         Harry Reid, Patrick J.

Had I voted, I would have voted nay.\n  Ms. Halligan has consistently espoused extremist positions on well-\nsettled areas of the law including second amendment rights, abortion, \nand terrorist detention. I believe that Ms. Halligan's demonstrated \npropensity for judicial activism disqualifies her for the Federal bench \nwhere a judge must impartially apply the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1146-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

I am pleased to have Senator Boozman as \nthe lead Republican of an effort to ensure these men have the \nrecognition they deserve. Together, we introduced S. 381, which will \naward the surviving airmen, known as the Doolittle Raiders, with the \nCongressional Gold Medal. Senator Boozman's collaboration reiterates \nthat bipartisan support for our veterans endures in this body. Joining \nus as original cosponsors are Senators Murray, Tester, Baucus, Nelson, \nCantwell, and Schatz.\n  As chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee during the last \nsession, Senator Murray also cosponsored last year's resolution. We are \ngrateful for her leadership. Our colleague Senator Lautenberg, the sole \nWorld War II veteran serving in the Senate, is also a cosponsor.\n  Some 16 million Americans served this country during World War II. \nToday their average age is 92. These survivors have earned the respect \nof a grateful Nation. Now is the time for us to act to honor them.\n  On April 18, 1942, 80 American airmen volunteered for an unknown \nassignment. These sons, fathers, and brothers accepted what they only \nknew to be ``an extremely hazardous mission.'' They were led by Lt. \nCol. James ``Jimmy'' Doolittle, a one-time flight instructor at Wright \nField in Dayton, OH, in my home State. He also studied at Kelly Field \nand McCook Field in Ohio.\n  The Doolittle Raid was the first time the Army Air Corps and the Navy \ncollaborated on a tactical mission. These pilots flew 16 U.S. Army Air \nCorps B-25 Mitchell bombers from the deck of the USS Hornet into \ncombat, a feat that had never been before attempted.\n  On the morning of the raid, the USS Hornet was discovered by Japanese \npicket ships. Fearing the mission\n\n[[Page S1147]]\n\nmight be compromised, the Raiders launched 170 miles earlier than \nplanned. The earlier launch meant these men now had to travel over 650 \nmiles to their intended targets, leaving them with the possibility of \nrunning out of enough fuel to land beyond the Japanese lines in \noccupied China.\n  Accepting this choice meant the Raiders would almost certainly have \nto crash land or bail out either above Japanese-occupied China or over \nthe home islands of Japan. Any survivor would certainly be subjected to \nimprisonment, torture or death.\n  After reaching their targets, 15 of the bombers continued to China, \nwhile the 16th--whose plane was dangerously low on fuel--headed to \nRussia.\n  The total distance traveled by the Raiders was about 2,250 nautical \nmiles over a period of 13 hours, making it the longest combat mission \never flown in a B-25 during the war.\n  Of the 80 Raiders who launched that day, 8 were captured--3 of them \nwere executed, 1 died of disease, and 4 of these prisoners survived and \nreturned home after the war. Of the original 80, 4 are still with us \ntoday. They are residents of Montana, Texas, Tennessee, and Washington \nState.\n  There was a fifth, MAJ Tom Griffin of Cincinnati, OH. On the evening \nof February 26, just 1 week ago--the date I introduced this \nlegislation--Major Griffin of Cincinnati passed away surrounded by \nfamily and friends. His family lost a loved one, our Nation lost a \nhero.\n  The remaining four Raiders will be commemorating the 71st anniversary \nof this raid this coming April in Fort Walton Beach, FL. Now is the \ntime to award these survivors the Congressional Medal. Their valor, \ntheir skill, their courage proved invaluable to the morale of our \ncountry on that day more than 70 years ago and the eventual defeat of \nJapan in the Second World War. These men continue to remind us of the \nquiet determination and that uncommon valor in the face of sheer \ndanger.\n  I humbly ask my colleagues to join us in this bill in honoring the \nDoolittle Raiders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1147-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1147-S1149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, since being elected, President Obama has \nbeen talking about the virtues of our Nation's potential to achieve \ndomestic energy independence. In his State of the Union Message just a \nshort time ago he said: ``After years of talking about it, we are \nfinally poised to control our own energy future.''\n  This is something I have been saying now for years. We already have \ncontrol over our energy future. The problem is we have an \nadministration that has not allowed us to exploit our own capabilities \nin terms of developing the natural resources we have. In fact, we are \nthe only country in the world that doesn't develop its own resources.\n  In fact, in each of the President's budgets he has proposed to kill \ncertain tax provisions specific to the oil and gas industry. Even \nthough he says these are subsidies for the oil and gas industry, that \nis not the case.\n  I would like to mention these because no one ever talks about the \nfact that he has specific provisions in his own budget. I will mention \njust three of them.\n  Intangible drilling costs--called IDCs. This is a provision that \nsimply allows producers to deduct from their revenue the cost of \ndrilling. You pay taxes on net revenue. So this is net of the expenses \nit takes to develop the revenue. Every business is allowed to deduct \nordinary and necessary business expenses, and IDCs are exactly that for \nthe oil and gas industry.\n  In other words, the cost of drilling should be deducted because a lot \nof times they drill and don't produce anything. So this is something \neveryone else has and we should be having also in the oil industry. If \nthe President gets rid of these, the tax increase would be $13.9 \nbillion over the 10-year period we have been talking about. This is \ninteresting because that is not a tax that would be paid by them. It \nwould go into the increased cost of energy. But we stopped that. We \nstopped that provision from becoming a reality, even though it was in \nthe President's budget.\n  The second is called percentage depletion. Percentage depletion is \nsimply a way the Tax Code has allowed oil and gas producers to account \nfor the reduction in the value of their reserves. Let's say they are \nfortunate and they produced oil that is going to be income that will go \nto them. As that is depleted, the value of that has been depleted also.\n  Percentage depletion has been on the books as long as we have had the \nindustry. If the President were successful in doing away with the \npercentage depletion, that would mean about an $11.5 billion tax \nincrease on the energy we use in this country.\n  The last one I will mention--and there are actually two more--is \ncalled section 199. Section 199 is the manufacturer's tax deduction. It \nallows all manufacturers, including farmers, filmmakers, and the rest \nof them to take a small deduction in their taxes because they create \nproducts here in America. The President has always proposed canceling \nthis out but only for the oil and gas industry and not for anybody \nelse. Everybody else would have that same advantage.\n  Again, if the President were successful in doing this, it would \nincrease the cost of energy by $11.6 billion over that 10-year period. \nThe President's proposal to increase these taxes would prevent the \nindustry from reaching its true potential, despite the fact of what we \nhave out there and what we could do and how we could get it done today \nreal quickly.\n  A recent CRS--Congressional Research Service--report stated that the \nUnited States has the largest combined resources in oil, natural gas, \nand coal of any country in the world. We have more than Saudi Arabia, \nChina, and Canada combined. Yet we are the only Nation, as I said, in \nthe world that doesn't allow ourselves to exploit our own resources.\n  Fortunately, oil and gas activities have increased over the past \nyears. As much as the President may want to claim credit for this, he \nhas no standing to do so because, as I mentioned, the tax provisions he \nhas proposed in his budget have been very negative toward oil and gas. \nLast year we hit a 15-year high in oil production, producing an average \nof 6.4 million barrels a day, which was 800,000 barrels per day more \nthan in 2011.\n  This increase is staggering and it is the result of the amazing \nadvancements in oil and gas production technologies--things such as \nhorizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. These are things that \nhave helped us get the oil and gas out of tight formations.\n  Nearly all of this increase has occurred on State and private lands. \nCRS confirmed 1 year ago that ``about 96 percent of the increase [in \noil and gas production] since 2007 took place on non-Federal lands.'' \nThat is critical, because as I have said twice already, we are the only \ncountry that doesn't develop its own resources. This means that is \nbeyond the reach of the President's hands. In other words, he can't \nstop the private land production but he can the public land.\n\n  Adding to that--and this was just released yesterday, which is why I \nwanted to make this point today--the oil production on all Federal \nlands, including onshore and offshore, declined last year for the \nsecond year in a row, falling from 632 million barrels in 2011 to right \nat 600 million barrels in 2012. So the 800,000 barrels-per-day increase \nwe saw last year took place solely on private lands, none of it on \npublic lands.\n  During this boom time we are having right now, on that which the \nPresident has control over--the Federal lands--we have actually had a \nreduction. This makes sense, given what we know about oil and gas \npermitting on Federal lands. It still take 300 days to get a permit to \ndrill.\n  This is something you can't talk about too much because they would \nalways say: In a certain case, you need to do it faster. In my State of \nOklahoma, you can get it done in hours. In North Dakota, you can get \npermitting done in an average of about 10 days. But no, it is 300 days \non Federal lands.\n  I have a friend named Harold Hamm. He is arguably the most successful \nindependent producer in America today. He is from Enid, OK. He does \nmost of his production in North Dakota right now. I saw just a moment\n\n[[Page S1148]]\n\nago the Senator from North Dakota, and he can be very proud of the fact \nthat in North Dakota Harold Hamm has one huge problem: He can't find \npeople to work. They have full employment up there. This is what the \npotential is for this entire country.\n  This chart shows all the potential, and I call to the Chair's \nattention this Northeastern part of the United States--Pennsylvania and \nNew York. It didn't use to be the case that they had all that \npotential, but they do now, and it is spread evenly throughout the \ncountry with all the great new discoveries that are out there.\n  Anyway, one of the arguments the President has had when I have said \nover and over again for the last 4 years that we need to open our \npublic lands for drilling, and if we were able to do that, good things \nwould happen in terms of the market, the price of gas at the pump, is \nthat if we do that--if we allow the drilling for gas and oil on public \nlands--it would be 10 years before we would feel that at the pump--10 \nyears.\n  So I called Harold Hamm. He is a guy who I think everyone would agree \ncould be considered the most knowledgeable person in this area, about 6 \nmonths ago I called him and said to him: I am going to be on a national \nTV show--I should tell you what it is, but I will not--and the \nPresident has been saying it will take 10 years before that oil will \nreach the pumps and so I would like to ask you a question. I said: When \nyou answer, I am going to use your name live on national TV tonight, so \nmake sure you are accurate. So I asked him: If you had a rig set up in \nNew Mexico and you were able to lift the restrictions we have on public \nlands, how long would it take that oil and gas to hit the market? He \nsaid, without hesitating, 70 days. I said: Be sure you are right. I am \ngoing to use your name, and he proceeded to tell me what would happen \neach day for the first barrel of oil to actually reach the pumps and \nhave an effect.\n  Anyway, no one has argued with that yet because it is pretty well \ndocumented. So by the time you have one Federal drilling permit \ncompleted, Harold Hamm could have four separate wells up and running, \nproviding more jobs and cheaper gasoline for all Americans.\n  Fortunately, the President does not control the permitting process on \nState and private lands, and because of this the industry has had the \nopportunity to unlock tremendous natural gas resources. Not 5 years \nago, many believed the United States faced a significant shortage of \nnatural gas. Wellhead prices at that time were trading as high as $11 \nper thousand cubic feet--$11 per thousand cubic feet--and investors \nwere racing to build liquefied natural gas import facilities. We were \ngoing to import liquefied natural gas. As you know, natural gas has to \nbe liquefied to have some bulk before you are able to trade it \ninternationally. Anyway, they were racing to try to get this done so we \nwould be able to import from foreign countries to meet U.S. demand with \nforeign supplies.\n  The shale gas revolution changed all this. Our expected natural gas \nreserves are well over 2 quadrillion cubic feet, which is enough gas to \nsupply our domestic needs in the United States for 90 years. That is \nright here in this country. Many industry observers believe this \nestimate is discounted to the Nation's true potential. This dramatic \nshift in natural gas markets has pushed prices down to below $4 per \nthousand cubic feet, putting the United States in a unique position to \nbolster both wealth creation and our foreign policy might by beginning \nnatural gas exports. So we would be going from importing liquefied \nnatural gas to exporting natural gas.\n  Right now there are currently 15 permits to export LNG pending before \nSecretary Chu at the Department of Energy. The Natural Gas Act requires \nthe Department to ``issue such [a permit] upon application, unless . . \n. it will not be consistent with the public interest.''\n  What could be inconsistent with this for the public interest? This \nwould be cheaper gas for us and give us total independence in a matter \nof weeks.\n  Congress, when it wrote the Natural Gas Act, understood that the \nexport of American products is good for the Nation. It supports \ndomestic industry, creates jobs, and transfers wealth from overseas \nback to the United States. It is all good for us.\n  A recent report commissioned by DOE to assist it in making its \ndetermination agreed with this. They stated:\n\n       . . . across the scenarios [examined by the study], the \n     U.S. economic welfare consistently increases as the volume of \n     natural gas exports increases.\n\n  So that is the opportunity that is out there.\n  Some in this body have raised concerns about allowing liquefied \nnatural gas exports to move forward. They are concerned mainly that \nproduction would not be able to keep up with the rising consumption and \nexports and that the follow-on effects will be harmful to domestic \nindustries. I can appreciate where these Members are coming from, but I \nwant to point out something that many may be overlooking.\n  The Energy Information Agency, the EIA, releases an annual outlook \nfor U.S. energy markets. In their most recent one, which came out just \na few weeks ago, they estimated that between now and 2040, production \nof natural gas would increase by 40 percent, which will more than \noffset the expected 20 percent increase in consumption. So our \nconsumption is going to increase. People say: How can we ever become \nindependent. Our production will increase at twice the consumption \nlevel.\n  Today, natural gas is trading near an all-time low, and because of \nthis many producers have completely abandoned new natural gas \nproduction projects. In 2008, when natural gas was trading at nearly \n$11 per thousand cubic feet, there were over 1,600 active drilling \nrigs. Today, that figure is down to 428. That is a 73-percent \nreduction. The rigs are still out there. They are still set up. They \nare just not operating. Overnight, you can have them operating again.\n  The industry is not moving forward with projects because it does not \nhave the demand and certainty it needs to do so. Without demand \ncertainty, it is impossible to accurately forecast whether the massive \ninvestments required to develop a project can be recouped. This stalls \nboth job and wealth creation, keeping our unemployment rates and \ndeficits higher than they should be.\n  Today the natural gas market is in a demand-limited scenario, and it \nwill remain there for the foreseeable future. Supply is truly so \nabundant and readily available that as soon as more demand comes online \nproducers are able to tap reserves and meet the market's needs.\n  The consulting firm Deloitte agrees. In its report, it stated \n``producers can develop more reserves in anticipation of demand \ngrowth.'' They added that future LNG exports will have limited \ndisruptions to natural gas markets because they ``will likely be backed \nby long-term supply contracts, as well as long-term contracts with \nbuyers. There will be ample notice and time in advance of the exports \nto make supplies available.''\n  This should be of great encouragement to domestic energy consumers. \nIn fact, the NERA Consulting Report concluded that across the board, \nindustries would not be hurt by LNG exports, stating that ``no sector \nanalyzed . . . would experience reductions in employment more rapid \nthan normal turnover.''\n  The petrochemical industry is one that has been vocal in opposition \nto LNG exports, but the leftwing think tank, the Brookings Institute, \nstated in its LNG report that ``exports can be seen as providing a \nbenefit to the petrochemical industry'' because it is primarily a user \nof natural gas liquids and not the dry liquids used to make LNG.\n  I can appreciate the fact that many people are worried about the cost \nof energy going up in this country. I am too. But those who are \nconcerned that exports will be the cause of this have misplaced \nconcerns. Rather, they should be focusing their attention on the \ncumulative effect of adverse government policies negatively affecting \nenergy sources. Government regulations, largely those coming out of the \nEPA, are perhaps the greatest threat to this Nation achieving domestic \nenergy independence. We have gone from 1,600 rigs out there that were \noperating down to 428 rigs.\n  Further, when considering the potential benefits of LNG exports, we \ncan't dismiss the impact trade has had on\n\n[[Page S1149]]\n\nother sectors of our economy. Agriculture is a prime example. The \nFederal Government works diligently to open and maintain international \nmarket access for U.S. agricultural producers. This was highlighted \nvery recently by the announcement that Japan would ease its \nrestrictions on U.S beef imports. Certainly, this is meaningful to my \nState and the States of others who are in this Chamber right now. This \nhas been a major goal of the current and previous administrations for \nyears, and Japan's decision was hailed by the administration and many \nMembers of Congress on both sides of the aisle. Everyone knows it is a \ngreat deal because when you sell products abroad, you both generate \nwealth at home and expand the size of the market, thereby increasing \nopportunities for expansion.\n  The Federal Government should adopt the same perspective with LNG \nexports. LNG exports will create jobs across the country, bring more \nwealth to our Nation from abroad, and grow our economy--all at the same \ntime. Meanwhile, we will be providing needed fuel for our allies--\nJapan, Korea, NATO, and Thailand--who will consequently be able to \nreduce their reliance on the Middle East.\n  So it is something that is good for everybody. It is good for our \ncountry; it is good for our economy. And all you have to do is, if you \nwant to see that, look up to North Dakota. As I mentioned, a great \nindependent producer, Harold Hamm from Oklahoma, is up there right now, \nand his biggest problem is they are fully employed.\n  We have a similar situation in my State of Oklahoma. We have expanded \nour production to the point where we are not feeling some of the grief \nyou hear in the discussions from the other people on this floor. So I \nwould encourage us to look at this export to keep this market, to get \nthose other 1,600 wells working. This is something that can certainly \nhappen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1149-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS\n\n  I notice my time is expiring, but I want to mention something that \ncame out in the State of the Union Message. I hope I will have a chance \nto do this later on today.\n  When the President was talking about greenhouse gas, as he has been \ntalking about for a long time, he made several comments. I think this \nwas talked about more in the State of the Union Message than anything \nelse he talked about.\n\n       Yes, it's true that no single event makes a trend. But the \n     fact is that the 12 hottest years on record have all come in \n     the last 15.\n\n  That is just flat wrong. Even NASA's James Hansen, who officially has \nbeen the leader on the other side of this issue, admits that global \ntemperature standstill is real, and mean global temperatures have been \nflat for the last decade. Later on I am going to go over one by one the \nstatements he has made. I would only suggest that this is something we \nneed to keep in mind.\n  In 1895, we went into this hysteria at that time because there was a \ncold snap: We are all going to freeze to death. Another ice age is \ncoming. We are all going to die.\n  In 1920, it was the same thing except it was a heat spell. This, \nobviously, wasn't true at that time, but everyone was getting \nhysterical. These 20-year cycles keep coming and going. You can set \nyour watch by them. Except in 1945, it was another cold spell that \nlasted until 1975. The interesting thing about this is that 1945 was \nthe year that had the largest release of CO2 of any time in \nthe history of this country, and that precipitated not a warming trend \nbut another cold trend. The warming trend, of course, came in 1975.\n  Anyway, these are cycles. God is still up there. We are going to have \nthese cycles take place. Later on today, hopefully, I want to take each \nstatement that the President has made and show that those statements \nweren't right.\n  One thing that is true--one thing that no one disagrees with--is that \nthe cost of having some type of a cap-and-trade system that the \nPresident wants would be between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. \nBy the admission of the past Director of the EPA, Lisa Jackson--when I \nasked the question: If we were to incur all these taxes, would \nsomething we do in the United States affect the release of \nCO2 worldwide, She said: No. Because the problem isn't here. \nThe problem is in China. The problem is in India and other places.\n  So, again, for those who believe that CO2 is causing \nglobal warming or other climate disasters, keep in mind, even the EPA \nDirector appointed by President Obama agrees that would not reduce any \nCO2 worldwide.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy remarks, the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul, be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1149-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1149-S1150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE SEQUESTER\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am not sure where the Obama \nadministration is getting all of its talking points on the sequester, \nbut the President might want to consider hiring a fact checker.\n  Even before the sequester took effect, Education Secretary Arne \nDuncan declared that schoolteachers were getting pink slips. A few days \nlater he had to walk those comments back. He said he was referring to a \nsingle school in West Virginia. But when the Washington Post contacted \nthe superintendent of that school, he said not one teacher had gotten a \npink slip because of the sequester.\n  Then President Obama suggested that all of the people who keep the \nCapitol clean would be suffering a pay cut. But that wasn't true \neither, according to Capitol Superintendent Carlos Elias.\n  We have been repeatedly told that the sequester would trigger drastic \nlayoffs of Federal workers. Yet on Monday alone the Federal Government \nposted literally hundreds of job advertisements.\n  Finally, just yesterday, when asked to provide evidence for the claim \nthat 70,000 children would be denied access to Head Start because of \nthe sequester, the White House had no details. While the President has \nbeen out there playing Chicken Little, Members of Congress have been \nwaiting for the White House to send over its budget.\n  The law requires the President to transmit a budget by February 4, \nand we have been now advised his budget will not be forthcoming until \nMarch 25. Ironically, that will actually be after the House and the \nSenate have taken up our own budget, and we will have no input from the \nPresident on his proposal.\n  A few weeks ago I said a second term offers the President a second \nchance. I still remain hopeful that President Obama will eventually be \npersuaded to adopt a serious approach for long-term deficit reduction \nand long-term economic growth.\n  One of the great tragedies in America today is the fact that our \neconomy is growing so slowly that unemployment rates remain \nunacceptably high--roughly around 8 percent. That is only after many \npeople have simply given up looking for work. Now more than 20 million \npeople are either out of work or they are working part time when they \nwould prefer to work full time. But that is not going to happen until \nwe get the economy growing again--and that is not going to happen until \nwe get our hands around our long-term deficit and economic growth.\n  I realize the President and Democrats want to take the House of \nRepresentatives back in 2014. The President probably remembers the \nHalcyon days of 2009 and 2010 when his party controlled the White \nHouse, the Senate, and the House. That got us ObamaCare, a $1 trillion \nstimulus, and a whole lot more debt, and the Dodd-Frank law--which was \ntargeted at Wall Street but which hit Main Street, including a lot of \nour community bankers.\n  There is a time for campaigning and there is a time for governing. \nBut the 2012 election occurred 17 weeks ago and the 2014 election will \nnot occur for another 20 months. Now is the time for governing, not for \ndelivering more partisan stump speeches. In order to govern, the Senate \nneeds to pass a budget, something this Chamber has not done for more \nthan 1,400 days. Over that same period our gross national debt has \ngrown by $5.5 trillion and we have experienced the weakest economic \nrecovery since the Great Depression.\n\n[[Page S1150]]\n\nSince the official end of the recession in June of 2009, the median \nhousehold income in America has fallen by more than $2,400. Meanwhile, \nsince the President took office the cost of family health insurance has \nincreased by $2,300. So not only has household income for most \nAmericans--the median household income, that is--dropped by $2,400, \nthey are seeing an additional burden of $2,300 because of ObamaCare.\n\n  The bottom line is the American people are tired of the ``Chicken \nLittle'' stories and they are tired of the fear mongering. They look at \nwhat is happening in Washington--I know my constituents in Texas do--\nand they almost want to turn their eyes in another direction to avert \ntheir gaze because they understand that Washington is not serving their \ninterests. If President Obama wants real change, it is time for him to \nget behind real tax reform and real reform of Social Security and \nMedicare, something his own bipartisan fiscal commission--Simpson-\nBowles--recommended.\n  After all, the American people did not send us here to kick and \nscream over a 2.4-percent budget cut. They sent us here to make some \nhard decisions to ensure long-term economic health and economic \nprosperity and it is time for the President as the leader of our \ncountry and the leader of the free world to take that message to heart.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin).

I will speak as long as it takes until the alarm is sounded from \ncoast to coast that our Constitution is important, that your rights to \ntrial by jury are precious, that no American should be killed by a \ndrone on American soil without first being charged with a crime, \nwithout first being found to be guilty by a court. That Americans could \nbe killed in a cafe in San Francisco or in a restaurant in Houston or \nat their home in Bowling Green, KY, is an abomination. It is something \nthat should not and cannot be tolerated in our country.\n  I do not rise to oppose John Brennan's nomination simply for the \nperson. I rise today for the principle. The principle is one that, as \nAmericans, we have fought too long and hard for to give up on, to give \nup on the Bill of Rights, to give up on the fifth amendment protection \nthat says no person shall be held without due process, that no person \nshall be held for a capital offense without being indicted.

Alice said loudly. ``The idea of \n     having the sentence first.''\n       ``Hold your tongue!'' said the Queen, turning purple.\n       ``I won't!'' said Alice.\n       [``Release the drones,''] said the Queen, as she shouted at \n     the top of her voice.\n\n  Lewis Carroll is fiction, right? When I asked the President: Can you \nkill an American on American soil, it should have been an easy answer. \nIt is an easy question. It should have been a resounding and \nunequivocal no. The President's response: He hasn't killed anyone yet.\n  We are supposed to be comforted by that. The President says: I \nhaven't killed anyone yet. . . . He goes on to say: and I have no \nintention of killing Americans, but I might.\n  Is that enough? Are we satisfied by that? Are we so complacent with \nour rights that we would allow a President to say he might kill \nAmericans, but he will judge the circumstances, he will be the sole \narbiter, he will be the sole decider, he will be the executioner in \nchief if he sees fit?\n  Some will say he would never do this. Many people give the President \nconsideration. They say he is a good man. I am not arguing he is not. \nWhat I am arguing is that the law is there, set in place for the day \nwhen angels don't rule government. Madison said that the restraint on \ngovernment was because government will not always be run by angels. \nThis has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with whether the President \nis a Democrat or a Republican. Were this a Republican President, I \nwould be here saying exactly the same thing: No one person, no one \npolitician should be allowed to judge the guilt--to charge an \nindividual, to judge the guilt of an individual, and to execute an \nindividual. It goes against everything we fundamentally believe in our \ncountry. This is not even new to our country. There is 800 years of \nEnglish law that we founded our tradition on. We founded it upon the \nMagna Carta from 1215. We founded it upon Morgan of Glamorgan from 725 \nA.D. We founded it upon the Greeks and Romans who had juries. It is not \nenough to charge someone to say that they are guilty.\n  Some might come to this floor and they might say: What if we are \nbeing attacked on 9/11? What if there are planes flying at the Twin \nTowers? Obviously we repel them. We repel any attack on our country. If \nthere is a gentleman or a woman with a grenade launcher attacking our \nbuildings or our Capitol, we use lethal force. You don't get due \nprocess if you are involved with actively attacking us, our soldiers, \nor our government. You don't get due process if you are overseas in a \nbattle, shooting at our soldiers. But that is not what we are talking \nabout.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported and said that the bulk of the drone \nattacks is signature attacks. They do not even know the name of the \nperson. A line or a caravan is going from a place where we think there \nare bad people to a place where we think they might commit harm and we \nkill the caravan, not a person. Is that the standard we will now use in \nAmerica? Will we use a standard for killing Americans to be that we \nthought you were bad, we thought you were coming from a meeting with \nbad people and you were in a line of traffic and so therefore you were \nfine for the killing?\n  That is the standard we are using overseas. Is that the standard we \nare going to use here? I will speak today until the President responds \nand says: No, we won't kill Americans in cafes. No, we won't kill you \nat home in your bed at night. No, we won't drop bombs on restaurants.\n\n  Is that so hard? It is amazing that the President will not respond. I \nhave been asking this question for a month. It is like pulling teeth to \nget the President to respond to anything and I get no answer. The \nPresident says he hasn't done it yet and I am to be comforted. You are \nto be comforted in your home. You are to be comforted in your \nrestaurant. You are to be comforted in online communicating in your e-\nmail that the President has not killed an American yet in the homeland. \nHe says he has not done it yet. He says he has no intention to do so.\n  Hayek said that nothing more distinguishes arbitrary government from \na government that is run by the whims of the people than the rule of \nlaw. The law is an amazingly important thing, an amazingly important \nprotection. For us to give up on it so easily doesn't speak well of \nwhat our Founding Fathers fought for, what generation after generation \nof American soldiers has fought for, what soldiers are fighting for \ntoday when they go overseas to fight wars for us. It doesn't speak well \nof what we are doing here to protect the freedom at home when our \nsoldiers are abroad fighting for us that we say our freedom is not \nprecious enough for one person to come down and say: Enough is enough, \nMr. President, come clean, come forward and say you will not kill \nAmericans on American soil.\n  The oath of office of the President says that he will, to the best of \nhis ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. He raises \nhis right hand, he puts his left hand on the Bible, and he says \n``will.'' The President doesn't say, I intend to if it is convenient; I \nintend to unless circumstances dictate otherwise. The President says, \n``I will defend the Constitution. I will protect the Constitution.''\n  There is not room for equivocation here. This is something that is so \nimportant, so fundamental to our country that he needs to come forward.\n  When Brennan, whose nomination I am opposing today, was asked \ndirectly: Is there any limit to your killing? Is there any geographic \nlimitation to\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\nyour drone strike program? Brennan responded and said: No, there is no \nlimitation.\n  So the obvious question would be, if there is no limitation on whom \nyou can kill and where you can kill and there is no due process upon \nwhom you will kill, does that mean you will do it in America? The \nSenator from Oregon asked him that question directly, in committee. And \nthis so-called champion of transparency, this so-called advocate of \nsome kind of process, responded to the Senator from Oregon by saying: I \nplan to optimize secrecy and optimize transparency.\n  Gobbledygook. You were asked: Will you kill Americans on American \nsoil? Answer the question.\n  Our laws forbids the CIA from doing that. It should have been an easy \nquestion. The 1947 National Security Act says the CIA doesn't operate \nin our country. We have the FBI, we have rules, we have separated \npowers to protect your rights. That is what government was organized to \ndo. That is what the Constitution was put in place to do, to protect \nyour rights. So when I asked, he says: No answer. He says: I will evade \nyour answer, and by letting him come forward we let him get away with \nit.\n  I have hounded and hounded and finally yesterday I get a response \nfrom Mr. Brennan, who wishes to be the CIA chief, and he finally says: \nI will obey the law.\n  Well, hooray. Good for him. It took a month to get him to admit that \nhe will obey the law. But it is not so simple. You see, the drone \nstrike program is under the Department of Defense, so when the CIA says \nthey are not going to kill you in America, they are not saying the \nDefense Department won't. So Eric Holder sent a response, the Attorney \nGeneral. His response says: I haven't killed anyone yet. I don't intend \nto kill anyone. But I might.\n  He pulls out examples that are not under consideration. There is the \nuse of local force that can always be repelled--if our country is \nattacked, the President has the right to protect and defend the \ncountry. Nobody questions that. Nobody questions if planes are flying \ntoward the Twin Towers whether they can be repelled by the military. \nNobody questions whether a terrorist with a rocket launcher or grenade \nlauncher is attacking us, whether they can be repelled. They do not get \ntheir day in court.\n  But if you are sitting in a cafeteria in Dearborn, if you happen to \nbe an Arab American who has a relative in the Middle East and you \ncommunicate with them by e-mail and someone says your relative is \nsomeone we suspect of being associated with terrorism, is that enough \nto kill you? For goodness sake, wouldn't we try to make an arrest and \ncome to the truth by having a jury and a presentation of the facts on \nboth sides of the issue?\n  See, the real problem here is one of the things we did a long time \nago is we separated the police power from the judicial power. This was \nan incredibly important first step. We also prevented the military from \nacting in our country because we did not want to have a police state. \nOne of the things we greatly objected to of the British is they were \npassing out general writs or writs of assistance. These were warrants \nthat allowed them to go into a house but allowed them to go into \nanyone's house. What we did when we wrote our Constitution is we made \nthe Constitution--we made the fourth amendment specific to the person \nand the place and the things to be looked for. We did not like the \nsoldiers going willy-nilly into any house and looking for anything. So \nwe made our Constitution much more specific.\n  I think this is something we should not give up on so easily. I think \nthe idea that we could deprive someone of their life without any kind \nof hearing, essentially allowing a politician--I am not casting any \naspersions on the President. I am not saying he is a bad person at all. \nBut he is not a judge.\n  He is a politician. He was elected by a majority, but the majority \ndoesn't get to decide whom we execute. We have a process for deciding \nthis and we have courts for deciding this. To allow one man to accuse a \nperson in secret and to never get notified that they have been \naccused--their notification is the buzz of the propellers on the drone \nas it flies overhead in the seconds before they are killed. Is that \nwhat we want from our government? Are we so afraid of terrorism and so \nafraid of terrorists that we are willing to just throw out our rights \nand our freedoms and what we have fought for and have gotten over the \ncenturies? We have at least 800--if not 1,000--years' worth of \nprotections.\n  Originally, the protections were against a monarch. We feared a \nmonarch. We didn't like having a monarch. When we came to this country \nand set up our Presidency, there was a great deal of alarm. There was a \ngreat deal of fear over having a king, and so we limited the executive \nbranch. Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers that the Constitution \nsupposes what history demonstrates, which is that the executive branch \nis the branch most prone to a war, most likely to go to war, and, \ntherefore, we took that power to declare war and vested it in the \nlegislature. We broke up the powers.\n  Montesquieu wrote about the checks and balances and the separation of \npowers. He was somebody whom Jefferson looked toward. They separated \nthe powers because there is a chance for abusive power when power \nresides in one person. Montesquieu said there can be no liberty when \nthe executive and the legislative branches are combined.\n  I say something similar; that is, there can be no liberty when the \nexecutive and the judiciary branches are combined, and that is what we \nare doing here. We are allowing the President to be the accuser in \nsecret, we are allowing him to be the judge, and we are allowing him to \nbe the jury. No man should have that power. We should fear that power \nnot because we have to say: Oh, we fear the current President. It has \nnothing to do with who the President is. It has nothing to do with \nwhether someone is a Republican or Democrat. It has to do with whether \nwe fear the consolidation of power, whether we fear power being given \nto one person, be it a Republican or a Democrat. This is not \nnecessarily a right-left issue.\n  Kevin Gosztola, who writes at firedoglake.com, writes that the mere \nfact that the President's answer to the question of whether you can \nkill an American on American soil was yes is outrageous. However, it \nfits the framework for fighting a permanent global war on terrorism \nwithout any geographic limitations, which President Obama's \nadministration has maintained it has the authority to wage.\n  What is important to note is that we are talking about a war without \ngeographic limitations, but we are also talking about a war without \ntemporal limitations. This war has no limit in time. When will this war \nend? It is a war that has an infinite timeline. If we are going to \nsuspend our rights, if there is going to be no geographic limits to \nkilling--which means we are not at war in Afghanistan, we are at war \neverywhere. Everybody who pops up is al-Qaida. Whether they have heard \nof al-Qaida or whether they have had any communication with some \nnetwork of al-Qaida, it is al-Qaida. There is a new war going on \neverywhere in the world, and there are no limitations.\n  Glenn Greenwald has also written about this subject, and he was \nspeaking at the Freedom to Connect conference. He said there is a \ntheoretical framework being built which posits that the U.S. Government \nhas unlimited power. Some call this inherent power. ``Inherent'' means \nit has not been defined anywhere; it has not been expressly given to \nthe government. They have decided this is their power and they are \ngoing to grab it and take what they get.\n  This is not new. The Bush administration did some of this too. When \nthe Bush administration tried to grab power, the left--and some of us \non the right--were critical when they tried to wiretap phones without a \nwarrant. Many on the right and many on the left raised a raucous. There \nwas a loud outcry against President Bush for usurping, going across due \nprocess, not allowing due process, and not obeying the restraints of \nwarrants. Where is that outcry now?\n  Glenn Greenwald writes:\n\n       There is a theoretical framework being built that posits \n     that the U.S. Government has unlimited power, when it comes \n     to any kind of threats it perceives, to take whatever action \n     against them that it wants without any constraints or \n     limitations of any kind.\n\n  As Greenwald suggests--and this goes back to Gosztola's words--\nanswering\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\nyes to the question that you can kill Americans on American soil \nillustrates the real radicalism the government has embraced in terms of \nhow it uses its own power.\n  We were opposed to them listening to our conversations without a \nwarrant, but no one is going to stand and say anything about killing a \nperson without a warrant, a judge's review or a jury? No one is going \nto object to that? Where is the cacophony who stood and said: How can \nyou tap my phone without going to a judge first? I ask: How can you \nkill someone without going to a judge or a jury? Are we going to give \nup our rights to any politician of any stripe? Are we going to give up \nthe right to decide who lives and who dies?\n  Gosztola goes on to say the reason the administration didn't want to \nanswer yes or no to this question--can you kill Americans on American \nsoil--is because he says a ``no'' answer would jeopardize the critical, \ntheoretical foundation they have very carefully constructed that says \nthere are no cognizable constraints on how U.S. Government power can be \nasserted.\n  Civil libertarians once expected more from the President. In fact, it \nwas one of the things I liked about the President. I am a Republican. I \ndidn't vote for or support the President either time, but I admired \nhim. I particularly admired him when he ran in 2007. I admired his \nability to stand and say: We will not torture people. That is not what \nAmerica does.\n  How does the President's mind work? The President--who seemed so \nhonorable, so concerned with our rights, so concerned with the right \nnot to have our phone tapped--now says he is not concerned with whether \na person can be killed without a trial. The leap of logic is so \nfantastic as to boggle the mind. Where is the Barack Obama of 2007? Has \nthe Presidency so transformed him that he has forgotten his moorings \nand what he stood for?\n\n  Civil libertarians once expected more from the President. Ask any \ncivil libertarian whether the President should have the right to \narbitrarily kill Americans on American soil, and the answer is easy. Of \ncourse no President should have the right or that power under the \nConstitution.\n  Brennan has responded in committee that now the CIA does not have the \nright to do it on American soil. The problem is that this program is \nunder the Department of Defense, so it is, once again, an evasive \nanswer. They are not answering the true question: Will the Government \nof America kill Americans on American soil?\n  Gosztola, from firedoglake.com, writes that there may never be a \ntargeted killing of a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil--and the question of \nwhether a U.S. citizen could be targeted and killed on U.S. soil may \nremain a hypothetical question for some time--but the fact that the \nObama administration has told a U.S. Senator there is a circumstance \nwhere the government could target and kill an American citizen on \nAmerican soil without charge and without trial is a stark example of an \nimperial Presidency.\n  This is what our Founding Fathers wanted to fight against. They \nwanted to limit the role and the power of the President. They wanted to \ncheck the President's power with the power of the Senate, the power of \nthe House, and the power of the judiciary. We have three coequal \nbranches. Not one of them should be able to run roughshod on the other.\n  The problem is we have allowed this to happen--not me personally, but \nCongress in general has allowed the President to usurp this power. If \nthere were an ounce of courage in this body, I would be joined by many \nother Senators in saying we will not tolerate this, that we will come \ntogether, in a bipartisan fashion, and tell any President that no \nPresident will ever have the authority to kill Americans without a \ntrial. When the President says he does intend to do so, we have to \nthink that through.\n  One year ago, the President signed a law that says a person can be \ndetained indefinitely and that they can be sent from America to \nGuantanamo Bay without a trial. He wants us to be comforted by that. He \nwants us to remember and think well of him because he says: I don't \nintend to do so. It is not enough. I mean, would we be able to tolerate \na Republican who stood and said: I like the first amendment, I am quite \nfond of the first amendment, and I don't intend to break the first \namendment, but I might.\n  Would conservatives tolerate someone who said: I like the second \namendment, I think it is important and I am for gun ownership and I \ndon't intend to violate the second amendment, but I might. Would we \ntolerate that he doesn't intend to do so as a standard?\n  We have to think about the standards being used overseas. Google \ninterviewed him not too long ago and asked him if he could kill \nAmericans at home. He was evasive. He said there are rules. He said the \nrules outside would be different than inside. I certainly hope so. \nOutside the United States the rules for killing are that someone can be \nkilled through a signature strike. We don't have to know what that \nperson's name is, who they are or whom they are with. If a person is in \na line of traffic and we think they are going from talking to bad \npeople to talking to other bad people, we can kill that person.\n  Is that going to be the standard in America? When they are asked if \nthey have killed civilians in their drone strikes, they say no. \nHowever, a person is not counted as a civilian if they are male or if \nthey are between the ages of 16 and 50. They are considered a potential \nand probable combatant if they are in the 16-to-50 age range.\n  My question is: If you are not a civilian, if you are in proximity to \nbad people, is that the standard we are going to use in the United \nStates? If we are going to kill Americans on American soil and the \nstandard is going to be signature strikes of a person who is close to \nbad people or in the same proximity of bad people, is that enough? Are \nwe happy with that standard? Are we happy we have no jury, no trial, no \ncharges, and nothing done publicly?\n  Eric Holder, the Attorney General's response to me is that they \nmaintain they are not going to do this. We should just trust them. It \nis not about them, though. It is about the law. The law restrains \neveryone equally, regardless of their party or whether they are \nRepublican or Democrat. The law is out there for the time when somebody \ninadvertently elects a truly bad person.\n  When World War I ended, the currency was being destroyed in Germany. \nIn 1923, paper money became so worthless that people wheeled it in \nwheelbarrows; they burned it for fuel. It became virtually worthless \novernight. At the beginning of September 1923, I think it was like 10 \nor 15 marks for a loaf of bread. On September 14, it was 1,000 marks. \nOn September 30, it was 100,000 marks. By October 15, it was a couple \nof million marks for a loaf of bread. It was a chaotic situation. Out \nof that chaos, Hitler was elected democratically. They elected him out \nof this chaos.\n  My point is not that anybody in our country is Hitler. I am not \naccusing anybody of being that evil. I think it is an overplayed and \nmisused analogy. What I am saying is that in a democracy we could \nsomeday elect someone who is very evil, and that is why we don't give \nthe power to the government. It is not an accusation of this President \nor anybody in this body; it is a point to be made historically that \noccasionally even a democracy gets it wrong. So when a democracy gets \nit wrong, we want the law to be there in place. We want this rule of \nlaw.\n\n  As I mentioned, Hayek said that this is what distinguished us. \nNothing distinguishes us more clearly from arbitrary government and a \ngovernment of whims than a rule of law, and a stable and consistent \ngovernment is the rule of law.\n  Heritage has an author who has written some about the oath of office. \nHis name is Kesavan. He writes that the location and the phrasing of \nthe oath of office for the President--this is something I mentioned \nearlier, that the President says he will protect and defend and \npreserve the Constitution--words are important. The oath doesn't say, I \nintend to preserve, protect, and defend; it says, I will.\n  Kesavan writes, though, that the location and phrasing of the oath of \noffice strongly suggests that it is not empowering but limiting. So the \nPresident doesn't take an oath of office that says: I intend to \npreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, but I also feel that I \nhave inherent powers that were never mentioned by anybody that I will \nbe the sole arbiter of interpreting what those powers are.\n\n[[Page S1153]]\n\n  That sounds more like a king. That is not what we wanted. We did not \nwant an imperial Presidency. What Kesavan suggests is that the oath of \noffice is not empowering but that it is limiting, that the clause \nlimits the President and how the President can execute or how the \nExecutive power can be exercised.\n  One unanswered word in that Constitution includes the Fifth Amendment \nto the Constitution. What does the Fifth Amendment say? The Fifth \nAmendment says that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or \notherwise infamous crime unless on presentment or indictment of a grand \njury. It is pretty explicit. The Fifth Amendment protects us. It \nprotects us from a King placing a person in the tower, but it also \nshould protect us from a President who might kill us with a drone.\n  We were granted due process. It is not always easy to sort out the \ndetails of who is a threat to the country and who is not a threat to \nthe country. If it were people with grenade launchers on their \nshoulders, that is easy. In fact, I agree completely. A person does not \nget due process if they are actively attacking America. But we have to \nrealize there have been reports that over half of the drone strikes \noverseas are not even directed toward an individual, they are directed \ntoward a caravan of unnamed individuals.\n  Overseas, I have no problems. If people are shooting at American \nsoldiers overseas, by all means, they get no due process. But we also \nhave to realize that many--we don't know because they won't tell us the \nnumber, but many of the drone strikes overseas are done when a person \nis walking, whether to church, a restaurant, or along the road; they \nare done when a person is in a car driving; they are done when a person \nis in a house eating or in a restaurant eating; or they are done when a \nperson is in a home sleeping. I am not even saying all those people \ndidn't deserve what they got, but I am saying they were not actively \ninvolved in something that is an imminent threat, and if they were in \nAmerica, they would be arrested.\n  If we think a person is a terrorist in America, we should arrest \nthem. But here is the question: Who is a terrorist? That is why I have \nbeen so concerned with a lot of people around here who want to say if \nyou are associated with terrorism. The reason is that our government \nhas already put out things that I think are of a questionable nature.\n  The Bureau of Justice put out a bulletin within the last year \ndescribing people we need to be worried about. These are the people we \nare supposed to say something about if we see something. Who are these \nterrorists who live among us? People who might be missing fingers on \none hand; people who might have stains on their clothing; people who \nmight have changed the color of their hair; people who like to pay in \ncash; people who own more than one gun; people who own weatherized \nammunition; people who have 7 days of food in their house--these are \npeople we should be afraid of and we should report to our government, \nso says our government. Are they going to be on the drone strike list? \nI think we need to get an answer from the President.\n  If you are going to kill people in America, we need rules, and we \nwant to know what your rules are because I certainly don't want to have \n7 days of food in my house if that is on the list of terrorism. There \nare some governmental Web sites that advise us to have food in our \nhouse. If we live in a hurricane-prone area, we are supposed to keep \nsome extra food around. Who is going to decide when it is OK to have \nfood in our house and when it is not?\n  There is something called a fusion center. Fusion centers are \nsupposed to coordinate between the Federal Government and the local \ngovernment to find terrorists. The one in Missouri a couple of years \nago came up with a list, and they sent this to every policeman in \nMissouri. This kind of concerns me. The people on the list might \ninclude me. The people on the list from the fusion center in Missouri \nwhom we need to be worried about and whom policemen should stop are \npeople who have bumper stickers that might be pro-life; people who have \nbumper stickers that might be for more border security; people who \nsupport third-party candidates; people who might be in the Constitution \nParty. And isn't there some irony there--people who might be in the \nConstitution Party, who believe in the Constitution so much, they might \nbe a terrorist.\n  So I think we need to be concerned about this. Things are not so \nblack and white. If someone is shooting a gun at us--a cannon, a \nmissile, a rocket, a plane--it is pretty easy to know what lethal \nattacks are and to repel them, and there should be no due process. But \nwe are talking about people in their home. We are talking about people \nin a restaurant or a cafe that someone is making an accusation against.\n  If the accusation is based on how many fingers you have on your hand, \nI have a problem with that standard. If the standard to be used for \nkilling Americans is whether a person pays in cash, I have a problem \nwith that. If the standard to be used in America is being close to \nsomeone who is bad or the government thinks is bad is enough for you to \nbe killed and not even to count you as an accidental kill but to count \nyou as a combatant because you were near them--see, here is the \nproblem, and this is no passing problem, this is an important problem. \nThere was a man named al-Awlaki. He was a bad guy. By all evidence \navailable to the public that I have read, he was treasonous. I have no \nsympathy for his death. I still would have tried him in a Federal court \nfor treason, and I think he could have been executed. But his son was \n16 years old, and he missed his dad, who had been gone for 2 years. His \nson sneaks out of the house and goes to Yemen. His son is then killed \nby a drone strike. They won't tell us if he was targeted. I suspect, \nsince there were other people in the group--there were about 20 people \nkilled--that they were targeting someone else. I don't know that. I \ndon't have inside information on that, but I suspect that.\n\n  Here is the real problem. When the President's spokesman was asked \nabout al-Awlaki's son, do my colleagues know what his response was? \nThis I find particularly callous and particularly troubling. The \nPresident's response to the killing of al-Awlaki's son--he said he \nshould have chosen a more responsible father. It is kind of hard to \nchoose who your parents are. That is sort of like saying to someone \nwhose father is a thief or a murderer or a rapist--obviously a bad \nthing, but does that mean it is OK to kill their children? Think of the \nstandard we would have if our standard for killing people overseas is \nthat you should have chosen a more responsible parent. It just boggles \nthe mind and really affects me to think that would be our standard.\n  There is absolutely no excuse for the President not to come forward \non this. I have been asking for a month for an answer. It is like \npulling teeth to get any answer from the President. Why is that? \nBecause he doesn't want to answer the question the way he should as a \ngood and moral and upstanding person--someone who believes in the \nConstitution should--that absolutely no American should ever be killed \nin America who is sitting in a cafe. No American should ever be killed \nin their house without a warrant and some kind of aggressive behavior \nby them. There is nothing American about being bombed in one's sleep. \nThere is nothing constitutional about that.\n  The President says to trust him. He says he hasn't done it yet. He \nsays he doesn't intend to do so but he might. That is just not good \nenough. It is not enough for me to be placated. It is not enough for me \nto be quiet.\n  So I have come here today to speak for as long as I can. I won't be \nable to speak forever, but I am going to speak for as long as I can to \ndraw attention to something that I find really to be very disturbing.\n  People have asked about this nomination process because I have \nactually voted for a couple of the President's nominees, some of whom I \nhave objected to, some of whom I have had personal differences with as \nwell as political differences with. This is not about partisanship.\n  I voted for Secretary of State John Kerry. I have almost nothing in \ncommon with him politically. I have disagreed with him repeatedly on \nthe floor. But I gave the President the prerogative of choosing his \nSecretary of State because I think the President won the election and \nhe deserves to get\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\nto make some choices on who is in his Cabinet.\n  I voted for the very controversial Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel. \nThere were things I liked about him and things I disliked about him. I \nfilibustered him twice before I allowed him to go forward, and people \nhave given me a hard time. Conservatives from my party have blasted me \nfor doing that, but I gave the President that prerogative.\n  So I am not standing here as a Republican who will never vote for a \nDemocrat. I voted for the first three nominees by the President. This \nis not about partisanship. I have allowed the President to pick his \npolitical appointees, but I will not sit quietly and let him shred the \nConstitution. I cannot sit at my desk quietly and let the President say \nhe will kill Americans on American soil who are not actively attacking \na country. The answer should be so easy. I can't imagine that he will \nnot expressly come forward and say: No, I will not kill Americans on \nAmerican soil.\n  The Fifth Amendment says that no person shall be held for a capital \nor otherwise infamous crime unless on the presentment or indictment of \na grand jury. It goes on to say that no person will be deprived of \nlife, liberty, or property without due process. Now, some hear ``due \nprocess,'' and if a person is not a lawyer--I am not a lawyer--when we \nfirst hear it, we think, what does that mean? What does it mean to have \ndue process?\n  What it means is we are protected. We get protections. Is our justice \nsystem perfect? No. Sometimes a person goes all the way through due \nprocess in our country, and we have actually convicted people who are \ninnocent. Fortunately, it is very rare, but we have actually convicted \npeople who are innocent. What are the chances that our President, going \nthrough a PowerPoint slide show and flashcards, might make a mistake on \ninnocence or guilt? I would say there is a chance. Even our judicial \nsystem, which goes through all of these processes, including a judge \nreviewing the indictment, a jury reviewing it, and then a sentencing \nphase and all of that going forward--we sometimes make mistakes. What \nare the chances that one man, one politician, no matter what party they \nare from, could make a mistake on this? I think there is a real chance \nthat exists. That is why we put these rules in place.\n  Patrick Henry wrote that the Constitution wasn't given or written or \nput down to restrain you; the Constitution was to restrain us. There \nhas always been, since the beginning of the time we first had \ngovernment, this desire to restrain the government, to try to keep the \ngovernment from growing too strong or to try to keep the government \nfrom taking your rights.\n  It is interesting that when we look at the Constitution, the \nConstitution gave what are called enumerated powers to government. \nMadison said these enumerated powers were few and defined. The \nliberties we were given, though, are numerous and unlimited. So there \nare about 17 powers given to government which we have now transformed \ninto about a gazillion or at least a million new powers--we don't pay \nmuch attention to the enumerated powers or to the Constitution anymore. \nBut the Constitution left our rights as unenumerated; they aren't \nlimited. Your rights are limitless.\n  So when we get to the 9th and 10th Amendments, they say specifically \nthat those rights not granted to your government are left to the States \nand the people respectively. It didn't list what those rights are. The \n14th Amendment talks about privileges and immunities being left to you \nalso. They are to be protected.\n  I don't think there is a person in America--that is why I can't \nunderstand the President's unwillingness to say he is not going to kill \nnoncombatants. Think about that. He is unwilling to say publicly that \nhe is not going to kill noncombatants, because that is what we are \ntalking about here. I am not talking about someone with a bazooka or a \ngrenade launcher on their shoulder. Anyone committing lethal force can \nbe repelled with lethal force. No one argues that point. I am talking \nabout whether you can kill noncombatants because many of the people \nbeing killed overseas are noncombatants. Are they potential combatants? \nMaybe. Maybe the standard can be less overseas than it is here for \npeople involved in a battle, but it is getting kind of murky overseas \nas well.\n  For goodness' sake, in America we can't just have this idea that we \nare going to kill noncombatants. We are talking about people eating in \na cafe, at home, in a restaurant. I think we need to be a little more \ncareful.\n  The power that was given by the Constitution to the Senate was that \nof advise and consent. This constitutional provision provides us with \nthe power to consent to nominations or withhold consent. It is a check \non the executive branch, but it only works if we actually use it.\n  I am here to speak for as long as I can hold up to try to rally \nsupport from people from both sides to say: For goodness' sake, why \ndon't we use some advise and consent? Why don't we advise the President \nhe should come forward and say he will not condone nor does he believe \nhe has the authority to kill noncombatants?\n  As a check on the executive branch, this power that is granted to the \nSenate is the right to withhold consent. The Constitution does not \nprovide Senators with the specifics or the criteria of why we withhold \nconsent. That is left to us to decide.\n  I withhold my consent today because I am deeply concerned the \nexecutive branch has not provided an answer, that the President refuses \nto say he will not kill noncombatants.\n  The President swore an oath to the Constitution. He said he will \nprotect, defend, and preserve the Constitution. He did not say: I \nintend to when it is convenient. He said: I will defend the \nConstitution. It is inexcusable for him not to come forward.\n  There is an author who writes for The Atlantic who has written a lot \nabout the drone program by the name of Conor Friedersdorf. He recounts \nthe tale of al-Awlaki's son who was killed. He said when the \nPresident's spokesman was asked about the strike that killed him, the \nPresident's spokesman replied: Well, he would have been fine if he \n``had a more responsible father.''\n  If that is our standard, we have sunk to a real low.\n  Cornered by reporters after this, White House Press Secretary Robert \nGibbs attempted to defend the kill list, which is secret, of course. We \nhave to remember, if we are going to kill noncombatants in America or \npeople we think might someday be combatants, the list will be secret. \nSo one will not get a chance to protest: Hey, I am not that bad. I \nmight have said that at one time, but I am not that bad. All right. I \nhave objected to big government, not all government. I am not fomenting \nrevolution. I was critical at that meeting. I was at a tea party \nmeeting, and I was critical of the President, but I am not a \nrevolutionary. Please, don't kill me.\n  Should we live in a country where we have to be worried about what we \nsay? Should we live in a country where we have to worry about what we \nwrite? What kind of country would that be? Why is there not more moral \noutrage? Why is there not every Senator coming down to say: You are \nexactly right. Let's go ahead and hold this nomination and why don't we \nhold it until we get more clarification from the President.\n  Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic writes:\n\n       . . . it's vital for the uninitiated to understand how Team \n     Obama misleads when it talks about its drone program. Asked \n     how their kill list can be justified, Gibbs--\n\n  The President's spokesman--\n\n     replies that ``when there are people who are trying to harm \n     us, and have pledged to bring terror to these shores, we've \n     taken that fight to them.'' Since the kill list itself is \n     secret, there's no way to offer a specific counterexample.\n\n  It is one thing to say: Yes, these people are going to probably come \nand attack us, which, to tell you the truth, is probably not always \ntrue. There are people fighting a civil war in Yemen who probably have \nno conception of ever coming to America.\n  Friedersdorf goes on to say:\n\n       But we do know that U.S. drones are targeting people who've \n     never pledged to carry out attacks in the United States.\n\n  So we are talking about noncombatants who have never pledged to carry \nout attacks are being attacked overseas. Think about it, if that is \ngoing to be the standard at home: people who have never truly been \ninvolved with combat against us.\n\n[[Page S1155]]\n\n  Friedersdorf continues:\n\n       Take Pakistan, where the CIA kills some people without even \n     knowing their identities. ``As Obama nears the end of his \n     term, officials said the kill list in Pakistan has slipped to \n     fewer than 10 al-Qaeda targets, down from as many as two \n     dozen. . . . ''\n\n  Yet we are killing hundreds of people in Pakistan.\n  There is a quote that I think sort of brings this and makes this very \npoignant. There is a quote from an ex-CIA agent--I think it is Bruce \nRiedel--who says: The drone strike program is sort of like a lawnmower. \nYou can keep mowing them down, but as soon as the lawnmower stops, the \ngrass grows again.\n  Some people have gone one step further and said: For every 1 you kill \nor for maybe every 1 you accidentally kill whom you did not intend to \nkill, 10 more spring up.\n  Think about it. If it were your family member and they have been \nkilled and they were innocent or you believe them to be innocent, is it \ngoing to make you more or less likely to become involved with attacking \nthe United States?\n  I have written a couple letters to John Brennan, who has been put up \nfor the CIA nomination. I think it looks like the first letter was sent \nJanuary 25. So here we are into March, and I only got a response when \nhe was threatened. So here is a guy whom the President promotes as \nbeing transparent and wanting to give a lot of information to the \nAmerican people, he will not respond to a Senator. They treat the \nSenate with disdain, basically--will not even respond to us, much less \nthe American people, when I asked him these questions. He finally \nresponded only when his nomination was threatened.\n  So when it came to the committee and it appeared as if I had \nbipartisan support for slowing down his nomination if he did not answer \nhis questions, then he answered his questions. It does not give me a \nlot of confidence that in the future, going forward, if he is approved, \nthat he is going to be real forthcoming and real transparent about \nthis.\n  I do not have a lot of anticipation or belief that we are going to \nget more information after this nomination hearing. Some are now \nsaying: You have gotten your pound of flesh. Let him go, and we will \nkeep working on this. The problem is, once he is gone, the discussion \nis over.\n  Others in my party have been trying to get information about what \nwent horribly wrong in Benghazi and have gotten some of that \ninformation but only by using it as leverage to try to get the \nPresident to do what is the honorable thing; that is, to be more \ntransparent with his ways.\n  In the first letter I sent to Brennan, I asked him the question: Is \nit legal to order the killing of American citizens and that you would \nnot be compelled to even give your reasoning--not even specific to the \ncase but any of your reasoning?\n  Finally, as these questions came forward, some of the things were \nleaked out. One of the most troubling things that came out is when \nBrennan and the President finally began to talk about the drone strike \nprogram, which, according to the former Press Secretary, they were to \ndeny that it existed for years.\n  When they finally came out, they told us a couple things about their \ninterpretation of it. One, they have no geographical limit to their \ndrone strikes. The second thing is they told us what they thought was \nimminent. This is pretty important because a lot of Americans, myself \nincluded, believe if we are being attacked, we can respond with lethal \nforce. But a lot of Americans think that we have to actually be engaged \nin that to respond with lethal force. But they told us the way their \nlawyers interpret ``imminent'' is imminent does not have to mean \n``immediate.''\n  Only a bunch of lawyers could get together, government lawyers could \nget together and say imminent is not immediate. You have to understand, \nand what we should be asking the President is, Is this your standard \nfor America? If you are going to assert that you have the right to kill \nAmericans on American soil, are you going to assert--are you going to \nassert--that your standard is that an imminent threat does not have to \nbe immediate?\n  I am quite concerned, when I hear this kind of evasiveness, with this \nsort of nonresponse to questions.\n  We also asked: Would it not be appropriate to require a judge or a \ncourt to review this?\n  See, here is the real interesting thing. We had a President who ran \nfor office saying your phone should not be tapped without a warrant. I \nhappen to agree with Candidate Obama. But what happened to Candidate \nObama, who wanted to protect your right to the privacy of your phone, \nwho does not care much about your right not to be killed by a drone \nwithout any kind of judicial proceeding?\n  I think we should demand it. The way things work around here, though, \nis people kind of say: Yes, we will demand it, and maybe later on this \nyear we will talk about a bill or talk about getting something. What \nthey should do is just say: No more. We are not going to move forward \nuntil we get some justice. We are not going to let the President--any \nPresident, Republican or Democratic--do this.\n  One of the other questions I asked the President was: It is \nparadoxical that the Federal Government would need to go before a judge \nto authorize a wiretap on U.S. citizens even overseas but possibly not \nhave any kind of oversight of killing an American here in America.\n  We have asked him how many citizens have been killed. We have not \ngotten an answer to that. They say not many, and hopefully it has not \nbeen many. But I think it is important to know. I think it would be \nimportant to know, if we are going to target Americans in America, if \nthat list exists. I think it would be important to know if being close \nto someone is also justified. What if you just happen to live in the \nneighborhood of somebody who is a suspected terrorist? Is it OK because \nyou were close to them? What if you happen to go to dinner with a guy \nyou did not know or a woman you did not know and the government says \nthey are a terrorist? Just because you are having dinner with them and \nyou are a male between the ages of 16 and 50, does that make you a \ncombatant?\n  We also asked the question: Do you condone the CIA's practice of \ncounting civilians killed by U.S. drone strikes as militants simply \nbecause they are of the same age? Similar to every other question, no \nanswer.\n  We asked him whether al-Awlaki's son was a target. No answer.\n  We asked how many people have been targeted? No answer.\n  Part of the problem with this is that we are--or Congress in general \nis sloppy about writing legislation in general.\n  I will give an example. When the ObamaCare legislation was written--\nit is over 2,000 pages--but it leaves up to the Secretary of Health, I \nthink 1,800 times, the power to decide at a later date what the rule \nwould be. So since ObamaCare, of 2,000 pages, has been written, there \nhave been now 9,000 pages of regulations.\n  Dodd-Frank is kind of the same way. Dodd-Frank is a couple thousand \npages. It now is going to wind up with 8,000 or 9,000 pages of \nregulations.\n  We abdicate our responsibility by not writing legislation. We write \nshells of legislation that are imprecise and do not retain the power. \nBecause of that, the executive branch and the bureaucracy, which is \nessentially the same thing, do whatever they want.\n  This happened also with the authorization of use of force in \nAfghanistan. This happened over 10 years ago now--12 years ago. I \nthought we were going to war against the people who attacked us, and I \nam all for that. I would have voted for the war. I would have preferred \nit to have been a declaration of war. I think we were united in saying: \nLet's get those people who attacked us on 9/11 and make sure it never \nhappens again.\n  The problem is, as this war has drug on, they take that authorization \nof use of force to mean pretty much anything. They have now said the \nwar has no geographic limitations. So it is not a war in Afghanistan; \nit is a war in Yemen, Somalia, Mali. It is a war in unlimited places.\n  Were we a body that cared about our prerogative to declare war, we \nwould take that power back. But I will tell you how poor--and this is \non both sides of the aisle--how poor is our understanding or belief in \nretaining that power here.\n  About 1 year ago, I tried to end the Iraq war. You may say: I thought \nthe\n\n[[Page S1156]]\n\nIraq war was already over. It is. But we still have an authorization of \nuse of force that says we can go to war in Iraq anytime. Since they \nthink the use of force in Afghanistan means limitless war anywhere, \nanytime in the whole world, for goodness' sake, wouldn't we try to take \nback an authorization of force if the war is over?\n  But here is the sad part. I actually got a vote on it. I think I got \nless than 20 votes. You cannot end a war after it is over up here. It \nhas repercussions, because these authorizations to use force are used \nfor many other things. So the authorization of force says you can go \nafter al-Qaida or associated terrorists.\n  The problem is that when you allow the executive branch to sort of \ndetermine what is al-Qaida, you have got no idea. For the most part I \nwill not be able to determine that either. All the information is \nclassified. There are a lot of bad people. There is a war going on in \nYemen. I do not know how much it has to do with us, you know, or how \nmuch there is an al-Qaida presence there trying to organize to come and \nattack us. Maybe there is. But maybe those are also people who are just \nfighting their local government.\n  How about Mali? I am not sure. In Mali, they are probably worried \nmore about trying to get the next day's food than coming over here to \nattack us. But we have to ask these questions. We have to ask about \nlimitations on force, because essentially what we have now is a war \nwithout the geographic boundaries.\n  We have many on my side who come down here and say, the battlefield \nis here in America. Be worried. Be alarmed. Alarm bells should go off \nwhen people tell you that the battlefield is in America. Why? Because \nwhen the battlefield is in America, we do not have due process. What \nthey are talking about is they want the laws of war. Another way of \nputting that is, they call it the laws of war. Another way to put it is \nto call it martial law. That is what they want in the United States \nwhen they say the battlefield is here.\n  One of them, in fact, said, if they ask for a lawyer, you tell them \nto shut up. Well, if that is the standard we are going to have in \nAmerica, I am quite concerned that the battlefield will be here and \nthat the Constitution would not apply. Because to tell you the truth, \nif you are shooting at us in Afghanistan, the Constitution does not \napply over there. But I certainly want it to apply here. If you are \nengaged in combat overseas, you do not get due process. But when people \nsay, oh, the battlefield has come to America, and the battlefield is \neverywhere, the war is limitless in time and scope, be worried because \nyour rights will not exist if you call America a battlefield for all \ntime.\n  We have asked him whether the strikes are exclusively focused on al-\nQaida and what is the definition of being part of al-Qaida. In 1947, \nthe National Security Act was passed. It said the CIA does not operate \nin America. Most people--most laypeople know that. The CIA is supposed \nto be doing surveillance and otherwise outside the United States of \nforeign threats. The FBI works within the United States. They do some \nof the same thing. But they are different groups. The CIA operating in \nIraq or Afghanistan does not get a warrant before they do whatever they \ndo to snoop on our enemies. The FBI in our country does. They operate \nunder different rules, and for a reason. We do not want them to operate \nin the United States. We are not saying the CIA are bad people, we just \ndo not want them operating with no rules or the rules we allow them to \noperate with overseas. We do not want them operating in our country.\n  The disappointing thing is that a month ago when I asked John Brennan \nthis question, as his nomination came forward, I could not get an \nanswer. He would not answer the question about the CIA operating in the \nUnited States. Only after yanking his chain, browbeating him in \ncommittee, threatening not to let him out of committee does he finally \nsay he is going to obey the law. We should be alarmed by that. Alarm \nbells should go off when we find that what is going on here is it takes \nthat much for him to say he is going to obey the law.\n  The President has said: Don't worry, because he is not going to kill \nyou with a drone unless it is infeasible to catch you. Now that sounds \nkind of comforting. But I guess if our standard for whether we kill you \nis whether it is practical, that does bother me a little bit. It does \nnot sound quite strict enough. I am kind of worried that maybe there is \na sequester and the President says we cannot have tours in the White \nHouse. Maybe he has not got enough people to go arrest you. He had \npolicemen by him. He is saying he is going to lay off the policemen. Of \ncourse, he does not have anything to do with the policemen, so do not \nworry about that. But he had the policemen by him that he is going to \nlay off, so maybe it is infeasible because he has laid off the \npolicemen so it is going to be easier to kill you.\n  I know that sounds as though we have gone a slippery slope beyond \nwhat he is asking for. But if his standard is it is infeasible to \ncapture you and that is what you are hanging your hat on, I would be a \nlittle concerned that that may not be enough protection for Americans \non American soil.\n  There is a law called posse comitatus. It has been on the books since \nshortly after the Civil War. It is once again one of those things a lot \nof people do not think about, but it is an important thing. It says the \nmilitary does not operate on U.S. soil unless there is a declaration of \nan insurrection or a civil war. There has to be a process that Congress \ngoes through. We have had this law for a long time.\n  Once again, the reason we do it is not because we think our military \nare bad people. I am proud of our soldiers. I am proud of our Army. I \nam proud of what they do for our country. But they operate under \ndifferent rules. It is a much more dangerous environment they operate \nunder. It is different. It is still dangerous in America, but policemen \nhave different rules of engagement than your soldiers have. There are \nmore restrictions and restraint on what we do in our country. So that \nis why we say the military cannot operate here.\n  So when we asked the President, can you kill Americans on American \nsoil with your drone strikes, which is part of the military, it should \nbe an easy answer. In fact, I hope someone is calling him now and \nasking him for an answer. It would save me a lot of time and breath. My \nthroat is already dry and I just got started. But if they would ask him \nfor an answer: Can the military operate in the United States? Well, no, \nthe law says the military cannot operate in the United States. It is on \nthe books. He should simply do the honorable thing and say he will obey \nthe law. It is simple. But I do not get why they refuse to answer it. \nIt worries me that they refuse to answer the question. Because by \nrefusing to answer it, I believe they believe they have expansive \npower, unlimited power. The real irony of this is is that many on the \nleft, Senator Barack Obama included, were very critical of the Bush \nadministration. They felt as though the Bush administration usurped \npower. They felt the Bush administration argued invalid aggrandizement \nor grasping for power. John Yoo was one of the architects of this, \nbelieving basically that the President just says, hey, I am going to \nprotect you, I can do whatever the hell I want.\n\n  Many on the left objected to that. Some of us on the right also \nobjected to this usurpation of power by the Republican President. But \nthe thing is, now that the shoe is on the other foot, we are not seeing \nany of that. We are now seeing a President who was worried about \nwiretaps not at all worried about the legality of killing Americans on \nAmerican soil with no judicial process.\n  But the law of posse comitatus prevents this from happening. It is \nvery clear. It has been on the books for 150-some-odd years. I think it \nwould be pretty easy for the President to go ahead and say that he will \nobey the law. We asked Brennan the question on this and we got no \nanswer.\n  The answers we have gotten are almost more disturbing than getting an \nanswer, really, to tell you the truth. Because when the President \nresponds that I have not killed any Americans yet at home, and that I \ndo not intend do so, but I might, it is incredibly alarming and goes \nagainst his oath of office. He says in his oath of office that I will \npreserve, I will protect, and I will defend the Constitution. It does \nnot say I intend to or that I might.\n\n[[Page S1157]]\n\n  Can you imagine the furor if people were talking about the second \namendment? Can you imagine what conservatives would say if the \nPresident said, well, you know, I kind of like the second amendment and \nI intend to, when convenient, when it is feasible, protect the second \namendment? Or what about those who believe in the first amendment, if \nthe President were to say, I have not broken the first amendment yet, I \nintend to follow it, but I might break it, or I intend to follow it \nwhen it is feasible? So I have all of those rules, and this is what the \nPresident answered when he was at Google Campus a couple of weeks ago. \nThey asked him the question: Can you kill Americans on American soil? \nHe said: Well, the rules will probably be different outside the United \nStates than inside. That basically means, yes, he thinks he can kill \nAmericans on American soil, but he is going to have some rules. Do not \nworry about it, because he will make some rules and there will be a \nprocess, but it will not be due process. It will be a process that he \nsets up in secret in the White House, and I do not find that \nacceptable.\n  The only answer really acceptable, you know, we ask a question that \ncould be yes or no: Can you kill an American on American soil? It is a \nyes-or-no question. They have been very evasive. They have never really \nanswered the question. But when asked it, we pretty much knew only one \nanswer was acceptable. That answer is no. I mean, if you do not answer \nit, basically by not answering it you are saying yes. I was actually a \nlittle bit startled when I finally got the answer: Yes, we can kill \nAmericans on American soil. I thought for sure that they would be \nevasive to the end, try to get their nominee through without opening \nPandora's box.\n  But they have opened Pandora's box. It would be a mistake for us to \nignore it. It would be a mistake for us to ignore the ramifications of \nwhat they have done. When we separate out police power from judicial \npower, it is an important separation. You know, the police can arrest \nyou. They are allowed to do certain things. But the policeman that \ncomes to our door and puts handcuffs on you does not decide your guilt. \nSometimes we do not always think about how important the separation is. \nBut it is incredibly important that those who arrest you are not the \nones who ultimately accuse you. The court, through the people, accuses \nyou, and then you are given a trial to determine your guilt.\n  It is complicated. It is not always clear who is innocent and who is \nguilty. Judges and juries make mistakes. But at least we have a \nprocess. You get appeals most of the time. We have a significant \nprocess going on that has a several-hundred-year tradition at the \nleast. So what gets me about the process that the President favors is, \nit is the ``trust me'' process. You know, I have no intention of doing \nbad things. I will do good things. I am a good person.\n  I am not disputing his motives or saying he is not a good person. But \nI am disputing someone who is naive enough to think that is good enough \nfor our Republic, that his good intentions are good enough for our \nRepublic. It never would have been accepted. It would have been laughed \nout of the Constitutional Convention. The Founding Fathers would have \nobjected so strenuously that that person would probably never have been \nelected to office in our country.\n  Someone who does not believe that the rules have to be in place, and \nthat we cannot have our rights guaranteed by the intentions of our \npoliticians--think about it. Congress has about a 10-percent approval \nrating. Think the American people want to face whether they are going \nto be killed by a drone on a politician? I certainly do not. It does \nnot have anything to do with whether he is a Republican or Democrat. I \nwould be here today if this were a Republican President, because you \ncannot give that much power to one person. We separated the police \npower from the adjudication or from the jury power from the decisions \non innocence and guilt. It is separate from the police power, \npurposefully so, with great forethought.\n\n  Some transform this--and the President has tried--Brennan has tried \nto transform this into: Oh, well, we need to reserve this power for \nwhen planes are attacking the Twin Towers. Well, that is not what we \nare talking about, Mr. President. I think you misunderstand or you \npurposefully obfuscate or you purposefully mislead. No one is \nquestioning whether the United States can repel an attack. No one is \nquestioning whether your local police can repel an attack. Anybody \ninvolved in lethal force, the legal doctrine in our country, and has \nbeen historically, has always been, that the government can repel \nlethal attacks.\n  The problem is that the drone strike program is often not about \ncombatants. It is about people who may or may not be conspiring but \nthey are not in combat. They are in a car. They are in their house. \nThey are in a restaurant. They are in a cafe. If we are going to bring \nthat standard to America, what I am doing down here today is asking the \nPresident to be explicit. If you are going to have the standard that \nyou are going to kill noncombatants in America, come forward and please \nsay it clearly so we know what we are up against. If you are not going \nto do it, come up with what the easy answer is: I am not going to kill \nnoncombatants. That would have been easy for him to say.\n  He could have said the military at some point in time needs to repel \ninvasions. We know that. We are not questioning that. We are \nquestioning a drone strike program--we don't know, because nobody will \ntell us the numbers. The numbers are secret. One Senator said in a \npublic meeting that 4,700 people had been killed overseas. If I had to \nventure a guess, a significant amount of them weren't involved in \nshooting at American soldiers. If they were, by all means kill them. If \nwe are fighting a war in Afghanistan--which we have been--and if there \nare soldiers around the bend who are a threat to our soldiers, there is \nno due process at that point. This is not what we are arguing about. We \nare arguing about targeted strikes of people not involved in combat. \nThat is my concern.\n  My concern also is who is and what is a terrorist, who is associated \nwith terrorism. The government has put out many documents now which \ntell you if you see something, say something. The documents you see, I \nam not so sure these people are terrorists. If you see somebody paying \nin cash or if you have a store, such as one of your customers comes in \nfrequently and they pay in cash, should you report them to the \ngovernment? I can't imagine that is the kind of standard we are going \nto have in our country for deciding drone strikes.\n  When it comes to some of these people, though, I think some of the \ndrone strikes have probably been justified. Al-Awlaki, I think, was a \ntraitor. This is not from looking at classified documents, this is from \nreading the lay press. By all means, he gave up on his country, \nrenounced his citizenship, went overseas, consorted with and aided the \nenemy.\n  One of the interesting questions about aiding the enemy is what \nexactly that means and what are the standards to be. Kevin Williamson \nwrites for the National Review. He wrote an article on drones that I \nthink truly brings this home if you are going to talk about and want to \nknow who are the people who potentially could be killed. In some ways \nal-Awlaki was a sympathizer, someone who aided and abetted through \nInternet talk and chatter. That was the main thing he was accused of. \nActually, after the fact, they said he had more direct association. I \ndon't know if that is true. I haven't seen the secret information on \nthat.\n  What I would say is he was initially brought up as a sympathizer. \nHere is the problem. Many writers have said if you take up arms against \nyour country, you are an enemy combatant. I think that is true. If you \nare in Afghanistan, have a grenade launcher on your shoulder and are \nshooting at Americans, you are an enemy combatant. You don't get due \nprocess.\n  Here is the question: If you are in Poughkeepsie and you are on the \nInternet, and you say I sympathize with some group around the world \nthat doesn't like America, and say bad things about America, are you a \ntraitor? I mean, you can try someone for treason for that. I am not \nsure if it will rise up to that if you are politically opposed to what \nyour government is doing in favor of another. Kevin Williamson gets it \npretty clearly:\n\n\n[[Page S1158]]\n\n\n       If sympathizing with our enemies and propagandizing on \n     their behalf is the equivalent of making war on the country, \n     then the Johnson and Nixon administrations should have bombed \n     every elite college in America.\n\n  During the 1960s, that is all that came out was anti-America, \nantiwar. Is objecting to your government or objecting to the policy of \nyour government sympathizing with the enemy?\n  Some were openly sympathetic. No one will ever forget Jane Fonda \nswiveling around in North Vietnamese armored guns, and it was \ndespicable. It is one thing if you want to try her for treason, but are \nyou going to drop a drone Hellfire missile on Jane Fonda? Are you going \nto drop a drone Hellfire missile on those at Kent State?\n  Our country objected to what happened at Kent State, which was not \ngood--but it was accidental since they were shooting over the heads of \nthese people. Can you imagine we have gone from a country that was \nrightfully upset about the deaths at Kent State to a country which now \nis going to say, if you are in college and you are rabble rousing \nbecause you don't like the government's foreign policy or the \ngovernment's war actions, you are sympathizing? There are a lot of \nquestions that aren't being asked, because sympathizing appears to be \nused as a standard for the drone strike program.\n  We actually had students, apparently during the Vietnam war, who were \nactually raising funds for the Vietcong. That does to me sound like \ntreason. It sounds to me something like we are fighting an enemy and \nyou are giving comfort to the enemy. That does sound like treason. I \nhave no problem with some people actually being tried for treason, but \nthey get a day in court. They don't get a Hellfire missile sent to \ntheir house. There is a difference, though, between sympathizing and \ntaking up arms. Most people around here who want to justify no rules, \nAmerica is a battlefield, no limits to war--they really want to blur it \nall together. It is easier to say, oh, you don't want to stop anybody \nwho is shooting at Americans, but it is not true. I think lethal force \nmay be used against those engaged in lethal force.\n  What troubles me about the drone strike program is quite a few--I \ndon't know the number--the Wall Street Journal says the bulk of the \nattacks in Afghanistan has been signature attacks. This means nobody \nwas named, nobody specifically was identified, and civilians aren't \nreally counted. This is because anybody, any male between the age of 16 \nand 60, is a combatant unless otherwise proven. If those are the \nstandards, I think we need to be alarmed. I think there is a difference \nbetween sympathizing and taking up arms.\n  One of the interesting things Kevin Williamson and the National \nReview brings out, and it is sort of a conundrum for conservatives--\nbecause saying someone was involved and just taking the government's \nwords, like saying al-Awlaki was involved with these other people and \ntaking the government's word, we have no way of ascertaining or \nquestioning whether the secret information is true or not true. A few \nyears before this--and a lot of people don't remember this--al-Awlaki, \nwho was killed a couple years before this, was brought to the Pentagon \nto speak as a part of a group of moderate Islamic preachers. They \nthought him to be an Islamic voice of reason. He even came to the \nCapitol and said prayers in the Capitol. This is the guy who the \ngovernment said was a good guy for a while and later said he was a bad \nguy. I think ultimately the evidence he was a bad guy is pretty strong. \nMost of his crime was sympathizing.\n  It wasn't enough of a standard. I think in a court, in a treasonous \ncourt, al-Awlaki would have been convicted of treason if I were a \njuror. I would have voted he was committing treason, and I wouldn't \nhave had trouble at all with a drone strike on him.\n  If we are going to take by extension the standard we used in putting \nhim on the list that he was a sympathizer, agitator, and a pain in the \nroyal you-know-what on the Internet, there are a lot of those people in \nAmerica if that is going to be our standard.\n  That is why I would feel a little more comforted if it weren't an \naccusation by a politician who unleashes Hellfire missiles. I would be \na little more comforted--and I think we would all sleep a little better \nin our houses at night--if we knew that before the Hellfire missile \ncomes down, a policeman would come to your door and say we accuse you \nof this. They might put handcuffs on you and take you to jail, but they \ndon't get to summarily execute you.\n  That is all I am asking. I am asking for the President to admit \npublicly he is not in favor of summary executions. That is really all I \nam asking, about summary executions of noncombatants. It seems like a \npretty easy answer.\n  We could be done with this in a moment's notice if someone will call \nthe President and ask the question. We could be done with this because \nthat is what I want to hear, not that he is going to use the military \nto repel an invasion. Nobody is questioning the authority of the \nPresident to repel an invasion. I am questioning the authority of the \nPresident to kill noncombatants asleep at home, eating in the \nrestaurant, or what-have-you.\n  One of the things Williamson brings up in his National Review article \nagain--which is a little bit off the subject but somewhat related--we \nwere fearful and we didn't do a very good job with 9/11, frankly. \nSeptember 11 occurred because of a lot of mistakes, and some of you \ncould look back as a Monday-morning quarterback and say, oh, we should \nhave done this.\n  One of the things that sort of bothered me about 9/11 was no one was \never fired. In fact, they gave medals--the head of the FBI, the CIA, \neverybody gets a medal. No one was ever fired.\n  Some of you may remember there was a 20th hijacker. His name was \nMoussaoui. He was in Minnesota, and they captured him a month in \nadvance of 9/11. When they captured him, the FBI agent there--who was \nspot on--was doing an excellent job. The agent who should have received \nthe medal was the FBI agent who caught Moussaoui and was asking his \nsuperiors to get a warrant. He asked repeatedly. He sent 70 letters to \nheadquarters, saying: May I have a warrant to open this guy's computer, \nto investigate him? He was turned down. He got no response. It was a \nhorrible and tragic human error.\n  What do we do? We promote and give medals to the people who were in \ncharge. That agent should have received a medal, but anybody above him \nwho made the decision not to even ask for a warrant shouldn't have gone \nanywhere within the department.\n  Williamson makes the point if our law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies--particularly the State Department--had been doing a minimally \ncompetent job vis-a-vis visa overstays and application screenings, at \nleast 15 of the 9/11 hijackers would have been caught. They were all on \nstudent visas, and they were all overstaying their student visas. \nNobody was paying attention. I still ask that question today. I ask, do \nwe know where all the students are, particularly from about 10 Middle \nEastern countries? The students who aren't from our own country, do we \nknow where they are? I think we have not a good enough system to know \nwhere they all are, whether they have come and gone. This is a real \nproblem.\n  Had we actually looked at Moussaoui's computer? They did; they looked \nat it on September 12. The day after 9/11 they looked at his computer. \nI think it, within hours, led them and linked them up to several \nhijackers in Florida and ultimately would have perhaps exposed the \nwhole ring.\n  The same thing was going on in Arizona at the same time. They had \nsomebody in Arizona saying there are guys who want to fly planes and \ndon't want to learn how to land them.\n  There were horrible and tragic occurrences that happened, human \nbreakdown. How do we fix it? We fix it the same way we do everything in \nWashington: We threw a ton of money at it, and I mean a ton of money. \nBillions upon billions and into the trillions of dollars have now been \nspent. Really the main problem with 9/11 was a lack of communication, \nlack of trying, lack of doing a good job at what you were already \nsupposed to be doing.\n  When we look at this issue, and as we go forward from here, I think \nwhat is most important to me is we not let this go. This is the first \ntime I have decided to come to the floor and speak in a true \nfilibuster. People talk about filibuster all the time. They say the \nfilibuster is overused and it is abused. A\n\n[[Page S1159]]\n\nlot of times the filibuster in our country and in the Senate is \nactually requesting 60 votes happen and we need to do everything by \nunanimous consent, so it almost never happens. I have been here 2 \nyears, and I don't think I have ever seen anybody come to the floor and \nspeak in a filibuster as I am doing today. I think it is important, \nthough, and I think the issue rises to such an occasion. There are a \nlot of things we disagree on, Republicans and Democrats. I think there \nare a lot of things we could actually pass up here, a lot of things we \ncould actually agree to we could pass if we get together, try to do \nsmaller bills, work on what we agreed and get away from some of the \nempty partisanship.\n  The reason I came to the floor today to do this is because I think \ncertain things rise above party politics. Certain things rise above \npartisanship.\n  I think you are right to be secure in your person, the right to be \nsecure in your liberty, the right to be tried by a jury of your peers. \nThese are things that are so important and rise to such a level we \nshouldn't give up on them easily. I don't see this battle as a partisan \nbattle at all. I don't see this as Republicans versus Democrats. I \nwould be here if there were a Republican President doing this.\n  Really, the great irony of this is President Obama's position on this \nis an extension of George Bush's opinion. It basically is a \ncontinuation and an expansion of George Bush's opinion. George Bush was \na President who believed in very expansive powers, some would say \nunlimited. He was accused of running an imperial Presidency. The irony \nis this President we have currently was elected in opposition to that. \nThis President was one elected who, when he was in this body, was often \nvery vocal at saying the President's powers were limited.\n  When I first came here, one of the first votes I was able to receive \nwas a vote on whether we should go to war without congressional \napproval. The interesting part is that the war was beginning in Libya. \nIt turned out to be a small war, but small wars sometimes lead to big \nwars. In fact, that was one of Eisenhower's admonitions, to beware of \nsmall wars, that you may find yourself in a big war. Fortunately, the \nLibya war didn't turn out to be a big war, although I think it is still \na huge mess and it is still yet to be determined whether Libya will \ndescend into the chaos of radical Islam. I think there is a chance they \nmay still descend into that chaos.\n\n  But when the question came up about going to war in Libya, there was \nthe question of, well, doesn't the Constitution say you have to declare \nwar? And so we looked back through some of the President's writings as \na candidate, and one of the President's writings I found very \ninstructive and I was quite proud of him for having said it. The \nPresident said that no President shall unilaterally go to war without \nthe authority of Congress unless there is an imminent threat to the \ncountry. I guess we should be a little wary of his ``unless'' now, \nsince we know imminent doesn't have to be immediate and imminent no \nlonger means what humans once thought imminent meant. But Candidate \nObama did say that the President doesn't go to war by himself.\n  I think it would be fair to say that Candidate Obama also felt the \nPresident didn't have the authority to imprison you indefinitely \nwithout a trial. And I think it is also safe to say that Barack Obama \nof 2007 would be right down here with me arguing against this drone \nstrike program if he were in the Senate. It amazes and disappoints me \nhow much he has actually changed from what he once stood for.\n  But I forced a vote on his words. I took his exact words. We quoted \nhim and put those words up on a standard next to me, and we voted on a \nsense-of-the-Senate that said: No President shall go to war without the \nauthority of Congress--which basically just restates the Constitution. \nNow, you would think that would be a pretty easy vote for people. I \nthink I got less than 20 votes. That is the sad state of affairs we are \nin. There were some who actually probably believed that but refused to \nvote for it because they said: Well, he is a Republican, and I won't \nvote with a Republican. But I honestly tell you, were the shoe on the \nother foot, were there a Republican President here and I a Republican \nSenator, I would have exactly the same opinion. My opinion today on \ndrone strikes would be exactly the same opinion under George Bush. And \nI was critical of George Bush as well. Were there a Republican \nPresident now, I would have the same instinct and the same resolution \nto carry this forward. And on the issue of war, it is the same no \nmatter which President.\n  One of the complaints you hear a lot of times in the media is about \nthere being no bipartisanship in Congress. Well, the interesting thing \nis, actually, there is a lot of bipartisanship in Congress. If you look \nat people who don't really believe in much restraint of government as \nfar as civil liberties, it really is on both sides. So you will find \nthat often on these votes on whether the Constitution says we have to \ndeclare war in the Congress, Republicans and Democrats vote \noverwhelmingly against that.\n  Now, you need to realize the implications of that. What they are \nvoting for is to say we don't retain that power and we don't want it. \nThe Constitution gave it to us, but we are giving it back. And this has \nbeen going on for a long time, really, probably for over 100 years, \nstarting with Woodrow Wilson, who sort of grabbed for Presidential \npower, and Presidents have been getting more and more powerful for over \n100 years, Republican and Democratic.\n  There was at one time--point in time in our history a pride among the \nSenate and a pride among the Congress that said: These are our powers, \nand we are not giving them up. There were people on both sides of the \naisle who would stand firm and say: This is not a power I am willing to \nrelinquish; this is not something that is good for the country. And by \nrelinquishing the power of Congress, we relinquish something very \nfundamental to our Republic, which is the checks and balances that we \nshould have--checks and balances to prevent one body or one part of the \nthree parts of government from obtaining too much power. So there was a \ntime when we tried to keep that power.\n  Unfortunately, the bipartisanship we have now, many in the media fail \nto understand. They see us not getting along on taxes and on spending, \nbut they fail to understand that on something very important--on \nwhether an individual has a right to a trial by jury, whether an \nindividual has the right to not be detained indefinitely--there is \nquite a bit of bipartisanship, although usually in the wrong direction.\n  Now, I will say there is some evolution and some trend toward people \nbeing more respectful of this, and there has been some work on both \nsides of the aisle that has brought together some of us who believe in \ncivil liberties.\n  There was a bill last year called the national defense authorization \nbill. In that bill, there was a clause that said Americans can be \nindefinitely detained. What does that mean? Well, it means forever, \nbasically, or without a trial, no sort of sentence, no sort of \nadjudication of guilt or innocence, an American citizen can be held. So \nthere was another Republican Senator on the floor, and I asked the \nquestion: Does that mean an American could actually be sent to \nGuantanamo Bay from here, someone who is accused of something but never \ngets a trial? And his answer was yes. His answer was yes, if they are a \ndanger to the country.\n  The problem with that kind of thinking is, who gets to determine \nwhether you are a danger? Who gets to determine whether you are guilty \nor innocent? It sort of begs the question of what our court system is \nset up to do, which is to try to find guilt or innocence. Guilt or \ninnocence isn't always apparent, and sometimes an accusation is a false \naccusation. Sometimes accusations are made because people politically \ndon't like your point of view. So the question becomes, should we have \na process where we try to determine innocence or guilt?\n  So in the national defense authorization bill, there was an amendment \nthat said you can be indefinitely detained, an American could be sent \nto Guantanamo Bay, and we had a big fight over it. We lost the first \ntime around in 2012. We had an amendment that tried to protect American \ncitizens. This was a good example of bipartisanship on our side. We had \n45 votes, and I would say it was probably about 38 Democrats\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\nand about 7 Republicans. So that was an example of both sides kind of \nworking together. But we fought and we lost.\n  The next year, we came back and we fought for the same amendment \nagain and we beat them. Interestingly, we beat them. We had 67 votes to \nsay that you cannot detain an American. An American can't be sent to \nGuantanamo Bay without a trial, without an accusation, without a \njury, without the Bill of Rights. You can't do that to Americans. We \nwon the battle with 67 votes. So the bill passes, the House passes \ntheir version without our amendment in it, it goes to the conference \ncommittee, where they work out the differences, and they strip out our \nlanguage. So sometimes when you win around here, you lose.\n\n  But with the 67, there was a pretty good mix--maybe 35, 40 Democrats \nand 15, 20 Republicans. So there is some emerging consensus or some \nkind of emerging group. One of the other Senators has called it the \nchecks and balances caucus, and I think that is a very accurate term \nbecause that is part of what we are arguing for. We are arguing that no \none person should get too much power or no one body will get too much \npower.\n  Some people see all that fighting and disputing between the different \nbranches of government, and they see it in a bad light. They say: Oh, \nwith all that fighting and bickering, that is gridlock. But in some \nways, our Founding Fathers weren't too opposed to a little gridlock, \nparticularly if it were gridlock that said: You know what, we are not \ngoing to make it easy to get rid of the first amendment.\n  It is not easy to get a constitutional amendment in our country. We \nhave added some through the years, but it is not easy to do. We make it \nhard to amend the Constitution. In fact, we make it such that we are \nnot really a country that is majority rule. And I am sort of a stickler \nfor talking about the differences between a democracy and a republic. I \nthink some people are sloppy with their words and they love the idea \nthat America is a democracy. Woodrow Wilson said we were going to war \nin the world war to make the world safe for democracy. Well, No. 1, we \nare not a democracy, and we were never intended to be a democracy.\n  When Franklin came out of the Constitutional Convention, a woman went \nup to him and asked him: What will it be? Will it be a monarchy or a \ndemocracy? And he said: It is a republic. It is a constitutional \nrepublic, if you can keep it. He was already worrying about whether \ndemocratic action would lead to people straying away and giving a \ngovernment too many powers.\n  So we are a republic, and it is important to know the differences \nbetween a republic and a democracy, particularly with our history and \nour country. In our country, we had a period of time where majorities \npassed some very egregious and unfair and unjust laws. These were \ncalled the Jim Crow laws. They passed laws based on race or the color \nof your skin, and these were passed by majorities.\n  The important thing about the Constitution and about rights and one \nof the reasons I am here today talking about the fifth amendment and \nhow it gives you the right not to be committed to prison or be killed \nwithout due process is that our Founders thought it was very important, \nthis whole concept between a republic and a democracy, and also \nconsidering the idea that majority State legislatures were voting on \nthings such as the Jim Crow laws that would say that a White person \ncan't sell a house to a Black person or vice versa. Those laws were \npassed by majority rule.\n  So any time someone comes up to me and says they want a democracy, \nthis is my first question to them: You are OK with Jim Crow, then? \nBecause democracies did bad things. But if you believe that rights are \nprotected and that rights should be protected and that these individual \nrights are not something a democracy can overturn, then you do truly \nbelieve in a protection that is more important than any democratic \nrule.\n  There has been some dispute over this. There was a Supreme Court case \nby the name of Lochner back in 1905. The President doesn't like Lochner \nat all. He is very much opposed to it. But the one thing about Lochner \nI like is that Lochner really expands the 14th amendment. The 13th, \n14th, and 15th amendments were passed after the Civil War and usually \nover Democratic objection.\n  In my State, the Democrats ruled the State legislature in Kentucky \nfor many, many years, and they voted against the 13th amendment, the \n14th amendment, and the 15th amendment. The great champions of \nemancipation, of voting rights, of all of the postwar amendments were \nthe Republicans.\n  Every African American in the country was a Republican before 1930--\nvirtually every African American. In 1931, in Louisville, there were \n25,730 Black Republicans, and there were 129 Black Democrats. Every \nAfrican American was a Republican at one point in time.\n  I try to tell people, even though the numbers have been, \nunfortunately, reversed, we are the party that believes in the \nimmutability of rights. We don't believe that the democracy can take \naway your rights, that a majority rule can take away your first, your \nsecond, or your fourth amendment rights. And I think if we got that \nmessage out, we might change some of what is going on.\n  But the President is an opponent of the Lochner decision. In the \nLochner decision, a State legislature decides something, and it is not \nreally of importance what the decision is so much as that it is about \njudicial deference, about whether the courts should say: Well, the \nState legislature decided this, and majorities should get to rule.\n  Many believed as Oliver Wendell Holmes did, who was a dissenter in \nthe Lochner case. He basically said majorities should get to rule.\n  Herbert Croly, one of the founders of the New Republic, wrote that we \ncan get trapped up in all of this support for Bill of Rights and all \nthese ancient individual rights. If we get too carried away with this \nwhole idea of rights thing, we will have a monarchy of the law instead \nof a monarchy of the people.\n  It was for good reason that we established a republic and not a \ndemocracy. One of the best contrasts--it may not be a perfect contrast, \nbut I think it has some truth and validity--is that our Revolution \nworked. In our Revolution we established a constrained government. In \nFrance, the mob came into power. They had mob rule. The French \nRevolution was a disaster.\n  Now, we had some things going for us. We had a colonial government \nwith English common law and adjudication, and we had adopted practices. \nWe were Englishmen, and we believed in the rights of Englishmen. We had \nthat for several hundred years in our country, so it was easier for us \nto have a revolution. They didn't quite have that going on in France, \nso it was different.\n  But one of the differences I see between America and France is that \nwe established a republic, and we weren't going to have majority rule \nwhere the majority was setting up a guillotine. Ours wasn't perfect, \nobviously. The Founders left and allowed slavery to still occur. \nInterestingly, though, if you read the Constitution, I think they were \nembarrassed by it. The word ``slave'' doesn't occur in our \nConstitution. In fact, there were many abolitionist writers, one by the \nname of Lysander Spooner, who actually wrote about the \nunconstitutionality of slavery even before the war. And if you read the \nConstitution and acknowledge that there is no word in there for \n``slavery'' and nothing that says you have to be consigned to slavery--\nthere are things in there that say you can't be kept without being \npresented with charges. ``Habeas corpus'' means ``present the body.''\n  In the old days in England and in different monarchies, they just \nsnatched you up. If you were next in line to be King or you made them \nmad, they snatched you up and put you into the tower. So we came up \nwith the right of habeas corpus. You had to present the body and say: \nHe has been arrested, and these are the charges against him. We have \ngotten to where there is some concern in our country about that, but we \nhave had that right all along.\n  So Lysander Spooner wrote and said: Why shouldn't a slave come \nforward and say, this guy is keeping me; he is telling me I have to \nwork for him, but I haven't been charged with anything. What is my \ncrime?\n  Eventually, one court case did come forward, and it was ruled \nincorrectly. I am not sure exactly how the arguments were, but in Dred \nScott they ruled that you can't make the argument. I don't know if \nhabeas corpus\n\n[[Page S1161]]\n\nwas part of that case, but it should have been.\n  What I am trying to say, though, is that the rights of the \nConstitution--the rights of the individual that were enshrined in the \nConstitution--are important things that democracies can't overturn.\n  When you get to the Lochner case, which was in 1905, the majority \nruled five to four that the right to make a contract is part of your \ndue process. Someone can't deprive you of determining how long your \nworking hours are without due process. President Obama is a big \nopponent to this. But I would ask him--among the other things I am \nasking him today--to rethink the Lochner case because the Lochner case \nreally is what precedes and what the case Buchanan v. Warley is \npredicated on.\n  Buchanan v. Warley is a case from 1917--interestingly, it comes from \nmy State, Louisville, KY. There was a young African-American attorney \nby the name of William Warley. He was a Republican, like most African \nAmericans were in Louisville in those days. He was a founder of the \nNAACP and, like most founders of the NAACP, a Republican.\n  What they did in 1914 was they sued because the Kentucky \nLegislature--by a majority rule, by democratic action--passed a law \nthat said a White person couldn't sell to a Black person in a White \nsection of town or vice versa. This was the first case the NAACP \nbrought up.\n  Moorfield Storey was the first president of the NAACP, a famous \nattorney. He and an attorney by the name of Clayton Blakely went \nforward with this case, and they won the case. It actually passed \noverwhelmingly. But, interestingly, this case to end Jim Crow was based \non the Lochner decision. So those who don't like the Lochner decision, \nI would say go back. We need to reassess Lochner. In fact, there is a \ngood book by Bernstein from George Mason talking about rehabilitating \nLochner.\n  The thing is, with majority rule--if you say we are going to give \ndeference to majority rule or we are going to have judicial restraint \nand we are going to say that whatever the majority wants is fine, you \nset yourself up for a diminishment of rights.\n  I go back to the discussion of the Constitution limits power that is \ngiven to Congress, but it doesn't limit rights. The powers are \nenumerated; your rights are unenumerated. The powers given to the \ngovernment are few and defined; the freedoms left to you are many and \nundefined. And that is important.\n  What does this have to do with Lochner? The case in Lochner is \nwhether a majority rule--a State legislature--can take away your due \nprocess, your due process to contract. Can they take away your life and \nliberty without due process? And the Court ruled no. I think it is a \nwonderful decision. It expands the 14th amendment and says to the \npeople that you have unenumerated rights.\n  Now, there is some dissension on how we look at these cases. But when \nyou go forward to Buchanan v. Warley, the case about Jim Crow laws and \nhousing segregation, one of the people who was going to dissent--and I \nthink he thought better of it when he thought about that he would be \nthe first Justice in probably 70-some-odd years to say that he believed \nin the Jim Crow laws and was upholding the Jim Crow laws--was Oliver \nWendell Holmes. He actually writes an opinion that has been found but \nwas never presented to the Court, and he ended up voting to get rid of \nthe Jim Crow laws, but he actually wrote an opinion in favor because he \nbelieved so strongly in majority rule.\n\n  Some may think these are idle questions. I don't think it is an idle \nquestion whether or not you have a democracy or a republic. I think \nthese questions--from Lochner, from Buchanan v. Warley, all the way \nthrough to the present--are important.\n  In the last couple years, we had two cases on gun rights, the second \namendment, called Heller and McDonald. I think both of them can be seen \nas, once again, an expansion of the 14th amendment to say: Your \nprivileges and immunities which are part of the 14th amendment include \nthe second amendment, and they include certain rights. In fact, I think \nany power or any right not given up to the government or limited by the \nenumerated powers is yours. So when they say the privileges and \nimmunities of the 14th amendment, I believe that means everything else. \nWhat does that mean? It means I believe in a very circumscribed view \nfor the government.\n  One of the side benefits of having a circumscribed view of the \ngovernment would be that a government that is not allowed to do much \nwouldn't get in many problems. For example, if your government wasn't \nallowed to spend money it didn't have or if your government wasn't \nallowed to spend money on programs that were not enumerated as being \nwithin the purview of the Federal Government, you wouldn't have these \nmassive deficits. We would have never gotten in this fix if we believed \nin a republic and not a democracy.\n  Now, what proof do I have that the current officials believe in \ndemocracy versus republic? When ObamaCare came forward, the comments \nfrom then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi were: A majority passed \nthis. We passed this by majority. It is the law. Why would anybody \nquestion the constitutionality?\n  The President said the same thing. The President said: A majority \npassed this. What right has the court to overturn this?\n  The question has been written about by many brilliant scholars who \nhave looked at the Constitution and looked at what it means. Some of \nthis has to do with whether you presume liberty--and Randy Barnett has \nwritten about restoring the Constitution--whether you have a \npresumption of liberty or whether you have a presumption of \nconstitutionality. That may sound a little esoteric, but what does that \nmean? It is whether or not, when they pass a law up here, you just \npresume it is fine because it is the law and the judges should give \ndeference to it because it is a law.\n  It may sound confusing because you might think I am arguing for \njudicial activism. In a way, I kind of am because if the Congress \nusurps the Constitution, if the Congress takes away from your rights, \nthe judges should stop them in their tracks. I am not arguing for \ndeference to the legislature; I am arguing for deference to the \nConstitution.\n  I am also arguing that there is a presumption of liberty. This goes \nback to the way we want to look at the 14th amendment. The 14th \namendment says we have unenumerated rights. I guess, by extension, when \nyou go from the 14th amendment to the 9th and 10th amendments is the \nbest way to look at this.\n  The 14th amendment talks about privileges and immunities, and when \nyou look at what the 9th and 10th amendment do, they say those freedoms \nyou didn't relinquish or those powers you didn't give to the government \nare left to the States and the people respectively, and it says they \nare not to be disparaged. I always loved the way that was worded--not \nto be disparaged. Not only is the Federal Government not to trample on \nyour rights, they are not to be disparaged. But these rights are \nunlimited. They are yours. You got them from your Creator. These are \nnatural-born rights, and no democracy should be able to take these away \nfrom you.\n  Now, by changing the Constitution, they could literally take away \nyour freedom of speech or your freedom to practice your religion. I \ndon't think I will see that ever happen, and it is difficult to change \nour Constitution, but it is incredibly important that our Founding \nFathers put it in there and made it difficult.\n  I always kind of joke that if you go to a conservative meeting and \nyou talk about the second amendment, everybody pats you on the back and \nthey all love you--until you get to the fourth amendment. But if we are \ngoing to have the second amendment, I think you have to have the fourth \namendment--the right to be free in your person from unreasonable \nsearches and seizures, that a judge should have to have a warrant to \ncome in your house. How are your guns going to be protected if they can \ncome in your house without a warrant? You have to have the fourth \namendment.\n  But you also have to have the fifth amendment. We don't talk about \nthe fifth amendment very much. Everything is about the second \namendment.\n\n[[Page S1162]]\n\nIt has been all over the news. You can't turn on a channel without \nhearing about the second amendment. But I think today is as good a day \nas any to talk about the fifth amendment.\n  I have come here to filibuster the nomination of John Brennan because \nI think the fifth amendment is important. But I think we shouldn't be \ncavalier. I don't think we should be casual in our disregard for the \nConstitution.\n  I think that to allow the President to trample on and shred the \nConstitution and say that the fifth amendment no longer applies is a \ntravesty, and it is something we should not do lightly. So I think it \nis worth a discussion. So far, it is sort of a one-way discussion, but \nwe will see. But it is worth a discussion that we talk about the fifth \namendment. It says that no person shall be deprived of their life or \ntheir liberty. That is what it means. It is pretty clear, and it is \npretty plain. You can't take away someone's life and liberty without \ndue process or an indictment.\n  So it should trouble every American. I can't imagine that there \nwouldn't be an American in our country who would not be troubled that \nwe are talking about killing noncombatants in America with drone \nstrikes. We have to get the President to respond to this. I don't think \nit is good enough for the President to say: I haven't done it yet. I \ndon't intend to do it, but I might.\n\n  His oath of office says he will preserve, protect, and defend the \nConstitution. The oath of office doesn't say: Well, I intend to when it \nis convenient. I have never seen a President go out on the lawn with \nthe Chief Justice and say: I intend to follow the Constitution when it \nis convenient. Because what he says is he won't drop a Hellfire missile \non you unless it is infeasible to capture you. That is what they are \ndoing overseas. If that is going to be the standard for America, if you \nare not going to get a Hellfire missile dropped on you unless it is \ninfeasible--to me, that sounds like unless it is convenient; if it is \ninconvenient. ``Not feasible'' sounds like inconveniency is the \nstandard.\n  I asked Secretary Kerry about this in his nominating process. I said: \nCan you go to war without Congress approving of it, without a \ndeclaration of war, like the Constitution says? And he said: No. I \nintend to obey the Constitution--except for when I don't intend to obey \nthe Constitution. It is hard to get things through Congress, and it is \nCongress's fault. There are too many squabbles and so many fights. So \nmost of the time we will come to Congress and we will ask for a \ndeclaration of war--which, by the way, we have not done since World War \nI, and when we did, it was voted on nearly unanimously.\n  But this is the standard we get to: We don't intend to kill anyone \nand we don't intend to go to war without a declaration of war unless it \nis impractical to get your approval.\n  That was the point. If you do not get the point of the Constitution, \nif you don't get the point of what kind of system our government set \nup, what kind of system our Founders set up, it was to make it \nimpractical. It was to make it difficult to go to war. It was to make \nit difficult and make it important: There would be debate and checks \nand balances. If inconveniency is our standard for going to war without \nCongress, inconveniency is our standard for killing Americans on \nAmerican soil with drones, I think we have sunk to a new low. I just \ncannot imagine as a country that is the standard you want to have.\n  I want to reiterate. This doesn't have anything to do with the \nPresident being a Democrat. Whether he was a Democrat or Republican, I \ndon't question his motives. I met the President several times. I really \ndon't think he would do this. But the thing is, I am troubled by the \nfact he will not tell us he will not.\n  If he is a good man and we believe him to be a good man who would \nnever kill noncombatants in a cafe in Houston, sitting out in a \nsidewalk cafe smoking--oh, that's right, you are not allowed to smoke \ncigarettes anymore--let's say they are sitting out in a cafe. If the \nPresident is not going to kill them, why would he not say he is not \ngoing to kill them there? That is the troubling aspect of this, if the \nPresident will not acknowledge he is not going to kill noncombatants in \nAmerica.\n  The real problem with this is we are now engaged in a limitless war. \nA lot of Americans may not know this but people all the time up here \nare saying it. You have to read between the lines sometimes to hear \nwhat they are saying. They are saying there is no geographic limit to \nthe war. That is what Brennan has said. What does that mean? I thought \nwe went to war in Afghanistan. I really thought that even at the time. \nI was not here, but I would have voted to go to war. I thought they \nwere voting to go to war to get the people who attacked us on 9/11. I \nwas all for it. I still am all for that. But we are now using that \nresolution to go to war to have no geographic limit for drone strikes \nanywhere in the whole world; and not only no geographic limit, no \ntemporal limit, which means no timeline. There is no end to the war in \nAfghanistan. The war will never end.\n  If you have no geographic limit--many on my side say the battlefield \nis everywhere, and the battlefield is in the United States. It is one \nthing to say that, but realize what they mean by that. They say because \nthe battlefield is here, the laws of war apply. That is what a drone \nstrike is. A drone strike is not something you do domestically. They \nare saying the laws of war apply.\n  If you change the words around, what are the laws of war? Martial \nlaw. I think if you ask Americans are you in favor of martial law by \nthe President, I don't think many would be. But many in this body would \ngladly give up their power, would gladly say America is now the \nbattlefield so the laws of war should operate.\n  The laws of war are that there really is no due process in war. I am \nnot arguing for due process in war; I think it is, frankly, impossible. \nIf you have gone as an American to Afghanistan and you are fighting \nagainst us, you don't get due process. You don't get your Miranda \nrights. It is an impossibility to have the Constitution operating in a \nbattlefield. So I am not for that.\n  But I am against defining the battlefield as being everywhere, \nincluding my house, my office, including everywhere in America. If it \nis a battlefield, you have no rights. The war zone is a zone where you \ndo not get due process, you do not get Miranda rights, you do not get \nan attorney. But it should be different in our country. If our country \nis a battlefield, if our country is a war zone, what is left? I thought \nwe were fighting to preserve our way. I thought we were fighting to \npreserve and protect our Constitution. What are we fighting for if we \nare not going to protect our rights at home?\n  The Bill of Rights is too important to scrap it. The Bill of Rights \nis too important to let any President, Republican or Democrat, simply \ncome forward and say: Well, I have not broken the Constitution yet, and \nI do not intend to break the Constitution, but I might because they are \neverywhere and the battlefield is everywhere and we are so frightened \nthat we must do anything.\n  I think it is good to be angry, upset, really to want vengeance \nsometimes against people who attack you. I was all for punishing those \nwho attacked us after 9/11. But I think, also, at the same time we need \nto not let that get in the way of what is our way of life and what we \nare protecting here. When we look at this and we look at what is going \non with terrorism, we need to keep in perspective that these people can \ndo us harm, but they are incredibly weak people. They are incredibly \ncowardly, in a way. You know, they have no armies. They have the \nability to inflict terrorism, which is what weak people do. People who \nhave no armies and no strength attack the civilians. It is a weak and \ncowardly way to attack your enemies. But it is not something that we \nshould cower so much that we say: Gosh, someday they may come and blow \nup the Senate, which would be terrible.\n  I think the things terrorists do are terrible, but I am not saying \nthat because we are so frightened of them coming that we should say: \nWhy don't we just have camps again, you know? Why don't we just round \nup--the Japanese Americans were a threat in the war and we just rounded \nthem up and, guess what. No Japanese Americans attacked us, so it must \nhave worked. I think it was an abomination what we did, one of the \nworst and most tragic episodes in our history, and the fact that the \ncourts upheld it. But are we so frightened we are going to give up on\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\nour Bill of Rights? Are we so frightened the next thing we are going to \ndo is round up people of a different skin color because we think they \nhave cousins who live in Lebanon?\n  We cannot really give up on what makes America special. What makes \nAmerica special is the Bill of Rights. What makes us special is really \nthat we are not a democracy. There are a lot of democracies around the \nworld. We are a republic. We are a constitutional republic. We are a \ncountry that enshrined our rights, took care and deliberation and wrote \ndown our rights, and they are not supposed to be usurped by any \nmajority. So it is important that we know we are not a democracy, we \nare a constitutional republic. It is important for me to know and say \nthat my rights came from my Creator. You don't have to agree with me on \nthat. Some people think they came naturally to them, but they think \nthere is a natural state of being that is free.\n  We do give up some freedom. We give up some freedom to pay taxes. If \nI work, all of my labor is mine, and I give up some of my labor and \nsome of my wages to a government. To live in a civilized world you do \ngive up a little bit. But what I have always argued for is that we \nshould minimize what freedom we give up. That is why you should always \nminimize taxes. You should minimize the size of your government because \neverything you give up in taxes or everything you give up to your \ngovernment is loss of your sweat equity, your labor. It is yours. It is \nnobody else's. So you give up the very minimum of it.\n\n  There is another argument. That is sort of the freedom argument for \nwhy we should keep government minimized. The other argument for why we \nshould keep government minimized is more of an efficiency argument. \nThis comes from Milton Friedman, but I think he put it very succinctly. \nHe said nobody spends somebody else's money as wisely or as frugally as \nyou spend your own.\n  It is a simple statement, but I think in one statement, one simple \nsentence, it sort of brings forward something about government that is \nvery true. People up here just do not spend it wisely. The reason they \ndon't spend it wisely is because it is not theirs. In fact, they have a \nperverse and wrongheaded incentive that says: I need to spend all of my \nmoney or I won't get it next year, so government agencies incredibly \nwant to spend all the money and more to make sure there is nothing left \nat end of the year.\n  If you listen to some people, they would say: Oh, no, government is \njust here to help people. Without government it would be--without this \nmassive huge government--we have to have the debt because we need all \nthe things we get from government. Will Rogers once wrote and said: \n``You're lucky you don't get all the Government you are paying for.''\n  George Will recently wrote, and he sort of put a twist on it, and he \nsaid that used to be true, but now I think you are getting more \ngovernment than you pay for. That is sort of the truth. We get a ton of \ngovernment. Our taxes cover about 60 or 70 percent of what we spend up \nhere. What kind of country gets rich borrowing 30 cents on every \ndollar? What kind of family can spend 30 percent more than comes in?\n  Some things are pretty simple. Wealth accumulation for you or wealth \naccumulation for a country is by savings. You don't get wealthy by \nspending more money than comes in. So as we look to these things, I \nthink we need to be cognizant of the reasons we would want to have \nsmaller, not bigger, government. But we would have smaller government \nif we paid attention to the rules.\n  The rules are very important, and when people talk about ``oh, that \nwould be a monarchy of the law,'' or they say ``that would be too rigid \nto live under the laws, we need a living, breathing, evolving \nConstitution,'' I think things change over time. You get new \ntechnologies; drone strikes and things are new technologies. But I \nthink what does not change are certain freedoms that are going to be \nthe same now as they will be in 10,000 years.\n  I think the freedom for people to worship is something that I don't \nwant majority rule to decide. You say: What does the freedom to worship \nhave to do with drone strikes? It is hard to worship after a Hellfire \nmissile has been launched on you.\n  So all of our rights--there is a panoply of rights that are all \ninterconnected, and they come from the basic right to life. If you \ndon't have the right to be secure in your person, you don't have any \nother rights. So as we diminish one right we attack at the foundation. \nBut if we are at a foundation where we are saying we can strike a \nperson in America with no trial, with no accusation, I think we have \ncome a long way from where we began.\n  I worry about it. I worry about it not just in the abstract sense, \nnot just in the sense that these are a right in abstract and that we \nlose something we cannot actually touch or feel. I worry really about \nit in the sense that I don't know how you continue to exist as a \ncountry if you do not believe in some fundamental right, some \nfundamental right and wrong.\n  After ObamaCare passed and there were some questions about its \nconstitutionality, they asked a Representative from the House side--he \nwas asked: What about constitutionality? He said: Why would I care? \nMost of the things we do up here have no constitutional justification.\n  We have gotten to the point where people care more about having \nenough votes. They think it is right if you have a majority vote as \nopposed to that there are certain immutable rights and wrongs; that \nthere are certain immutable rights that were there at the founding of \nour country that will be there in 100 years or 1,000 years from now: \nYour right to be secure in your person, the right that the government \ncannot take away these privileges.\n  This is not a new fight. Really, from the beginning of time there has \nbeen a struggle with the people versus the leaders. The leaders always \nwant more. The amazing thing is it is sort of like a contagion. Not \nmany people get to be President in this country. One person gets to be. \nWe have had in the forties--44 or 45 Presidents. We have not had many \nPresidents. But there is something contagious about the office. It is \nthat power corrupts, I think.\n  Lord Acton said it is not just that power corrupts, but that absolute \npower corrupts absolutely.\n  I think people can become intoxicated with power. I don't know if \nthat is the explanation for President Obama's about-face. He was one \nwho at a time when he was in this body believed in some restraint, \nbelieved in Senate authority, believed in--actually he did not even \nbelieve in raising the debt ceiling when he was here. The thing is, \nwhat we would hope for is someday we have a President who believes, \neven after assuming office, that the powers of the office should be \nprotected. I think we run the risk, as we allow more and more power to \ngravitate to the President, we run the risk of living under an imperial \nPresidency.\n  I have said some inflammatory statements: that the President is \nacting like a king. Some of that is inflammatory and provocative, but \nsome of it has some ring of truth to it or I would not get so much \npush-back. Kings operate by edict. They say it is so; make it so. There \nis no give-and-take. There are no checks and balances between the \nlegislature and the Presidency.\n  This has been going on for a long time. It is a titanic struggle and, \nfrankly, I wish more people were interested in it. I wish we had a \ndozen people down here saying: No President should assume such \nauthority. No President has the right to say he is judge, jury, and \nexecutioner. No President should be allowed to say that.\n  It is not enough for him to say: My motives are good. I don't intend \nto do so. I haven't done so yet, but I might.\n  If that is the standard we are going to live under, we have a great \ndanger in our country. It is not enough. We live under the rule of law, \nand the law is quite explicit. The fifth amendment says no person shall \nbe detained without an indictment or without due process.\n  I find the answer to be incredibly easy. I have asked the President \nan easy question. My question is, Can you kill an American on American \nsoil, a noncombatant, with a drone strike? It should be an easy answer.\n  (Mr. HEINRICH assumed the chair.)\n  When a President will not answer a question or when they answer the \nquestion and it is an evasive answer, our\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\nconcern is if they answer yes. I thought they would never answer the \nquestion, but they finally did. They said: Yes, we can conceive of \nsituations when we might. The situations they conceive of, though, are \nattacks on the country, which I don't disagree with, so they are \ntalking about things that are not controversial.\n  If planes are attacking the Twin Towers, New York or DC, there is not \nany question on either side of the aisle among almost anybody in the \ncountry or the universe who doesn't believe we can repel lethal \nthreats. What we are talking about are the noncombatants who are either \neating dinner, sleeping in their house or walking down the street. A \nlarge percentage of the drone strikes have been people who were not \ncarrying arms or in combat.\n  Were they bad people? I am not positive I could say one way or the \nother, but I don't want that sort of standard to be used in America. I \ndon't want the standard to be that if someone is close to a bad person \nwho happens to be a male between the ages of 16 and 50, that they are \nno longer a civilian but actually a militant. Is that the standard we \nare going to use in America?\n  I don't want the standard to be sympathizing. Has anybody ever been \non the Internet? Has anyone ever seen crackpots who are on the Internet \nand say all kinds of crazy things? If someone is saying crazy things \nand they happen to be against our government, is that enough for a \nHellfire missile to come down on their house? Is sympathizing enough? \nPeople have written and talked about this. During the Vietnam war there \nwere some people who probably were treasonist and probably should have \nbeen tried for treason. Having said that, I would not kill them without \nsome sort of due process or trial. The idea of a right to trial by jury \nhas been the basis of our history for hundreds and hundreds of years. \nIt is the basis of a foundational principle for our country. I cannot \nimagine we would be so cavalier as to let it go.\n  As we move forward with this nominating process, I have decided to \noccupy as much time as I can on the floor to bring attention to this \nissue. Ultimately, I cannot win. There are not enough votes. There \nwould be if there was truly an uprising of bipartisan support that \nwould come to the floor and say: It is not about John Brennan. It is \nabout a constitutional principle and we are willing to delay this until \nthe President can explicitly say noncombatants in America will not be \nkilled with drone strikes. I think that is pretty easy to answer, but \nit has been like pulling teeth.\n  I have written letter after letter for weeks and weeks trying to get \nan answer on this and we have not had much luck. There have been people \nwho have written about the lawfulness of these lethal operations \ndirected against citizens, and there is a question both in the country \nand outside the country of what the standard will be. Will it be the \nsame standard? Some say there is no standard once we get outside the \ncountry and that anybody can be killed whether they are an American \ncitizen or not.\n  Frankly, I don't like the idea of no standard. For example, the most \nprominent American who was killed overseas was al-Awlaki. His name was \npublicly known to be on a kill list for months. I see no reason why he \ncould not have been tried in a Federal court expeditiously--if he \ndidn't return home, he would still be tried--given representation, and \ntried for treason. These are not frequent cases that occur overseas, so \nI see no reason why we would not use a Federal court. The Federal \ncourts are adapted in such a way that we can go into secret session if \nthere is classified material. The Federal courts in Washington, DC, \nPhiladelphia, and New York have done this on occasion. I think we could \ndo this in Federal court. We have convicted quite a few terrorists--I \nthink that they number up to several hundred--in the United States in \nour courts.\n  The main thing I object to is people becoming so fearful they \ncavalierly give up their rights. We had two terrorists in Bowling \nGreen, KY, my hometown, which has 50,000 people. Who would have thought \nwe would have two terrorists? They were conspiring to either buy or \nsend Stinger missiles to Iraq. I am glad they were caught and punished. \nThey were tried in a court.\n  Many people said let's just send them to Guantanamo Bay forever. Once \nwe go down that path where we are not going to have any due process--\nour courts have done a pretty good job. In fact, I think we have not \nlet off anybody from one of our courts that should have been kept here \nand tried.\n  I do have a question as to how the terrorists got into the country. \nThat goes back to the issue of not wanting terrorism to occur, but how \nshould we combat it? Is it best if we combat it in Yemen, Mali, \nSomalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan or should we combat terrorism by knowing \nwho is coming into and leaving our country?\n  For example, we have allowed 60,000 people from Iraq to come into \nthis country in the last 2 or 3 years. Frankly, I think that is a lot. \nThey come here under asylum. The problem with asylum is I thought \nasylum is when a county was escaping a dictatorship. We won the war in \nIraq. They have a democratic government over there, and I would not \nunderstand why they would want to leave a democratic government. Also, \nthe 60,000 who leave--other than maybe the two we captured in Bowling \nGreen, we presume that most of them are pro-Western--are the people we \nwant to run Iraq. There are all kinds of reasons to stay in Iraq to run \nthe country.\n  In letting so many people come in, we didn't do a very good job \nbecause the two terrorists who were allowed to go to Bowling Green had \ntheir fingerprints on an IED that was in a warehouse somewhere. They \ndid not find a match on any of the fragments with their fingerprints on \na database until after we caught them. Once we knew their names and had \ntheir fingerprints, we checked some fragments for their fingerprints \nthat had been in a warehouse for years and years. So we are not quite \ndoing the job.\n  Sometimes we want to analyze so much information that we get \noverwhelmed with the information too. We collect millions and millions \nand billions of pieces and bits of information, but it cannot all be \nanalyzed. Some of it, I fear, goes against our rights to privacy. Any \nof our e-mails that are over 6 months old can be looked at. We found \nout about this recently when we had an adulterous affair in our \nmilitary.\n  I believe our third-party records are ours. I had an amendment \nrecently on this, and I told people my Visa bill is pretty private. \nJust because I use my Visa card doesn't mean I have given up my \ninformation and that the government gets to look at my Visa bill every \nmonth, but that is what we have done. A lot of these things have been \nslipping away from us for a long time. It is not just President Obama; \nit is 40 or 50 years of court cases.\n  Thirty, forty or fifty years ago, we decided that once a third party \nhad your records, they were not private anymore. I think that is \nabsurd. Think of the age we live in and how a lot of people don't use \ncash at all. Our Visa cards have everything on it. We can look at a \nperson's Visa card and find out if they have seen a psychiatrist, what \nkind of medicines they are on, what kind of magazines they get, what \nkind of books they get. We can look at a person's Visa bill and find \nout if they gamble or drink or what their travel plans are. We can find \nout a ton of information on a person's Visa bill.\n  Should people be allowed to look at a Visa bill, without asking a \njudge, and then say: We think he is involved in this. We are not saying \nwe cannot do this for a terrorist, but what we should do is go to a \njudge and present some evidence and say we think he is a terrorist and \nwe want to look at his Visa bill. People in America should not be able \nto have their Visa bill open to scrutiny, and that is basically what we \nhave now. Our banking records, our Visa statements, and all our records \nthat are held by a third party are not protected.\n  Some people may have heard about how they want to have cyber \nsecurity. Everybody wants their computers to be secure, including the \ncomputer companies. They work nonstop trying to keep hackers out of \ncomputers, but the law they want to pass gives immunity to the computer \ncompanies. A lot of us don't think much of it. We check off the \nconfidentiality button and hope that after we have signed the contract, \nthey will not share it. They share it in a way that is anonymous, and \nwe put up with that in order to get a search engine. I am OK with that.\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\n  What I am concerned about is when we pass the cyber security bill, we \ncannot sue them if they breach the policy. So then everybody's \ncomputer, searches, and reading habits are open to the Federal \nGovernment. Because we are fearful of people coming at us and fearful \nof attacks, we give up our rights. I thought we were fighting to \npreserve our rights.\n  So what are we fighting for? These battles are going on and on \nthroughout the government. The interesting thing about these battles is \nthat they are not always Republican v. Democrat. These are battles that \nare sometimes coalitions of people from the right and people from the \nleft who have gotten together and fought over these issues.\n  In the case of trying to get the President to acknowledge he will not \ndo drone strikes, there have been people on the Democratic side of the \naisle who have aligned with me and helped me get this information. The \nPresident probably would have refused until Hell froze over to give me \nanything, but the fact is we had Democrats ask to get information also. \nSuddenly we were able to get a coalition and get the information, but \nit has not been easy. The fact that they don't want to acknowledge \nlimitations as to the President's power worries me that they believe in \nan expansive Presidential power. In order to stop that, we have to be \nprotective of our rights. We have to be able to not so easily give up \non our rights.\n  There is a white paper that was written, and the title of it is ``The \nlawfulness of a lethal operation directed against a U.S. Citizen who is \nan operational leader of al-Qaida, foreign associated forces,'' and \nthis is from the Department of Justice. This white paper sets forth a \nlegal framework for considering the circumstances for which the U.S. \nGovernment could use lethal force. One of the things they do in the \ndocument--this was leaked repeatedly--is they tell of the criteria for \nwhen they can kill people overseas.\n  We don't know the criteria for killing people in this country. They \nmake a contention that the rules will be different, but no one is \nacknowledging exactly whom they can kill or what the rules will be. For \nthe people who are killed overseas by drone strikes, the thing they \ncome up with is that they say it has to be an imminent threat, but it \ndoes not have to be immediate.\n  To my thinking, only a bunch of government lawyers could come up with \na definition for imminent threat that says it is not immediate, so that \nis the first problem with it. Is that going to be the standard that is \nused in America, that there has to be an imminent threat, but it \ndoesn't have to be immediate?\n  My next question is: What does that mean? Does that mean \nnoncombatants who we think might someday be combatants are an imminent \nthreat? It is a pretty important question. What is imminent. There is \nno question of what imminent lethal force is. If someone is aiming a \ngun, a missile or a bomb at you, there is an imminent threat, and no \none questions that. No one questions using lethal force to stop any \nkind of imminent attack. We become a little bit worried when the \nPresident says imminent doesn't have to mean immediate. When that \nhappens--and then we see from the unclassified portion of the drone \nattacks overseas--many of these people are not involved in combat. They \nmight someday be involved in combat, they might have been involved in \ncombat, but when we kill them, most of them are not involved in combat. \nSo even overseas there is some question of this program, but my \nquestions are primarily directed toward what we do in this country.\n  It says the U.S. Government can use lethal force in a foreign country \noutside the area of active hostilities. That is, once again, the point. \nWe are not talking about a battlefield. But because the battlefield has \nno limits--since the battlefield is not just Afghanistan. The \nbattlefield has no geographic limits so the battlefield is the whole \nworld, and many in this body say the battlefield is the United States. \nSo once we acknowledge and admit that the battlefield is the United \nStates, this whole idea of what is imminent versus what is immediate \nbecomes pretty important because we are talking about our neighbors \nnow.\n  The other thing about this is we need to try to understand who these \nterrorists are. Members of al-Qaida. There are no people walking around \nwith a card that says ``al-Qaida'' on it. There are bad people. There \nwere bad people associated with the terrorists--and we have killed a \nlot of them--who were in Afghanistan training and part of the group \nthat attacked us. But there are terrorists all over the world who are \nunhappy with their own local governments--some of them are unhappy with \nus too--but to call them al-Qaida is sometimes a stretch and sometimes \nopen to debate as to who is and who isn't.\n  Then they use other words, and words are important. They are either a \n``member of al-Qaida'' or ``associated forces.'' I don't know what that \nmeans. Does one have to talk to al-Qaida or commit terrorism or does a \nperson have to be in a country where we are supporting the government \nand people are attacking the government? It is not always clear.\n  The other question we get to when it is either al-Qaida or people \nassociated with al-Qaida is that now we get to the United States and we \nhave the government defining what they say as terrorism. So the \ngovernment has put out some documents, one by the Bureau of Justice, to \nwarn us of who might be a terrorist. In fact, the government has \nprograms where they want people to inform: If you see someone, tell \nsomeone. If you see these people, you are supposed to inform on them. \nSo some of the characteristics of the people who might be terrorists--\nand I don't know, they don't have to be an imminent threat or an \nimmediate threat, but some of these people might be terrorists. I don't \nknow. If the President is going to kill these people, he needs to let \nthem know. Some of the people who might be terrorists might be missing \nfingers. Some people may have stains on their clothing or some people \nmay have changed the color of their hair, some people may have \naccumulated guns, some people may have accumulated weatherized \nammunitions, which might be half the hunters in the South this time of \nyear, or people who might like to pay in cash, or people who have seven \ndays of food on hand. I know people who just for religious reasons are \ntaught to keep food on hand. In fact, government Web sites sometimes \ntell us to keep food on hand for hurricanes. If you live along the \ncoast, one government Web site says keep food on hand, and another one \nsays if you do, you might be a terrorist. They are not saying you are, \nbut if these are the characteristics of terrorism, would you not be a \nlittle concerned that if the government is putting this list out, we \nare going to drop Hellfire missiles from drones on people in America \nwho might be on this list? I am particularly concerned about that.\n  So I think we can't be sloppy about this. We can't allow ourselves to \nbe so I guess afraid of terrorism or afraid of our enemies that we give \nup on what makes us Americans. What makes us Americans are our \nconstitutional rights that are enshrined in our Constitution. It is why \nwe have gone to war, to defend these rights. Will we think the war \nstill has purpose if we are no longer able to enjoy these rights at \nhome?\n  The problem as I see it as we go forward is that I wish I could tell \npeople there is an end to this, that there would be a grand battle for \nour constitutional rights or for what rights we lose overseas, what \nrights we lose here if we travel. The problem is they don't see an end \nto the war. They see perpetual war, perpetual war without geographic \nlimits, and they see the battlefield here, so they want the laws of war \nto apply not only there but here. In other words, what they are saying \nis the laws of war are martial law. These are the laws of war. These \nare the laws that are accepted in war.\n  We accept a lot of things on the battlefield that we don't want to \naccept here. I acknowledge we accept that we don't get Miranda rights \non the battlefield. We don't get due process. We don't get an attorney. \nIf they are shooting at us, we shoot back and kill them. But the thing \nis if a person is sitting in a cafe in Houston, they do get Miranda \nrights, they do get accused of a crime, they do get a jury of their \npeers. That is what we are talking about here. The President should \nunequivocally come forward and state that noncombatants--people not \ninvolved with lethal force--will not have drones dropped on them.\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n\n  The other thing he should acknowledge is the law--not only the \nconstitutional law but the law since the Civil War--has said the \nmilitary doesn't operate in the United States. There is a reason for \nthe military not operating in the United States. Why? The military \noperates under different rules of engagement than policemen. The rules \nare stricter for policemen. We do it because we are not in a war here \nso the policemen have to call judges. A lot of people don't think this \nthrough, though, and they will say, These people are terrible, awful \npeople who would cut your head off. They are right; they really are bad \npeople. We have really bad people in our country too sometimes. We have \nmurderers and rapists. But tonight at 4 a.m. if there is a rapist going \naround the neighborhood and you get to a house and there isn't an \nimminent thing going on but you are told he might be in this house, \nbefore the door is broken down, they call on a cell phone, they get a \njudge out of bed, and they say, we have chased him into this \nneighborhood, no one is answering, we want to break the door down, can \nwe have a warrant. Most of the time the police have to call for a \nwarrant. We have a process. But when he is arrested, they don't just \nstring him up. We don't have lynchings in our country. We don't let \nmobs decide who is guilty and who is not.\n  I don't question the President's motives. I don't think the President \nwould purposefully take innocent people and kill them. I really don't \nthink he would drop a Hellfire missile on a cafe or a restaurant as I \nhave been talking about. But it bothers me that he won't say he won't. \nIt also bothers me that when he was a Senator in this body and when he \nwas a candidate, he had a much higher belief and standard for civil \nliberties and he seems to have lost that since he has been the \nPresident.\n  I think this is an important issue. It goes beyond John Brennan. It \ngoes beyond the President. It goes to an issue that rises above I think \nall other issues we consider here. I have voted for three of the \nPresident's nominees, not because I agreed with them politically; in \nfact, I disagreed with the vast majority, but I disagree with the \nPresident on a lot of political issues. I voted for his nominations \nbecause I think the President does get some prerogative in deciding who \nhis political appointees are. I have chosen to make a stand on this one \nand not so much because of the person but the principle of this. I have \nnothing personally against Brennan. I have nothing personally against \nthe President. But I have a great deal of concern about the rights that \nwere enshrined in the Constitution. I have a great deal of concern \nabout this slippery slope of saying there won't be accusations, there \nwon't be trials, that we will summarily execute people, and the \nquestion is, will we execute noncombatants. If he is not going to, he \nought to say so.\n\n  In this white paper that was released, they talked about the three \ndifferent conditions. One of them was imminence, but then they \nqualified it by saying imminent doesn't have to be immediate. Another \none was feasibility. They said it is not feasible to get some of these \npeople overseas and so we kill them. But feasibility, to a certain \nextent, could be defined as convenience. So the question is, in \nAmerica, what if they live up in the Rocky Mountains and there are no \nroads leading up to where they are; they are not very accessible; it is \nnot very feasible; so we are going to do strikes based on convenience. \nIs that going to be the standard?\n  When we talk about standards, they say they have a process in place, \nbut the process is very important. The standard is important, but it is \nalso important that one group of people, one political group of people \nor one politician doesn't get to decide that standard. And part of the \nway the process in our country works is that there are checks and \nbalances between the three branches of government so that one branch of \ngovernment doesn't get to unilaterally decide what these standards are. \nBecause some of the standards are a little bit loose--whether you are \nnear someone. Apparently, we are not counting civilians who are killed \nby drone strikes if they are males between the ages of 16 and 50. If \nthey were close to the people we are targeting, we just count them as \nother militants. Are we going to do that in the United States?\n  If you are eating with 15 of your family members and one of them may \nor may not be communicating by e-mail with somebody in a Middle Eastern \ncountry, can we kill all 20 of them, and because some of them are \nwithin the right age group, that is fine? Let's say you are eating with \nyour cousin who is communicating with somebody in the Middle East and \nthat person may or may not be a bad person, and then when you leave--\nlet's say you are going to a wedding and you are going from a preparty \nand there are 20 cars all going to the wedding and they know or they \nthink they know there may be a bad person among the group; why don't we \njust strike the caravan? These are called signature strikes. The Wall \nStreet Journal said that the bulk of our drone strikes overseas are \nsignature strikes. That is a good question for the President: Are \nsignature strikes going to be the standard for killing Americans in \nAmerica?\n  The President simply says the rules will probably be different for \ninside than outside. Well, I frankly don't think that is good enough. \nHe says he has no intent to kill Americans in America. I frankly don't \nthink that is good enough. I don't think it is good enough for the \nPresident to say I have no intention of breaching the fifth amendment. \nIntending not to is not the same as saying I won't. His oath of office \nsays I will not--no, it says: I will protect, defend, and preserve the \nConstitution. It doesn't say I intend to protect, defend, and preserve \nthe Constitution except for when it is infeasible or inconvenient. That \nis not what the rules are about. I think the rules are pretty absolute.\n  The rules are the Bill of Rights and they are ours. We got them from \nour Creator. They were enshrined in the Constitution. Nobody gets to \ntake them from us. Nobody. No President from any party gets to be \njudge, jury, and executioner.\n  This decision to let this go, to let this nomination go without an \nanswer is a big mistake for us. If we do this--if we let this \nnomination go without a debate, without significant opposition, without \ndemanding more answers from the President--the problem is we are never \ngetting any more answers. There will be some in this body who say, \nWell, just let it go. The snow is coming and we want to go home. The \nproblem is that he is never going to answer these questions unless he \nis forced to. I suspect George Bush would have been the same. I suspect \na lot of the Presidents would be the same. And I think it is \nunfortunate that they see their power and their sphere of power as \nbeing more important than our constitutional rights. But we won't get \nthis by just the glad hand and the winning smile. That is not going to \nget any information from the President.\n  The only way this President would ever give us information is if we \nwere to stop this nomination. I am not even saying stop it personally. \nMy objection really is not so much to Brennan being in charge of the \nCIA as my objection is to the program and to the President not \nadmitting that he can't do drone strikes in America.\n  I will continue to do what I can to draw attention to this and we \nwill see where things lead. But I am disappointed in the President. I \nam one who while I am a Republican--I didn't vote for him in 2008 or \n2012--I am one who has admired certain aspects of his policy. I admired \nhis defense of civil liberties. I admired him in 2007 when he said \nAmericans shouldn't be involved in torture. I admired him when he said \nwe should follow the rule of law and we should have warrants before we \ntap people's phones and that we shouldn't be trolling through people's \nrecords. But I find a great irony and, frankly, a great hypocrisy in \nsomeone who would defend getting warrants before we tap your phone but \nwon't defend a trial before we kill you. Tapping one's phone is a \nbreach of privacy and it should only be done if a person has been \naccused of a crime and evidence has been presented and a judge grants a \nwarrant. But killing someone with no due process, with no judicial \noversight--some are saying, Oh, we will get to it. We are eventually \ngoing to set up a court, maybe a FISA court. Unfortunately, a FISA \ncourt probably won't be good enough because it will be in secret and a \nperson should have a chance to confront their accusers and have a \npublic trial if a person is going to be killed.\n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\nTypically what I am talking about is American citizens, but there needs \nto be some oversight. But the problem of waiting to do this and saying, \nOh, we will do this sometime, we will get to it eventually, never \nhappens. The same way with saying, Oh, we will get to--we will keep \nasking the President for more information, but it never happens. If we \ndo not take a stand for something we believe in, it is going to slip \naway from us. I think our rights are gradually eroding. I think they \nare gradually slipping away from us. I think the understanding of the \nConstitution as a document that restrains the government, that \nrestrains the size and scope of the government, has been lost on a lot \nof people. I think it is something we shouldn't give up on.\n  When the President goes through his three different items that were \nleaked through this memo, he says there has to be an imminent threat. \nHe says their capture has to be inconvenient or infeasible. And he says \nthe operation of killing the person has to be conducted within a manner \nconsistent with the applicable law of war.\n  Here is the problem. That sounds fine if you are in Afghanistan and \nin the mountains fighting a war. But I am talking about downtown \nWashington, DC. I am talking about living in the suburbs of Houston or \nAtlanta. Are we going to have drone strike programs in America \nconsistent with the applicable law of war?\n  See, the other way to put ``law of war''--and this is not a stretch, \nthis is just turning the words around--``martial law.'' Now people, if \nyou put it that way, might have a little different impression. Do we \nwant martial law in our country?\n  If you go back to the battle we had over indefinite detention last \nyear, where they are saying they can take a citizen without a trial and \nactually send them from America to Guantanamo Bay if they are accused \nof terrorism--accused, not convicted; accused of terrorism--you start \nto worry about some of the stuff happening in our country, that this \ncould actually happen.\n  One of the sort of ironies of looking at different governments and \nlooking at what makes people unhappy--in Tahrir Square in Cairo, there \nhave been hundreds of thousands of people protesting. It is interesting \nwhat they are protesting. One of the large things they are protesting \nis something called an emergency decree, which I believe went in place \nby Mubarak 20-some-odd years ago. So you get leaders who come in, and \nthey use fear to accumulate power, and you get a decree. So you get \nmartial law. The martial law, ironically enough, in Egypt allows \ndetention without trial. They do have the right to trial, but there is \nan exception, and it has been accepted for the last 20-some-odd years, \nand the people are hopping mad over it. So we get involved in their \ncountry and their politics and give them money and weapons, and we have \nsome of the same debate and problems here at home--whether or not you \ncan indefinitely detain.\n  The President's response to this was also pretty disappointing. It \nwould not have become law without him. I think he threatened to veto \nit, and then he signed it anyway. Empty threats are of no value, and he \nstruck no great blow for America or for American freedoms by not \nvetoing this. But when he signed it, he said something similar to what \nhe is saying now. He said: Well, I have no intent to indefinitely \ndetain people.\n  Am I the only one in America who is a little bit underwhelmed by the \nPresident saying he has no intent to detain somebody but he is going to \nsign it into law saying he has the power to? That is the same thing we \nare getting now in this drone strike program: Don't worry. Everything \nis OK. I am your leader, and I would never detain you. I would never \nshoot Hellfire missiles at noncombatants. I will not do that.\n  I can take him at his word, but what about the next guy and the next \nguy? In 1923, when they destroyed the currency in Germany, they elected \nHitler. I am not saying anybody is Hitler, so do not misunderstand me. \nI am saying there is a danger, even in a democratic country, that \nsomeday you get a leader who comes in, in the middle of chaos, and \nsays: Those people did it. Those people are the mistake. Those people \nare who we need to root out.\n  If the laws have been removed that prevented that from happening, if \nthe laws have been removed and they say: We can indefinitely detain--in \nHitler's case, he said: The Jews, those bankers, the Jews did this to \nus. And they were indefinitely detained. Now, am I saying this is going \nto happen in our country? Unlikely. I cannot imagine any of our \nleaders, for all of our disagreements, doing that. But if you do not \nhave the law to protect you, you do not have that protection because \nyou do not know who the next guy is and the next guy or the next woman.\n  When Madison wrote about this, he was very explicit. He said: We have \nthese rules in place because we do not have a government of angels. If \nwe had a government of angels, we would not need these rules.\n  I will never forget the discussion with somebody about the Kelo case. \nThe Kelo case was a case where the government took private property and \ngave it to a richer person who had private property who wanted to \ndevelop it. Ironically, the justification they used was blight. So they \ntake it from one middle-class person and give it to a rich corporation, \nand they say they are doing that to rectify blight. But when they did \nthat and when they came down with the ruling, it was concerning the \nlogic of the way they get to this ruling, that basically they really do \nnot have this right to your property.\n  When the Kelo decision came down, it really bothered me. But I \nremember we started having the battle in our local government. In our \nlocal government, there was a battle over a resolution. The resolution \nsaid--it was in the city council--the resolution said the local city \ngovernment cannot take private land and give it to another person. It \nwas really like so many other things. The intention of eminent domain \nwas to have highways and thoroughfares that you might not get \notherwise, but it was never intended to take from a private owner and \ngive to a corporation. That is what they did with the Kelo decision.\n  So, anyway, local governments began talking about this, and I was \ntalking to one of my local government officials--this is probably 20 \nyears ago, 15 years ago--and their response was, but I would never do \nthat. I would never take private land through eminent domain and give \nit to another corporation. I would never do that.\n  And I believed that person. And I really, frankly, give the President \nthe benefit of the doubt. I do not question his motives. I do not think \nhe probably will kill noncombatants. But I certainly do not want him to \nclaim that he has the authority to kill noncombatants. So this is a big \ndeal. It is a huge deal.\n  So with the eminent domain, we finally passed it in our local \ncommission. It was like 3 to 2, but in my town in Kentucky, you cannot \ntake private property with eminent domain and give it to another \nprivate individual, because it is not about the individuals involved, \nit is about the fact that we do not always have angels running our \ngovernment. We do not always know whom we are going to get.\n  If we ask the question, Do you want a government that is run by \nmajority rule or a government that is restrained by its documents, it \nis a pretty important question. Ultimately, there are ramifications to \nmajority rule, to basically whatever the majority wants.\n\n  One, the majority can vote upon minority rules they do not pass on \nthemselves. In fact, Martin Luther King wrote--this is one of my \nfavorite quotes from him--he said: An unjust law is any law that a \nmajority passes on a minority but does not make binding on themselves. \nI thought it was a great statement because you could probably almost \napply that to any law written on any subject. If the law excludes \ncertain people and is not applied to everyone, then by definition it is \nan unjust law. What a great way to put it succinctly and a great way \nthat we should look as far as trying to write rules.\n  But you have to decide as a country whether you want majorities or \npoliticians to decide things or whether you want reliance on documents \nand on a process and on a rule of law that protects you.\n  If we rely on, basically, the whims of politicians, I think it is a \nbig mistake. If we are going to rely on the politician basically \nsitting in the Oval Office going through flashcards and a\n\n[[Page S1168]]\n\nPowerPoint presentation to make the decision on life and death for \nAmericans in America, I think it is a huge mistake.\n  Any people who watch trials and court cases realize that even courts \nare not perfect. It is actually amazing how we even get it wrong with \ncourts and trials and juries. Many States and even many people who were \nfor the death penalty have questioned their support of the death \npenalty because of the imperfection of our courts. Through DNA testing, \nwe have found we do not always get it right even with that. I think in \nIllinois they stopped the death penalty after having so many DNA \ntestings that showed there was an incorrect diagnosis of who had \ncommitted the crime.\n  So the question becomes, even with all the checks and balances of the \ncourt, are you worried at all about having one politician accuse, \nsecretly charge, I guess--if you can call it a charge--and then execute \nAmericans? I am incredibly troubled by that. I cannot imagine we as a \nfree country would let that stand. I think it is an insult to every \nsoldier in uniform fighting for American freedom around the world that \nwe would just give up on ours at home, that the President would \ncavalierly or incorrectly or without forethought, without sufficient \nforethought, not tell us, not go ahead and explicitly say: This will \nnever happen in America.\n  His answer to me should not have been, no, we will not kill \nnoncombatants. It should be, never--no, never. We will never in America \ncome to that. Under my watch, we will never, ever allow this to happen \nin America.\n  It is incredibly disappointing. It should be disappointing to all \nAmericans or anyone who believes in this. We have to realize that \ntrying to figure out guilt or innocence is very complicated. Anybody \nwho has ever served on a jury realizes how difficult it is to determine \nguilt. And sometimes you are unsure. Some cases are actually decided \nby, gosh, the evidence was so equal, but there was not a preponderance. \nI could not become completely convinced, and this person is going to be \nput to death?\n  Contrast the feeling a juror has and what a juror is trying to do in \nfinding innocence or guilt and letting someone be punished by death \nwith our current standard. Our current standard for killing someone \noverseas is that you can be sympathizing, you can be close to people \nwho we think are bad, you can be in a caravan that we say bears the \nsignature of bad people.\n  Now, there is another debate that can be had about whether those are \nsufficient standards for war. And the standards are different for war \nin our country. But we have to adamantly and unequivocally stand up and \nsay to those who would say this is a battlefield: The hell it is a \nbattlefield. This is our country. If you want to say this is a \nbattlefield--if you say we are going to have the laws of war here, we \nare going to have martial law here--by golly, let's have a debate about \nit. Let's have a discussion in the country. Let's have everybody \ntalking about, are we the battlefield? Is this a battlefield? Is our \ncountry a battlefield? Because what that means is that you get no due \nprocess in a battlefield.\n  I am not here to argue and say that you get due process in a \nbattlefield. I am here to argue that we cannot let America be a \nbattlefield because we cannot say that we are no longer going to have \ndue process, that we are no longer going to have trial by jury, that we \nare no longer going to have presentment of charges and grand juries. It \nis impossible in a battlefield. In Afghanistan, it is impossible to \nsay: Hey, wait a minute, can I read you your Miranda rights? It is \nimpossible. We are not arguing for that. We are not arguing for a judge \nor a jury or anything else. If people are shooting at our troops, they \ncan do everything possible, including drone strikes. It is not even the \ntechnology so much that I am opposed to, but the technology opens doors \nthat we need to be concerned with.\n  Defense of our soldiers in war--there is no due process involved with \nthat. But realize the danger to saying America is at war, America is \nthe battlefield, because also realize the danger that these people--\nthey are Republicans and Democrats--these people do not believe there \nis any limit to the war, there is no geographic limit, and there is no \ntemporal limit. It is a perpetual war. And many of them--if you prompt \nthem or provoke them--will open up and say: Oh, yes, America is a \nbattlefield. We need the laws of war. And you ask them: When is the war \ngoing to end, When will we win the war, they will admit it--some of \nthem will frankly admit it. They will say the war may go on for a long \ntime. Some have talked about a 100-year war, 100 years being in these \ncountries. But basically we are talking about perpetual war. We are \ntalking about a war with no geographic limit, no temporal limit, and a \nwar that has come to our country.\n\n  There will be bad people who come to our country whom we need to \nrepel. We are not talking about that. If planes are being flown into \nthe Twin Towers, we have the right to shoot them down with our \nmilitary. That is an act of war. No one questions that. If someone is \nstanding outside the Capitol with a grenade launcher, we have a lot of \nbrave Capitol policemen. I hope they kill the person immediately. \nLethal force to repel lethal force has never been questioned by anybody \nand is not even controversial.\n  But they want to make the debate about that and not about killing \nnoncombatants driving in their car down Constitution or sitting in a \ncafe on Massachusetts Avenue. There may be bad people who are driving \nin their car, and there may be bad people sitting in cafes around the \ncountry. If there are, accuse them of a crime, arrest them and try \nthem.\n  The battlefield coming to America or acknowledging that is an \nenormous mistake. So there are some big issues, some issues that we as \na country gloss over. We watch the nightly news. There is sometimes so \nmuch hysteria about so many issues, so many people yelling back and \nforth. But this is an issue that I think if we could get a frank \ndiscussion--I have proposed to the leadership--I have not had much luck \nwith this--but I proposed for a constitutional debate or a debate of \nimportance that everybody come, and instead of hearing me all day, we \ntake 2 or 3 minutes and we go around the room and everybody speaks, it \nis limited, but there is some kind of debate and discussion--less \nspeechmaking and more debate.\n\n  I proposed we have lunch together. I have asked to come to the \nDemocratic lunch. I have not gotten the invitation secured yet. It has \nonly been 2 years so it may happen, but there are many reasons for \ndiscussion. There are many reasons why we should have civility. There \nare reasons why people on both sides of the aisle can agree to this. If \nwe were to have a vote, maybe not on the nomination but a vote on \nrestricting drones--there is a bill out there that we are working on \nthat would restrict drones to imminent threats. It does not even get \ninto the distinction of the military--things in the country would be \nthe FBI; it would not be the military because that is the law. There is \nan important reason for the law.\n  But we have a bill we are going to come forward with that we are \nworking on that would simply say there has to be a real imminent lethal \nthreat, something we can see. Then I think people could agree to that \nbecause it is not so much the drone we object to. If some guy is \nrobbing a liquor store 2 blocks from here and the policemen come up and \nhe comes out brandishing a gun, he or she can be shot. Once again, they \ndo not get Miranda rights. They do not get a trial. They do not get \nanything. If you come out brandishing a weapon and people are \nthreatened by it, you can be shot.\n  So it is important to know what we are talking about. We are not \ntalking about the guy coming out of the liquor store with a weapon. \nEven a drone could kill him if the FBI had drones. So my objection to \ndrones is not so much the technology. There may be a use for law \nenforcement here, but there is also potential for abuses.\n  Many government agencies have drones. These hopefully will remain \nunarmed drones. This is a different subject. But it is a subject that \nsort of dovetails from this into the next subject, which is, should you \nhave protection from the government snooping--from the government \nlooking through your bedroom windows? I remember that issue when I read \n``1984'' when I was in high school. It bothered me, but I could not \nquite connect. I felt somewhat secure in the sense that we did\n\n[[Page S1169]]\n\nnot have two-way televisions. This was back in the 1970s. We did not \nhave the ability to look at people. The government could not look at me \nin my house 24 hours a day.\n  So you kind of get the feeling for how terrible it would be for that \nto happen. But technology was behind that. Actually ``1984'' was \nwritten, I think, in 1949. So talk about--he was truly being able to \nforesee the future. But now fast forward another 30 or 40 years and \nlook at the technology we have now. We have drones that are less than \nan ounce, presumably with cameras--it is hard for me to believe that--\nbut less than an ounce with a camera. It is not impossible to conceive \nthat you could have a drone fly outside your window and see what your \nreading material is.\n  It is not impossible to say they could not send drones up to your \nmailbox and read at least what kind of mail you are getting or where it \nis from. It is not inconceivable that drones could follow you around. \nWe had an important Supreme Court case last year, though, that was a \nblow for privacy. This was a Supreme Court case that had to do with GPS \ntagging. Everyone knows what GPS is. But what they were doing is the \npolice were shooting them to cars or tagging them when you were not \nwith your car and then following you around waiting for you to commit a \ncrime. If you tag everybody's car and wait for them to speed, we are \ngoing to have a big deal on fines. There is going to be a problem. \nThere is also a problem with following people around waiting for people \nto commit a crime. So the Supreme Court ruled, I think it was \nunanimously, that you have to have a warrant to do that.\n  The thing about surveillance is those of us who believe in privacy \nare not arguing against any surveillance. What we are arguing is that \nyou have to have a reason to do it and you have to ask a judge for \npermission. So it is not a society where there is no surveillance or a \nsociety where you have absolute privacy. If you commit a crime, the \npolice go to the judge and ask for permission to do this.\n  But there are some worrisome things about the direction of drones. \nFor example, the EPA now has drones. The EPA is flying drones over \nfarmland. I think some of this may be even in the defecation patterns \nof the cows. I do not know exactly what they are looking for because \nmanure in streams is said to be a pollutant and, actually, frankly, \nthousands of animals might.\n  But the whole idea, if you think someone is dumping anything in a \nstream--I am not opposed to having laws stopping that, get a warrant, \nsearch them or get a warrant and spy on them with a satellite or drone \nor whatever you want to do. But you have to have some kind of probable \ncause they are committing a crime. Because you can imagine that we \nwould devolve into a society where every aspect of our life would just \nbe open to the government to watch what we are doing.\n  They say there is something called an open spaces concept. They say: \nYou have 40 acres. The land is open so it is not private anymore. I \nthink that is absurd. I think that is sort of analogous to the whole \nbanking secrecy, such as you gave your records to your bank so you do \nnot care if anybody looks at them. That is absurd. I have a 40-acre \nfarm. I go hunting out there. I am supposed to not care if people watch \nme, everything I do once I am outside my house. My privacy is only in \nmy house and not in open spaces?\n  I disagree with that. One of the interesting things about the right \nto privacy, and you actually get some disagreement from people on the \nright about this. There was a case called the Griswold case. It had to \ndo with birth control. A lot of conservatives objected to it because \nthey saw it as a building block for Roe v. Wade. I am pro-life and did \nnot like the decision in Roe v. Wade, but I actually do not mind the \ndecision in Griswold so much. The reason is, going back to a little bit \nof the discussion we had earlier on Lochner, is that with Griswold, \nwhat I see is they talked about a right to privacy.\n  Some said--the conservatives who are worried about the judiciary \ncoming up with new things or creating things--they thought the right to \nprivacy was not in the Constitution so you do not have it. I think that \nis a mistake in notion. Because, for example, the right to private \nproperty, that is not in the Constitution either, but I do not think \nany of the Founding Fathers or most of us today would argue you do not \nhave a right to private property. In fact, I think it is one of the \nmost important parts. In fact, there was some debate about having it in \nthere. But I think the right to privacy, the right to private property, \nthey are part of what I would call the unenumerated rights. The \nunenumerated rights are basically everything else not given to the \ngovernment.\n\n  You gave the government--or we give the government, through the \ncompact of the Constitution, we give the government enumerated powers. \nThere are about 17 to 19, depending on how you count them. But as \nMadison said, they are ``few and defined.'' When you talk about the \nrights, though, the 9th and 10th amendment will say those rights not \nspecifically delegated to the Federal Government are left to the States \nand the people respectively. They are not to be disparaged.\n  So the interesting thing about your rights is there is not sort of a \nlist of your rights. In fact, when the Founding Fathers were putting \ntogether the Bill of Rights, one of the objections to the Bill of \nRights was they said if we put the Bill of Rights together, everybody \nwill think that is all of their rights. They will say, if it is not \nlisted, you do not get it.\n  So the 9th and 10th amendments were an important part of it. In fact, \nI do not know I would have voted for the Bill of Right's inclusion if \nyou did not have the 9th and 10th. I like all the others, of course. \nBut then the 9th and 10th protect all those not mentioned.\n  So it is an interesting thing that some on the right disagree. In \nfact, the majority does not like the Griswold decision. But I actually \nkind of like it because I think your right to privacy is yours, the \nsame as I think your right to private property is yours. It was not \ndelegated, it was not taken, it was not given to the Federal \nGovernment. It is yours.\n  It gets back to the sort of the primacy of liberty, the primacy of \nyour individual freedom that you did not get that, you were not given \nyour freedom by government. It was yours naturally or, as many of us \nbelieve, it is comes from your Creator. So your rights are national and \ninborn. They were enshrined in the Constitution, not given to you but \nenshrined and protected. As Patrick Henry said, it is not that the \nConstitution was instituted among men to protect the government, they \nwere to protect the people from the government.\n  It was to limit the size of government, to try to restrain the size \nof government, to try to allow for a government that lived under a rule \nof law. When Hayek said nothing distinguishes an arbitrary government \nfrom a constitutional government more clearly than this concept of the \nrule of law, the important thing about the rule of law is also that the \nrule of law is something that--it gives a certainty. Businessmen have \ntalked about certainty.\n  Without relinquishing the floor, I would like to hear a few comments \nfrom Senator Lee.\n  Mr. LEE. The issues we are discussing are of profound importance to \nthe American people for the reasons Senator Paul has identified. \nAmericans have every reason to be concerned anytime decisions are made \nby government that impair one of the fundamental God-given protected \nrights that Americans have.\n  Anytime the government wants to intrude upon life or liberty or \nproperty, it must do so in a way that comports with time-honored, \ncenturies-old understandings of due process. The rule of law, in other \nwords, must operate in order to protect those God-given interests to \nmake sure they are not arbitrarily, capriciously deprived of any \ncitizen.\n  We are talking about the sanctity of human life. When the interest at \nstake is not just liberty or property but life itself, we have to \nprotect it. We have to take steps to protect that. So I think it is \nimportant we carefully scrutinize and evaluate any government program \nthat has the potential to deprive any American citizen of his or her \nlife without due process of law.\n  I was concerned, as was Senator Paul, recently, when the Obama \nadministration leaked what was characterized as a Department of Justice \nwhite paper outlining the circumstances--outlining the legal criteria \nthat this administration would\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\nuse in deciding when and whether and under what circumstances to snuff \nout human life, the human life of an American citizen no less, using a \ndrone.\n  The memorandum started out with certain somewhat predictable or \nfamiliar concepts. The memorandum started out by explaining an imminent \nstandard, explaining that certainly could not happen absent an imminent \nthreat to American national security, an imminent threat to American \nlife, for example. When we think of imminence, we think of something \nthat is emergent, we think of an emergency, something that is going on \nat the moment, which unless interrupted presents some kind of a \ndangerous threat.\n  Significantly, however, this is not how the Department of Justice \nwhite paper actually read. Although it used the word ``imminence,'' it \ndefined imminence as something far different than we normally think of, \nthan we as American citizens use this kind of language, certainly in \nany legal or constitutional analytical context.\n  If I could read from that memorandum, I would point out this \ncondition of imminence is described as follows.\n  It says: The condition that an operational leader--an operational \nleader of a group presenting a threat to the United States--presented \nimminent threat of violent attack against the United States does not \nrequire the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack \non U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future.\n  Wouldn't it be the Senator's understanding if something is imminent, \nit would need to be something occurring immediately?\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes. I think there is really no question about using lethal \nforce against an imminent attack. I think that is why we need to make \nthe question we are asking the President very clearly. The question is \nif planes are attacking the World Trade Center, we do believe in an \nimminent response. We do believe in an imminent defense for that. The \nproblem is we are talking about noncombatants who might someday be \ninvolved. If they are in America, I see no reason why they shouldn't be \narrested.\n  Mr. LEE. If we are dealing with something that is imminent, we are \ntalking about something that is about to occur, and it is urgent. That \ntypically is the standard any time government officials in other \ncontexts, law enforcement, for example--sometimes regretfully and \ntragically, law enforcement officers need to make a spur-of-the-moment \njudgment call in order to protect human life. Sometimes in doing that \nthey have to do something they wouldn't ordinarily do. It always turns \non some kind of an imminent standard. It always turns on some kind of \nan emergent threat, something that is about to occur, that is occurring \nat the moment.\n  Yet we are told in black and white right here in this white paper \nthis condition, imminence, does not require the United States to have \nclear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests \nwill take place in the immediate future. That begs the question, what \nthen is the standard. Who then makes this determination? Presumably it \nis the President of the United States. Perhaps it is others reporting \nup in the chain of command to the President of the United States.\n  If actual imminence isn't required as part of this ostensibly \nimminent standard, what then is the standard? Is there any at all? If \nthere is a standard, is it so wide, is it so broad you could drive a \n747 right through it? If that is the case, how is that compatible with \ntime-honored notions of due process, those notions deeply embedded in \nour founding documents, those notions we understand come from God and \ncannot be revoked by any government?\n  I wish I could say the imminence standard problem in the Department \nof Justice white paper is the only problem. It is not. We look to the \nvery next page, the page dealing with feasibility of capture. One of \nthe other standards outlined in the Department of Justice white paper \noutlining the circumstances in which the government of the United \nStates may take a human life using a drone in a case involving a U.S. \ncitizen is that the capture must be infeasible, and the United States \nmust be continuing to monitor whether capture becomes feasible at some \npoint.\n  As to this standard on page 8 of the Department of Justice white \npaper, it says:\n\n       Second, regarding to the feasibility of capture, capture \n     would not be feasible if it could not be physically \n     effectuated during the relevant window of opportunity or if \n     the relevant country were to decline to consent to a capture \n     operation. Other factors such as undue risk to U.S. personnel \n     conducting a potential capture operation could also be \n     relevant. Feasibility would be a highly fact-specific and \n     potentially time-sensitive inquiry.\n\n  In other words, they are saying it has to be something that could not \nbe physically effectuated during the relevant window. What is the \nrelevant window? The white paper makes absolutely no effort whatsoever \nto define what the relevant window is. Who then makes this \ndetermination, and according to what factors is that determination \nmade?\n  Here yet again we have a standardless standard. We have a standard \nthat is so broad, so malleable, so easily subject to so many varying \ninterpretations, no one can reasonably look into this and decide who \nthe government may kill with a drone and who the government may not \nkill with a drone. That is a problem, and that, it seems to me, is \nfundamentally incompatible with time-honored notions of due process. \nWould the Senator not agree with that assessment?\n  Mr. PAUL. Absolutely. I think that is where the crux comes down to \nthis, talking about having an imminent standard. This is part of the \nproblem in the sense he doesn't want to talk about it. If we are going \nto do something so dramatic as to no longer have the fifth amendment \napply in the United States, to have no accusation, to have no arrest, \nno jury trials for folks who are to be killed in the United States, it \nis such a dramatic change that you would think we would want to have a \nfull airing of a debate on this.\n  Mr. LEE. Would the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?\n  Mr. PAUL. I won't yield the floor, but I will allow the Senator to \nmake comments.\n  Mr. LEE. If the Senator will yield for a question, I will ask if the \nSenator was aware of the exchange some members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee had with Attorney General Holder this morning on the subject.\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes.\n  Mr. LEE. Was the Senator aware of the fact some of us asked Attorney \nGeneral Holder for a more robust analysis than the series of memoranda \nauthored by the Office of Legal Counsel, the U.S. Department of \nJustice's chief advisory body, and the fact that so far the Department \nof Justice has declined to make those available to members of the \nJudiciary Committee?\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes, I am aware of that. I think we have a transcript of \nsome of the conversation from this morning.\n  Mr. LEE. If I may supplement that question by describing what I \nencountered in connection with that, I expressed frustration to the \nAttorney General over the fact that members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee--who have significant oversight responsibilities with regard \nto the operation of the U.S. Department of Justice--have not had access \nto that memorandum. This is part of our oversight responsibilities. \nThis is something we ought to be able to see, and so far it is not \nsomething we have been able to see. I encouraged the Attorney General \nto make available to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee those \nvery documents, which he claimed add some additional insight and would \ngive us some additional analysis above and beyond what this white paper \nis saying. I thought that might be relevant to the Senator in \naddressing my question.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Absolutely. At this point, I will entertain comments from \nSenator Cruz and a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Would the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?\n  Mr. PAUL. I will not yield the floor, but I will acknowledge a \nquestion to the Chair.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I wish to ask the Senator's reaction to the testimony \nAttorney General Eric Holder gave the Senator this morning in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. I wish to describe that testimony for the \nSenate and ask the Senator's reaction to that testimony.\n  I would begin by saying that Senator after Senator on the Judiciary \nCommittee invoked the leadership of the Senator from Kentucky on the \nissue of\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\ndrones and asked Attorney General Holder about the standards for drone \nstrikes in the United States. Indeed, although the Senator does not \nserve on the Judiciary Committee, it was as if he were serving in \nabsentia, because the Attorney General was forced over and over again \nto respond.\n  I would note the Senator's standing here today, like a modern ``Mr. \nSmith Goes to Washington,'' must surely be making Jimmy Stewart smile. \nMy only regret is there are not 99 of our colleagues here today \nstanding with the Senator in defense of the most fundamental principle \nin our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution; namely, each \nof us is endowed with certain unalienable rights by our Creator and \nthat first among them is life, the right to life, and the right not to \nhave life arbitrarily extinguished by our government without due \nprocess of law.\n  At the hearing this morning, Attorney General Holder was asked about \nthe letter he sent the Senator in which the Senator asked him whether \nthe U.S. Government could use a drone strike to kill a U.S. citizen on \nU.S. soil. As the Senator knows, Attorney General Holder responded in \nwriting he could imagine a circumstance where that would be \npermissible. The two examples he gave were: No. 1, Pearl Harbor; and \nNo. 2, the tragic attacks on this country on September 11, 2001. In the \ncourse of the hearing, Attorney General Holder was asked for more \nspecifics. In particular, both of those were military strikes on our \ncountry with imminent and, indeed, grievous loss of life that flowed \nfrom it. Few, if any, disagree that the U.S. Government may act swiftly \nto prevent a military attack which would mean immediate loss of life. \nThe question Attorney General Holder was asked three different times \nwas whether the U.S. Government could take a U.S. citizen, who was \nsuspected of being a terrorist, on U.S. soil, who was not engaged in \nany imminent threat to life or bodily harm, simply sitting at a cafe--\ncould the U.S. Government use a drone strike to kill that U.S. citizen \non U.S. soil.\n  Three times when asked that direct question, Attorney General Holder \nresponded that in his judgment that was not ``appropriate.''\n  The first question--and if I may, I wish to ask a series of \nquestions--does it surprise the Senator the Attorney General would \nspeak in vague, amorphous terms of appropriateness and prosecutorial \ndiscretion rather than the bright lines of what the Constitution \nprotects, namely, the right of every American to have our life \nprotected by the Constitution?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I am quite surprised, although I guess I \nshouldn't be, that we don't get direct responses. It is a pretty direct \nquestion. It is the question I have been asking all morning. It is the \nquestion I have been asking for a month and a half. I am talking about \nsituations where you have a noncombatant, someone not posing an \nimminent threat, who they think make may someday pose an imminent \nthreat because that is what we are doing overseas. If that is the \nstandard overseas, I am asking is that going to be the standard here? \nIt amazes me.\n  Part of the reason we are here today in the midst of a filibuster is \nbecause they won't answer the question directly. I applaud the attempts \nto try to get a more specific question. I am not terribly surprised we \nhave had trouble getting a direct answer.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Would the Senator yield for additional questions?\n  Mr. PAUL. As long as I do not yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRUZ. After three times declining to answer a direct question, \nwould killing a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil with a drone strike when that \nU.S. citizen did not present an imminent threat, would that be \nconstitutional--after three times of simply saying it would not be \nappropriate, finally, the fourth time Attorney General Holder responded \nto vigorous questioning--in particular during the course of the \nquestioning, the point was made that Attorney General Holder is not an \nadvice columnist giving advice on etiquette and appropriateness. The \nAttorney General is the chief legal officer of the United States. I \nwill note I observed it was more than a little astonishing the chief \nlegal officer of the United States could not give a simple one-word, \none-syllable, two-letter answer to the question: Does the Constitution \nallow the Federal Government to kill with a drone strike a U.S. citizen \non U.S. soil who is not posing an immediate threat? The proper answer I \nsuggested at that hearing should be no. That should be a very easy \nanswer for the Attorney General to give.\n  Finally, the fourth time around, Attorney General Holder stated: Let \nme be clear. Translate my appropriate to no. I thought I was saying no. \nAll right? No. Finally, after three times refusing to answer the \nquestion whether it would be constitutional to do so, the fourth time \nthe Attorney General answered.\n  The question I want to ask is the Senator's reaction to this \nexchange. In particular when Attorney General Holder on the fourth time \nfinally stated his opinion--and I assume the opinion of the Department \nof Justice--that it is unconstitutional for the Federal Government to \nkill a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil who does not pose an imminent threat, \nwhen he stated that, my response was I wish he had simply said so in \nhis letter to the Senator at the beginning. I wish John Brennan in his \nquestioning the Senator provided had said so in the beginning.\n  Indeed I then said: The Senator from Kentucky and I are going to \nintroduce legislation in this body to make clear that the U.S. \nGovernment may not kill a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil if that individual \ndoes not pose an imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm. I \nobserved that if the Attorney General's view was that it was \nunconstitutional for the U.S. Government to do so, then I assumed he \nwould be supporting that legislation. I would welcome the Senator's \nreaction to that exchange.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Well, Mr. President, the response is a little bit \ntroubling; that it took so much work and so much effort of cross-\nexamination to finally get an answer.\n  I will note, in his final answer, I don't ever see the words \n``constitutional'' or ``unconstitutional.'' He is responding to Senator \nCruz's word of ``constitutional'' when he says: Let it be clear and \ntranslate my ``appropriate'' to ``no.'' I thought I was saying no. All \nright. No.\n  Well, words do make a difference, and I would feel a little more \ncomfortable if we would get in writing a letter that says he doesn't \nbelieve killing people not actively engaged in combat with drones in \nAmerica, on American soil, is constitutional. That sure would have \nshort-circuited and saved quite a bit of time.\n  I will say, though, that I will believe a little more of the \nsincerity of the President and of the Attorney General if we get a \npublic endorsement of the bill that says drones can't be used except \nunder imminent threat, and define that as an imminent threat where you \nactually have a lethal attack underway. If we could get to that, I \nthink this is something that both parties ought to be able to unite by. \nIt is such a basic principle, I can't imagine we couldn't unite by \nthis. And it would have gone a long way to getting these answers.\n  But what still disappoints me about the whole thing is that it takes \nso much work to get people to say they are going to obey the law. It \ntakes so much work to get the administration to admit they will adhere \nto the Constitution. This should be a much simpler process.\n  I commend the Senator from Texas for not letting go and for trying to \nget this information. I would welcome any more comments that he has.\n  Mr. CRUZ. If the Senator would yield for one final question, is the \nSenator from Kentucky aware of any precedent whatsoever--any Supreme \nCourt case, any lower court case, the decision of any President of the \nUnited States, beginning with George Washington up to the present, the \nstated views of any Member of this Senate, beginning with the very \nfirst Congress up to the present--for the proposition that this \nadministration seems willing to embrace, or at least unwilling to \nrenounce explicitly and emphatically, that the Constitution somehow \npermits, or at least does not foreclose on, the U.S. Government killing \na U.S. citizen on U.S. soil who is not flying a plane into a building, \nwho is not robbing a bank, who is not pointing a bazooka at the \nPentagon, but who is simply sitting quietly at a cafe, peaceably \nenjoying breakfast?\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\n  Is the Senator from Kentucky aware of any precedent whatsoever for \nwhat I consider to be the remarkable proposition that the U.S. \nGovernment, without indicting him, without bringing him before a jury, \nwithout any due process whatsoever could simply send a drone to kill \nthat U.S. citizen on U.S. soil?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I am aware of no legal precedent for taking \nthe life of an American without the fifth amendment or due process. \nWhat is troubling, though, is that Attorney General Eric Holder is on \nrecord as actually arguing that the fifth amendment right to due \nprocess is to be determined and is to be applicable when determined \nsolely by the executive branch.\n  I would appreciate the comments and opinions of the Senator from \nTexas on the idea that the executive branch gets to determine when the \nBill of Rights applies.\n  Mr. CRUZ. If I may give my views on that question and then ask for \nthe Senator's response to my views on whether the executive may \ndetermine its own limitations, I would suggest the genesis of our \nconstitution is found in the notion that the President is not a king, \nthat we are not ruled by a monarchy, and that no man or woman is above \nthe law. Accordingly, no man or woman may determine the applicability \nof the law to himself or herself.\n  For that reason, the Framers of our Constitution won not one but two \nrevolutions. The first revolution they won was a bloody battle for our \nindependence from King George, and a great many of them gave the \nultimate sacrifice so that we might enjoy the freedom we do today. But \nthe far more important war they won was the war of ideas, where for \nmillennia men and women had been told that rights come from kings and \nqueens and are given by grace, to be taken away at the whim of the \nmonarch. What our Framers concluded, instead, is that our rights don't \ncome from any king or queen or president; they come from God Almighty, \nand sovereignty does not originate from the monarch or the president, \nit originates from we the people.\n  Accordingly, the Constitution served, as Thomas Jefferson put it, as \nchains to bind the mischief of government. And I would suggest that \nanytime power is arrogated in one place--in the Executive--that liberty \nis threatened. And that should be a view that receives support not just \nfrom Republicans, not just from Democrats or Independents or \nLibertarians, that should be a view that receives support from \neverybody; that none of us should want to live in a country where the \nPresident or the Executive asserts the authority to take the life of a \nU.S. citizen on U.S. soil without due process of law and absent any \nimminent threat of harm.\n  I would suggest the idea that we should simply trust the Attorney \nGeneral, trust the Director of the CIA, or trust the President to \nexercise an astonishing power to take the life of any U.S. citizen, in \nmy judgment, is fundamentally inconsistent with the Bill of Rights. And \nI would, therefore, ask the Senator from Kentucky for his reaction and \nwhether he shares my understanding that our rights are protected not at \nthe whim or grace of the Executive, but they are protected by the \nConstitution and, ultimately, they are rights that each of us was given \nby our Creator, and we are obliged to protect the natural rights to \nlife, liberty, and property that every man and woman in America enjoys?\n  Mr. PAUL. Well, Mr. President, this is what makes this debate so \nimportant. This debate is about the fundamental rights that we--most of \nus, or many of us--believe derive from our Creator and that it is \nimportant we not give up on these; that we not allow a majority vote or \none branch of government to say we have now decided you don't get all \nthese rights anymore.\n  Our Founders really wanted to make it difficult to change things, to \ntake away our rights. So this is an important battle and one in which I \nthink we should engage because the President needs to be more \nforthcoming. The President needs to let us know what his plans are, if \nhe is going to overrule the fifth amendment and if the Attorney General \nis going to decide when the fifth amendment applies. That is a pretty \nimportant distinction and change from the history of our country.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask for any comments, \nwithout yielding the floor, from the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. In response to Senator Paul's question, I would like to add \nto the Senator's remarks and those of the junior Senator from Texas the \nfact that in the concluding paragraph of the Department of Justice \nwhite paper on this issue, the Department concludes as follows:\n\n       In sum, an operation in the circumstances and under the \n     constraints described above would not result in a violation \n     of any due process rights.\n\n  It is a rather interesting conclusion, in light of the fact that two \nout of the three analytical points outlined above in the memorandum, in \nthe white paper are themselves so broad as to be arguably meaningless \nor, at a minimum, capable of being interpreted in such a way as to \nsubject American citizens to the arbitrary deprivation of their own \nright to live.\n  First, as I mentioned earlier, by proposing an imminent standard that \nleaves out anything imminent--in other words, it is not just peanut \nbutter without the jelly; it is peanut butter without the peanut \nbutter. There is no ``there'' there--they define out of existence the \nvery imminent standard they purport to create and follow. That is not \ndue process. It is the opposite of due process.\n  Secondly, they outline a set of circumstances in which this attack \nmay occur, where capture is infeasible, and then they define an \nunderstanding of feasibility that is so broad as to render it virtually \nmeaningless.\n  So at the conclusion of the memo--and the memo says:\n\n       In sum, an operation in the circumstances and under the \n     constraints described above would not result in a violation \n     of any due process rights.\n\n  It is describing constraints that are not really constraints, and \nthat is a problem. That amounts to a deprivation of due process.\n  In light of these circumstances, I think it really is imperative the \nAmerican people, or those who serve in this body--at a minimum, those \nwho serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee--be given an opportunity to \nreview the wholesale legal analyses identified by the Attorney General \ntoday that have been prepared by the Office of Legal Counsel of the \nDepartment of Justice. This is the chief advisory body within the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice. It is the job of the fine lawyers in the Office \nof Legal Counsel to render this advice, and we ought to have the \nbenefit of that. At a minimum, we ought to have the benefit of that \nwithin the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  So when I asked the Attorney General this morning whether he would \nmake those available, I was surprised and a little frustrated when he \ndeclined to offer them immediately. He said he would check in with \nthose he needed to consult with. I reminded him he is the Attorney \nGeneral, and he does, in fact, supervise those who work in the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  I hope that is satisfactory and in response to the Senator's \nquestion.\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes, I agree with the comments of the Senator from Utah.\n  The whole problem is that if the President says my plan has due \nprocess, that would be sort of like me saying I have passed my law, and \nI think it is constitutional. Well, the same branch of government \ndoesn't get to judge whether it is constitutional. That is the whole \nidea of the checks and balances.\n  We pass a law in the Senate and the Supreme Court can rule on whether \nit is constitutional. So the President gets to decide that he is going \nto abrogate the fifth amendment or abbreviate the fifth amendment or do \ncertain things, and then he says: Oh, I am really not because the way I \ninterpret it, I am applying the fifth amendment to my process.\n  Well, he can't do that. He can't be judge, jury, executioner, and \nSupreme Court all rolled into one. That is an arrogation of power we \ncannot allow.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to entertain comments or a \nquestion from the Senator from Kansas without yielding the floor, if I \nmay.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky, and I \nwould like to ask a series of questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n[[Page S1173]]\n\n  Mr. MORAN. First, let me outline a thought I had in listening to this \nconversation and ask the Senator a question about it.\n  We have seen the actions of our President to be determined \nunconstitutional in a recent case in the court of appeals in the \nDistrict of Columbia--a case in which the President made the \ndetermination he could determine the definition of a recess in the \nSenate--and so we now have a court that has declared the President's \nconclusion in that regard to be unconstitutional.\n  I don't know that we want to get into the magnitude or evaluating \nwhat constitutional violations are most damaging to the American people \nor to our rights and liberties, but I would ask the Senator to compare \nthe consequences of the President being wrong once again in regard to \nthe constitutionality of utilizing a drone strike to end the life of an \nAmerican citizen. Again, I am suggesting that we have seen precedent \nwhere the President acts unconstitutionally. Fortunately, the legal \nprocess is there to make certain a determination is made as to the \nconstitutionality of that act.\n  In this case, what would be the consequences of a drone strike as \ncompared to whether an appointment to an administrative body under the \nrecess clause is constitutional?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I think the analogy is apt. The difference \nis a recess appointment you get to make your appeal to a court while \nstill living, which makes a big difference. In the case of the recess \nappointments, the President decided he could determine when the \nlegislative branch was in session or out of session. So you have the \nsame sort of conflict again.\n  The President has a sphere and we have a sphere, but now he is saying \nhe controls our sphere also; that he can tell us when we are in session \nor out of session, and he can basically do what he wishes. The Supreme \nCourt rebuked him pretty sternly.\n  So I agree with the Senator from Kansas. There is a great deal of \nsimilarity between the two because it is, once again, the executive \nbranch or the President acting as if the checks and balances between \nthe Legislative and the executive branches don't exist; that he \nbasically made the decision for us that he has decided we are in \nrecess.\n  But the Senator is correct, the Supreme Court gave him a pretty stern \nrebuke and said that would be unconstitutional.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, to the Senator from Kentucky, what is the \nlogical extension of a decision that it is constitutional to utilize a \ndrone by our military to strike at the life of an American citizen in \nthe United States?\n  And I would say, if the Senator would agree with me, most Americans \nwould find it repulsive, unconstitutional, and a terrible violation of \npublic duty if a military officer on the streets of Wichita, KS, pulled \na gun and shot an American citizen.\n  Really, is that not the logical extension of the idea that a drone \nstrike from above results in the death of a U.S. citizen without due \nprocess? Is that any different than the ability to kill somebody in any \nother manner that I think most Americans would recognize today as \nprohibited without due process of law by our Constitution?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the analogy that the Senator from Kansas \nbrings up I think is appropriate.\n  We have had rules on the books since the Civil War saying the \nmilitary doesn't act in our country. So it is not just a drone; it is \nany sort of law enforcement in the United States. We recognize that.\n  We respect our soldiers. We are proud of our soldiers. But we have \nlimited their sphere to the sphere of war. Within the United States, \nfor our security we have the police and we have the FBI. It is because \nthe rules of engagement are different. It is different being a soldier. \nIt is a tough job being a soldier. But it is just not the same on the \nstreets of Wichita or the streets of Bowling Green, KY. So we have \ndifferent rules and we have made it different.\n  But the Senator is right. I think people would understand that it \nwould be wrong for a military officer to shoot someone on the streets \nin America. It is prohibited for a good reason; not because our \nsoldiers are bad people, but it is because there are different rules \nfor soldiers. That is what is most troubling about many of these people \nwho say, oh, Wichita is the battlefield. And if it is the battlefield, \nthey don't understand why the military can't act in Wichita or Houston \nor Bowling Green, KY. So it does delve into the problem that we have to \ndebate: Is there a limitation to where the battlefield is?\n  If the Senator has another question, I would yield for a question \nwithout yielding the floor.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I have an additional question, and I \nbelieve it is my final question.\n  I would ask the Senator from Kentucky, through the President--we are \nhere at this point in time in the juncture of the Senate with the issue \nof whether to confirm a particular individual to a particular office, \nan administrative appointment. I would ask the Senator if he doesn't \nbelieve the issue of the due process rights of American citizens is of \nsuch a magnitude that the real issue that ought to be before the Senate \nis not the confirmation of an individual, but we ought to resolve the \nissue of whether the Senate believes it is constitutional for the due \nprocess rights of an American citizen to be taken by a drone strike in \nthe United States, and the opportunity now presents itself that it \nwould be a reason not to grant cloture.\n  Let me ask it as a question. Would it not be a reason to grant \ncloture on this nomination until we resolve this issue?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I think it is very reasonable. It is more \nimportant than just the nomination of one individual.\n  When we are talking about whether the Bill of Rights is going to be \nchanged, when we are talking about whether you will have the due \nprocess to be tried in a court, or whether you could be killed--\nsummarily executed without a trial--that is an important change in the \nhistory of our country.\n  The Senator's response also made me think of something else. Another \nway to resolve this, where we could conclude this debate and get on to \nthe nomination, would be for the majority party to come forward with a \nresolution that says: You know what. We are not going to kill \nnoncombatants in America with drone strikes; we are not going to use \nthe military; we are going to reaffirm the law.\n  So there is a resolution that both parties could come forward--and it \nwould be a wonderful resolution to this process to say: The Senate goes \non record in a bipartisan fashion as saying we are not going to \noverturn the fifth amendment. If you are an American and you live in \nAmerica, you will not be killed without being accused of a crime, tried \nby a jury, and convicted by a jury. I think that would be a reasonable \nresolution to this, and I would entertain it if the other side were \ninterested.\n  Mr. MORAN. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for responding to my \nquestions.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, would the Senator from Kentucky yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, without relinquishing the floor, I yield to \nthe Senator from Texas for a question.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask the Senator his reaction as to the \npossible justification for the administration's repeated reluctance to \nanswer what should be a very straightforward question.\n\n  I find myself genuinely puzzled that both Mr. Brennan and Attorney \nGeneral Holder, when asked whether the U.S. Government may kill a U.S. \ncitizen on U.S. soil with a drone strike, absent an imminent threat of \nharm to life or grievous bodily injury--I find it quite puzzling that \nboth of them did not simply respond: Of course not. Of course we can't. \nWe never have in the history of this country, and we never will. The \nConstitution forbids it.\n  In my understanding of the Constitution, that was not a difficult \nquestion the Senator asked, and I find it quite remarkable that they \ntreated it as a difficult question.\n  To be clear, there is no dispute--at least no serious dispute--that \nif an individual poses an imminent threat of harm--if an individual is \nrobbing a bank, there is no dispute that law enforcement, a SWAT team, \ncan use deadly force to prevent the imminent threat to life or limb.\n  What this issue is about is an individual who is not posing an \nimminent threat--a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil--and\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\nthe administration's continued reluctance to say: The Constitution \nforbids killing that U.S. citizen without due process of law.\n  So what I want to ask the Senator about is efficacy.\n  Let's take a hypothetical individual whom the U.S. Government \nbelieves to be a terrorist, who is sitting at a cafe enjoying a cup of \ncoffee, not posing an imminent threat to anybody. The question I would \nlike to ask about efficacy--and if I might, I would like to ask a \ncouple of questions.\n  No. 1, if it turns out the intelligence is incorrect, that this \nindividual the U.S. Government suspects of being a terrorist is not in \nfact a terrorist, that they have the wrong guy; and if a drone strike \nis used and that individual is killed, is there an effective remedy to \ncorrect that tragic mistake?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I think the question is well put.\n  The first aspect of the question is, What is the President thinking? \nWhy would the President not respond to us? Why would the President not \nanswer a pretty easy question and say that noncombatants in the United \nStates will not be killed with drones?\n  I think the reason is complicated--and it is conjecture because I \ncan't get in his mind. But I would say it is sort of a contagion or an \ninfection that affects Republicans and Democrats when they get into the \nWhite House. They see the power the Presidency has. It is enormous. \nThey see themselves as good people, and they say: I can't give up any \npower because I am going to do good with that power.\n  The problem they don't see is that the power itself is intoxicating, \nand the power someday may be in the hands of someone else who is less \ninclined to use it in a good way. I think that is why the power grows \nand grows, because everybody believes themselves to be doing the right \nthing.\n  With regard to exactly what would happen in the situation when there \nis not an imminent threat, it boggles the mind when we can't answer \nthat question. And I don't have a good understanding as to why exactly \nwe can't get a response.\n  I would yield for a response from the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, if I could ask the second question, in the \ninstance where the intelligence was wrong and a U.S. citizen was killed \nby his or her government without due process of law, there obviously \nwould be no remedy. But I would ask about the alternate scenario.\n  If it were the case that this individual was in fact a terrorist, was \ninvolved in a plot to threaten the lives and threaten the safety of \nother Americans; if this U.S. citizen sitting in a cafe is killed with \na drone strike--focusing on efficacy--once he is killed, am I correct \nthat you can't interrogate him further; you can't find out who else was \nin the terrorist plot with him; you can't find out what methods he had \nput in place; you can't find out if there is an imminent threat planned \nthat he may know about? But if a drone from the sky simply kills him, \nthat knowledge perishes with him at that cafe and so undermines the \nlegitimate efforts of our government to protect the safety and security \nof all Americans.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I think it is an excellent question and \nreally gets to the root of the whole problem we are talking about \nbecause we are talking about people who may not all be good people. \nThey may be bad people and they may be plotting to do something bad to \nAmerica, and they may be in a cafe. So there may be all kinds of \nreasons to arrest and punish them, but there may be all kinds of \nreasons to try to get more information from them. Particularly if they \nare not involved in combat, it is hard to imagine why you would want to \nkill them. If they are not involved in combat, why not capture them and \ntry to get some useful information out of them?\n\n  So it is a little bit difficult to understand why the President \nwouldn't say what is obvious: Why would we want to kill noncombatants \nin America?\n  The reason we keep asking the question is, of the drone strikes \noverseas--which we are not privy to all of the details because some of \nit is classified. But the details that have been in the press are that \na lot of these people being killed overseas are not in combat.\n  So the real question is, If you are going to take this drone strike \noverseas and it has no geographic limitations, and you are bringing it \nhome to America, does the President not think it is incumbent upon him \nto say: Well, yes, we are bringing it home, but we are not going to \nkill noncombatants?\n  What an important question. I think the Senator has phrased it \nappropriately and I would anticipate or respect any other response he \nwould like to give.\n  Mr. CRUZ. One final question for the Senator from Kentucky.\n  I am aware the Senator from Kentucky is originally from the great \nState of Texas. As the Senator is no doubt aware, today is the 177th \nanniversary of the fall of the Alamo.\n  One hundred eighty-two men were stationed at the Alamo, and after 13 \ndays of a bitter siege, fighting an army of thousands, those patriots \ngave their lives for freedom. They put everything on the line to stand \nagainst tyranny and to stand for the fundamental right of every man and \nwoman to breathe freely, to control our own lives, our own autonomy, to \nmake decisions about what our future would be.\n  If I may presume to speak on behalf of 26 million Texans, I would say \nI have no doubt that Texans are proud to see the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky, as a native-born Texan, fighting so valiantly for \nliberty and serving as such a clarion voice for liberty at a time when \nsometimes liberty has few champions.\n  Indeed, I would suggest if those brave patriots of the Alamo were \nhere, William Barrett Travis and Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie and each \nof the others who gave their lives for freedom, they would be standing \nside by side with the Senator and would be proud to call him brother.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I would like to say that I appreciate the \nremarks of the Senator from Texas. If the filibuster goes on long \nenough, we would like to hear a recitation of William Barrett Travis's \nlast words at the Alamo. We had to memorize that as a kid, and I am \nafraid my memory has gone a little dusty. But the Senator is younger \nand may remember that for us.\n  The issue at hand is an issue that goes beyond party politics. It \ngoes beyond nominations. It goes beyond the President is a Democrat and \nI am a Republican. I voted for three of the President's nominations, \nmuch to the chagrin and much to the criticism of some on my side. But I \nhave done so because I think the President does have some \nprerogatives--that is just my personal viewpoint--on choosing \nappointees. This is a political appointee, but I do not consider this \ndebate to be about the appointee. I think this debate is more about a \nconstitutional issue, and I think it rises to a level above the \nindividual and it is something to which we need to draw attention and \nabout which we need to have a good healthy discussion in our country.\n\n  I don't think it has to be a bitter partisan battle. I have met the \nPresident personally. I have flown on Air Force One with him. I respect \nhim, I respect the office. I think he and I could have a reasonable \nconversation on this issue. In fact, I think if he were here today, he \nmight actually agree with much of what I am saying. What I am \ndisappointed in--and I do not know if it is the muddle of a large \ngovernment and not getting a message forward, but what I am \ndisappointed in is that it is so hard to get him to agree with what I \nthink he should already and probably already agrees with. But when we \nare talking about doing something so different, when we are talking \nabout changing the way we adjudicate guilt, changing the way we decide \nsomeone's life or death, it is too important to just say: Oh, Mr. \nPresident, go ahead and do it. As long as you tell me you have no \nintent of breaking the law or no intent to kill Americans, that is \nenough.\n  It just simply is not enough. It is not enough to say: I have not \ndone it yet. I do not intend to kill anybody, but I might.\n  He came up with some circumstances where he might use the drone \nstrikes in America. Then, in the cross-examination of Senator Cruz in \nthe committee, we have gotten him to admit--under duress, I think, but \nto admit that they are not talking about people in a cafe.\n  Some might say he has never mentioned people in a cafe. The reason it\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\ncomes up, of people not involved in combat, is that a lot of the people \nwho have been the victims or have been killed by these drone strikes \nwere not involved in combat when they were killed. They were riding in \ncars, walking down the street, traveling in caravans. I am not saying \nthey are good people. I am just saying, regarding the standard for whom \nwe kill overseas, we have to ask the question, and I don't think we are \ndoing our job if we do not ask the President: Are you going to use the \nsame criteria for how you kill people overseas? Is that the same \ncriteria over here?\n  And it should not be: I will tell you later. It shouldn't be, I don't \nintend to do it and I probably won't, but I might.\n  That is just not enough.\n  We are talking about basic protections that we fought our Revolution \nover and really, in a way, when I see the wars that we have gone to--\nand not every war has been perfectly justified or that we should have, \nbut when our soldiers fight, I see them fighting for the Bill of \nRights, and I think they say that too. No matter where they are around \nthe world, I see them fighting for the Bill of Rights and our \nConstitution. But if we are giving that up, if we are not going to \nadhere to the fifth amendment, it takes the wind out of the sails.\n  Can you imagine being a soldier in Afghanistan or Iraq or in far-\nflung places around the world and you are told you were fighting for \nthe Bill of Rights minus the fifth amendment? Or when we say we are \ngoing to indefinitely detain people, we are going to fight for the Bill \nof Rights minus the sixth amendment? It is pretty important. These \nthings are what we are fighting for, so we really should at least have \na robust debate over the magnitude of these changes, over how these \nwill be set up, over exactly what will happen, how this process is \ngoing to work. I am just saying that ``I am not intending to do so'' is \nnot enough.\n  Mr. President, I, without yielding the floor, would like to allow a \nquestion from the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. If the Senator from Kentucky would allow this question, I \nwould like to respond to his very gracious invitation and ask if the \nfollowing letter gives the Senator from Kentucky encouragement and \nsustenance as he stands and fights for liberty? This letter was written \nFebruary 24, 1836, and it begins as follows:\n\n       To the People of Texas and All Americans in the World:\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots;\n       I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under \n     Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual Bombardment and \n     cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man. The enemy has \n     demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison \n     are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken. I have \n     answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag still \n     waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or \n     retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of \n     patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to \n     come to our aid, with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving \n     reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or \n     four thousand in four or five days. If this call is \n     neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as \n     possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due \n     to his own honor & that of his country. Victory or Death.\n       William Barret Travis\n\n  My question is, Does that glorious letter give you encouragement and \nsustenance on this 177th anniversary of the Alamo?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I think what Travis's letter at the Alamo \ntalks about is that there are things bigger than the individual. At the \ntime he wrote that, I don't think they had much hope of surviving, and \nhe died at the Alamo, as well as other volunteers, some from my State \nof Kentucky. But there was an issue bigger to them at the time, that \nthey saw as bigger than the issue of the individual. I think that is \nwhat this debate is about.\n  This is not really about the person of John Brennan. This really is \nnot about the person of Barack Obama. This is about the body of the \nConstitution, it is about our respect for it, and it is about whether \nwe will hold these principles so dear and we will hold these principles \nso high that we are willing to try to enjoin a debate, to try to get \nboth sides to talk about this and to try to admit it, because we don't \nwant innocent people to be killed in America. We want to have the \nprocess that has protected our freedoms for a couple of hundred years \nnow to remain in place, and we are unwilling to diminish that simply \nbecause of fear.\n  FDR said, ``There is nothing to fear but fear itself.'' I think we \nshould also say that we should not let fear be so great that we allow \nthe loss of our freedoms. I think that is where we are, that sometimes \nterrorists are everywhere and they are trying to attack us, but we need \nto remember that it is our freedom that is precious, and we need to try \nto do everything we can to uphold that.\n\n  At this time, I would entertain a question, without yielding the \nfloor, from the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the issue of American security and American \nfreedom really does not get enough discussion here in the Senate. It is \nmy view that the Senator from Kentucky has made a number of important \npoints this day, and I would like to take a few minutes to lay out my \nviews on this issue and then pose a question to my colleague from \nKentucky. We have talked often about these issues. I always learn a \ngreat deal.\n  Of course the Senate will be voting on the nomination of John \nBrennan, the Deputy National Security Adviser, to be the Director of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency. I voted in favor of Mr. Brennan during \nTuesday's Intelligence Committee meeting, and I intend to vote for Mr. \nBrennan on the floor. Virtually every member of the Intelligence \nCommittee now, in my view, believes Mr. Brennan has substantial \nnational security expertise and experience, and it is certainly my hope \nthat he will be the principled and effective leader the CIA needs and \ndeserves.\n  I think Senator Paul and I agree that this nomination also provides a \nvery important opportunity for the U.S. Senate to consider the \ngovernment's rules and policies on the targeted killings of Americans, \nand that, of course, has been a central pillar of our Nation's \ncounterterror strategy.\n  For several years now, I and colleagues--Senator Paul as well--have \nbeen seeking to get more information about the executive branch's rules \nfor conducting targeted killings of Americans. I am pleased that after \nconsiderable efforts--efforts really that should not have to have been \ntaken to get documents that the Intelligence Committee has been \nentitled to for some time--the committee has now received those secret \nlegal opinions.\n  To be clear--and this is a point Senator Paul made in the course of \nthis discussion--targeted killings of enemy fighters, including \ntargeted killings that involve the use of drones, can be a legitimate \nwartime tactic. If an American citizen chooses to take up arms against \nthe United States, there will absolutely be circumstances in which the \nPresident has the authority to use lethal force against that American.\n  But I think it has been our view--a view that I hold and that I know \nSenator Paul holds--that the executive branch should not be allowed to \nconduct such a serious and far-reaching program by themselves without \nany scrutiny because that is not how American democracy works. That is \nnot what our system is about. Our unique form of government is based on \na system of checks and balances that will be here long after the \ncurrent President and individual Senators are gone.\n  From time to time, the Senator from Kentucky and I say we ought to \nhave something that we call a checks and balances caucus here in the \nSenate. Those checks and balances depend upon robust congressional \noversight, and frankly they depend on bringing the public into this \ndiscussion as well, that there be public oversight.\n  We share the view that details about individual operations do need to \nbe kept secret, but the Congress and the public need to know what the \nrules for targeted killings are so they can make sure, as the Senator \nhas touched on in the course of this day, that American security and \nAmerican values are both being protected. It is almost as if we have a \nconstitutional teeter-totter: we want both our security and our \nliberty. This is especially true when it comes to the rules for \nconducting targeted killings of Americans.\n  What it comes down to is every American has the right to know when \ntheir government believes it is allowed to kill them. Now the executive \nbranch has gradually provided Congress with much of its analyses on \nthis crucial topic, but I think more still needs to be\n\n[[Page S1176]]\n\ndone to ensure that we understand fully the implications of what these \nheretofore secret opinions contain and we have a chance to discuss them \nas well.\n  In his capacity as Deputy National Security Adviser, John Brennan has \nserved as the President's top counterterrorism adviser and one of the \nadministration's chief spokesmen regarding targeted killing and the use \nof drones. He would continue to play a decisive role in U.S. \ncounterterror effort if he is confirmed as Director of the CIA, and the \nIntelligence Committee is charged with conducting vigilant oversight of \nthese particular efforts.\n  A number of colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee of both \npolitical parties I think share a number of the views that Senator Paul \nand a number on this side of the aisle have been expressing today and \nin the past few days. I would especially like to express my \nappreciation to the former chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nSenator Rockefeller. There is no one more committed to the principles \nthe CIA stands for. There is no individual more committed to the \nprinciples the CIA stands for than Senator Rockefeller, and he believes \nmore needs to be done to ensure that Congress has the power to do \nresponsible oversight. Senator Udall, Senator Collins, and Senator \nHeinrich are all ones who share that view as well. In doing that, we \nrecognize that we have a responsibility and that ultimately it is up to \nAmerican voters to decide whether Congress is fulfilling its obligation \nto conduct vigorous oversight of the executive branch's actions and \nactivities.\n  Let me then turn to the question that has received most of the \nattention today and is really about what I would like to explore for a \nmoment or two with my colleague from Kentucky. The President has also \nsaid--I was encouraged by a number of his comments, including the State \nof the Union Address--that with respect to counterterrorism efforts, no \none should take his word for it that the administration is doing things \nthe right way. As part of that, he said he was going to engage the \nAmerican people in a discussion of these kinds of issues. When it comes \nto continuing the public debate about the rules for conducting targeted \nkillings, there are a number of questions which need to be explored. \nOne question I will address to Senator Paul involves the question he \nand I have been interested in for some time, and that is the question \nof the geographic limitation with respect to the use of lethal \nauthority.\n\n  Senator Paul and I--as well as others--have been asking for some \ntime: What are the limits with respect to these lethal authorities, and \nin particular whether they can be used inside the United States?\n  I have listened to a bit of the comments made by Senator Paul \nconcerning the confirmation hearing tomorrow. The point the Senator has \nmade this afternoon is an issue I and others have asked of the Attorney \nGeneral for some time, and we have not been able to get an answer.\n  In recent weeks Senator Paul has sent a number of letters on this \ntopic. He has received two responses and he has shared them with me. \nFor purposes of this question, I think the response from John Brennan--\nand he stated his view on this quite clearly--was quite constructive. \nHe said the CIA does not conduct lethal operations inside the United \nStates, and most importantly--as per the conversations the Senator from \nKentucky and I have had--Mr. Brennan said the CIA does not have the \nauthority to conduct those operations.\n  He was unequivocal with respect to what would happen if he was \nconfirmed as the head of the CIA, that he would not have the authority \nto conduct those operations. So for purposes of anybody who is kind of \nkeeping score, I just say that Mr. Brennan--on the questions the \nSenator from Kentucky and I have been interested in--was clear and \nforthright. I have been interested in this for some time. I am glad the \nSenator from Kentucky has asked the question. We have now gotten an \nanswer that is unequivocal from Mr. Brennan.\n  That brings us to the second response from Attorney General Holder. \nThis letter repeated the statement that the U.S. Government has not \ncarried out any drone strikes inside the United States and that the \nObama administration has no intention of doing so. It goes on to say \nthat the Obama administration ``rejects the use of military force where \nwell-established law enforcement authorities in this country provide \nthe best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat.'' I would \ncertainly agree with this position. It is clear to me that prosecutions \nin Federal court provide tough effective means for dealing with \nterrorist suspects, which is why there are a great many terrorists who \nare now sitting in American prisons today locked behind bars and \nexactly where they belong.\n  The Attorney General went on to state:\n\n       It is possible . . . to imagine an extraordinary \n     circumstance--Such as Pearl Harbor or the 9/11 attacks--in \n     which it would be necessary and appropriate under the \n     Constitution and . . . laws of the United States for the \n     President to authorize the military to use lethal force \n     within the territory of the United States.\n\n  This is what I wish to unpack a little bit with my colleague from \nKentucky after asking this question a number of times and thinking a \nlot about what the answer ought to be. On this particular issue it \nseems to me the Attorney General has certainly moved in the direction \nof what we wanted to hear. I want to kind of outline it, and I think we \nagree on most of it, but I want to have a chance to exchange some \nthoughts.\n  One of the core principles of American democracy is that we do not \nask our military to patrol our streets. It was important to me to hear \nthe Attorney General emphasize that principle. I know there are some \nwho believe the military ought to be given more domestic counterterror \nresponsibilities such as capturing and detaining terrorist suspects \ninside the country. I do not share that view, and I know the Senator \nfrom Kentucky does not share that view. I am grateful the Obama \nadministration has now said they don't share that view either. In fact, \nas I have talked about with a number of colleagues, I actually voted \nagainst the annual Defense authorization bill for the past 2 years \nbecause I was concerned that those two bills didn't adequately address \nthat particular principle.\n  The Attorney General suggested what I think we would all consider an \nunlikely scenario, the Pearl Harbor and 9/11 attacks, in which it would \nbe lawful and appropriate for the President to use military force \ninside the United States. As I read that statement--and this is the \npoint of my question to my friend from Kentucky--it sounds a lot like \nthe language that is in article 4 of the Constitution which directs the \nU.S. Government to protect individual States from invasion. In my \njudgment, if the United States is being attacked by a foreign power, \nsuch as the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the President can indeed have \nthe military power to use the military to defend our country.\n  The reason I have been asking this question and have been interested \nin exploring it with my colleague from Kentucky is that I think it is \nextremely important to establish that unless we have an extraordinary \nsituation, such as Pearl Harbor, the President should not go around \nordering the military to use lethal force inside the United States. Our \nmilitary--we are very proud of them--plays a vital role in efforts to \ncombat terrorism overseas, but here at home we rely on the FBI and \nother law enforcement agencies to track down the terrorists, and they \ndo their job well.\n\n  I thought it was helpful to see the Attorney General, as part of what \nhas been discussed here, clarify and establish that the President can \nonly use military force inside the United States in extraordinary \ncircumstances such as the Pearl Harbor attack. The Senator from \nKentucky and I have had discussions over this, and I thought about it \novernight and thought about our discussions. My sense is that the \nSenator from Kentucky doesn't believe the Attorney General's response \nwas clear enough. I very much respect his view on this point.\n  One of the reasons why I wanted to walk briefly through a little bit \nof history is that I think there are some issues still to be debated. \nMy colleague has certainly been correct in asking valid questions \nbecause the Attorney General has left open the possibility of using \nmilitary force inside the United\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\nStates outside of the extraordinary Pearl Harbor circumstance I have \nmentioned.\n  So, through the Chair, I ask the Senator: I think the Senator is \nraising some important questions. In fact, my friend has asked some of \nthe most important questions that we could be asking here on the floor \nof the Senate. It seems to me the Attorney General has ruled out using \nmilitary force inside the United States except in cases of an actual \nattack by a foreign power. I understand why my colleague from Kentucky \nwould say we ought to be engaging more with the administration and \nasking for additional insight. I want it understood that I have great \nrespect for his effort to ask these kinds of questions and force them \nto be debated on the floor. Senator Paul has certainly been digging \ninto these issues in great detail. Frankly, on the question of how we \nbalance American security and American liberty, we have worked together \noften, and we are certainly going to be working together in the future \non these issues in the days ahead.\n  I wish to allow the Senator from Kentucky to respond to my question. \nI ask that my friend recognize that while we might differ a bit on the \naspect of the Attorney General's response which I have cited this \nafternoon where there would be an instance of an extraordinary threat \nto our country, I do see--almost as part of what article 4 is about--\nthe President's ability to defend us in those kinds of situations. I \nknow my colleague from Kentucky may see it differently, and, frankly, \nhe is raising important issues. I am interested in his thoughts on that \nthis afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for coming \nto the floor and being a champion for the Bill of Rights. We get a lot \nof grief in Washington about a lack of civility--people yelling and \nscreaming at each other. In my dealings with Senator Wyden--who is on \nthe other side of the aisle--I think it is evident that people can be \nfrom different perspectives, find common ground, and try to get to a \npoint which is not a partisan point. I have tried to make it not so \nmuch about red as it is about principles. I voted for two or three of \nthe President's nominations, and I think he deserves some latitude with \nhis political nominees. I think the Senator from Oregon said it well \nwhen he said we have use of authorization of force in Afghanistan. Most \npeople think that was going toward Afghanistan. It has been so broadly \ninterpreted that it means worldwide war basically forever, and that is \nsort of why we get into some of these problems. Not only is it \nworldwide, which is a big debate in and of itself, worldwide means at \nhome too. The battlefield is here.\n\n  I agree with the Senator from Oregon that Brennan was very \nforthright. It was a little bit onerous getting the response, but once \nwe got the response, it was exactly what was appropriate. He said he \nwould obey the law, and the law was very clear: The CIA does not \noperate in the United States. The problem is not with his response but \nthat the Department of Defense is the one directing the drone programs \nand it doesn't answer the final question.\n  As far as Holder's response, if it would have been written as the \nSenator from Oregon states it, there probably wouldn't be much of a \nproblem. I think maybe recounting the letter gives it a little more \nstrength than the letter actually possesses in its own words. If he \nwere to say we were ruling out all strikes other than extraordinary \nstrikes, that would actually be a pretty good letter. Instead he says \nhe can imagine this under certain circumstances, and he lists a couple \nof circumstances. The interesting thing is that a lot of us agree that \nin a situation such as Pearl Harbor and 9/11--probably the Senator from \nOregon and probably me--we can repel a military attack. The reason we \nasked the next question, and the reason I am concerned about the next \nquestion--and I have only seen the unclassified version of these--but \nthe unclassified versions of the drone attacks indicate that a \nsignificant amount of them are not killing people with a weapon. People \nlike to talk about taking up arms. Well, a lot of people are not \ncarrying around arms. It doesn't make them good people, but they are \nnot carrying around arms. They are not actively shooting our soldiers \nor us. At the particular time they kill them, they look like \nnoncombatants. If we have somebody sitting in a cafe in our country--\neven if it is a bad person--most of us would probably rather arrest \nthat person. If they were arrested, one, they would get the due process \nof our country; and two, if they were bad people, we might actually get \ninformation from them. So I wish to see a little bit better wording.\n  The last thing I would say--and I would appreciate hearing the \nSenator's response--is the Attorney General was in the Judiciary \nCommittee this morning. He was asked a bunch of questions on this. I \nlooked through the transcript of a couple of them and it is still like \npulling teeth. He was asked four times: Do you think it is \nconstitutional to kill someone in a cafe in Seattle or Houston or \nLouisville? He kept saying it wasn't appropriate, but language is \nimportant when we are talking about this. Appropriate is not strong \nenough. It is sort of like the President is saying: I have no \nintention. We want him to say he won't, rather than not having \nintention.\n  He didn't quite put it together in his response, but in his \nresponse--combined with the questioning--we can get the opinion that \nmaybe he thinks it is not constitutional to kill noncombatants having \ndinner. Wouldn't it be easier if they just said that? At this point, I \nwould entertain a question without yielding the floor.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, just responding to the point of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky and noting the fact he would not be giving up the floor \nin the process, I think the Senator from Kentucky is making an \nimportant point, and the way I read it, it would focus on ensuring that \nour country would be protected against those kinds of exceptional \ncircumstances.\n  I would just like to leave the discussion here by noting that I think \nboth of us feel this is just the beginning of this debate. The nature \nof warfare has changed so dramatically--and I particularly appreciate \nthe chance to work on this in a bipartisan way--we are going to have to \nbe continually digging in and trying to excavate more information about \nhow all of this actually works without in any way jeopardizing sources \nand methods and ongoing operations. I think we can do it.\n  With respect to how I read particularly that part of the letter--and \nI thought a lot about it--I think the two of us and others can be part \nof what we can call the ``checks and balances caucus,'' so we can just \nmake sure people understand this is about liberty and security, and I \nthink we can flesh this out more in the days ahead. I know I have had \nfour sessions now with the classified documents that were made \navailable as a member of the Intelligence Committee and I still have a \nlot of questions. Some of those I think we will have to ask in a \nclassified way, but I think others of them we can ask in a public way, \nand the two of us can work on that together.\n  I also think there is a very strong case for beginning to declassify \nsome of the information with respect to these drone policies, and I \nthink that can be done as well, consistent with protecting our national \nsecurity.\n  So I think the Senator from Kentucky has made a number of important \npoints this afternoon. I thank him for the chance to work with him on \nthese issues and I look forward to continuing this discussion in the \ndays ahead and I appreciate the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, a lot of the process by which we are getting \nthis information wouldn't have happened without the Senator from Oregon \nas well as the senior Senator from Georgia both working together to get \ninformation. It is the way the system ought to be working. One of the \ngood things about the body is both Republicans and Democrats working \ntogether to get information from--not necessarily adversarial but in a \nway adversarial--another branch of government. We are a branch of \ngovernment, but it is not partisan against partisan, it is bipartisan \nworking for the power of the checks and balances to try to ensure a \nleveling. I thank the Senator from Oregon for helping to get the \ninformation to make this a much fuller debate.\n  Without yielding the floor, I will entertain a question from the \nSenator from Florida.\n\n[[Page S1178]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I thank my colleague for the opportunity. Let me begin \nby--I have been here a while. Let me give my colleague some free \nadvice: Keep some water nearby. It is handy. Trust me.\n  Anyway, I thank the Senator for entertaining my question. Let me just \nbegin by saying my question is about the motivation for being here on \nthe floor today. What brought me here is I have been reading some of \nthe accounts of what is going on and people are talking about the \ninvolvement of the Senator from Kentucky in a filibuster and some are \nalready characterizing it as another Republican filibuster of one of \nthe President's nominees. Just to be clear because, as I understand, \nthe only thing I have heard the Senator from Kentucky say leading up to \nnow about the primary issue in coming to the floor today is that the \nSenator from Kentucky asked a very straightforward question on an issue \nof constitutional importance. Yet he has not received a straightforward \nanswer. Not only has the Senator from Kentucky not received an answer, \nbut we saw testimony earlier this morning that, quite frankly--I \nwatched the video two or three times and I personally do not understand \nwhy it was so difficult to basically just say yes or no.\n  So I wish to start out by asking, just to be clear, the motivation to \nbe on the floor today is not to deny the President a vote on one of his \nnominees but the motivation is that the Senator from Kentucky has asked \nthis administration a very important and relevant question and has been \nunable to receive a straightforward answer to that question?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, my response to that is yes. In fact, I have \nactually voted for several of the President's nominations. My trying to \ndraw attention to this issue is because I believe it is an incredibly \nfundamental issue; that is, how we would kill people--Americans--on \nAmerican soil, whether the Constitution applies, whether the fifth \namendment applies.\n  So my motivation in doing this is not partisan. It is something that \nhas to do--and I have said, frankly--and I truly mean this--if it were \na Republican President today I would still be in the same place because \nthe American people deserve answers on this.\n  There are different rules in war than there are here. We need to \nacknowledge and separate ourselves and say we are not completely--we \nare not in the middle of a battle zone. We still do have Miranda rights \nand we still get an attorney in the United States. It is not the same \nas a battlefield, but if he is bringing battlefield strategy home, we \nneed to know before he starts doing it and at least we need to know the \nrules. Does the Constitution apply?\n  I would entertain a further question from the Senator from Florida \nwithout yielding the floor.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Without yielding the floor, the followup question I have--\nbecause I think this is actually a very useful exercise for the folks \nwho have been snowed in today and there is nothing better to watch than \nC-SPAN and for the people who are able to be here today to actually \nunderstand the structure of our government and how it was designed, \nbecause it is my personal opinion we have gotten away from some of \nthat.\n  Let me describe for a second my position that leads up to the \nquestion I am going to ask. I am actually a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, which means we reviewed this nomination. I have questions \nthat I care about that were somewhat different than the valid ones the \nSenator from Kentucky is raising. As a member of that committee, I \nasked those questions and I am going to seek answers to those \nquestions.\n  We have a job to do. I think that is important for people to \nunderstand. Members of the Senate have an important constitutional role \nto give advice and consent on these nominations. We have an obligation \nnot just to pass these folks through but to actually ask serious \nquestions to determine if they are qualified for the position they are \ngoing to hold. We want our Senators to be doing that in both parties, \nno matter who the President may be.\n  So I undertook that effort as far as the Intelligence Committee. I \nasked my questions. I got answers to my questions. I believe the \nnominee is qualified and I believe the President has a right to his \nnominees, even if they are not the people we would nominate. I believe \nultimately these nominees deserve a vote. That is why I voted yesterday \nto move this nomination on.\n\n  Just as the President has a right to his nominations and ultimately \nto have a vote on those nominations, so, too, do Members of the Senate \nhave a right to their role and, in particular, to ask relevant \nquestions on issues of important public policy and get answers from the \nadministration. This is not--I think sometimes this is being lost. We \nhave different branches of government, but they are coequal branches of \ngovernment. The Presidency, the executive branch, is it important? \nAbsolutely, it is important. It is the Commander in Chief. It is the \ntop single office in the Nation. But the legislative branch is a \ncoequal branch with a job just as important. In order to do that job, \nwe have to have access to information, the ability to ask relevant \nquestions, and to get straight answers. To be frank, sometimes I feel \nwhen we ask questions of this administration, they feel as though it is \nbeneath them to answer questions from us, from time to time. I think \nthat is very unfortunate.\n  My question is--when the Senator from Kentucky is here today raising \nthese issues, it is my opinion--and I would like to hear what the \nSenator has to say--this is more than just an issue of the \nconstitutionality of this particular program, it is a defense of this \ninstitution. It is a defense of the legislative branch. It is a defense \nof the Senate as an institution. Irrespective of how one feels about \nthe nomination or the program or where the Senator falls on this \nconstitutional issue, it is a defense of this institution, and it is a \nconstitutional--not a constitutional right, a constitutional obligation \nto ask relevant questions of public policy and to get answers, to ask \nquestions so the people back home will know the answers to these \nquestions. If we are not going to ask these questions, who is going to \nask them? The press? Maybe in a press conference, but that is not what \nthey are paid to do; that is what we are paid to do. That is what we \nwere elected to do.\n  So I would like to hear the Senator's views on that, because my \nbelief and what I am picking up from everything Senator Paul is saying, \nthe Senator is actually on the floor today standing for the obligation \nthis institution has to ask questions such as this and to be able to \nget straight answers to these questions.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Florida has it \nexactly right. This is about checks and balances, it is about the \ncoequal branches of government, and it is about how we limit usurpation \nof power by checking and balancing each of the different powers.\n  So when Montesquieu wrote that there can be no liberty when you \ncombine the executive and the legislative, they were separated for a \nreason. When the Constitution says Congress declares war not the \nPresident, it was separated for a reason. So when we look forward to \nthese things--and the Senator from Kansas brought this up earlier--when \nthe President says, I have the ability to determine when you are in \nsession or not and I can do recess appointments when I think you are \nout of session, that is a great usurpation of power to one branch and \nwe should fight it as an institution, Republican and Democrat, and not \nmake these partisan issues.\n  So I agree with the Senator from Florida. I believe there is a need \nfor those checks and balances. By the body not struggling to get as \nmuch information as they can--not even in this case as much about the \nindividual as about the policy--then I think it is a mistake for the \nbody not to. I agree with the Senator from Florida completely. It is \nsomething that should be defended. It is not something to be derided as \npartisan because I don't see it as partisan at all. I see it as a \ndefense of the separation of powers and of the checks and balances.\n  At this time I yield, without yielding the floor, for another \nquestion.\n  Mr. RUBIO. This will probably be my last question. Before I get to \nit, let me say that all the other Senators--I know some of my \ncolleagues have already come to the floor and some might be watching or \nsome might be nearby. I would just say this, to think about this\n\n[[Page S1179]]\n\nfor a moment. One may or may not agree with the position of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky on this issue. Maybe a Senator saw the Attorney General's \nanswer and saw his testimony this morning and that Senator is satisfied \nwith it. Maybe another Senator is not that concerned about this issue \nat all. I don't think that is the issue. I think what we need to \nremember is that all of us have something we care deeply about or \nmultiple things we care deeply about, and the day will come when \nsomething you care about or some issue you are involved in or some \nquestion you have, you will try to raise that question, and it may be \nunder a different administration. I think we have to remember the \nPresident will not be President forever. There will be a new President \nin 3\\1/2\\ years and after that and so forth and some folks may still be \nhere. At some point in the future, all of us will have questions we \nwant answered and we will have an administration or some other \norganization of government that refuses to give us straight answers. \nWhen that moment comes, you will want your colleagues to rally to your \nside, even if they don't agree with you, and defend your right as a \nrepresentative of the people of your State to ask important questions, \nparticularly questions of constitutional importance, and get straight \nanswers to those questions.\n  It is my feeling--and the Senator may comment on this--if he had just \ngotten a straight answer to that letter, if he had just gotten a \nstraight answer in the testimony today, this would not have been \nnecessary. If they would have taken in the question, which I think is a \npretty straightforward question, and answered it in a straightforward \nway, all of this could have been avoided and this nominee could have \nhad a vote. But, instead, they decided to go in a different direction \nand it baffles me.\n  Here is a question I have. I think this is important also for the \npeople watching back home. Often, they may say: Why do you have to do \nit this way? Why can't you just answer the question and not have to do \nthis process of starting and stopping things from moving forward? My \nview is--and I want to share it with the Senator and get his \nimpressions--twofold. No. 1, these are the tools that are at our \ndisposal. That is why the system was created and designed this way. One \nof the things the Senate has at its disposal to preserve and protect \nits prerogative to ask important questions are the rules we have set up \nhere. They don't protect just one Senator but every Senator here, even \nif I don't agree with others. One of the things that gives us the \nability to ask and have questions answered is this role we have of \nconfirming nominees.\n  Secondly, I would say this is not the Secretary of the Treasury, this \nis not some other unrelated Cabinet position, this is the Central \nIntelligence Agency, which is directly related to the program the \nSenator from Kentucky has relevant questions about. So I guess I wanted \nto hear from him a little bit more about why he chose this particular \nnomination and why and how it is relevant to the larger question he is \nasking.\n  Mr. PAUL. The answer to the question is that we have tried the normal \nchannels and have been for a month. We sent the standard letters. We \nsent three different letters to John Brennan and we didn't get any \nresponse. But when the leverage became used or the leverage became \napparent that both Republicans and Democrats on the Intelligence \nCommittee were asking for more answers, then we finally began to get \nanswers. The answers unfortunately didn't quite answer the question.\n  As the days wore on, we have actually gotten more answers. Since I \nhave been standing here this morning, we have now gotten the report of \nthe Attorney General's testimony before the Judiciary Committee. In \nthat, under withering cross-examination, I guess is the best way to put \nit, he finally owns up and says: Well, maybe somebody in a cafe, it \nwouldn't be appropriate to kill them in America.\n  The Senator from Texas wanted to go one step further. We don't want \nyou to say whether it is appropriate; we want you to say whether you \nthink you have the power to do it, whether you think you have the \nconstitutional authority to kill someone who is a noncombatant in a \nrestaurant or in their house or in their church or wherever. Do you \nthink you have the power to kill noncombatants? It is a pretty \nimportant question. I think we may have eked out some of the answer \nfrom Attorney General Holder.\n  It would be nice if we would actually get that in clean language, \nwhere the Attorney General would now say this is our policy. But, see, \nthis comes from allowing the executive branch so much power. If you \nallow them the power to make the rules, to make the decisions without \nany kind of oversight or scrutiny, the danger is that there will be no \nprocess. So the thing is right now we have a program going on where we \nkill people around the world with drone strikes, and there are criteria \nand standards for how we do it.\n  The obvious question is: You are going to do that in America? Under \nwhat standards? We have had at least allegations, we have had some who \nhave said the bulk of the drone strikes around the world have been \nsignature killings, which means the people are not identified who are \nbeing killed, that it is a long line of traffic and we blow up the line \nof traffic.\n  Now, we can debate whether in war we may have a looser criteria for \nwhom we are blowing up, but I would think that in America we would not \nblow up a caravan going from a wedding to a funeral, from a church to a \nhouse, from a political meeting back to their home. We would have \ndifferent rules in America. If you are accused of a crime, if they \nthink you are somehow a terrorist, then they would arrest you, \nparticularly if you are in a noncombat opportunity. Why in the world \nwould the President take the position that if you are eating in a \ncafeteria, you are eating at a restaurant, you are at home asleep, that \nyou could not be arrested?\n  So it is a real easy question, and the President should, very \nfrankly, answer the question: I will not kill noncombatants in America. \nI cannot imagine why the President cannot answer an easy question.\n  There have been people on both the right and the left who have been \nasking these questions. Glenn Greenwald writes a lot about this issue. \nThis is a pretty interesting proposition that he puts forward. He says:\n\n       If you posit that the entire world is a ``battlefield,'' \n     then you're authorizing him to do anywhere in the world what \n     he can do on a battlefield. . . .\n\n  That has been my point. If the United States is the battlefield, and \nwe are going to have the laws of war--or another way it can be put is \nmartial law--in America, if we are going to have that in America, you \nneed to know about it because martial law--living under martial law--is \nthe way they live in Egypt. That is why they just had a rebellion in \nEgypt and overthrew Mubarak. Because they had, by martial law, \nindefinite detention.\n  So those who say the battlefield is here, we need to live under the \nlaws of war in our country--and they tell you to shut up if you want an \nattorney--by golly, be careful about that. Be quite careful if you are \ngoing to let us go to that sense.\n  So Greenwald says:\n\n       If you posit that the entire world is a ``battlefield,'' \n     then you're authorizing him to do anywhere in the world what \n     he can do on a battlefield: kill, imprison, eavesdrop, \n     detain--all without limits or oversight or accountability. \n     That's why ``the-world-is-a-battlefield'' theory was so \n     radical and alarming (not to mention controversial). . . .\n\n  He also quotes from Esquire, from Charles Pierce, who said:\n\n       This is why the argument many liberals are making--that the \n     drone program is acceptable both morally and as a matter of \n     practical politics because of the faith you have in the guy \n     who happens to be presiding over it at the moment. . . .\n\n  So you will remember, many of these people did not like George Bush, \nand they railed and railed about wiretaps, and now they are \nsuspiciously quiet when we get to a killing program.\n  But he says: If you have so much confidence because you like the guy, \nthe President in charge of this--he says--that ``is criminally naive, \nintellectually empty, and as false as blue money to the future.''\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The powers we have allowed to leach away from their \n     constitutional points of origin into that office have created \n     in the presidency a foul strain of outlawry that (worse) is \n     now seen as the proper order of things.\n       If that is the case--\n\n  And the author says he believes it is--\n\n\n[[Page S1180]]\n\n\n       then the very nature of the presidency of the United States \n     at its core has become the vehicle for permanently unlawful \n     behavior.\n\n  This is coming from a liberal.\n\n       Every four years, we elect a new criminal because that's \n     become the precise job description.\n\n  So we have to ask some important questions. I am not asking any \nquestions about the President's motives. I do not question his motives. \nI, frankly, do not think he will be killing people in restaurants \ntonight or in their house tonight. But this is about the rule of law. \nIt is not so much about him. It is not so much about John Brennan. It \nis about having rules so that someday, if we do have the misfortune of \nelecting someone you do not trust--electing someone who might kill \ninnocent people or who might kill people whom they disagree with \npolitically or they might kill people whom they disagree with \nreligiously or might kill people of another ethnic group--we are \nprotected. That is what these protections are about. But they are not \nso much about the individuals involved now.\n  But there is a program that is going on around the world that is \nkilling individuals with drones, and it is done in a warlike fashion. \nThe thing is, in war you do not get due process. So these people around \nthe world do not get Miranda rights, and I am not arguing for that. If \nyou have a gun leveled at an American in Afghanistan, you are going to \nbe killed with no due process. I am not arguing for that. But I am \narguing it is different if you are in Afghanistan pointing a weapon at \nus or here pointing a weapon at us. It is different if you are eating \ndinner or if you are in your home at night.\n  So I think there are clear and distinct differences, and there is no \nexcuse for the President not giving us a clear-cut answer.\n  There is a writer by the name of Conor Friedersdorf who writes for \nThe Atlantic. I will get into that in just a minute.\n  At this time, I would like to, without yielding the floor, stop for a \nquestion from the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  First of all, let me say, I appreciate the Senator's passion. I \nappreciate the fact that, as he knows--and he and I have had some \ndiscussions about this issue over the last several days and weeks--the \nSenator is bringing this to the forefront, as he has done.\n  We have talked about the Senator's question that he submitted to Mr. \nBrennan for answering. This is not a rocket science question. This is a \nquestion that is perfectly reasonable, perfectly rational, and a \nquestion that ought to be able to be addressed by the administration in \na very quick, simple, direct response. I have been dumbfounded, as the \nSenator from Kentucky knows, about the fact that he did not get a \nstraightforward, simple answer immediately.\n\n  But the fact of whether a drone attack--and I am one of those who \nthinks we need to detain and interrogate folks as opposed to just \nfiring drones at everybody because we are losing a lot of valuable \ninformation from folks whom we take shots at versus folks whom we are \nable to detain and interrogate--but still, I know the Senator from \nKentucky agrees with me that at the end of the day, we need to take out \nbad guys, guys who seek to do us harm. The Senator's position all along \nhas been that with due process that ought to happen.\n  My question to the Senator is, with the administration not giving him \na straightforward answer--and I understand the Attorney General, in \nresponse to some questions today in the Judiciary Committee, again was \nvery evasive on the question, in spite of having given the Senator a \nletter just yesterday on this issue--that there still is not a \nstraightforward, black-or-white, as it appears to me they could give \nyou, answer to this question; am I correct about that?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia is correct. I also, \nwhile he is on the floor, want to thank him for getting some of this \ninformation to come forward. Because it has been a very onerous task, \nand without his leadership on the Intelligence Committee, as well as \nRepublicans and Democrats asking for more information, we would not \nhave gotten anywhere. With that input, we have been able to get some \nanswers.\n  The answers have not all been good. Brennan has answered, with the \nappropriate answer: The CIA does not work within the United States. \nThat should be pretty obvious because everybody knows that and that is \nthe law. The problem is, it does not answer the final question because \nthe drone program is under the Department of Defense, and if we are \ngoing to bring that home to America, I think the Intelligence \nCommittee, as well as the whole body, ought to be not just waiting for \nthe President to tell us how he is going to use it in America. We have \ncivil law in America and we ought to be part of that process. But I do \nnot think we can allow it to go on without our input.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Let me, Mr. President, if could, ask the Senator again \na little different question to make sure I understand exactly what the \nSenator has asked for.\n  The Senator's position, as I understand it, has been all along that \nif we have bad guys flying airplanes into a tower or if we have folks \nwho are firing missiles or tanks or weapons of any sort in the United \nStates, seeking to carry out an act of war, an act of terrorism, taking \nthose guys out is not a problem.\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes. Mr. President, the idea of combating lethal force I \nthink is questioned by very few, if anybody. If planes are flying into \nthe Twin Towers, we obviously send up F-16s. We have missiles. We do \nwhatever we can to stop an attack on America.\n  What I am concerned about--the same way if it is a domestic \nterrorist. If there is someone outside the Capitol with a grenade \nlauncher, we do not give them Miranda rights. We kill them. That is the \nway it works. If you are exerting lethal force against American \nsoldiers anywhere in the world or in our country, you use lethal force \nto stop that. Sometimes you cannot stop to even ask permission from \nCongress. You do that. Imminent threats are repulsed.\n  But because of all the drone attacks--and I am not saying they are \nnecessarily wrong the way they are done--it is just that they are done \nat people who are not in the middle of a battle. So if we transfer that \nto America, I do not think that is acceptable for America.\n  It is a different debate on whether it is always a good idea, whether \nwe should do it, what the rules should be overseas. But the rules we \nhave currently I do not think are appropriate for the United States.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Again, Mr. President, if I could direct a question to \nthe Senator: The fact is that from a pure oversight standpoint--Armed \nServices, Intel--these committees that have jurisdiction over the issue \nof fighting the war on terrorism need to have the right kind of \ninformation so we can ask the right questions. Getting the right kind \nof information out of this administration has been worse than having a \nroot canal and more difficult than having a root canal.\n  I again am appreciative of the Senator being forceful in asking the \nquestion, and I think at the end of the day, again, he has had no issue \nrelative to ultimately having a vote on Mr. Brennan.\n  I am not supportive of the nomination of Mr. Brennan, but I think he \nought to have a vote, and I intend to express myself in much greater \ndetail on it a little later. But from the standpoint of simply moving \nthe issue forward, if the administration had come to the Senator with a \ndirect answer days or weeks ago, when he asked the question, we \nprobably would not be here now.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for his comments on this issue.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I wish to thank the ranking member of the \nIntelligence Committee and also say this could come to a close anytime \nif the President will sort of say what Attorney General Holder was \ntrying to say this morning, and put it into actual words, that he \nthinks he has the military authority to reject imminent attack. I think \nwe all agree to that. But if he says he is not going to use drones on \npeople who are not engaged in combat in America, I think we could be \ndone with this debate--I think one phone call from the President to \nclarify what his position is or from the Attorney General to actually \nwrite out what his position is.\n  But I guess the reason I am kind of alarmed is, we have a quote from \nthe Attorney General saying the executive\n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\nbranch will decide when and if to use the fifth amendment.\n  I understand in times of war and on battlefields that is a different \nstory. I am talking about in the United States. I do not think the \nexecutive branch gets an option of whether to adhere to the fifth \namendment in the United States. But if they could be more clear on \nthat, I think we could be done with this debate at any time.\n  I have never objected to a vote on Brennan, on the nominee for the \nCIA. But I have objected to the idea that basically we are just going \nto throw out the baby with the bathwater and the Bill of Rights becomes \nsomething of lesser importance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would my friend yield without losing for the \nfloor for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. PAUL. Without yielding the floor, I would be happy to yield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1181-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1181-S1226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 43; that the cloture \nmotion at the desk be reported; that the mandatory quorum under rule \nXXII be waived; that there be 90 minutes for debate, with 30 minutes \nunder the control of the chair and 1 hour under the control of the \nvice-chair of the Intelligence Committee, with 30 minutes of the vice-\nchair's time under the control of Senator Paul; that following the use \nor yielding back of that time on the nomination, the Senate proceed to \nvote on the cloture motion; that if cloture is invoked, the Senate \nproceed to vote on the confirmation of the nomination, without \nintervening action or debate; further, that the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid on the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate; that no further motions be in order to the nomination; that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  Mr. President, before I hear from my friends on the consent, I have \nno problem if people want to talk for a long time, no problem. I have \ndone it a time or two in my day. But I think that the rest of the body \nneeds to know if we are going to finish tonight or tomorrow or the next \nday. So my consent request is pretty direct. We would have 90 more \nminutes of debate, an hour under the control of the Senator from \nGeorgia, and 30 minutes under the control of Senator Feinstein or their \ndesignees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nconsent request?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would simply say, if there is objection, \nwe will come back tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me, \nif I may, direct a question to the majority leader through the Chair. \nAs I understand what the Senator is asking, for 90 more minutes--30 \nminutes to Senator Feinstein and 30 minutes for me, and Senator Paul \nwould have 30 minutes-- it would start right now, basically?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, basically.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Continuing to reserve the right to object, I guess, \nthen, I would direct a question to the Senator from Kentucky since he \nhas the floor. What amount of time does the Senator think he wants to \nutilize?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would be \nhappy with a vote now. I have talked a lot today. But the only thing I \nwould like is a clarification. If the President or the Attorney General \nwill clarify that they are not going to kill noncombatants in America--\nhe essentially almost said that this morning.\n  He could take his remarks, that he virtually agreed ultimately with \nSenator Cruz, and put it in a coherent statement that says the drone \nprogram will not kill Americans who are not involved in combat.\n  I think he probably agrees to that. I do not understand why we could \nnot put that into words. But if he does, I want no more time. If not, I \nwill continue to object. If the administration and the Attorney General \nwill not provide an accurate answer, I object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am not in a position to talk for the \nAttorney General. We will just finish this matter tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, everyone should plan on coming tomorrow. We \nare through for the night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, at this time, without yielding the floor, I \nwould like to entertain a question from the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Kentucky \nfor raising a very important issue. I would just like to have a little \nbit of clarification so that I understand exactly what has transpired \nand the exact question to which the Senator from Kentucky would like a \nresponse.\n  My perception, my understanding, is this seems like a very simple and \nbasic request. So I am surprised that we did not have a simple and \nstraightforward answer. So I wonder if the Senator from Kentucky would \njust summarize briefly for me, so that I understand clearly the exact \nrequest that he made to the administration.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, in late January we sent a letter to John \nBrennan, the nominee for the CIA, asking a bunch of questions. Included \namong those questions was, Can you kill an American in America with a \ndrone strike? We got no response and no response and no response.\n  Thanks to the intervention of the ranking member on the Intelligence \nCommittee, as well as members from the opposite aisle on the \nIntelligence Committee, we finally got an answer about 2 days ago. The \nanswer from John Brennan was that he acknowledges the CIA cannot act in \nthe United States. That is the law. That was nice. But the Attorney \nGeneral responded and said they do not intend to. They have not yet, \nbut they might.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Am I correct in understanding that is currently the state \nof play? That is the most recent response the Senator has gotten in \nwriting from the administration?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, that is the only direct response I have \ngotten. I have also read the testimony from the Judiciary Committee \nwhere the Senator from Texas cross-examined the Attorney General, who \nresponded indirectly to my question by saying: It was inappropriate, we \nprobably would not do that.\n  But he would not answer directly whether it was unconstitutional. It \nappears at the end that he may have said that it would be \nunconstitutional, say, to kill noncombatants.\n  It should be a pretty simple answer really. That is all I am asking. \nI can be done anytime if I could just get a response from the \nadministration or the Attorney General saying they do not believe they \nhave the authority to kill noncombatants in America.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Further clarification: If the administration seems to be \nunwilling to state unequivocally that they recognize they do not have \nthe legal authority to kill a noncombatant American on American soil, \ndid they suggest under what circumstances they would?\n\n  Did they suggest a process by which they would identify an American \ncitizen noncombatant on American soil who might be subject to being \nkilled by a drone strike?\n  Mr. PAUL. Well, there has been a white paper that was released that \ngoes through a series of things. They do have a step or a process they \ngo through in determining whom to kill. The problem I have is that in \nforeign countries--I do not know the exact number because it is \nclassified, but in foreign countries many of the people being killed \nare not actively engaged in combat.\n  I am not saying that is right or wrong or making an opinion on that \nmatter. But I am saying that is not a standard I can live with in the \nUnited States. So let's say one-third of the drone strikes are going \nagainst people who are eating dinner with their family or walking down \nthe road or sleeping in their house. If that is our standard and we are \ngoing to do drone strikes in America, I could not tolerate or live with \nmyself if I would accept a standard in the United States that would \nallow that to happen.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, judging from the response, what I \nunderstand is\n\n[[Page S1182]]\n\nthat there is a standard that applies overseas. But we have not \ngotten--correct me if I am mistaken--a definitive word as to whether \nthat same standard would apply domestically to American citizens. If we \nhave not gotten a definitive answer, then we, it seems to me--again, \ncorrect me if I am wrong--but then it would suggest to me that we have \nno idea what standard would be used. I cannot imagine that we would \nfind it acceptable to be in a situation where an administration would \nsuggest that using a drone to kill an American noncombatant on American \nsoil, without even disclosing the process by which they would determine \nthat was appropriate--this is kind of hard to understand. Am I \nunderstanding it incorrectly?\n  Mr. PAUL. Well, the interesting thing about this is for many years, \nno one would talk about the drone strike program at all. Then, \nrecently, one of the former spokesmen for the President said he was \ninstructed to never say it existed. But now that it is in the open, the \nPresident, a week ago, was asked at Google when he was there for an \ninterview: Can you do this?\n  His answer: Well, the rules would probably have to be different \ninside than outside.\n  That implies he thinks he can do it in America. Then the question \nbecomes, What are those rules? This is as much about the checks and \nbalances of--you know, they say we have the ability to advise and \nconsent. This is some friendly advice I am giving to the President \ntoday that he ought to think about or we should think about as a body \nwhether we are a check and balance to the power of the Executive, \nwhether it is Republican or Democratic.\n  I think it is immaterial. No President should have the power to make \nthese decisions unilaterally.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I will finish. I just want to make two \npoints: One is I think we ought to have a robust debate about the \ncircumstances under which we would use drone strikes overseas and \nunderstand the implications. Think about this. We have what is still, \nto the United States, a relatively new threat in the form of these \nnonstate actors, these terrorist organizations that are sometimes \naffiliated with each other, sometimes not, scattered around the globe. \nThis is new.\n  In addition, we have new technology we never had before. It was not \nterribly long ago the idea of flying an unmanned drone and using it to \nkill a person who could be hundreds or thousands of miles away, that \nwas completely implausible. Now, of course, we have the ability to do \nit. When new circumstances and new technology come to bear, we ought to \nhave a discussion about when and whether and how it is appropriate to \nuse that.\n  When we are talking about American noncombatants on American soil, I \nthink the starting point ought to be, we are not going to do that. The \nonus ought to be on whoever has an explanation for when and whether and \nwhy and under what circumstances we would, and that ought to be debated \nvery, very carefully and thoroughly. Until such time, I think it ought \nto be easy to acknowledge this is not going to take place.\n  If we cannot get a direct answer to that question, then I have to say \nI think the Senator from Kentucky is performing an important service in \nputting a spotlight on this. I commend him for doing it. I thank him \nfor doing it. I am finished with my questions.\n  Mr. PAUL. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for asking his \nquestions and being part of the debate. I think that ultimately we \ncould get this straightened out in the sense that it is not so much \nabout the debate about the person as it is about the issue.\n  If we could get the administration or the Attorney General to put \ntheir answer in a succinct form and simply say they believe they have \nthe authority to repel an attack, which most of--I think all of us \nagree to that, but they do not have the authority to kill someone in a \nrestaurant, to kill someone at home in their house, to kill someone \nwhen they are eating dinner; that, really, if you want to say that you \ncan use drones in America to strike people, not only would it have to \nbe remarkably different, it could not be anything like the way we use \ndrones around the world, which brings up some other important \nquestions.\n  The thing is this has brought us to a much bigger and important \ndebate. When people tell you that America is a battlefield, when they \ntell you the battlefield is here, realize what they are telling you. \nThey are telling you your Bill of Rights do not apply because in the \nbattlefield, you really do not have due process. I am not arguing for \nthat. I am not arguing for some kind of silly rules for soldiers to ask \nfor Miranda rights and do all this. War is war. War is hell. But we \ncannot have perpetual war. We cannot have war that has no temporal \nlimits. We cannot then have war that is a part of our daily life in our \ncountry; that we are going to say from now on in our country, you do \nnot have the protections of the Bill of Rights.\n  So I think it is incredibly important. We have been kind of blase \nabout this whole drone strike program. It should come home to where we \ncan really think about it because that is what they are asking to do. \nThey are asking to bring the drone strikes to the homeland.\n  So I think we need to be careful. We need to ask important questions. \nI think at the very least we need to be asking the question: Can you do \nthis with no due process? Are we not going to have an accusation? Are \nwe not going to have a public accusation or charge? Are we not going to \nhave a trial by jury?\n  I started out today reading from ``Alice in Wonderland.'' I would \nlike to go back to ``Alice in Wonderland,'' because it sort of points \nout the absurdity of where we are at this point. We think of Lewis \nCaroll as being fiction. Of course it is fiction. We think Alice never \nfell down a rabbit hole. Of course she did not. She is not real. The \nwhite queen and her caustic judgments are not really a threat to us. \nBut there is a question: Has America the beautiful become Alice's \nWonderland? We can hear the queen saying: No. No. But her response is, \nSentence first, verdict afterwards.\n  Well, that is absurd. How could we sentence someone without \ndetermining first whether they are guilty or innocent? Only in Alice's \nWonderland would you sentence someone before you try them. Would you \nsentence someone to death before you accuse them? Do we really live in \nAlice's Wonderland? Is there no one willing to stand up and say to the \nPresident: For goodness' sake, you can't sentence people before you try \nthem. You can't sentence people before you determine whether they are \nguilty.\n  There has been discussion in our country about whether even the \ncourts can sometimes make mistakes. Some States have gotten rid of the \ndeath penalty because they have made mistakes and through DNA testing \nthey have found that sometimes they convicted the wrong person. Can you \nimagine, with all the checks and balances of our court system--which I \nthink is the best in the entire world, with attorneys on both sides \nwhether you can afford them or not. There is an argument back and \nforth, and there are all of these procedural protections, and you may \nappeal, and still sometimes we get it wrong.\n  If we can get it wrong in the best system in the world, do you think \none politician might get it wrong? You will never know because nobody \nis told who is going to be killed. It is a secret list. How do you \nprotest? How do you say: I am innocent. How do you say: Yes, I e-mail \nwith my cousin who lives in the Middle East, and I didn't know he was \ninvolved in that. Do you not get a chance to explain yourself in a \ncourt of law before you get a Hellfire missile dropped on your head?\n  It amazes me that people are so willing and eager to throw out the \nBill of Rights and just say: Oh, that is fine. Terrorists are a big \nthreat to us, and I am so fearful that they will attack me that I am \nwilling to give up my rights. I am willing to give up on the Bill of \nRights.\n  I think we give up too easily.\n  The President has responded, and he said he hasn't killed anybody yet \nin America. He says he doesn't intend to kill anyone in America, but he \nmight. I, frankly, just don't think that is good enough.\n  The President's oath of office says ``I will,'' not ``I might'' or \n``I intend to,'' the President says ``I will protect, preserve, and \ndefend the Constitution.'' He doesn't say ``I will do it when it is\n\n[[Page S1183]]\n\npractical'' or ``I will do it unless it is infeasible, unless it is \nunpleasant, people argue with me. I have to go through Congress, and I \ncan't get anything done, then I won't obey the Constitution.'' It is \nout there. It is a rule. He doesn't get to choose.\n  Recently he made some choices where it appears as if he believes he \ndoes have some sort of superpower, some power that sort of exceeds the \nother branches of government. Recently he told the body of the Senate \nthat he decides when we are in recess, he decides when we are working. \nThe court rebuked him. The court told him it is unconstitutional, and \nthey reversed his decision. Do you know the people he appointed through \na recess--do you know what they are doing right now? They are still at \ntheir post. They are still working in defiance of the court. This will \nhave to go to the Supreme Court. I guess it will take another year or \nso to go up there, but he has been told what he did was illegal.\n  I guess what disappoints me most about this, though, is that the \nPresident, when he ran for office, was actually someone for whom I had \na great deal of respect on the issues of civil liberties. I work with \nmany on the other side of the aisle because, frankly, many on the left \nand some on the right--we truly do believe in civil liberties and in \nprotecting the individual. I think the President was one of those when \nhe was in the Senate.\n  The President, when he ran for office, often talked about, it isn't \nAmerican to torture people. I agree with him. He said it isn't American \nto give up on the right to privacy, to say you don't need a warrant to \ntap someone's phone. I agreed with him, and I respected that about him. \nI can't for the life of me understand how he goes from that kind of \nbelief where he believes so much in the constitutional protections to \nyour phone, but he is not willing to stand up for the constitutional \nprotection to your life? It doesn't make any sense at all. And if he \ndoes, why won't he say it?\n  I have my own sort of theory on this, and this applies both to \nRepublicans and Democrats. My theory is that it is sort of a contagion, \nit is sort of an infection that you get when occupying the Oval Office. \nThey think, oh, I am a good person, so more power for me would be a \ngood thing.\n  Lord Acton said that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts \nabsolutely. There is a danger when someone has so much power that they \nthink more power, more power and more power--I will do good with that \npower. The problem is that even if that is a good person, someday \nsomeone occupying that office may not be a good person. Someday you may \nget someone in the Oval Office who says: What about those people? They \nlook different from us. What about those people? They have different \ncolor skin. What about those people? They have a different color \nideology than I have. What about those people?\n  The danger is also that we have already defined some of the people \nwho we think might be terrorists. The Bureau of Justice came out with a \nlist of characteristics, and they said: If you see this, report on it. \nIf you see this, tell someone. They want you to inform on your \nneighbor, so you need to know which one of your neighbors is a \nterrorist. They gave you some descriptions of people to be worried \nabout. They said people missing fingers, people with colored stains on \ntheir clothes, people who have weatherized ammunition, people who have \nmultiple guns, people who like to use cash. If that is the criteria or \nthe criterion for who is a terrorist, I would be a little bit worried \nif you are one of those people--you might have a drone attack in your \nbed tonight.\n  This has gone on in more than one place. The fusion centers they \ndeveloped were supposed to be a liaison between the Federal Government \nand the local government. In these fusion centers, for example, in \nMissouri, they also came up with some characteristics of people who \nmight be terrorists. They actually send it out as a memo to all the \npolice officers. Can you imagine if you are one of these people--people \nwho are pro-life, people who are for secure borders, people who support \nthird-party candidates? The big irony of all is people who belong to \nthe Constitution Party. If you believe in the Constitution too much, \nyou might be a terrorist. They say it was a mistake, and they \neventually apologized. Now they don't--they try not to have their memos \nbecome public, I think.\n\n  The point is, if this is what we are getting to and this is the \ncriterion for who is a terrorist, you would think--you really would \nthink you would be worried about giving your President the authority to \nkill Americans on American soil without any kind of due process. I find \nit quite alarming.\n  I think the answer he could have given is pretty simple. I think \nthere is a possibility he may actually even agree with some of the \nthings we are saying here today. Why won't he give it? I think \nPresidents, Republican and Democratic, don't give the answer because \nthey are afraid of constricting their authority. They believe in some \nsort of inherent power, which is not listed anywhere, but they think \nthey have it. They don't want to give up any of it. They jealously \nguard this power. They have this power, and they don't want to give it \nup. That is why they won't answer us with a straight answer.\n  You get things. The only word I can think of is gobbledygook. You get \nthis craziness that comes from attorneys that doesn't make any sense.\n  He was asked: What is an imminent threat?\n  These people we are going to kill with drones have to be an imminent \nthreat.\n  His attorneys say ``imminent'' doesn't have to mean ``immediately.'' \nThat is the only way he can justify this because probably half of these \ndrone attacks are people who really aren't engaged in any kind of \ncombat. That is a different debate. You can argue right or wrong \nwhether we should be killing these people not involved in combat \nbecause there is evidence they are conspiring to hurt us and to attack \nus. That is another argument, but it is a pretty low standard. You can \nargue that, well, that is war over there, and that is a lower standard, \nand I can accept it, but for goodness' sake, could there be any \nquestion that in America we are going to accept a standard so low, a \nstandard that basically says that if we think you might someday be \nengaged in hostilities, we can kill you? We need to be careful because \nthe criteria for the drone strike program overseas really is something \nthat I think most Americans wouldn't accept for their fellow citizens.\n  Overseas, one of the most famous American citizens they killed was \nal-Awlaki. Before he was killed, he was primarily thought of as someone \nwho they said was a sympathizer. I think there is no question he was a \nsympathizer. I think he denounced his citizenship. He was a bad guy. He \nsympathized with our enemies. I think he could have been tried for \ntreason. I think if I were on a jury, from what I have read of \nnonclassified information, I would have voted his guilt and for his \ndeath. The thing is, some kind of process might be helpful.\n  His son, though, 16 years old, was killed 2 weeks later in a separate \ndrone strike, and he was on nobody's list that I know of; they won't \nrespond. I think the response by the President's spokesman is \nreprehensible. It really should be called out. It is really sort of \nthis flippant response that I think shows absolutely no regard for \nindividual rights or for Americans. He said: Well, the kid should have \nchosen a more responsible father. Think about that. Is that the \nstandard you wish your government to operate on in America? We have a \nlot of criminals in our country. We have a lot of bad people. If you \nhappen to be the son of a bad person, is that enough to kill you?\n  The other thing is that people killed overseas who are not the \ntarget--they don't call them civilians because they say anybody between \nthe age of 16 and 50 who is a male is a potential combatant. Are we \ngoing to use that same standard here in our country? Are we going to \nuse the standard in our country that if you just happen to be a male \nand you happen to be standing near somebody we have judged to be a \nproblem, that we are going to go ahead, and, oh, I guess that is not \neven collateral damage; that person was probably a bad person because \nhe was standing close to this person?\n  I think there are different standards for war than there are within \nour country. It is not always going to be perfect, and there is a \nlegitimate debate over what the rules should be in a war,\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\nwhere a war is overseas, and exactly what happens. I think good, honest \npeople can disagree on some of that. What I worry about are the people \nwho say America is a battlefield because when they say America is a \nbattlefield, they say they want the laws of war to apply here. The \nreverse of that is basically, if you reverse the laws of war, they are \ntalking about martial law, is what they are talking about, law that is \nacceptable under extreme circumstances.\n  I don't think what we have in our country right now is a circumstance \nwhere I would accept martial law, but we have already instituted some \nof the things you will see in other countries under martial law. In \nEgypt, they have indefinite detention. That is their emergency decree \nthat occurred back in the 1970s, and it went on and on to the present. \nThey have martial law, and they are very unhappy about having martial \nlaw, indefinite detention. You saw it last year. We have indefinite \ndetention in America.\n  The President's response again was inadequate. What did the President \nsay to having indefinite detention in our country? He said: Well, I \ndon't intend to use it. I would rather have a President who has the \nchutzpa to not sign the legislation and send it back and say: Take it \nout or I won't sign it. I would have a lot of respect for someone like \nthat.\n  Mr. President, without yielding the floor, I would be happy to \nentertain a question from the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to pose a \nfew questions to my colleague from Kentucky. First, I would say that I \nadmire his fortitude and his willingness to ask appropriate and \nreasonable questions of the administration on a matter of grave \nimportance. This is a matter no less important than our constitutional \ngovernment itself that does not give sole power to the administration \nto make these decisions but recognizes that the Congress is a coequal \nbranch of government. Indeed, we have important oversight \nresponsibilities in the Department of Justice, the Department of \nDefense, and there isn't a more delicate and important matter than the \nlimitations placed on the government when it comes to dealing with our \nown citizens.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Kentucky whether he is aware of \nsome of these issues.\n  First of all, shortly after President Obama took office, the Holder \nJustice Department declassified and released detailed, previously top-\nsecret legal memos attempting to explain the legal rationale for the \nenhanced interrogation program the Central Intelligence Agency used \nduring the Bush administration. These memos were written by the Office \nof Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice, which is frequently \ncalled the lawyer for the executive branch, which issues those \nauthoritative memos. President Obama, Eric Holder presumably decided \nthat they would release those previously classified memos that \nexplained the legal rationale for the enhanced interrogation program.\n  I would further ask the Senator if he recalls that when the Obama \nadministration made these legal memos--highly classified legal memos--\npublic documents, does he remember the Attorney General made some \nspecific comments? In fact, he said: We are disclosing these memos \nconsistent with our commitment to the rule of law. Yet today, that same \nJustice Department refuses to release to Members of Congress--including \nthis Senator, the Senator from Kentucky, and other Members who have \noversight responsibilities--the very same legal rationale in this case \nfor the drone strikes the Senator from Kentucky is talking about.\n  So I wanted to ask, first of all, of the Senator from Kentucky \nwhether he believes I have accurately recited the facts, but then to \nask him whether he sees a double standard here on the part of the \nObama-Holder Justice Department where on one hand they release these \nlegal memos from the Office of Legal Counsel, and in this case, instead \nof releasing the legal rationale for the authority to make drone \nstrikes, they issue what is, in essence, a white paper, or press \nrelease, that was linked to the news media.\n  I would ask the Senator from Kentucky to respond.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the question from the Senator from Texas is \na very good one, and there does seem to be a double standard going on \nhere. There seems to be one standard for wiretapping of phones or \ninterrogation, but there seems to be much less a standard for actually \nkilling. It seems to be hypocritical and one would wonder why.\n  With regard to releasing the memos and how they come about their \nprocess, some of that was leaked. It is always curious to me that it is \nas if the leaks come out on purpose; as if they are intentional. The \nleaks happen right before a nomination process. I don't know the truth \nof that, but I do think that not only should we get the memos, but if \nthere is going to be a drone strike program in America, perhaps we \nshould actually be writing the rules and sending them to the President. \nThat would be our job--not to listen to him and what he is going to do \non drone strikes in America, but actually spelling out and having an \nopen discussion. Because in America I don't think that should be a \nsecret--how we are going to go about this in America.\n  I see no reason not only to get the drone memos, and I think it would \nbe more consistent with their earlier position, but I think what we \nshould do is be a part of the process of determining how we go forward, \nwith whether we are going to have drone strikes in America and what the \nrules would be.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would ask a further question of the Senator from \nKentucky. I believe the question he has asked--whether the President \nhas the power to authorize lethal force, such as a drone strike against \na U.S. citizen on U.S. soil and without trial--is a very clearly stated \nquestion and one, I believe, the Senator and the rest of the Members of \nCongress are entitled to a very clear answer on.\n  I was in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with the Attorney \nGeneral this morning where we attempted to ask him on a number of \noccasions what his answer would be to this question. Yet he equivocated \nand he was ambiguous. He seemed to be ambiguous when a clear answer \nwould serve him just as well, a point the Senator from Kentucky has \nmade.\n  The question I have for the Senator is: Wouldn't in all likelihood \nthe legal rationale or justification issued by the Office of Legal \nCounsel at the Department of Justice include a discussion which would \nilluminate and elucidate the answer to the Senator's question?\n  In other words, I would assume, without having seen that classified \nmemo, that it would go through a rather lengthy analysis of the \nhypothetical situations under which these drone strikes might be used \nand would, in all likelihood, I think, shed some light on and clarify \nthe answer to the Senator's question. Wouldn't that be a reasonable way \nto answer what is a very straightforward and reasonable question?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, piecing together what I have heard of some \nof his testimony, I actually think he did finally admit to some things \nthat I think are consistent with what I am saying. They haven't put it \nin writing previously. I would think he could almost take his testimony \ntoday--where he almost at some point seems to agree that it would be \nunconstitutional to kill noncombatants, people not actively engaged in \ncombat--and if he would say that, I think he would answer my question, \nbasically. Because I have never been talking about people engaged in \nlethal force. You don't get much due process there. If you are engaged \nin lethal force, lethal force is used against you. So one would think \nhe could answer that simple question, similar to what he actually \nstated in his testimony today, but they won't give us a succinct \nanswer, or any answer, really. So that is the answer we have been \ntrying to get to all along.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator will yield for another question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. To the Senator's last point, I am reading from a letter \ndated March 4. It is from the Attorney General to Senator Paul, and he \nsays:\n\n       The question you have posed is therefore entirely \n     hypothetical, unlikely to occur, and\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\n     one we hope no President will ever have to confront.\n\n  But he goes on to say, in response to Senator Paul's question:\n\n       It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary \n     circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate \n     under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United \n     States for the President to authorize the military to use \n     lethal force within the territory of the United States.\n\n  In other words, to the Senator's point, on one hand he said it was a \nhypothetical question, unlikely to occur, and one we hope no President \nwould ever have to confront; and then, on the other hand, he said it is \npossible to imagine a scenario under which it would happen. That would \nappear to cast a further lack of clarity on something that should be a \nstraightforward yes or no.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, here is the interesting thing about saying \nit is hypothetical and it wouldn't happen. I could buy that, except for \nthe fact that our foreign drone strike program--a significant amount of \nthe drone strikes--are on people not actively engaged in combat. \nWhether that is right or wrong is another question, but since we \nalready have an example of a significant amount of those being used on \nthose not engaged in active combat, it is hard for him to say this is a \nrare, unusual, hypothetical thing that could never happen, because it \nseems as though it is a big part of the drone program overseas.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I said that was my last question, but I \nwould ask the Senator to yield for this last question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. It strikes me, Mr. President, that there is a clear \ndouble standard here. The Senator has asked a reasonable question, to \nwhich he has not gotten a clear answer, and one that is clearly within \nthe purview of the Senate in our oversight capacity for the Department \nof Justice and as a coequal branch of government. On one hand, the \nObama-Holder Justice Department not only released a white paper but \nreleased previously classified legal memos from the Office of Legal \nCounsel on the enhanced interrogation program, saying it was consistent \nwith their commitment to the rule of law, but today, in response to an \neminently reasonable request, is giving the Senator from Kentucky what \nI think can appropriately be called the Heisman, or stiff arm, and \ndenying him access to that.\n  So I wanted to come to the floor and make that point and ask those \nquestions and say again that I admire the Senator's fortitude and \nwillingness to stand up and challenge the administration on this issue. \nIt would be easy to satisfy the Senator's request. He has made that \nvery clear. He is not intending to block a vote on this nomination, but \nhe is intending to get the information he has requested, and he is \nentitled to it.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the questions and points the Senator from \nTexas has made are very good points, and it also shows we are not that \nfar apart in trying to find an answer to this, because, there is no \nultimate ability for me to stop this nomination. I am already getting \ntired and I don't know how long I will be able to do this, so I can't \nultimately stop the nomination. But what I can do is try to draw \nattention to this and try to get an answer. That would be something, if \nwe could get an answer from the President. And I think we would all \nsleep better and feel more comfortable if he would say explicitly that \nnoncombatants in America won't be killed with drones. The reason it has \nto be answered is because our foreign drone strike program does kill \nnoncombatants. They may argue they are conspiring or they may some day \nbe combatants, but if that is the same standard we are going to be \nusing in the United States, it is a far different country than I know \nabout. Ours is a country where dissent, vocal dissent, even vehement, \nvociferous dissent as far as whether our country should go to war, \nwhether our country should raise taxes, lower taxes, has always been \nallowed. We allow a great deal of dissent in our country. But some of \nthe people whom we have said we are targeting have been dissenters, \nprobably traitors too, but they have also been people who have been \nvocalizing it more than they have been shooting anybody.\n  That is not to say you can't be a traitor even if you don't shoot \nanybody. But if you are going to be accused of treason or of being a \ntraitor in the United States, I would think you would get your day in \ncourt, probably. It is particularly troublesome since some of the \ndescriptions of who might be a terrorist are such that I would be a \nlittle bit concerned about the slippery slope to who is and who is not \na terrorist. I can't imagine in America we would do that without an \nopen accusation, without a trial by a jury, without a verdict.\n  I think it is important this discussion go on, and I am not \nultimately setting the goal that I can stop this nomination. I am here \ntoday to draw attention to a constitutional principle, to try to get \nthe administration to admit publicly they will not kill Americans who \nare not involved in combat. But it hasn't so much to do with Brennan or \nhis nomination, it has to do with a constitutional principle. \nUltimately, Brennan will be approved. He will be the head of the CIA. \nThis will be a blip in his nomination process. I hope people will see \nit more as an argument for how important our rights are; that no one, \nno branch of government, no individual politician should be above the \nlaw, should be able to dictate and say what they think the law is.\n  We had some of this even under a Republican President. I was critical \nof President Bush for saying he had the ability to interpret the law; \nhe had the ability to put signing statements, which were extensive \nsometimes, which gave his interpretation of what the law was or what he \nthought the law was. So I have been critical of both sides thinking \nthey have more power than they have.\n  Our Founding Fathers were brilliant in the sense that they separated \nthe powers and had these coequal powers of government, these branches \nof government that were somewhat pitted against each other. And by \nhaving equal power and by being able to judge the power of the other \nbranch, no one branch could accumulate too much power. But in our \ncountry it has been going the other way for a long time. It hasn't been \njust Democratic Presidents or just Republican Presidents, it has \nfrankly been both. For maybe 100 years or so power has been gravitating \nand gravitating and gravitating to the Presidency. And not just the \nPresidency. When people talk about the bureaucracy, these are people \nwho are within the executive branch--millions of them. When we passed \nObamaCare, it was 2,000-some-odd pages, but there have been 9,000 pages \nof regulations written since. ObamaCare had 1,800 references to ``the \nSecretary of Health shall decide at a later date.'' We gave up that \npower. We gave up power that should have been ours, that should have \nbeen written into the legislation. We gave up that power, and as a \nconsequence we gave it to the executive branch. We gave it to people--\nmany of them we call bureaucrats--who are unelected. So we gave away \npower. It is a struggle, and it should be a perpetual struggle, but we \nshouldn't give in on that struggle and give up that power.\n  There was mention the President should reveal to us drone memos on \nhow he is making the decisions. We have had some leaks about that, but \nI would go one step further. Not only should the President let Congress \nknow what he is doing, maybe we should tell him what to do. Maybe the \nCongress should be setting the rules for how we do drone strikes. Maybe \nthe Congress should be protecting the American people from their \ngovernment.\n  That sounds terrible, protecting you from your government. That is \nwhat the Constitution was about. The Constitution wasn't written to \nrestrain your behavior, it was written to restrain your government's \nbehavior.\n  A lot of people get confused when we talk about religion and the \nfirst amendment. But if you read the first amendment, it says Congress \nshall make no law. It doesn't say anything about your religious \npreferences. It is not supposed to limit your involvement in \ngovernment. It is really not supposed to limit so much religious \ninvolvement in government or even religion.\n  We have a prayer every morning in the Senate. You can't have it in \nyour public school, but we have a prayer every morning. Explain that to \nme. We have the Ten Commandments around here. So does the Supreme \nCourt. But\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\nyou can't have it in your local school. I think we have gotten confused \non things. It was really about government getting involved in your \nreligion.\n  We didn't want to establish a church. We thought it was a bad idea to \nhave an official church, and I still think it is a bad idea to have an \nofficial church because then the government would be telling the church \nwhat to do. But it is really all about the documents that we have \nprotecting you from an overbearing government.\n  Your government was given a few defined powers, the enumerated \npowers. There are 17, 19--depends on how you want to count them--but \nthere are not very many. They are few and defined. But your liberties \nare many--basically, unlimited and undefined.\n  When you read the ninth and tenth amendment, it says those rights not \nexplicitly given to government are left to the States and the people. \nThey are yours. They are not to be disparaged.\n  These are important debates we are having. When Montesquieu talked \nabout the separation of powers and the different checks and balances, \nhe said: There can be no liberty when you combine the executive and the \nlegislative. Likewise, I would add to that there can be no liberty when \nyou combine the executive and the judiciary.\n  So if you allow the President to tell you he can have drone strikes \non Americans, on American soil, you are allowing him to be not only the \nexecutive, you are allowing him to be the judiciary. If he makes it \nsecret, nobody can object.\n  I remember one time I was complaining to another Senator about these \nthings called suspicious activity reports. Your bank is required to \nfile them on you. In fact, if you pay your Visa bill through your bank, \nover the phone, you have done a wire transfer, and you can be part of a \nsuspicious activity report. If you turn cash in to the bank or get cash \nout of the bank over a certain amount, you can get a suspicious \nactivity report.\n  I was concerned about this because there have been 8 million filed \nsince \n9/11, and the Senator's response is he has never heard anybody complain \nabout it. The reason nobody complains is they are secret. They don't \ntell you they are doing this.\n  So if you get on the kill list, it is a little hard to complain. We \nmight have a kill list for a couple of years in the United States, on \nAmerican citizens, and nobody might complain because it is secret. You \ndon't know you are on the list.\n  So I think it is important that we have a big debate and discussion \nover this; that we let the President know he doesn't get to write all \nof these rules on killing American citizens; that the Constitution \nstill applies in our country.\n  The reason this is a big debate is that when you are in a war, the \nConstitution doesn't always apply on the battlefield in another \ncountry. There is a debate over whether the Constitution is here or \nwhether it extends beyond the borders. But the practical matter is we \ncan't really enforce the Constitution beyond our borders. You sort of \nconsent to your Constitution, you sort of consent to your government by \nvoting. We have that arrangement in our country, but it doesn't happen \nin Mexico, Europe, or Afghanistan, and it certainly doesn't happen in \nthe middle of hostilities. So you don't really get due process over \nthere. That is the real danger. That is the problem. That is the rub.\n  This whole thing is about the use of authorization of force that was \npassed after 9/11 to go to war in Afghanistan. If you had voted on \nthat--you didn't; your leaders did. But had you voted on that, you \nwould have thought: I am going to war in Afghanistan to get the people \nwho attacked us on 9/11.\n  I was all for it. I still am. I think that was something we needed to \ndo. We couldn't let people attack us, but I don't think you would have \nthought, when you voted for that, you were voting for a worldwide war \nwith no end that included America as part of the battlefield. That is \nthe real problem.\n  The administration, John Brennan, who wants to be head of the CIA, \nand Eric Holder, the Attorney General, they all believe--and many here \nbelieve this also--there is no geographic limit to the war. It is not \nin Afghanistan. They say it is everywhere, but they say everywhere \nincludes here.\n  Here is the problem: If you don't think you can apply due process in \nthe middle of a war, what happens if they say the war is here? That \nmeans you don't get any protection. So if you are accused of a crime, I \nguess that is it.\n  I can't imagine that is what we want as Americans. I just can't \nimagine we would believe or acquiesce or allow the President to \nbasically say he is going to make the decisions for us; that he \nbasically would kill noncombatants in America.\n  I, frankly, think eventually he will admit--it would be nice if he \nwould admit it tonight--that he is not going to do it. If anybody has a \nphone, give him a call. Let him know we would like to know an answer. \nAnd I think it would be appropriate.\n  When the Attorney General came this morning to the Judiciary \nCommittee to answer questions, he was asked repeatedly this question: \nCan you kill noncombatants if they are sitting and having tea somewhere \nin America? He kind of weebled and wobbled and went around the issue. \nFinally, we said: We want to know, is it constitutional? Do you think \nyou can do this?\n\n  Instead of saying we might not, we don't intend to--and it sounds \nlike he finally admits at the end that it is unconstitutional. But then \nwhy can't we get them to issue a statement? Why can't we get them to \nsay explicitly: We are not going to do this? I see no reason. It would \ntake them 5 minutes to jot this down on a piece of paper. If they don't \nintend to do it, why not tell us?\n  When your government won't tell you they are not going to do \nsomething, when they won't answer, no, they don't have the power, they \nare saying to you, yes, they have the power.\n  If they will not answer your question and say: No, I will not kill \nAmericans who are not involved in combat here at home, if they cannot \ntell you that, they are saying, yes, they will kill Americans not \ninvolved in combat. It is a simple question.\n  Conor Friedersdorf writes for the Atlantic, and he writes:\n\n       Does President Obama think that he has the power to kill \n     American citizens on U.S. soil? If he accuses a guy in the \n     Arizona desert or rural Montana of being an Al Qaeda \n     terrorist, is it ever kosher to send a drone over to blow him \n     up, as was done to--\n\n  People overseas--\n\n       Or is it never okay to drone strike an--\n       American citizen to death here in America?\n       It's an easy question.\n       Answering it wouldn't jeopardize national security in any \n     way.\n       So why do Obama administration officials keep dodging it?\n\n  When the President was asked this question in a Google Plus interview \nlast week, he said: Well we might have different rules inside the \ncountry than outside the country.\n  Well, that sort of assumes he thinks he can kill Americans here, and \nhe might have different rules. He might have more protections, but he \nis not going to tell you. He says it is secret. I, for one, am not very \ncomforted.\n  When the President says he hasn't killed any Americans yet and he \ndoesn't intend to kill any Americans--but he might--that doesn't really \ncomfort me so much. I don't think that is strong enough language.\n  The Presidential oath of office says, ``I will preserve, protect, and \ndefend the Constitution.'' It doesn't say: I intend to. It doesn't say: \nI intend to preserve, if it is convenient; I intend to preserve, \nprotect, and defend the Constitution if it is convenient.\n  In his memo, he says he is only going to kill people if it is \ninfeasible. To me, that sounds a little bit like, yes, it is tough. It \nis inconvenient, so I am going to preserve, protect, and defend the \nConstitution as long as it is feasible. It just doesn't inspire me.\n  Friedersdorf goes on to say with regard to the President's answer in \nGoogle: ``But he still didn't give a straight answer.''\n  Counterterrorism adviser John Brennan--whose nomination we are \ntalking about--won't answer either. He finally did answer, but only \nunder duress. His answer was actually the appropriate answer. He said \nthe CIA can't do this in America. But it begs the question--because the \nCIA is not in charge of the drone program; the Department of Defense \nis. So we need an answer from the Department of Defense, and we get an\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\nanswer from Eric Holder that says they haven't done it yet, they don't \nintend to do it, but they might. He doesn't say specifically that they \nwill not.\n  These answers have been out there for a while, and we have been \nthrough this and around this and asked questions. These are simple \nquestions. These are questions I can't imagine why we can't get an \nexplicit answer to--unless the answer is no. Unless the answer is that \nthey don't want limitations on their power. Unless the answer is that \nthey don't want to be constrained by the Constitution. Unless their \nanswer is that the Bill of Rights doesn't apply to them when they think \nit doesn't apply to them. And that is the real danger.\n  Eric Holder--your Attorney General--was asked about this and asked \nabout the fifth amendment. He was asked: Does it apply?\n  He said: Well, it applies when we think it applies.\n  What does that mean? I know it is a debatable question--overseas, \nAmerican citizens, this and that--but I don't think it is a debatable \nquestion. In our country, does the fifth amendment apply? I don't know \nhow you can argue the fifth amendment doesn't apply. I don't know how \nyou can argue we have an exemption to the Bill of Rights when we want \nto.\n  But this is the President--the same President who argued he gets to \ndetermine when the Senate is in recess because he didn't get a few of \nhis appointees last year, also argued that the Senate was in recess and \nsaid he could appoint anybody he wanted--and he did.\n\n  It went to court, and the court rebuked him. The court said: You \ndon't get to decide all the rules for all of government. The Senate \ndecides when they are in recess; you decide when you are in recess, but \nyou don't get to decide the rules for the Senate.\n  They struck him down. Has he obeyed the ruling? Has he listened to \nwhat the court did? Has he been chastised and rebuked by the court?\n  The people he appointed illegally are still doing that job. All of \ntheir decisions are probably invalid. So for the last 2 or 2\\1/2\\ \nyears--however long these recess appointments have been out there--all \nof these decisions are going to be a huge mess. They have made all \nthese decisions, and it is going to be uncertain whether the decisions \nare going to be valid. All of this happened because for some reason he \nthought he had power he doesn't actually have. I think there are some \nanalogies to what we are talking about.\n  Now, one of the rules he said he would adhere to, as far as the drone \nstrikes overseas, was that there has to be an imminence to the threat. \nThen his team of lawyers followed up and concluded: Well, it has to be \nimminent, but it doesn't have to be immediate. I think only a gaggle of \ngovernment lawyers could come together and say ``imminent'' doesn't \nmean ``immediate.''\n  Spencer Ackerman wrote, in Wired, about this. The title is, ``How \nObama Transformed an Old Military Concept So He Can Drone Americans.''\n\n       ``Imminence'' used to mean something in military terms; \n     namely, that an adversary had begun preparations for an \n     assault. In order to justify his drone strikes on American \n     citizens, President Obama redefined the concept to exclude \n     any actual adversary attack.\n\n  It is important to get that and to register that he has defined a \npotential imminent attack to mean that it excludes any actual adversary \nattack. So you are under imminent attack but there is no attack. It is \na bizarre logic, but it is done to widen what they can do to grant them \nmore power.\n  Ackerman goes on to say:\n\n       That's the heart of the Justice Department's newly leaked \n     white paper--\n  These drone memos--\n\n       first reported by NBC News, explaining why a ``broader \n     concept of imminence'' (.pdf) trumps traditional \n     Constitutional protections American citizens enjoy from being \n     killed by their government without due process. It's an \n     especially striking claim when considering that the actual \n     number of American citizens who are ``senior operational \n     leader[s] of al-Qaida or its associated forces'' is \n     vanishingly small. As much as Obama talks about rejecting the \n     concept of ``perpetual war'' he's providing, and \n     institutionalizing, a blueprint for it.\n\n  This is what we are talking about. Don't think if you give the \nPresident the power to kill Americans, that it is a temporary power.\n  The use of authorization of force, they say, has no geographic limit \nand no temporal limit. There is no end to the war. There is no end to \nthe lessening or the abrogation or the giving up of your rights. If you \ngive up your rights now, don't expect to get them back.\n  Ackerman goes on:\n\n       Imminence has always been a tricky concept. It used to \n     depend on observable battlefield preparations, like tanks \n     amassing near a front line, missile assemblage, or the \n     fueling of fighter jet squadrons. Even under those \n     circumstances, there has been little consensus--\n\n  internationally about various wars that we have had in the past.\n\n       President George W. Bush contended that the U.S. had to \n     invade Iraq not because the government knew Saddam Hussein \n     was about to launch an attack upon America, but because it \n     didn't.\n\n  Because it was unknown, because we fear things we don't know--we \ndon't know so we conclude yes, and we preemptively attack.\n\n       Bush contended that the uncertainty about Saddam's weapons \n     of mass destruction augmented by 9/11's warnings of shadowy \n     terrorist groups plotting undetectable attacks redefined \n     ``imminence. . . . ''\n\n  So when I say this is not a partisan battle, I am true to my word. \nPresident Bush started this. President Obama is expanding this.\n  The real irony, though, is President Obama ran as the anti-Bush \ncandidate. He ran as the guy with the real moral umbrage at what \nPresident Bush was doing and in the end he is taking Presidential power \nto a new level beyond what President Bush could have ever imagined. So \nBush contended that they could invade because they were uncertain about \nwhat Saddam could do. He:\n\n       . . . redefined ``imminence'' to mean the absence of \n     dispositive proof refuting the existence of an unconventional \n     weapons program. . . .\n\n  Imminence is the absence of proof that you don't have something. So \nyou have to prove a negative, you have to prove you don't have \nsomething, or you are an imminent threat.\n  That would be sort of like saying to Mexico: Prove to us you don't \nhave a nuclear weapon or we are going to bomb Mexico City. It is a \nbizarre notion of imminence. So Mexico is now an imminent threat to the \nUnited States because they are unwilling to prove they don't have a \nnuclear weapon. You can see the convoluted logic that occurs here.\n\n       But when U.S. troops invaded, they learned that Saddam did \n     not possess what Bush or Condoleezza Rice famously termed a \n     smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.\n       The undated Justice Department white paper, a summary of a \n     number of still-classified legal analyses, redefines \n     imminence once again. Al-Qaida leaders are ``continually \n     planning attacks,'' the undated white paper says, and so a \n     preemptive attack ``does not require the United States to \n     have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons \n     and interests in the immediate future.''\n\n  Realize what this means. First of all, nobody has an al-Qaida card. I \nthink we say every terrorist in the world is in al-Qaida because then \nthey have to prove otherwise. So nobody has an al-Qaida card. Everyone \nis in al-Qaida. So we say that unless you can prove that you are not \nattacking us, because we know the history of al-Qaida is to continue to \nattack us, we can preemptively attack you.\n  But now we are talking about bringing that kind of gobbledygook, \njumbled logic to the United States. Are these going to be the standards \nby which we kill Americans?\n  Ackerman goes on:\n\n       For an adversary attack to be ``imminent'' and a preemptive \n     U.S. response justified, U.S. officials need only \n     ``incorporate considerations of the relevant window of \n     opportunity, the possibility of reducing collateral damage to \n     civilians, and the likelihood of heading off future \n     disastrous attacks on America.''\n\n  So if we say al-Qaida is always attacking us and we say you are part \nof al-Qaida, then we can kill you. But the thing is, that is an \naccusation. If you are a U.S. citizen, you live in San Francisco or \nHouston or Seattle and someone says you are a member of al-Qaida, \nshould not you get a chance to defend yourself? Shouldn't you get to go \nto court? Shouldn't you get a lawyer? Are these not things that we \nwould want in our country?\n  Ackerman goes on. He says:\n\n       There is a subtlety at work in the Justice Department \n     framework. It takes imminence out of the context of something \n     an enemy\n\n[[Page S1188]]\n\n     does and places it into the context of a policymakers's \n     epistemic limitations.\n\n  So really we are not looking to say someone has a rocket launcher on \ntheir shoulder. We are saying because we think that these people do not \nlike us and will continue to attack us, we can preemptively kill them.\n  Realize that this kind of logic is being used overseas, and that is \ndebatable. But now they are going to bring this logic to America. So \nwhen you read stuff like this, that imminence is out of the equation \nand in its place we are going to put a ``policymaker's epistemic \nlimitations'' or estimation--that is how we are going to decide who is \ngoing to be killed in America? All we know is what we have in the \nforeign drone program.\n  We have no evidence yet because no one has told us. They just told us \nthey have not killed anyone yet, they don't intend to, but they might--\nbut they haven't told us what the rules are they are going to use in \nthis context--what rules are going to be used in America? If you are \ngoing to kill noncombatants, people eating dinner in America, there \nhave to be some rules. Does the Constitution apply?\n  When Eric Holder was asked about the fifth amendment, he said the \nfifth amendment applies when they think it applies. He says the \nexecutive branch is very careful and they are very conscious of the \nfifth amendment and they do try to apply the fifth amendment when they \ncan.\n  I mean, it is a different story when you are talking about a war \noverseas and you are talking about people who live in our country. You \ndon't get the option of determining when the fifth amendment applies.\n  Ackerman goes on to say:\n\n       If there is a reasonable debate about what imminence means \n     in an era of terrorism, and what standards ought to be \n     accepted for defining it as an international norm, that \n     framework--\n\nwhere they talk about that they are thinking about what the terrorist \nis thinking rather than what the terrorist is doing basically preempts \nthe whole idea of determining or trying to discuss or figure out what \nimminence really means.\n  Ackerman goes on:\n\n       All that matters to justify a drone strike attack is for \n     the U.S. to recognize that it can't be all-knowing.\n\n  So interestingly it's not intelligence that drives the attack, it's \nyou saying I don't know but I am worried that these people do attack us \ncontinuously, so by me not knowing their plans, that is a justification \nfor an attack. Realize, that could be the standard in the United \nStates.\n\n       It's the logical equivalent of the CIA's signature strikes, \n     which target anonymous military-age males in areas where \n     terrorists operate--\n\n  This should be the thing that should just scare the you-know-what out \nof you. If we are killing people overseas who we don't know their name \nbecause we think they are in a caravan going from a place where we \nthink there are bad people to another place where there are bad people, \nthat is a fairly loose standard. So, let's say there are people going \nfrom a Constitution Party meeting to a Libertarian Party meeting. Both \nthese groups don't like big government. They hate big government. They \nare opposed to government. They are nonviolent as far as I know, but \nthey were on the Fusion List for potential terrorists. Are we going to \nkill people in a caravan going from one meeting to the next? Are we \ngoing to have to name the person we kill in the United States?\n  You say, oh, that is absurd. We would never do that. Well, what about \nwhose phone we tap? Do we have to name that person? It used to be the \nrequirement. It has gotten less so over time. We have gotten to the \npoint where the fourth amendment protections to name the person, place, \nand what you want to look at have become looser over time. I think it \nis a legitimate question. If you are going to target Americans on \nAmerican soil, are you going to name them first? Are you going to tell \nus who is on the list? The list overseas is secret so the question is, \nis the list going to be secret in the United States? How do you get \nyour due process if you don't know you are on the list? It is a little \nbit late after the drone attack to say: Hey, it wasn't me. I didn't \nreally mean what I said in that e-mail. I should not have made that \ncomment on line.\n  Some liberals think they have had a double standard on this and \nhaven't been very good. Some have been more honest in their criticism \nof the President being hypocritical. The President seemed to be \nconcerned at one time about warrants for wiretaps. He seemed to be \nconcerned about Americans and torture. He seems to have lost a little \nbit of that when we talk about whether to kill Americans on American \nsoil.\n  Eugene Robinson, whom I would consider a liberal pundit, wrote an \narticle printed in the San Antonio News called ``Judicial Review Needed \nFor Drone Hits Of Citizens.'' He begins this way. He says:\n\n       If George W. Bush had told us that the ``war on terror'' \n     gave him the right to execute an American citizen overseas \n     with a missile fired from a drone aircraft, without due \n     process or judicial review, I'd have gone ballistic.\n\n  These are Eugene Robinson's words. If he had heard this about George \nBush, he would have gone ballistic. To his credit he says:\n\n       It makes no difference that the president making this \n     chilling claim is Barack Obama. What's wrong is wrong.\n\n  Robinson goes on to say:\n\n       The moral and ethical questions posed by the advent of \n     drone warfare are painfully complex. We had better start \n     working out some answers because, as an administration \n     spokesman told me recently, drone attacks are the ``new \n     normal'' in the ongoing struggle against terrorist groups \n     such as al-Qaida.\n\n  These attacks have become normal. They have become commonplace. They \nhave become the rule rather than the exception. But at least Eugene \nRobinson is someone who is consistent in his application of criticism. \nHe says he would have gone ballistic had George W. Bush done exactly \nwhat President Obama is doing and his response is, ``It makes no \ndifference that the president making this chilling claim is Barack \nObama. What's wrong is wrong.''\n  The question of when we get due process, whether it applies to you \nhere or overseas, is a big question. But under our concept of \ngovernment, it is not a question that should be left up to one branch \nof government. You know, should one branch of government get to decide \nthat you don't get due process? That the fifth amendment doesn't apply \nto you? This is an incredibly important question. John Brennan and the \nnomination today pale in comparison to that question. Does the \nPresident alone, unilaterally, get to decide whether the fifth \namendment applies to you? Or can he say that he is going to secretly \naccuse you of a crime and that the fifth amendment doesn't apply to \nyou?\n  This is worrisome because the Attorney General has been asked about \nthe applicability of the fifth amendment to the drone program. He said \nthe fifth amendment applies when they think it applies. He says they \ntry to give some kind of process. It is not due process. Due process \ninvolves a jury and a judge and public trial and an accusation. By \nprocess, they mean they get together and look at a PowerPoint \npresentation. They go through some flash cards and they decide who they \nare going to kill. That is the process. They may say you are demeaning \nthe process by treating it flippantly, about whether they are serious \nabout the process. Is that the process you want for someone in America? \nDo you want in America, for the process for you being accused of a \ncrime, to be a PowerPoint presentation by one branch of government, \nmaybe in a political party you are part of, maybe in a political party \nyou are not part of?\n  There are things in politics that are partisan. I don't think I would \nwant Americans to be subject to any partisanship with determining \nwhether you get the fifth amendment, whether you get a jury trial. I \ncan't imagine anybody would. I don't care whether it is a Republican or \nDemocrat, I don't want a politician deciding my innocence or guilt; it \nis as simple as that. The President should say unequivocally we are not \ngoing to kill noncombatants, we are not going to do PowerPoint \npresentations in the Oval Office on Tuesdays. We are not going to have \nTerrorist Tuesdays for Americans. He should say that. I don't think it \nis that hard. It is an easy question to the President.\n  Mr. President, are you going to have Terrorist Tuesdays for \nAmericans?\n  Are they going to put flashcards of Americans up and pass them around \nthe table in the Oval Office with pictures of Americans on them and \ndecide\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\nwho is going to die and who is going to live? Are they going to \npublicly charge people or are they going to secretly charge people? Are \nthey going to have any kind of trial or any kind of representation? \nDoes anybody get a chance to say: Hey, it wasn't me. I didn't do it. \nDoes anybody get a chance to represent or have representation?\n  This is an article we found interesting also by Noah Shachtman. This \nwas also printed in ``Wired.'' It is called ``U.S. Drones Can Now Kill \nJoe Schmoe Militants in Yemen.'' This is not quite about the domestic \nissue so much and a little bit about the foreign issue. However, there \nis a linkage between the foreign drone attacks and what will become the \ndomestic drone attacks.\n  Why? Because those are the only drone attacks we know and we have not \nbeen told that there will be an American plan for killing Americans and \na foreign plan for killing Americans or foreigners overseas. We have \nnot been told that. We have not been told anything. We have been told \nto go and sit in a corner--including the Senate and Congress--and be \nquiet. They have a process. They have a PowerPoint presentation, and \nthey have flashcards. I don't think that is adequate.\n  Noah Shachtman writes in ``Wired'':\n\n       In September, American-born militant Anwar al-Awlaki was \n     killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen. In the seven months \n     since, the al-Qaida affiliate there has only grown in power, \n     influence, and lethality. The American solution? Authorize \n     more drone attacks--\n\n  It kind of brings me back to that quote from the CIA agent. He said \ndrone attacks are like a lawnmower, but when you quit mowing the lawn, \nthe terrorists come back; sometimes they may be more numerous. The \nquestion is, Can they kill them all? Can they kill every terrorist in \nthe world? For every terrorist they kill, maybe 3 or 4 pop up--maybe 10 \npop up. What happens to the families who happen to be the ones whom we \nmake mistakes on or happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time?\n  I know the President's spokesman found it cute to say: Oh, they \nshould have chosen more responsible parents. I don't find that \nendearing or cute. I find it reprehensible to say that is the standard. \nWe have to ask the question: Is that going to be the standard in the \nUnited States? Are we going to kill people because they are related to \nbad people and then flippantly say they should have chosen better \nparents after we kill a 16-year-old? Shachtman goes on to write:\n\n       The American solution? Authorize more drone attacks--and \n     not just against well-known extremists like Awlaki, but \n     against nameless, faceless low-level terrorists as well.\n       A relentless campaign of unmanned airstrikes has \n     significantly weakened al-Qaida's central leadership in \n     Pakistan.\n\n  I am not saying we should not use drones. I am not saying they are \nnot a valuable weapon that has helped us to decimate our enemies. I am \njust saying it is different in a warzone than it is in our country. If \nthe President cannot acknowledge that being in battle somewhere is \ndistinctly different than walking down the street in Washington or \nBaltimore or Philadelphia, it is beyond me how we can let him get away \nwith that.\n\n       . . . militants were chosen for--\n\n  These drone strikes--\n\n     robotic elimination based solely on their intelligence \n     ``signatures''--their behavior, as captured by wiretaps, \n     overhead surveillance and local informants.\n\n  We don't know the names of the people who were killed in these drone \nstrikes except to know it was largely in the tribal areas of Pakistan. \nWe are targeting people and we do not know their names. We cannot know \nmuch about them if we don't know their names. We are targeting them by \ntheir signatures, where they go, and whom they visit.\n  Probably, inevitably, the milkman or the doctor has to go to the \nterrorist camp. Maybe some of them are complicit, but some of the \npeople who may not be quite the people we think we are after are in a \ncaravan going from city to city. Maybe they are in the local food \ndistribution business and make good money selling it. But the question \nis whether that is the kind of standard we would like to have in \nAmerica. Would a signature strike be acceptable in America? These are \nquestions that ought to be asked and the President ought to answer.\n  These people are being targeted by their signature. Their behavior is \ncaptured by wiretaps, overhead surveillance, and local informants.\n  Shachtman goes on to say:\n\n       A similar approach might not work in this case, however.\n\n  In Yemen, where we have a lot of drone strikes, he says:\n\n       Every Yemeni is armed.\n\n  It is going to be kind of hard to tell who is friend or foe when they \nare all fighting and they are all mad at each other.\n\n       So how can they differentiate between suspected militants \n     and armed Yemenis?\n\n  Shachtman goes on to say:\n\n       What's more, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula--the Yemeni \n     affiliate of the terror collective--``is joined at the hip'' \n     with an insurgency largely focused on toppling the local \n     government, another official told the Washington Post last \n     week. So there's a very real risk of America being \n     ``perceived as taking sides in a civil war.''\n       The Yemeni drone campaign--actually, two separate efforts \n     run by the CIA and the military's Joint Special Operations \n     Command--will still be more tightly restricted than the \n     Pakistani drone war at its peak. Potential targets need to be \n     seen or heard doing something that indicates they are \n     plotting against the West, or are high up the militant \n     hierarchy.\n       ``You don't necessarily need to know the guy's name. You \n     don't have to have a 10-sheet dossier on him. But you have to \n     know the activities this person has been engaged in,'' a U.S. \n     Official tells the Journal.\n       Gregory Johnsen, a Yemen specialist at Princeton \n     University, believes that these ``signature'' strikes--``or \n     something an awful lot like them''--have actually been going \n     on for quite a while in Yemen.\n\n  He goes on to say that he thinks that ``Awlaki's son was killed just \na month after his dad,'' in a signature strike. He says he thinks `` . \n. . there have been 13 attacks in Yemen in 2012.''\n  When we talk to people around here, they say there are no signature \nstrikes. What are we supposed to believe? A lot of people are saying \nthey have evidence and have heard there are signature strikes. Those in \npower who have the secret say we are not. It is hard to know what to \nbelieve.\n  I think one thing that is easy to understand, though, is that I \ncannot imagine we would allow such a standard in the United States \nwhere we don't name whom we are killing and that we kill people \ninvolved in a caravan. I think it should be pretty easy for the \nPresident to say there will be no signature strikes in America.\n  Shachtman goes on to say:\n\n       Many of them have hit lower-level militants, not top terror \n     names. This authorization only makes targeting killings \n     legally and bureaucratically kosher.\n       But despite the increased pace of strikes--those 13 attacks \n     are more than they were in all of 2011--al-Qaida in the \n     Arabian Peninsula. . . . In fact, White House \n     counterterrorism adviser John Brennan last week called it the \n     terror group's ``most active operational franchise.''\n       All of which leads Micah Zenko at the Council of Foreign \n     Relations to wonder where this drone campaign is going. ``By \n     any common-sense definition, these vast targeted killings \n     should be characterized as America's Third War since 9/11,'' \n     he writes. ``Unlike Iraq and Afghanistan--where government \n     agencies acted according to articulated strategies, \n     congressional hearings and press conferences provided some \n     oversight and timelines explicitly stating when the U.S. \n     combat role would end--the Third War is Orwellian in its lack \n     of cogent strategy, transparency, and end date.''\n       ``Since these attacks are covert, the administration will \n     offer no public defense, he adds. But ``it begs [CIA director \n     David] Petraeus' haunting question at the onset of the Iraq \n     war in 2003: ``Tell me how this ends?''\n\n  That is a question I have for the President: How does the war end? \nHow do we win? How do we declare victory and when will the war end? The \nproblem is we have come up with a scheme that basically has no \ngeographic limitations on where the war is fought. It is harder to \ndefeat an enemy if the entire war is the battlefield. It is not only a \nproblem with determining victory, it is a problem with ultimately \ncoming home.\n  The other problem with having no geographic limitations to this is \nsaying that war is here; the war is in America and the battlefield here \nat home is one where we are going to have rules or the laws of war are \ngoing to apply in our everyday life.\n  Before we were talking about drone strikes in America, the Center for \nConstitutional Rights has been concerned\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\neven about American citizens overseas. On September 30, they put out \nthis release which said:\n\n       Today, in response to the news that a missile attack by an \n     American drone aircraft had killed U.S. citizen Anwar Al-\n     Awlaki in Yemen, the Center for Constitutional Rights, which \n     had previously brought a challenge in federal court to the \n     legality of the authorization to target Al-Awlaki in Yemen, \n     released the following statement: ``The assassination of \n     Anwar Al-Awlaki by American drone attacks is the latest of \n     many affronts to domestic and international law'' . . . ''The \n     targeted assassination program that started under President \n     Bush and expanded under the Obama Administration essentially \n     grants the executive the power to kill any U.S. citizen \n     deemed a threat, without any judicial oversight or any of the \n     rights afforded by our Constitution. If we allow such gross \n     overreaches of power to continue, we are setting the stage \n     for increasing erosions of civil liberties and the rule of \n     law.''\n\n  Now what they have said there is not completely noncontroversial, and \nI might even take some issue with the fact that they are saying the \nConstitution applies everywhere. Some argue it applies to U.S. citizens \nwhether here or at home, and I think there is some debate as to that. I \nthink the only place we can guarantee that the Constitution applies is \nin our country. The only border we ultimately control is in our \ncountry. The courts we ultimately control are here. However, the entity \ndoing the killing is the American military killing a citizen overseas. \nSo I personally have been of the belief that what we should do is try \npeople for treason. It is one of the four crimes in the Constitution \nthat is actually labeled, displayed, and given to the Federal courts.\n\n  There are specifics on what is actually treason. I personally don't \nthink it would be that hard to try people for treason. I think we could \ndo it without--we could start at the very top court and not have appeal \nafter appeal.\n  I think there was evidence that al-Awlaki could have been tried in \nFederal court for treason and then targeted.\n  People say: Why would we want to give any protection to people who \nhave denounced their citizenship, who hate America, and who are \nconspiring with the enemy?\n  I guess the way I would respond is that I don't like murderers and \nrapists either. I don't like violent people who commit crimes in our \ncountry. But because we prize our system so much and because we want to \nmake sure we arrest, convict, and possibly execute the right person, we \nhave trials. So we think it is pretty important that we have trials. So \nI agree when people say these are bad people. Yes, these are bad \npeople. Many of them deserve what they get. The problem is, if we give \nup on the process of how we do it, if we give up on the Constitution, \nor if we say that kind of standard is going to be brought back to the \nhomeland, or if we say America is a battlefield, there is a real \nproblem. There is a problem in doing that because I think if we do \nthat, the standard becomes so loose, we really won't have what we \nreally expect as Americans.\n  The Center for the Constitutional Rights goes on with this comment by \nPardiss Kebriaei, a senior staff attorney. They went to the court, and \nthey asked for information on some of these drone strikes, and they \nwere denied. She responds:\n\n       In dismissing our complaint, the district court noted that \n     there were nonetheless disturbing questions raised by the \n     authority being asserted by the United States.\n\n  There certainly are disturbing questions that need to be asked again \nand answered by the U.S. Government about the circumstances and the \nkilling and legal standard that governs it.\n  In October 2012 there was an article by Greg Miller in the Washington \nPost. It was entitled ``Plan for Hunting Terrorists Signals U.S. \nIntends to Keep Adding Names To Kill List.'' The editor notes that this \nproject was based on interviews with dozens of current and former \nnational security officials, intelligence analysts, and others who have \nexamined and were examining the U.S. counterterrorism policies and the \npractice of targeted killings.\n  This is the first of three stories that appeared:\n\n       Over the past 2 years, the Obama administration has been \n     secretly developing a new blueprint for pursuing terrorists, \n     a next-generation targeting list called the ``disposition \n     matrix.''\n       The matrix contains the names of terrorism suspects arrayed \n     against an accounting of the resources being marshaled to \n     track them down, including sealed indictments and clandestine \n     operations. U.S. officials said the database is designed to \n     go beyond existing kill lists, mapping plans for the \n     ``disposition'' of suspects beyond the reach of American \n     drones.\n       Although the matrix is a work in progress, the effort to \n     create it reflects a reality setting in among the nation's \n     counterterrorism ranks: The United States' conventional wars \n     are winding down, but the government expects to continue \n     adding names to kill or capture lists for years.\n       Among senior Obama administration officials, there is a \n     broad consensus that such operations are likely to be \n     extended at least another decade. Given the way al-Qaida \n     continues to metastasize, some officials said no clear end is \n     in sight.\n       ``We can't possibly kill everyone who wants to harm us,'' a \n     senior administration said. ``It's a necessary part of what \n     we do . . . We're not going to wind up in 10 years in a world \n     of everybody holding hands any saying, ``We love America.''\n       That timeline suggests that the United States has reached \n     only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on \n     terrorism. Targeting lists that were regarded as finite \n     emergency measures after the attacks of September 11 are now \n     fixtures of the national security apparatus. The rosters \n     expand and contract with the pace of drone strikes but never \n     go to zero.\n       Meanwhile, a significant milestone looms: The number of \n     militants and civilians killed in the drone campaign over 10 \n     years will soon exceed 3,000 by certain estimates.\n\n  We have heard an estimate recently by a Member of the Senate who said \n4,700 have been killed.\n\n       The Obama administration has touted its successes against \n     the terrorist network, including the death of Osama bin \n     Laden, as signature achievements that argue for President \n     Obama's reelection. The administration has taken tentative \n     steps toward greater transparency, formally acknowledging for \n     the first time the United States' use of armed drones.\n       Less visible is the extent to which Obama has \n     institutionalized the highly classified practice of targeted \n     killing, transforming ad-hoc elements into a counterterrorism \n     infrastructure capable of sustaining a seemingly permanent \n     war.\n       Spokesmen for the White House, the National \n     Counterterrorism Center, the CIA and other agencies declined \n     to comment on the matrix. Privately, officials acknowledge \n     that the development of the matrix is part of a series of \n     moves, in Washington and overseas, to embed counterterrorism \n     tools into U.S. policy for the long haul.\n       White House counterterrorism adviser John O. Brennan is \n     seeking to codify the administration's approach to generating \n     capture/kill lists, part of a broader effort . . .\n       CIA Director David Petraeus is pushing for an expansion of \n     the agency's fleet of armed drones. The proposal, which would \n     need White House approval, reflects the agency's \n     transformation into a paramilitary force and makes clear that \n     it does not intend to dismantle its drone program and return \n     to pre-September 11 focus on gathering intelligence.\n       The U.S. Joint Special Operations Command, which carried \n     out the raid that killed bin Laden, has moved command teams \n     into suspected terrorist hotbeds in Africa. A rugged U.S. \n     outpost in Djibouti has been transformed into a launchpad for \n     counterterrorism operations across the Horn of Africa and \n     into the Middle East.\n       The Joint Special Operations Command has also established a \n     secret targeting center across the Potomac River from \n     Washington. The current and former U.S. official said the \n     elite command's targeting cells have traditionally been \n     located along the front lines of its missions, including Iraq \n     and Afghanistan. But the joint committee has now created a \n     national capital region task force that is a 15-minute \n     commute from the White House so it can be more directly \n     involved in deliberations about the al-Qaida list.\n       The developments were described by current and former \n     officials from the White House as well as intelligence and \n     counterterrorism agencies. Most spoke on the condition of \n     anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. These \n     counterterrorism components have been affixed to a legal \n     foundation for targeted killings the Obama administration \n     has discussed more openly over the past year. In a series \n     of speeches, administration officials have cited the legal \n     basis, including the congressional authorization to use \n     military force.\n\n  This really gets to the crux of the matter, which is that the \nauthorizations for all of these activities around the world and then \nultimately here at home all come from the use of authorization of force \nwhen we went to war against Afghanistan after 9/11. The problem is, how \ndo we finally conclude war? Is perpetual war OK with everybody? How \nwould we conclude the war in Afghanistan?\n  The President said he is bringing troops home. It is actually another \nthing I admire about the President. I think it is time to come home. I \nthink we have accomplished our battle. I think we have accomplished our \nplan. But the thing is, if we are going to end\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\nthe war, why would we not end the war? I think it means we end that war \nand we go somewhere else. There is a question of whether we can \ncontinually afford perpetual war. There is a question of whether it is \nadvisable. There is a question of whether or not we go so many places \nthat maybe in the end we are doing more harm than good.\n  The thing about the wars as they go on is we have to figure out a way \nto try to end war. We have to figure out a way to try to limit war. Our \ngoal shouldn't be to expand war to proportions that have no limit. To \nsay there are no geographic limits on war I don't think should be an \nadmirable thing. I think it is a mistake in policy to say we can have \nperpetual war with no limits, with no geographic limits, with no \ntemporal limits.\n  It is hard to end a war anymore, though. It used to be easy. In the \nold days, you won a war and you came home. The problem is that we can't \neven end the Iraq war. The Iraq war has been over for a couple of years \nnow--at least a couple of years. I tried to introduce a resolution to \nend the Iraq war, to deauthorize the war, and it was voted down. I \nthink I got less than 15 votes. How do we end war?\n  The problem is that people take these resolutions and they stretch \nthem and they pull them and they contort them to mean things that \nreally they were never intended to mean. I don't think being involved \nin a protracted war in Yemen or Mali or any of these other places was \nintended when we went to war in Afghanistan. I just don't think that \nwas the intention.\n  Critics contend that the justifications for the drone war have become \nmore tenuous as the campaign has extended further and further beyond \nthe core group of al-Qaida operatives behind the strikes on New York \nand Washington. Critics note that the administration still doesn't \nconfirm the CIA's involvement or the identities of those who were \nkilled. Certain strikes are now under legal challenge, including the \nkilling last year of the son of al-Awlaki.\n  Counterterrorism experts have said, though, that the reliance on \nthese targeted killings is self-perpetuating, yielding undeniable \nshort-term results that may obscure the long-term costs. I think that \nis a good way of putting it because when we think about it, obviously, \nthey are killing some bad people. This is war, and there has been some \nshort-term good. The question is, Does the short-term good outweigh the \nlong-term costs not only in dollars but the long-term costs of whether \nwe are encouraging a next generation of terrorists?\n  This is a quote from Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst. He says:\n\n       The problem with the drones is it's like your lawn mower. \n     You got to mow the lawn all the time. The minute you stop \n     mowing, the grass is going to grow back.\n\n  Maybe there is an infinite number of terrorists. Maybe the drone \nstrikes aren't the ultimate answer. There are a billion Muslims in the \nworld. Maybe there needs to be some component of this that isn't just \nthe killing fields. I am not saying that many of these people aren't \nallied against us and would attack us and they don't deserve to die; I \nam just not sure it is the ultimate answer, it is the ultimate way. I \nam also concerned that the people who are the strongest proponents of \nthis are also those who want to bring the war to America and say that \nAmerica is part of this perpetual battlefield.\n\n       The United States now operates multiple drone programs, \n     including acknowledged U.S. military patrols over conflicted \n     zones in Afghanistan and Libya and classified CIA \n     surveillance flights over Iran. Strikes against al-Qaida, \n     however, are carried out under secret lethal programs \n     involving the CIA and the CSOC. The matrix was developed by \n     the NCTC under former Director Michael Leiter to augment \n     those organizations' separate but overlapping kill lists. The \n     result is a single, continually evolving database in which \n     biographies, locations, known associates, and affiliated \n     organizations are all catalogued.\n       So are strategies for taking targets down, including \n     extradition requests, capture operations and drone patrols.\n       Obama's decision to shutter the CIA's secret prisons ended \n     a program that had become a source of international scorn, \n     but it also complicated the pursuit of terrorists. Unless a \n     suspect surfaced in the sights of a drone . . . the United \n     States had to scramble to figure out what to do.\n       ``We had a disposition problem,'' said a former U.S. \n     counterterrorism official. . . .\n       The database is meant to map out contingencies, creating an \n     operational menu that spells out each agency's role in case a \n     suspect surfaces in an unexpected spot. ``If he's in Saudi \n     Arabia, pick up with the Saudis,'' the former official said. \n     ``If traveling overseas to al-Shabaab . . . we can pick him \n     up by ship. If in Yemen, kill or have the Yemenis pick him \n     up.''\n\n  There has been some discussion as to what to do with these people. It \nis a complicated situation, but I think the take-home message from all \nof this is that what we are stuck in is a very messy sort of \ndecisionmaking, a type of decisionmaking that I do not think is \nappropriate for the homeland, for the United States. I think the idea \nthat in the United States this is to be a battlefield, and you do not \nneed an attorney, you do not need a court, or you do not get due \nprocess, is really repugnant to the American people, and should be.\n  I think it is something we have given up on too easily if we let the \nPresident dictate the terms of this. If the President is unwilling to \nsay clearly and unequivocally that he is not going to kill \nnoncombatants in America, I do not think we should tolerate that. I \nthink there should be a huge outcry and the President should come \nforward and explain his position.\n  This discussion tonight is not so much about John Brennan, it is not \nabout his nomination so much as it is about whether we believe that in \nAmerica there are some rights that are so special that we are not \nwilling to give up on these.\n  So as we move forward into this debate, it is not about who gets \nnominated to be the head of the CIA. It is about principles that are \nbigger than the people. It is about something bigger and larger than \nthe people involved. It is about constitutional principles that we \nshould not give up on.\n  I think we should all judge as inadequate the President's response \nwhen he says he has not killed Americans in America yet, he does not \nintend to, but that he might. I do not think that is a response that we \nshould tolerate.\n  So as we move forward in this debate, we need to understand and we \nneed to fight for something that is classically American, something we \nare proud of and something our soldiers fight for; that is, our rights, \nour individual rights, our right to be seen as an American, to be tried \nin a court by our peers. I think if we are to give up on that it is a \nhuge mistake.\n  One of the things we have to ask is, What kind of standard will there \nbe? If there is going to be a program in America, what kind of \nstandard? If we are going to kill Americans in America, what kind of \nstandard will there be?\n  If the standard is to be sympathy, you can imagine the craziness of \nthis.\n  Mr. President, I would at this time yield for a question, without \nyielding the floor, from my colleague from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Through the Chair, Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator \nfrom Kentucky a couple of questions.\n  I have been listening to the conversation, to the debate, to the \ndiscussion on the Senate floor throughout the afternoon, and I would \nask the Senator from Kentucky these questions: Is it not true that the \nConstitution of the United States is a document designed to protect the \nfreedoms and liberties of Americans?\n  I would ask the Senator from Kentucky, while sometimes perceived to \nbe a grant of authority, is not really the main purpose of the U.S. \nConstitution to make sure the American people enjoy certain liberties \nand freedoms that the Founding Fathers who wrote that document believed \nwere important for American citizens? And whether or not that is true, \nI will let the Senator from Kentucky tell me, but if that is the case, \nif it is constitutional to intentionally kill an American citizen in \nthe United States without due process of law, then what is not \nconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution?\n  If the conclusion is reached--as the administration, at least, is \nunwilling to say that is not the case--if the conclusion is reached \nthat it is within the powers of the Constitution for the executive to \nallow for the killing of an American citizen in the United States, then \nwhat is left in our Constitution that would prohibit other behavior? If \nyou can go this far, what liberties remain for Americans?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I think it is a good question because, \nultimately,\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\nthe question is, Who gets to decide? Does the President get to decide \nunilaterally that he is going to do this? And how would you challenge \nit? If you are dead, you have a tough time challenging, basically, his \nauthority to do this.\n  But, no, I cannot imagine in any way that you can usurp and go beyond \nthe constitutional requirements in the United States. I see no way he \ncan do that, and I cannot imagine that he would even assert such a \nthing. But it still boggles the mind that he will not explicitly say he \nwill not do this.\n  Mr. MORAN. Well, I would, again, through the Presiding Officer, ask a \nquestion of the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Again, in the absence of the assurance or the statement \nfrom the administration--from the President of the United States or his \nAttorney General--I ask the Senator from Kentucky, is not this the \nappropriate venue for us to insist upon that answer? Is it not \nappropriate for this to be the venue on which we, as a U.S. Senate, \nmake clear that it is unconstitutional, in our view, for the death of a \nU.S. citizen in the United States by military action?\n  This is the opportune moment because of the pending confirmation of \nthe nomination of the head of the Central Intelligence Agency. So while \ntoday's order of business really is an administrative appointment, is \nthis issue not so important that we need to utilize this moment, this \ntime in the Senate to make certain that question is answered in a way \nthat makes clear--not only for today and for the current occupant of \nthe CIA and its administration, but for all future Americans, all \nfuture CIAs, all future military leaders--that it is clear that in the \nUnited States American citizens cannot be killed without due process of \nlaw?\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I think it is a good point. I think also a \npoint to be made is that one resolution to this impasse would be to \nhave a resolution come forward from the Senate saying exactly that; \nthat our understanding is--and this has been something that Senator \nCruz and I have discussed: whether we should limit the President's \npower by legislation or by resolution, basically saying that repealing \nan imminent threat is something the President can do, but killing \nnoncombatants is not something that is allowed under the Constitution.\n  I think the courts would rule that way should the courts ever have to \nrule on this. But it would be much simpler and more healthy for the \ncountry if the President would simply come out and say that.\n  Mr. MORAN. Perhaps, Mr. President, finally, I would ask the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, while this opportunity to discuss this issue on the \nSenate floor has occurred today, it certainly is an opportunity for the \nAmerican people to understand a significant basic constitutional right \nmay be at stake. And while the Senator from Kentucky has led this \ndiscussion, I would ask him, has he now received, as a result of \nbringing this attention to this issue, any additional reassurances from \nthe Attorney General or the President of the United States that the \nadministration agrees that there is no constitutional right to end the \nlife of an American citizen using a drone flying over the lands of the \nUnited States and attacking a U.S. citizen?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, since we began this today, I have had no \ncommunications from the White House or the Attorney General. The only \nthing we have gotten indirectly was that the Attorney General was \nbefore the Judiciary Committee today and that he did seem to backtrack \nor acknowledge a little bit, under withering cross-examination. He was \nnot very forthcoming in saying what we would like to hear: that they \nwill not kill noncombatants in America. But I think that is still a \npossibility from them. I think his answers were not inconsistent with \nthat.\n  But you would think it would be a little bit easier and they would \nmake it easier on everyone, and you would think they would want to \nreassure the public that they have no intention--not just they have no \nintention--but that they will not kill Americans.\n  Mr. MORAN. Again, Mr. President, if I can ask the Senator from \nKentucky a question through the Presiding Officer, while there is a \nsignificantly important issue before the Senate today--and that is the \nconfirmation of the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency--I \nwould ask the Senator from Kentucky, is not the more important issue, \nthe less pedestrian issue, that we face on the Senate floor and in the \nUnited States of America one that has been with us throughout our \nhistory, one that was with us when the Constitution was written, and \none that has been with us every day thereafter; that is, what is the \nmeaning of the words contained in the U.S. Constitution, and what do \nthey mean for everyday citizens, that they know that their own \ngovernment is constrained by a document created now more than 200 years \nago? Is that not the most important question that faces our country and \nits citizens on a daily, ongoing basis?\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes, I think American citizens get that. But not only that, \nI come from a State that has two large military bases. When our \nsoldiers go off--and when I talk to them--they talk of fighting for our \nBill of Rights, they talk of fighting for our Constitution. They do not \nthink they are going off to conquer any people. They truly believe and \nthey honestly appraise that they are fighting for our Bill of Rights.\n  So that is why I see this as somewhat of an insult to our soldiers, \nto say that and to insinuate somehow that the Bill of Rights is not so \nimportant; that our fear is going to guide us away or take us away from \nsomething so fundamental and so important.\n  I think Americans do realize that the protections of having a jury \ntrial are incredibly important and that assessing guilt is not always \neasy when you are accused of a crime. I think Americans know it is \nreally important to try to get it right when someone is accused of a \ncrime. So I think the American people are with us in wanting to find \nthese answers.\n  The Senator is right. This is not ultimately about the nomination; \nthis is about a question that is bigger than any individual. It is \nabout something that our country was founded upon; that is, basically, \nthe individual rights.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nresponding to my questions.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we have had a good and healthy debate today. \nI think we have hit upon a few points. We may have even hit a couple \npoints more than once.\n  When we think about it and put it in perspective, so many of the \nbattles we have up here are battles that I think the American public is \nsometimes disgusted with. They see a lot of things we do as petty and \npartisan. Sometimes I see disagreements up here that I think are \ncompletely partisan and completely petty on both sides.\n  But I think this issue is different in the sense that this is not \nabout this particular individual and his nomination. I have actually \nvoted for the President's first three nominations to his Cabinet. So I \nhave not taken a partisan position that the President cannot nominate \nhis political appointees. I have looked carefully at the nominees. I \nhave asked for more information. I have tried to extend debate on some \nof the nominees. But in the end, I voted for three out of three and \nmany of the judges that the President has put forward, not necessarily \nbecause I agree with their politics. I do not agree with much of the \nPresident's politics.\n  In fact, one of the few things I did agree with the President on was \nthe idea of civil liberties, was the idea that you do not tap someone's \nphone without a wire, without a warrant, that you do not torture \nAmericans, and that you did not kill Americans without due process. \nThese are things I thought the President and I agreed on. So I am not \nso sure exactly, you know, where we stand with that. I actually kind of \nthink that probably he still does agree with me, or I still agree with \nhim. But the question is, why cannot he publicly go ahead and announce \nhe is not going to kill noncombatants?\n  This is a resolution we have talked about. This resolution says: ``To \nexpress the sense of the Senate against the use of drones to execute \nAmerican citizens on American soil.''\n\n       Expressing the sense of the Senate against the use of \n     drones to execute American citizens on American soil. \n     Resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that the use of \n     drones to execute or target American citizens on American \n     soil who pose no imminent\n\n[[Page S1193]]\n\n     threat clearly violates the constitutional due process of \n     rights. The American people deserve a clear, concise and \n     unequivocal public statement from the President of the United \n     States that contains detailed legal reasoning, including but \n     not limited to the balance between national security and due \n     process, limits of executive power, and distinction between \n     the treatment of citizens and noncitizens within and outside \n     the borders of the United States.\n       The use of lethal force against American citizens and the \n     use of drones in the application of the lethal force within \n     the United States territory.\n\n  There is another article that I think is of interest. This is another \narticle by Spencer Ackerman in Wired. This talks about once again the \nsignature strikes, the idea that basically we are killing people whose \nnames we did not know. The title of this was: ``CIA Drones Kill Large \nGroups Without Knowing Who They Are.''\n\n       The expansion of the CIA's undeclared drone war into the \n     tribal areas of Pakistan required a big expansion of who can \n     be marked for death. Once the standard for targeted killings \n     was top-level leaders in al-Qaeda or one of its allies. \n     That's long gone, especially as the number of people targeted \n     at once has grown.\n       This is the new standard, according to a blockbuster piece \n     in the Wall Street Journal: ``Men believed to be militants \n     associated with terrorist groups, but whose identities aren't \n     always known.'' [may be targeted.] The CIA is now killing \n     people without knowing who they are, on suspicion of \n     association with terrorist groups. The article does not \n     define the standards, [but the standards are said to be] \n     ``suspicion'' and ``association.''\n\n  While this is overseas, it kind of gets to the point we have been \ntalking about: What is the standard that will be used in America? If we \nare to have drone strikes in America, what is the standard we will use? \nIs it a standard that says you have to be suspicious, or that you have \nto be associated?\n  Strikes targeting those people, usually groups of such people, are \nwhat we call signature strikes. The bulk of the CIA's drone strikes are \nsignature strikes now, which is a remarkable thing. So what we are \ntalking about--that is one of the reasons why we are concerned here--is \nthat if the President claims he can do strikes in America, and the bulk \nof the current strikes overseas are signature strikes, would it not be \nworrisome that we could kill people in America without evening knowing \ntheir name?\n\n       The bulk of CIA's drone strikes now are ``signature'' \n     strikes.\n\n  It was written in the Wall Street Journal in an article by Adam \nEntous, Siobhan Gorman, and Julian Barnes. And the ``bulk'' really \nmeans the bulk. The Journal reports that the growth in clusters of \npeople targeted by the CIA has required the agency to tell its \nPakistani counterparts about mass attacks. We are talking about pretty \nsignificant attacks here. They are only notifying them when they are \ngoing to kill more than 20 at a time.\n  Determining who is the target is not a question of intelligence \ncollection. The cameras on the CIA fleet of Predators and Reapers work \njust fine. It is a question of intelligence analysis, interpreting the \nimagery collected from the drones, from the spies and spotters below, \nto understand who is a terrorist and who, say, drops off the \nterrorist's laundry. Admittedly in a war with a shadowy enemy, it can \nbe difficult to distinguish between the two. So the question is, is \nthis the kind of standard we will use in the United States? Will we use \na standard where people do not have to be named? We do not know. The \nPresident has indicated his drone strikes in America will have \ndifferent rules than his drone strikes outside of America. But we have \nheard no rules on what those drone strikes will be.\n  So we have drone strikes inside and outside. They are going to have \ndifferent rules. But we already know that in a large percentage of the \ndrone strikes overseas we are not naming the person. Is that going to \nbe the standard? We also know we have targeted people for sympathizing \nwith the enemy. We talked about that before. In the 1960s, we had many \npeople who sympathized with North Vietnam. Many people will remember \nJane Fonda swiveling herself around in a North Vietnamese artillery and \nthinking, gleefully, that she was just right at home with the North \nVietnamese.\n  I am not a great fan of Jane Fonda. I am really not too interested in \nputting her on a drone kill list either. We have had many people who \nhave dissented in our country. We have had people in our country who \nhave been against the Afghan war, against the Iraq war. I was opposed \nto the Iraq war. There have been people against the government on \noccasion. What are the criteria for who will be killed? Does the fifth \namendment apply? Will the list be secret or not secret? Can you kill \nnoncombatants?\n  And people say, well, the President would never kill noncombatants. \nThe problem is, is that is who we are killing overseas. We are alleging \nthat they may be conspiring someday to be combatants or they might have \nbeen yesterday. But are we going to take that same kind of standard and \nuse it in America? Are we going to have a standard that if you are on \nyour iPad typing an email in a cafe that you can be targeted in a drone \nstrike? These are not questions that are inconsequential. These are \nquestions that should be known. These are questions that should be \npublic. These are questions that should be discussed in Congress. In \nfact, we should not be asking him for drone memos, we should be giving \nhim drone memos. We should not be asking him how is he going to run the \ndrone program, we should be telling him how he is to run the drone \nprogram. That is our authority. We have abdicated our authority. We do \nnot do what we are supposed to. We are supposed to be the checks and \nbalances. But we have let the President make those decisions because we \nhave largely abdicated our responsibility.\n\n  In this Spencer Ackerman story from Wired, he talks about and goes on \nto say:\n\n       Fundamentally, though, it is a question of policy, whether \n     it is acceptable for the CIA to kill someone without fully \n     knowing if he is the bombsmith or the laundry guy.\n\n  The Journal reports:\n\n       The CIA's willingness to strike without such knowledge, \n     sanctioned in full by President Barack Obama, is causing \n     problems for the State Department and the military. As we \n     have written this week, the high volume of drone attacks in \n     Pakistani tribal areas contributes to Pakistani intransigence \n     on another issue of huge importance to the United States, \n     convincing Pakistan to deliver the insurgent groups it \n     sponsors to peace talks aimed at ending the Afghan war. The \n     drones do not cause that intransigence. Pakistani leaders, \n     after all, cooperate with the drones and exploit popular \n     anti-American sentiment to shake down Washington. The strikes \n     become cards for Pakistan to play, however cynically.\n\n  I think this is quite true of Pakistan. They play both sides to the \nmiddle. They play both sides to get more money from us. I think they \nhave been complicit in the drone attacks, and then they complain about \nthem publicly. They have two faces, one to their people, and one \nprivately to us. But the question is, have we gotten involved more in \nPakistan than getting al-Qaida leaders, and have we gotten more \ninvolved with a war in Pakistan that involves people who want to be \nfree of their central government?\n  Ultimately, we as a country need to figure out how to end the war. We \nhave had the war in Afghanistan for 12 years now. The war basically has \nauthorized a worldwide war. Not only am I worried about the perpetual \nnature of the war, I am also worried that there are no geographic \nlimitations to the war. But I am particularly concerned, and what today \nhas all been about, I am worried that they say the United States is the \nbattlefield now. My side, their side, the President, everybody thinks \nthat America is the battlefield. The problem is, they all think you do \nnot get due process in a battlefield. Largely they are correct. When \nyou are overseas in a battlefield, it is hard to have due process. We \nare not going to ask for Miranda rights before we shoot people in \nbattle. But America is different.\n  So one of the most important things I hope that will come from today \nis people will say and people will listen: How do we end the war in \nIraq? How do we end the war in Afghanistan? I got a vote. I tried to \nend the Iraq war 2 years after it ended, by taking away the \nauthorization of use of force. I still could not get that voted on.\n  It is even more important not only to end the war in Iraq, but \nultimately to end the war in Afghanistan. Because the war in \nAfghanistan, the use of authorization of force is used to create a \nworldwide war without limitations, to create a war that some say the \nbattlefield is here at home. This battlefield being here at home means \nyou do not get due process at home.\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\n  There have been Members of the Senate stand up and say, when they ask \nyou for a lawyer, you tell them to shut up. Is that the kind of due \nprocess we want in our country? Is that what we are moving toward? So \nthe questions we are asking here are important questions. These \nquestions are: Does the Bill of Rights apply? Can they have exceptions \nto the Bill of Rights?\n  One of the articles from the National Review recently was by Kevin \nWilliams. We got into this a little bit earlier. I thought it was an \nimportant article because it talked about what our concern is is about \nwhat standard we will use. What will be the standard for how we kill \nAmericans in America? He talked a little bit about how his belief is \nthat al-Awlaki was targeted mainly as a propagandist. An interesting \nthing about al-Awlaki is that before he was targeted, he was actually \ninvited to the Pentagon. We considered him to be a moderate Islamist \nfor a while.\n  We invited him to the Pentagon. I think he actually gave and said \nprayers in the Capitol at one point.\n  The question is if we made a mistake the first time about whether he \nwas our friend--and I think we did--could you make a mistake on the \nother end? The question is, if governments are to decide who are \nsympathizers and people who are politicians, with no checks or \nbalances, are to decide who is a sympathizer, is there a danger that \npeople who have political dissent could be included in this?\n  The way Williamson describes al-Awlaki was that he was first and \nforemost an al-Qaida propagandist. He was a preacher and a blogger who \nfirst began to provoke United States authorities through the online \nbile which earned him the faintly ridiculous sobriquet the bin Laden of \nthe Internet.\n  Was he an active participant in planning acts of terrorism against \nthe United States? The FBI did not think so, at least in the wake of 9/\n11 attacks. The Bureau interviewed him four times and concluded he was \nnot involved. The Defense Department famously invited him to dine at \nthe Pentagon as part of the Islamic outreach efforts, and in 2002 he \nwas conducting prayers in the U.S. Capitol.\n  Throughout the following years, al-Awlaki became a sort of al-Qaida \ngadfly, dangerous principally because he was fluent in English and, \ntherefore, a more effective propagandist. It was not until the first \nObama administration that al-Awlaki was promoted by United States \nauthorities from propagandist to operations man.\n  You may remember the context. The Obama administration had been \nplanning to try 9/11 conspirators in New York City when the country was \nthrown into a panic by the machinations of the would-be underpants \nbomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.\n  The Obama administration, in an interesting about-face--whereas it \nhad been planning to try Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in New York and his \ncoconspirators there, definitively turning our back on Guantanamo--\nturned around and made a decision that it couldn't do it in New York. \nAl-Awlaki was a part of this. He was a propagandist and part of this. \nThey said Abdulmutallab actually sought out al-Awlaki in Yemen and al-\nAwlaki had blessed his bomb plot and even introduced him to a \nbombmaker. This, according to the Obama administration, is what \njustified treating al-Awlaki as a man at arms earning him a place on \nthe national secret hit list.\n  Williamson asked this question:\n\n       If sympathizing with our enemies and propagandizing on \n     their behalf is the equivalent to making war on the country, \n     then the Johnson and Nixon administrations should have bombed \n     every elite college campus in the country during the 1960s.\n\n  These are his words, not mine. He goes on:\n\n       And as satisfying as putting Jane Fonda on a kill list \n     might have been, I do not think that our understanding of the \n     law would encourage such a thing, even though she did give \n     priceless aid to the communist aggressors in Vietnam. \n     Students in Ann Arbor, MI, were actively and openly raising \n     funds for the Vietcong throughout the war. Would it have been \n     proper to put them on kill lists?\n\n  I don't know.\n  Williamson said:\n\n       I do not think that it would. There is a difference between \n     sympathizing with our enemies and taking up arms against the \n     country.\n\n  They aren't the same thing. We have to ask ourselves, what is the \nstandard? Could political dissent be part of the standard for drone \nstrikes?\n  You say, well, that is ridiculous. We have listed people already on \nWeb sites and said they were at risk for terrorism for their political \nbeliefs. The Fusion Center in Missouri listed people who were of pro-\nlife origin and listed people who believed in secure borders for \nimmigration. They listed people who were supporters of third-party \ncandidates, the Constitution Party or the Libertarian Party. These \npeople were listed in a mailing sent out to all the police in the State \nto be aware of these people. Be aware of people who have bumper \nstickers on their cars supporting these people.\n  That, to me, sounds dangerously close to having a standard where the \nstandard is sympathy not for your enemies but sympathy for unpopular \nideas or ideas that aren't popular with the government. That concerns \nme. It concerns whether we could have in our country a standard that is \nless than the Constitution. The Constitution is a standard where I \ncan't imagine we would want to give up on this standard, or any \nPresident could assert a standard would not be the Constitution.\n  There was an article in Human Rights First which was published in \nDecember of 2012. It begins with this prefacing statement:\n\n       We are establishing precedents that other nations may \n     follow, and not all of those nations may--and not all of them \n     will be nations that share our interests or the premium we \n     put on protecting human life, including citizens.\n\n  This was a statement by John Brennan. It is a statement that actually \ncarries some weight and should be thought through. This is the reason \nwhy I say this filibuster is not so much about Brennan as it is about a \nconstitutional principle.\n  The Obama administration has dramatically escalated targeted killing \nby drones as the central feature of counterterrorism response.\n  Mr. President, at this time I have a unanimous consent request. I \nwish to read it into the Record. With this unanimous consent request, I \nwould emphasize that this would be ending the debate and allowing a \nvote on Brennan. Part of this unanimous consent request would be the \nestablishment of a vote on this resolution as well as setting a vote up \non the confirmation of John Brennan to be CIA Director.\n  The resolution states:\n\n       Resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       1. The use of drones to execute, or to target, American \n     citizens on American soil who pose no imminent threat clearly \n     violates the constitutional due process rights of citizens.\n\n  That is the most important clause of that. I think it is important \nfor the American people to know that apparently the other side is going \nto object. Object. It is important to know the majority party here in \nthe Senate, the party of the President, is going to object to this \nstatement being voted on. They may still vote against it if they wish, \nbut they are going to object, I understand, to having a vote on this \nstatement. The use of drones to execute a target, American citizens on \nAmerican soil, who pose no imminent threat, clearly violates the \nconstitutional due process rights of citizens.\n\n  What we are talking about is a resolution that says what we have been \ntrying to get the President to say: You can't kill noncombatants. You \ncan't kill people in a cafe in Seattle. That is what we are asking. It \nis blatantly unconstitutional to kill noncombatants. I can't understand \nwhy we couldn't get a resolution, particularly because I am willing to, \nwith this resolution, move forward and let the vote occur on Brennan.\n  The second part of the resolution is:\n\n       The American people deserve a clear, concise, and \n     unequivocal public statement from the President of the United \n     States that contains detailed legal reasoning, including but \n     not limited to the balance between national security and due \n     process, limits of executive power and distinction between \n     treatments of citizens and noncitizens within and outside the \n     borders of the United States, the use of lethal force against \n     American citizens, and the use of drones in the application \n     of lethal force within the United States territory.\n\n  Basically, the second part of the resolution asked, basically, we do \nour job and ask the President to let us know what is going on with the \nprogram. If there is an objection to this, it would be an objection to, \nNo. 1, killing citizens who are noncombatants and, No. 2,\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\nto giving us a report on what the program will actually entail.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the two leaders tomorrow, the Senate vote on this \nresolution as I just read it, and with the addition to it they then \nturn to the Brennan nomination or be allowed to proceed to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to my friend from Kentucky that I am chair of \nthe Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights Subcommittee of the \nJudiciary Committee. We are scheduling a hearing on the issue of \ndrones, because I believe the issue raises important questions, legal \nand constitutional questions. I invite my colleague to join us in that \nhearing if you wish to testify. I think this is something we should \nlook at and look at closely. That is why this hearing is being \nscheduled. I believe at this moment it is premature to schedule a vote \non this issue until we thoroughly look at the constitutional aspects of \nall of the questions the Senator has raised today, which are important.\n  Because of that, I have no alternative but to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I am disappointed the Democrats choose not \nto vote on this. The answer around here for a lot of things is we will \nhave a hearing at some later date to be determined. The problem is this \nis a nonbinding resolution. This is a resolution just stating we \nbelieve in the Constitution and, A, Mr. President, send us some \ninformation about your plan, how it is going to work. It doesn't change \nthe law. In fact, I wish it could do more than that. We have an actual \nbill which will be introduced. We will actually try to change the law.\n  This is a symbolic gesture and a way to allow us to move forward. I \nam disappointed we can't.\n  This was an article that was published in Human Rights First in \nDecember of 2012. As I said, it has an opening statement by John \nBrennan I think is actually well thought out and recognizes some of the \nadvantages and disadvantages of drone strikes.\n  John Brennan begins by saying:\n\n       We are establishing precedents that other nations may \n     follow, and not all of those nations may--and not all of them \n     will be nations that share our interests.\n\n  Think about what he is saying there. Other people are going to get \ndrones. We have already lost a drone in Iran. How long do you think it \nis before Iran has drones? How long do you think it is before Hezbollah \nhas drones or Hamas has drones? I think there is a certain amount of \nthought that ought to go into a drone-killing program, particularly \nwhen the people who are being killed by the drones will have their own \ndrones, I think within short order.\n\n       The Obama administration has dramatically escalated \n     targeted killing by drones as a central feature of his \n     counterterrorism response. Over the past 2 years the \n     administration has begun to speak more openly about the \n     targeted killing program, including in public remarks by \n     several senior officials. While we welcome and appreciate \n     these disclosures, they nevertheless provided only limited \n     information.\n       Experts in other governments have continued to raise \n     serious concerns about:\n       The precedent that the United States targeted killing \n     policy is setting for the rest of the world, including \n     countries which have acquired or are in the process of \n     acquiring drones, yet have long failed to adhere to the rule \n     of law and protect human rights--\n\n  We would like to believe we actually have rules in place, and we \nwould not misuse drones. Imagine what it is going to be like when \ncountries get drones that have none of the rules, none of the checks \nand balances.\n\n       The impact of the drone program on other U.S. \n     counterterrorism efforts, including whether U.S. allies and \n     other security partners have reduced intelligence sharing and \n     other forms of counterterrorism cooperation because of the \n     operational and legal concerns expressed by these countries; \n     the impact of drone operations on other aspects of U.S. \n     counterterrorism strategy, especially diplomatic and foreign \n     assistance efforts designed to counter extremism, promote \n     stability, and provide economic aid; the number of civilian \n     casualties, including a lack of clarity on who the United \n     States considers a civilian in these situations.\n       Of note and of consideration also is whether the legal \n     framework of the program that has been publicly asserted so \n     far by the administration comports with international legal \n     requirements.\n       The totality of these concerns, heightened by the lack of \n     public information surrounding the program, require the \n     administration to better explain the program and its legal \n     basis and to carefully review the policy in light of the \n     global precedent it is setting and serious questions about \n     the effectiveness of the program on the full range of U.S. \n     counterterrorism efforts. While it is expected that elements \n     of the U.S. Government's strategy for a targeted killing will \n     be classified, it is in the national interest that the \n     government be more transparent about policy considerations \n     governing its use as well as its legal justification, and \n     that the program be subject to regular oversight. \n     Furthermore, it is in the U.S. national security interests to \n     ensure that the rules of engagement are clear and that the \n     program minimizes any unintended negative consequences.\n       How the U.S. operates and publicly explains its targeted \n     killing programs will have far-reaching consequences. The \n     manufacture and sale of unmanned aerial vehicles is an \n     increasing global industry and drone technology is not \n     prohibitively complicated.\n\n  I will give you an idea where there is a marketplace for drones. Last \nyear, I introduced a bill to require a warrant before you could use a \ndomestic drone to spy on citizens. Before I introduced it or anybody \nknew outside my office, we already had calls in lobbying coming from \ndrone manufacturers. So this is a big business.\n\n       Some 70 countries already possess UAVs, or drones, \n     including Russia, Syria and Libya, and others are in the \n     process of acquiring them. As White House counterterrorism \n     chief John Brennan stated: The United States is \n     ``establishing precedents that other nations may follow, and \n     not all of them will be nations that share our interests or \n     the premium we put on protecting human life, including \n     innocent civilians.''\n       By declaring that it is an armed conflict with al Qaeda's \n     ``associated forces,'' (a term it has not defined)--\n\n  I think this is an important point because everybody is always \nsaying: Don't worry. You are fine. You are not a terrorist. We are only \ngoing after terrorists. The problem is, as I said, the government has \ndefined terrorism in this country to mean things that may not include \nterrorists--paying cash, having weatherized ammunition--so there are a \nlot of different things they have used as a definition. But let's say \nthey are going after al-Qaida, people working with them or associated \nforces--what that means I don't know, particularly since al-Qaida is a \nlittle hard to define because they do not have membership cards. Some \nof them probably don't use the label at all. I doubt many of them have \nany communication with any kind of central headquarters or central \ngroup called al-Qaida.\n\n       By declaring that it is in an armed conflict with al \n     Qaeda's ``associated forces,'' without articulating limits to \n     that armed conflict, the United States is inviting other \n     countries to similarly declare armed conflicts against groups \n     they consider to be security threats for purposes of assuming \n     lethal targeting authority. Moreover, by announcing that all \n     ``members'' of such groups are legally targetable, the United \n     States is establishing exceedingly broad precedent for those \n     who can be targeted, even if it is not to utilize the full \n     scope of this claimed authority. As an alternative to armed \n     conflict-based targeting, U.S. officials have claimed that \n     targeted killings are justified as self-defense responding to \n     an imminent threat. . . .\n\n  The problem is we have defined imminent to be not immediate. So \nhaving a murky definition of what imminent is allows us to run into \nproblems.\n\n       It is also not clear that the current broad targeted \n     killing policy serves U.S. long-term strategic interests in \n     combating international terrorism. Although it has been \n     reported that some high-level operational leaders of al-Qaida \n     have been killed in drone attacks, studies show the vast \n     majority are not high-level terrorist leaders. National \n     security analysts and former U.S. military officials \n     increasingly argue that such tactical gains are outweighed by \n     the substantial cost of the targeted killing program, \n     including growing anti-American sentiment and recruiting \n     support for al-Qaida.\n       The broad targeted killing program has already strained \n     U.S. relations with allies and thereby impeded the flow of \n     critical intelligence about terrorist operations.\n\n  The problem is, when we talk about this, one of the most important \nthings to our intelligence is actually human intelligence. We get \ninformation from people who are our friends, who live in those \ncountries, who blend into the population and are part of their \npopulation. But we have gone on to destroy some of this intelligence in \nthe sense that one of the people who helped us to\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\nget bin Laden was a doctor in Pakistan by the name of Dr. Shakil \nAfridi. If we don't stand by the people who give us intelligence and \ngive us information, we will not get more. But when he did help us, \nsomehow his name was leaked. I don't know where the leak came from, but \nhis name was leaked and then he was arrested by the Pakistanis. He is \nnow in prison for the rest of his life.\n  I have asked several times, both to the previous Secretary of State \nas well as to the current Secretary of State, and I asked the current \nSecretary of State point-blank and directly: Will you use the leverage \nof foreign aid to say we are not going to give you foreign aid if you \ndon't release this doctor who gave us information?\n  It is a little ironic that we will not do it, particularly since at \none point in time we actually had, I think, a $25 million reward for \nany information that led to helping us get bin Laden. So it is kind of \ndisappointing that we haven't held out and supported our human \nintelligence and people such as Dr. Afridi, who helped us get probably \nthe most notorious terrorist of the last century.\n\n       While the U.S. Government does not report the number of \n     deaths from drone strikes, independent groups have estimated \n     that the drone program has claimed several thousand lives so \n     far.\n\n  Estimates and public comments by some Senators have said as many as \n4,700. What we don't know about the 4,700 but what would be an \nimportant statistic, I think, or maybe a troubling statistic, would be \nhow many of the 4,700 were killed in combat--actually holding weapons, \nfighting, going to a battle, coming from a battle--and how many of the \ndrone strikes were actually on people who weren't involved in combat. I \nthink if that number were released, if that number were made public, it \nwould concern you even more because you may well find out a lot of the \npeople--and we have seen some of the strikes on television, with people \nin their cars, people walking around without weapons, people eating \ndinner, people at home in their houses. I am not saying these are good \npeople necessarily, I am just saying the drone strike program we have \nin place currently seems to have a very low threshold for whom they \nkill. So the question would be whether you are going to use that kind \nof standard if you have a domestic drone strike program in the United \nStates.\n\n  I think we are getting to the point, and that is one of the most \nimportant questions as we look at the foreign drone program, is \nunderstanding what the parameters are that allow us to kill people in \nforeign countries and are those the parameters that are going to be \nused here.\n  For the most part, over the last decade, they haven't admitted we \neven have a drone strike program. But now that they admit it, the \nPresident doesn't want to answer any questions about it. He doesn't \nwant to deny he will use it here. He just says he isn't intending to \nuse it here but then says: Oh, probably there will be different rules \ninside the United States than outside the United States.\n  This is where the Senate ought to get involved, instead of punting \nthis to another time. The Senate ought to say we are not going to wait \nfor the President to send us a memo. We are going to send him a memo. \nWe are going to tell him what the rules on drone strikes are. We are \ngoing to tell him the Constitution does apply to Americans, \nparticularly Americans in the United States, and there are no \nexceptions.\n  I find it inexcusable that the Attorney General says: Well, the fifth \namendment, we will use it as needed, basically. We will use it when we \nchoose. The problem with that is I don't think the executive branch \nshould get to pick and choose.\n  Without yielding the floor, I am going to allow a question from my \ncolleague from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Kentucky, and I want to ask the \nfollowing question: Is the Senator from Kentucky aware of the reaction \nthe American people are having to his extraordinary efforts today?\n  Given the Senate rules do not allow for the use of cellular phones on \nthe floor, I feel quite confident the Senator from Kentucky is not \naware of the Twitterverse that has been exploding. So what I want to do \nfor the Senator from Kentucky is to give some small sampling of the \nreaction on Twitter so he might understand how the American people are \nresponding to his courageous leadership, to Senator Paul's doing \nsomething that in the last 4 years has happened far too little in this \nChamber, which is standing and fighting for liberty.\n  So I will read a series of tweets.\n\n       So proud of Rand Paul standing up for what's right. Stand \n     with Rand.\n       Rand Paul: a reason to be proud of your elected \n     representatives again. Keep going, Rand.\n       Proud of Senator Rand Paul and all who have joined him in \n     this effort. Stand today with Senator Rand Paul.\n       So happy with Rand Paul right now. Someone finally using \n     the system to aid, not usurp, our rights.\n       Rand Paul filibusters Brennan nomination--over four hours \n     now. Glad someone in the Senate has some spine.\n\n  That was tweeted a while ago.\n\n       Rand Paul is a hero today, a man with a backbone.\n       Today Rand Paul is my hero.\n       Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is a true constitutional hero in \n     his filibuster against CIA nominee.\n       I can honestly say, I am proud to currently live in Rand \n     Paul's State of Kentucky.\n       So proud of Rand Paul. He's bringing it. He's not going to \n     let our constitution get trashed. A breath of fresh air. PRAY \n     4 THIS FIGHT 4 RAND.\n       I am so beyond proud of Rand Paul and the way he is \n     standing up for each and every American citizen right now by \n     filibustering the Senate.\n       I am VERY proud of Senator Rand Paul. This is an important \n     moment when one person had the courage to yell STOP. Stand \n     with Rand.\n       So proud of Rand Paul. We need more like him. Stand with \n     Rand.\n       Rand Paul is now in hour 7 of his filibuster. He is \n     standing up for our rights. Thank you. Stand with Rand.\n       It is frightening that Obama seeks to have an ever growing \n     amount of power. Drone strikes are frightening. Stand with \n     Rand.\n       Dear GOP. The base is crying out for more of you to stand \n     with Rand. If you want the base's votes, get it together.\n       Stand with Rand. We need you now more than ever. This \n     president has usurped his power. We can't say anything bad \n     against him.\n       Stand with Rand. So long as Rand speaks, we'll be tuned in.\n       It is unconstitutional to target and kill Americans on \n     American soil with a drone. Stand with Rand.\n\n  A retweet from Senator Rand Paul. I will commend the Senator from \nKentucky. He was so flexible he was able to tweet while he was standing \non the floor. A retweet from Senator Rand Paul's tweet: ``I will not \nsit quietly and let President Obama shred the Constitution,'' with the \nhashtags ``filiblizzard'' and ``Stand with Rand.''\n  Here is a more mixed one, but nonetheless demonstrating the respect \nthe Senator from Kentucky is earning across the aisle.\n\n       I may not always agree with Rand Paul but he has my \n     respect. He's very willing to do what he feels is right. \n     Stand with Rand.\n\n  From Congressman Justin Amash:\n\n       Why won't President Obama simply state that it is \n     unconstitutional and illegal for government to kill Americans \n     in U.S. without due process? Stand with Rand.\n       Stand with Rand, because we deserve to know if American \n     citizens should fear murder from our Government.\n       Everyone should be aware of this important moment in \n     American history. Stand with Rand.\n       Proud to call Rand Paul my Senator. Stand with Rand.\n       It is unconstitutional to target and kill Americans on \n     American soil with a drone. Stand with Rand.\n       The Federal Government does not have the power to kill its \n     citizens whenever it wants. There is something called due \n     process. Stand with Rand.\n       Fight for our constitutional rights and liberties. Stand \n     with Rand.\n       Stand with Rand. I have gained a lot of respect for Senator \n     Paul today. This is not a right or left issue, it is a civil \n     liberties issue. Thank you Rand Paul and others who are \n     taking a stand for patriotic Americans.\n       A great day for liberty when Senator Rand Paul and a \n     handful of others stood up for liberty. Stand with Rand.\n       It is ironic that a Nobel Peace Prize winner won't \n     guarantee that he won't use drones against Americans. Stand \n     with Rand.\n\n  I will note to the Senator from Kentucky and ask his reaction to \nthese--this is but a small sampling of the reaction in Twitter. Indeed, \nin my office I think the technical term for what the Twitterverse is \ndoing right now is ``blowing up.''\n  I suggest to the Senator from Kentucky and then ask his reaction--I \nsuggest that this is a reflection of the fact that the American people \nare frustrated. They are frustrated that they\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\nfeel too few elected officials in Washington stand for our rights, are \nwilling to rock the boat, are willing to stand up and say the \nConstitution matters. And it matters whether it is popular or not, it \nmatters whether my party is in power or another party is in power. The \nConstitution matters. Our rights matter. And I think so many Americans \nare frustrated that they view elected officials as looking desperate to \nstay in power, desperate to be reelected to do everything except fight \nfor the Constitution and fight for our liberties, and I think this \noutpouring the Senator from Kentucky is seeing is a reflection of that \ngreat frustration.\n  I join with the sentiments of these and many others on Twitter. I ask \nthe Senator from Kentucky if he was aware of this reaction and what his \nthoughts are to the many thousands more--I haven't been able to read \ntheir tweets--and their words of encouragement as the Senator from \nKentucky more than anyone is standing with Rand.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for coming to \nthe floor and cheering me up. I was getting kind of tired. I appreciate \nhim bringing news from the outside world.\n  As you know, we are not allowed to have electronics on the floor, so \nI don't really have much knowledge of the electronic outside world. But \nactually it is probably a good thing for every American eventually not \nto see their phone or their computer for about 8 hours.\n  The thing is, people think that we should not--people are always \nsaying don't fight, get along, and stuff. I think people do want that. \nI think at the same time they want you to stand up and stand for \nsomething and believe in something. It doesn't have to mean that we do \nit in an acrimonious way. Even the Senator from Illinois and I usually \nhave civilized words together. There is a smile.\n  The thing about it is that there are principles we ought to stand \nfor. I think the most important principle here, though, is that really \nthis is a tug-of-war between the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch. There may be some partisanship, that we can't all get together \nin the Senate to say to the President that we think his power should be \nrestrained, but I think at the same time there are some on the other \nside who are saying that. Really, that is what this should be about.\n  It is about how much power a President can have. Can a President have \nthe power to decide to kill Americans on American soil? But not only \nthat, can the President have the power to decide when the Bill of \nRights applies? Can you be targeted because you have been alleged to \nhave committed some crime and your Bill of Rights is stripped away even \nif you are here in the United States? I think it is a pretty easy \nquestion.\n  Maybe someone from the media would ask the President tonight--I don't \nknow if he is still up or not--but ask the President the question. Ask \nhim, do you plan on killing Americans who are not in combat? Do you \nplan on killing Americans who are not in a combat position, people whom \nyou might be accusing of some kind of crime but who are actually not \nengaged in combat? I would think it would be a simple answer. In fact, \nI am willing to go home if we can get an answer from the President that \nsays: People not engaged in combat won't be on any target list. It is a \npretty simple question to ask and a pretty reasonable question to ask.\n  After much jockeying and debate with the Senator from Texas asking \nthe Attorney General this question, we finally did get to where it \nseems as though he was coming toward not trying to but being forced to \nsay it is not constitutional to kill noncombatants.\n  It should be an easy question. So we will take a telegram. We will \neven take a tweet. If the Attorney General would tweet us, we can have \nthat relayed to the floor and let him know--let us know that basically \nthey acknowledge that their power is not unlimited.\n  I don't think this is really an overstatement of the cause. This has \nbeen written up. Glenn Greenwald has written this up. Conor \nFriedersdorf has written this up, talking about if you have a war that \nhas no end, if you have a war that has no geographic limit, and then if \nyou have strikes that have no constitutional bounds, basically what you \nhave is an unlimited imperial Presidency.\n  This is not a partisan issue. A lot of this began under George Bush. \nIt has been continued, expanded, doubled, and quintupled and made 10 \ntimes worse by the current President. But even under George Bush, \nnobody ever maintained they could kill Americans at home. I can't \nimagine that the President, when he comes forward and says he has not \nkilled Americans and he does not intend to do it but he might--that \nsomehow we are supposed to be placated by that. Somehow that is \nsupposed to be enough.\n  This is not the first time we have seen this--not the first time we \nhave seen a reversal of fortunes here, reversal of what I think he \nstood for as a candidate. I have said many times, probably 10 times \ntoday that I admired the President. I admired the President when he was \na Senator on many issues. I admired the President when he ran for \noffice. But the President who ran for office and said we are not going \nto tap phones without a warrant, the President who ran for office and \nsaid we are not going to torture people now says we are going to kill \npeople with no due process? I find that incredibly hypocritical and \nincredibly ironic. I see no reason why he can't come forward and say: \nWe don't get to pick and choose when the fifth amendment applies. We \ndon't get to pick and choose when people can be accused of crime and \nget no adjudication and be killed by a drone.\n\n  I just cannot imagine he can't answer these questions. It is not \nenough to say: I don't intend to do so.\n  Last year when we passed the national defense authorization bill, \nthere was included in that the ability to indefinitely detain an \nindividual, an American citizen. In fact, I asked another Senator on my \nside--I said: Does that mean you can send an American to Guantanamo \nBay?\n  He said: Yes, if they are dangerous.\n  That would be fine if we all agreed who is dangerous and who \ncommitted a crime, but that would be an accusation, and that would have \nto be adjudicated somehow, and if you don't get a trial, how do we \ndetermine your innocence or guilt or whether you are going to be sent \nto Guantanamo Bay?\n  The President, like so many times, said: I don't support indefinite \ndetention. I would veto that.\n  No, no, I won't veto that this time, but I would veto that if I were \nstill Candidate Barack Obama. But I am President Barack Obama, I am not \ngoing to veto that.\n  So instead he says: I have no intention of detaining anyone.\n  Here is the problem. It is not good enough. The law is for everybody. \nIt is not for saying: Oh, I am a good President. I am very--I went to \nHarvard. I am not going to detain anybody.\n  That is not enough. The law is what the law is. If the law allows you \nto be detained as an American citizen, what about the next guy who is \nnot so high-minded, the next guy who decides he is going to detain \npolitical opponents and ethnic groups or people he dislikes? What \nhappens when that happens? It is not enough to say: I don't intend to \ndo something.\n  I would think the leader of the free world, the leader of I think one \nof the most important nations if not the most important nation or \ncivilization we have had in historic times--I have high hopes and high \nestimation of who we are as a people. It is not enough for him to say: \nI don't intend to break the Constitution. You either believe in the \nConstitution or you do not.\n  I think illustrative of sort of this opinion was when I interviewed \nor asked questions to Senator Kerry when he was being nominated. I \nasked him these questions about, can you go to war without a \ndeclaration of war.\n  His answer was, oh, of course I will support the Constitution, except \nfor when I won't support the Constitution, when it is inconvenient. It \nis sometimes hard to go to war, it is messy, there is all this voting \nstuff, and people don't want to vote to go to war, they don't want to \nraise taxes. It is just hard to get the votes for war. So when it is \ninconvenient, I will not.\n  That is the problem.\n  He asked me or sort of insinuated that I was an absolutist. I don't \nknow how to halfway believe that Congress should declare war. I don't \nknow how to halfway believe in the fifth amendment. This is not one we \nare even debating exactly what it means, what the\n\n[[Page S1198]]\n\nestablishment clause of the first amendment means. There is really not \na lot of debate over what due process is. When you are accused of a \ncrime, when you are accused of something, you are indicted. When you \nare accused, you get a trial, you get due process. Nobody is really \ndebating what that means. Yet the Attorney General for this President \nhas said that the fifth amendment will be applied when they can.\n  To be fair, I think he is referring to foreign strikes. He is talking \nabout foreign strikes. To tell you the truth, it is kind of muddled, \nwhether the Constitution applies to people in foreign lands or in \nforeign zones. But that is the whole point of this. The point is that \nthis is America. We are not talking about a battlefield. We are not \ntalking about people using legal force. If you are in America, if you \nare outside the Capitol and you have a grenade launcher, you will be \nkilled without due process. You don't get due process. You don't get an \nattorney. You don't get Miranda rights. Nobody thinks that you do. But \nif you are sitting in a cafe, and somebody thinks you e-mailed your \ncousin in the Middle East, and they think you are conspiring with them, \nyou should be charged. You should be imprisoned if they can make the \ncharges stick. But they should not just drop a Hellfire missile on your \ncafe experience.\n  We have to realize and the President above all people--someone who \ntaught constitutional law should realize that his opinion is not so \nimportant. Even as the President, it is not so important. For him to \nsay that he doesn't intend to kill people--I would defy a \nconstitutional lawyer in our country to say that is important. The law \nis what it is, and he is going to give us a legal interpretation of the \nlaw and not what his intent is. To say he hasn't killed anybody yet, to \nsay he has no intention of killing anybody but he might, is just not a \nlegal standard I chose to live by. It concerns me.\n  It concerns me that we have documents in the United States that are \nproduced by the government that indicate people who might be a \nterrorist. The Bureau of Justice came out with one last year, and it \nsaid people who are missing fingers, people who have colored stains on \ntheir clothes, people who have more than 7 days of food might be \nterrorists. Ironically, another government Web site says that if you \nlive on the coast, you should have 7 days of food because there might \nbe a hurricane, you might need to have the food. But another Web site \nsays that if you do, you might be crazy and a lunatic and a \nsurvivalist, and you might be someone we might need to target with a \ndrone. If you see somebody hiding this, you are supposed to report \nthem. If you hear of people who have guns in their house or lots of \nweatherized ammunition or ready-to-eat meals, they could be on the \ntarget list. Of that is whom we are targeting to be terrorists, I would \ncertainly want a trial. I just wouldn't think it would be enough to be \naccused.\n\n  People say: Oh, well, they are just members of al-Qaida, but they \ndon't have a membership card. I don't know that we have looked at \nanybody's because they are dead; they were blown up with a missile, so \nno one is looking at their al-Qaida membership card. The thing is in \nthe United States they might say someone is associated with al-Qaida or \nassociated with terrorism. We have had experience with government \noffices and officials talking about people who might be terrorists.\n  The Fusion Centers in Missouri said people who are pro-life might be \nterrorists. They said people who are for secure borders might be \nterrorists. They said the people who vote for the Constitution Party or \nthe Libertarian Party might be terrorists. So if they believe in \nsignature strikes, I guess if we see the traffic going to the \nLibertarian Party Convention, that could probably hit a caravan and hit \na whole bunch of them at once.\n  People say that is absurd. The President is not advocating that. He \nis advocating a drone strike in America, and all we have to compare it \nwith is the drone strike overseas. He doesn't want to talk about it, \nbut when forced to, he says the rules will probably be slightly \ndifferent inside the United States than they will be outside the United \nStates. I guess he does believe he has a right to have a drone strike \nprogram in the United States. He will just have slightly different \nrules.\n  I have an important question for him. He needs to give me a call. Is \none of the rules of inside the U.S. drone strike program to obey the \nConstitution that a person will get a trial by a jury of their peers? \nIs that going to be in the rules for inside America as opposed to \noutside America?\n  It is disturbing that it has been so hard to get any information on \nthis. I wouldn't have gotten any information at all--I don't think--had \nwe not gotten some support from the other side.\n  The Senator from Oregon stood in the committee. In fact, he asked the \nquestion before I did. I was fascinated he asked the question. Senator \nWyden stood in the Intelligence Committee and asked: Can you do a drone \nstrike on Americans on American soil? John Brennan's response--I kid \nyou not--we need to optimize transparency and we need to optimize \nsecrecy. That was his answer. Here is the followup question: What does \nthat mean? Does that mean you can kill Americans on American soil? What \nare you trying to say or what are you trying not to say? To Brennan's \ncredit, he finally answered the question only when there was a threat \nof him not getting out of committee--thanks to the bipartisan support \nof Republicans and Democrats threatening to hold him up. He finally got \nout, but on the day we threatened to hold him up, he finally responded.\n  I sent him questions a month and a half previously, and I finally got \nan answer after the threat of his nomination not coming out of \ncommittee. This is not the way it should work. The President is \nbragging about how transparent the guy is, that he believes in \ntransparency, that he is such a high-minded fellow, but he won't give \nany answer unless someone forces him to. The same thing with the \nPresident.\n  So we finally get an answer and John Brennan says: Well, the CIA \ncannot kill people in the United States, it is against the law. Yes, we \nknew that. Thanks. Thanks for admitting you are going to obey the law. \nWe feel blessed that you said you will now obey the law. But it is sad \nthat it took a month and a half--and under severe duress--that they \nhave admitted they will obey the law and the CIA will not kill you in \nAmerica.\n  The problem is it is kind of a tricky answer because they are not the \nones running the drone program. The Defense Department runs the \nprogram. You can be sure the CIA is not going to kill you, but the \nDefense Department might. Still the answer is: We haven't killed \nanybody yet. We don't intend to, but we might. So that is what we are \ngoing to have to be satisfied with.\n  So we got the answer from the Attorney General, and his was a little \nmore detailed and actually had some good things in it. Basically, he \nconcluded by saying they could conceive of a place where someone could \nget attacked or where the United States might attack Americans, but the \nexamples they came up with were not what we were asking about. So it is \nsort of akin to answering a question but answering the question that \nwasn't asked.\n  They said: Well, if planes are flying at the Twin Towers and if Pearl \nHarbor is happening again, obviously, we could see a use for drone \nstrikes. Well, me too. I mean, if we are being attacked and there is a \nwar or even if there is a person with a grenade launcher, we have the \nability to respond to that. No one is questioning that. The reason this \nquestion comes up is that a significant portion of the drone strikes \noverseas are occurring on people who are not involved in combat.\n  Now there are allegations that there are bad people and they may have \nbeen in combat but are not currently in combat. The question is: Are we \ngoing to use the foreign drone strike model in the United States? Are \nwe going to kill noncombatants in the United States? Are we going to \nkill people whom we suspect? That sort of gets us to the other question \nwhen we talk about what rules and procedures we expect in our country. \nDo we expect that the police would come and arrest you and put you in \njail for the rest of your life because they suspect something? Is \nsuspicion enough? Obviously not. We believe that is the beginning of \nit. Usually, it involves probable cause and involves a judge to get \ninformation.\n  I have a message here--not from the White House. It is a message \nsaying the White House hasn't returned our phone\n\n[[Page S1199]]\n\ncalls. If anybody knows anybody at the White House and wants to come, \nwe are looking for an answer from the White House. We have called \nJustice also. I think the answer says something about the sequester. \nMaybe they are going to call me when the sequester is over.\n  I think one of the courtesies they ought to think about is--\nparticularly if what they are hearing is something that they don't \nobject to--why not end the debate by going ahead and letting us know? \nWhy not go ahead and let us know they agree they are not going to be \nkilling noncombatants. I would think that would be a pretty easy answer \nfor them. In negotiating with any kind of executive branch--this one or \nothers--that when we get a nonanswer or a nonresponsive answer or get a \nrefusal to answer, I think that is when we need to be concerned that \nthe answer is not the answer they want to be public. It is an answer \nthat perhaps the fifth amendment will be optional depending on who is \njudging the circumstances.\n\n  As we look forward and look at some of the information that has been \ngathered over time on this, one of the interesting articles we have \ncollected on this was an article in the Los Angeles Times entitled \n``Police employ Predator drone spy planes on the home front.'' This is \nan article by Brian Bennett.\n\n       Reporting from Washington--Armed with a search warrant, \n     Nelson County Sheriff Kelly Janke went looking for six \n     missing cows on the Brossart family farm in the early evening \n     of June 23. Three men brandishing rifles chased him off, he \n     said.\n       Janke knew the gunman could be anywhere on the 3,000-acre \n     spread in eastern North Dakota. Fearful of an armed standoff, \n     he called in reinforcements from the state Highway Patrol, a \n     regional SWAT team, a bomb squad, ambulances and deputy \n     sheriffs from three other counties.\n       He also called in a Predator B drone.\n       As the unmanned aircraft circled 2 miles overhead the next \n     morning, sophisticated sensors under the nose helped pinpoint \n     the three suspects and showed they were unarmed. Police \n     rushed in and made the first known arrests of U.S. citizens \n     with help from a Predator, the spy drone that has helped \n     revolutionize modern warfare.\n       But that was just the start. Local police say they have \n     used two unarmed Predators based at Grand Forks Air Force \n     Base to fly at least two dozen surveillance flights since \n     June. The FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration have used \n     Predators for other domestic investigations, officials said.\n       ``We don't use [drones] on every call out,'' said Bill \n     Macki, head of the police SWAT team in Grand Forks. ``If we \n     have something in town like an apartment complex, we don't \n     call them.''\n       The drones belong to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, \n     which operates eight Predators on the country's northern and \n     southwestern borders to search for illegal immigrants and \n     smugglers. The previously unreported use of its drones to \n     assist local, state, and federal law enforcement has occurred \n     without any public acknowledgement or debate.\n       Congress first authorized Customs and Border Protection to \n     buy unarmed Predators in 2005. Officials in charge of the \n     fleet cite broad authority to work with police from budget \n     requests to Congress that cite ``interior law enforcement \n     support'' as part of their mission.\n       In an interview, Michael C. Kostelnik, a retired Air Force \n     general who heads the office that supervises drones, said \n     Predators are flown ``in many areas around the country, not \n     only for federal operators, but also for state and local law \n     enforcement. . . .''\n       But former Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), who sat on the \n     House homeland security intelligence subcommittee at the time \n     and served as its chairwoman from 2007 until this year, said \n     no one discussed using Predators to help local police serve \n     warrants or do other basic work.\n       Using Predators for routine law enforcement without public \n     debate or clear legal authority is a mistake, Harman said.\n       ``There is no question that this could become something \n     that people will regret,'' said Harman, who resigned from the \n     House in February and now heads the Woodrow Wilson \n     International Center for Scholars, a Washington think tank.\n\n  The point is it isn't so much about technology. I am not opposed to \ndrones being used even domestically. It is about the individual \nfreedom, it is about the process, and it is about how they are used. \nFor example, just like in national defense, if someone is robbing a \nliquor store and it is safer to get the robber down with a drone, that \nis fine. If someone is armed and robbing and threatening people in the \nliquor store and people as they come out, I don't mind if that person \nwas shot with a drone or a rifle from a policeman. It is what it is. As \none of my friends who is a physician would say when people would come \nin wounded from robbing someone: Well, I guess that is an occupational \nhazard if you break into homes. The thing is it isn't the force we are \ntalking about, it is whether the process is right. So they can use \nlethal force when lethal force is threatened. The question about drones \nis whether they are being used with warrants, if they are spying on \nsomeone or doing surveillance on someone.\n  One of the bills we introduced last year was a bill to require \nwarrants for drone surveillance. This is a hot topic, and I think it \nwill probably get up to the Supreme Court. I don't believe it has yet. \nThere were cases that were talking about GPS tagging of cars, and the \nSupreme Court ruled they cannot do that without a warrant.\n  My suspicion is they will rule in favor of warrants on drones too. \nAlthough there is some dispute over what they call open spaces. I think \nthat with open spaces we need to be concerned that just because you are \nnot inside your house does not mean you don't still deserve some \nprivacy on your own land. So it is not so much that the drone is \nnecessarily our enemy, but it just allows the government to do so much \nmore. We need to be very careful about the safeguards of the \nConstitution and requiring whether these safeguards are met as far as \nprotecting our liberty.\n  This is from the same article from the Los Angeles Times:\n\n       In 2008 and 2010, Harman helped beat back efforts by \n     Homeland Security officials to use imagery from military \n     satellites to help domestic investigations. Congress blocked \n     the proposal on grounds it would violate the Posse Comitatus \n     Act.\n\n  The Posse Comitatus Act is pretty important and it has been part of \nour discussion today and we are not the first person to raise this. The \nmilitary is not authorized to operate in the United States. Some may \nsay: Why not? The reason is they operate under different rules of \nengagement than our police do. In Afghanistan, Iraq or in any kind of \nwar theater, they have warrants, they don't have Miranda rights, and \nthey don't get due process in war. At home we do. That is why it is \nimportant we get folks to acknowledge this is not a battlefield. \nAmerica is not a battlefield. It is a place where we have \nconstitutional rights and have for hundreds of years.\n  The Posse Comitatus Act--after the Civil War--regulated and \nprohibited the military from acting as a police or taking a police role \non U.S. soil. Proponents say the high resolution cameras, heat sensors, \nand sophisticated radar on the Border Protection drones--and this is \nthe other point--were legislated to be used on the border.\n  One could argue that there is a Federal role for monitoring borders \nfor national defense and other reasons, but now they are loaning them \nout to local law enforcement and law enforcement is also buying drones \ndirectly. So they have high-resolution cameras, heat sensors, and \nsophisticated radar on the Border Protection drones that can help track \ncriminal activity in the United States just as the CIA uses predators \nand other drones to spy on militants in Pakistan, nuclear sites in \nIran, and other targets around the globe.\n  For decades, U.S. ports have allowed law enforcement to conduct \naerial surveillance without a warrant. This is part of that sort of \nopen spaces doctrine. I am not saying it makes it right but that the \ngovernment has been doing it for decades. Some of the courts apparently \nhave ruled that what a person does in the open--even behind a backyard \nfence--can be seen by a passing airplane and is not protected by \nprivacy laws. I don't think I agree with that. If a person is swimming \nin their pool in their backyard or in the hot tub, just because we have \nthe technology to be able to see them in their hot tub, does that mean \nthey have a right to look at what people are doing in their backyard? I \ndon't accept that. I think it has been abused and we should be fighting \nagainst this surveillance state.\n\n  Advocates say Predators are simply more effective than other planes. \nFlying out of earshot and out of sight, a Predator B can watch a target \nfor 20 hours nonstop, far longer than any police helicopter or manned \naircraft.\n  What I would say there is it seems as though that might be somewhat \nanalogous to the GPS case. The Supreme Court ruled that you can't tag \npeople's\n\n[[Page S1200]]\n\ncars and watch them constantly, waiting to see if they break any laws. \nSo I would think the same for a Predator, that you stake them out, \nwatch, and you will eventually get somebody breaking the speed limit or \nrunning a stop sign. I don't think that is what was intended.\n  Howard Safir says, ``I am for the use of drones.'' He is the former \nhead of operations of the U.S. Marshals Service and former New York \nCity police commissioner. He said, ``Drones could help police in \nmanhunts, hostage situations and other difficult cases.''\n  I agree completely. If someone is being held in harm's way, if \nsomeone is being held and threatened, drones are a great idea. So it is \nnot that I am opposed to the technology. I am not particularly excited \nabout them hovering outside our windows looking over our shoulders at \nwhat magazines we read, whether we are reading any free market \nmagazines that might be offensive to government officials. So I think \nwe don't want people looking into our activities in our houses without \na warrant. But I think in situations where people have already broken \nthe law, there is lethal force being exposed and there are people in \ndanger, why wouldn't we want to use a drone versus a policeman to save \nthe life of a policeman going into a difficult situation. So I think \nthose probably will come to fruition. That doesn't bother me.\n  In some ways it is a little bit analogous to the situation we are \ntalking about with drone strikes by the military in the United States. \nIt is not so much that anybody is opposed to using a drone to shoot \ndown a plane that is flying in to attack us, or people who are flying \ninto a building to knock a building down, or flying into the Capitol. \nNobody is opposed to using a drone when there is a lethal imminent \nforce. The problem is it has gotten so convoluted. The President said \nan imminent threat doesn't have to be immediate. So that is the kind of \nthing we are concerned about. We are not concerned about an imminent or \nlethal threat where someone responds. What we are concerned about is a \ndrone strike against a noncombatant. It seems as though it ought to be \nan easy question for the President. Couldn't he at least respond and \nsay, I have always believed this, I just forgot to mention it, and we \nweren't very clear in the way we expressed it but, obviously, we would \nnever use a drone against a noncombatant. He needs to say that, though, \nbecause the drones overseas are being used against noncombatants and we \nneed to know what the rules are going to be.\n  This is a long, drawn-out day, but it is to try to get some answers. \nIt is to try to shame the President into doing the right thing. I think \nhe knows what the right thing is. I think the President, part of him \nwould like to do the right thing. But I think there is a certain \nstubbornness there too. I think there is a certain belief that he is \nthe President and Presidents have all this power and he doesn't want to \ngive up any of that power. I think some of that we see with Republicans \nand Democrats, frankly. When people leave the legislative branch and go \nto the White House, they think, I am a good person. I would never use \npower wrongly, so why would it be wrong if I got more power? Why would \nit be wrong if I said, I am going to use the fifth amendment, people \nwill get due process, except for sometimes when I think they are bad \npeople, and then I won't use the fifth amendment, they won't get due \nprocess.\n  Privacy advocates say that drones help police snoop on citizens in \nways that push current law to the breaking point. Ryan Calo, director \nfor privacy and robotics at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet \nand Society, says:\n\n       Any time you have a tool like that in the hands of law \n     enforcement that makes it easier to do surveillance, they \n     will do more of it. This could be a time when people are \n     uncomfortable and they want to place limits on that \n     technology. It could make us question the doctrines that you \n     do not have privacy in public.\n\n  I think that is a good point. Maybe we will question some of the \nthings we have said before about open spaces now that we can crisscross \nevery inch of our open spaces. We have to imagine that we now have \ndrones that weigh less than an ounce, so we are not even talking about \nthe pictures of you coming down--some of us after a while don't want \npictures of us in our bathing suit, whether it is 2 miles up or whether \nit is from 5 feet in front of us. So I can't imagine we would \neventually rule that a drone could swoop down and be 10 feet over our \nfence. What is the question going to be? Can they be 10 feet over our \nfence or 2,000 feet in the air and still snoop without any kind of \nproblem at all?\n  Do we want to live in a police state is basically what the question \nis. Do we want to live in a surveillance state? It is going to take \npeople to stand up and say enough is enough, that we are not going to \ndo this, instead of everybody being like a herd of lemmings and going \noff the cliff saying, ``Lead me, lead me, take care of me.''\n  We have to ask the question that Franklin asked: Are you going to \ntrade your liberty for security? Are you so fearful, are you so afraid \nthat you are willing to trade your liberty for security? That is sort \nof the underlying question to this entire debate.\n  The Los Angeles Times article continues:\n\n       This can be a time when people are uncomfortable and they \n     want to place limits on that technology. It could make us \n     question the doctrine that you do not have privacy in public.\n\n  This is from a June 13 article, 2012, in ``Wired'' magazine by \nLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai:\n\n       We like to think of the drone war as something far away, \n     fought in the deserts of Yemen or the mountains of \n     Afghanistan. But we now know it is closer than we thought. \n     There are 64 drone bases on American soil. That includes 12 \n     locations housing Predator and Reaper unmanned aerial \n     vehicles, which can be armed.\n       Public Intelligence, a non-profit that advocates for free \n     access to information, released a map--\n\n  which is probably not a very good idea to release a map of where our \ndrone bases are in the United States.\n\n       The possibility of military drones as well as those \n     controlled by police departments and universities flying over \n     American skies have raised concerns among privacy activists.\n\n  The other thing that should concern everybody, and probably people \nsaw this as they had some university students seeing if they could \ncommandeer a drone. So they had a drone fly over and the guy who didn't \nknow the frequency all of a sudden within 2 minutes is commandeering \nthe drone. There are questions whether that is what happened in Iran or \nwhether the thing landed accidentally. I don't know the answer to that, \nbut I think it is of concern that the drones could be commandeered and \nused by the people. It is also a concern that ultimately our enemies \nare going to have these drones too, and so while war is a messy thing \nand there are a lot of imperfections to war, I think the way we act in \nwar should be the way we ultimately want to be treated in war. It is \neasier said than done and I don't think it is an easy doctrine, but it \nis something I think we should aspire to.\n\n       The possibility of military drones as well as those \n     controlled by police departments and universities flying over \n     American skies has raised concerns among privacy activists. \n     The American Civil Liberties Union explained in its December \n     report that the machines potentially could be used to spy on \n     American citizens. The drones' presence in our skies threaten \n     to eradicate existing practical limits on aerial monitoring \n     and allowing for pervasive surveillance, police fishing \n     expeditions, and abusive use of these tools in a way that \n     would eventually eliminate the privacy Americans have \n     traditionally enjoyed in their movements and activities.\n\n  I have told people that when I first read ``1984,'' I was bothered by \nit. Everybody is bothered by Big Brother being able to have these two-\nway televisions in your house and they see everything you do. You can't \nescape Big Brother. But part of the consolation I had and part of the \nfeeling was, Well, they can't do this. The technology doesn't exist. \nWhen I was a kid it didn't exist.\n  It is amazing, though, to think that Orwell writes this in 1949, \nbefore any of this technology. We were getting closer in the 1970s when \nI was a kid and now we are there, though. The technology is there. So \nwhile technology is not an enemy and technology is not something we can \nor should ban, technology makes our privacy more important, it makes \nthe defense of our privacy something that needs to be guarded more \njealously, because our government now does have the technology to see \nour every movement, to monitor our every move. So do our enemies, for \nthat matter. So one can imagine, we don't want\n\n[[Page S1201]]\n\nthe police GPS tracking us and we probably don't want our political \nopponents tracking our car, either. So there have to be some \nprotections of privacy.\n  The issue and discussion of privacy has been one that conservatives \nand people on the right haven't always been as unified about. \nLibertarians on the right have been better with these issues and some \nconservatives have as well. But the question has always been, Do you \nhave a right to privacy? I have always said, Sure, you have a right to \nprivacy. I can't imagine why you wouldn't have a right to privacy.\n  Some on the conservative side say, Well, you don't have a right to \nprivacy; nobody talked about it in the Constitution. You don't \nnecessarily have a right to privacy. I have to disagree because I think \nwhat is talked about in the Constitution are the freedoms we gave up or \nagreed to have limited. The freedoms that you didn't agree to have \nlimited are unnamed. They are unenumerated. And the 9th and 10 \namendments say they are to be left to the States and people. The 9th \nand 10th amendments say that there is a plethora of rights, there is an \nunlimited amount of rights and they are yours. They stay with you, \nunless the government explicitly takes these rights away from you.\n  So the conclusion I come to with the right to privacy is I think you \ndo have a right to privacy. I think we have a right to private \nproperty. Private property isn't listed in the Constitution, either, \nbut I think all of our Founding Fathers believed in private property \nand some of them talked about actually putting the words in there. But \nI think some of them liked more the idea--instead of life, liberty, and \nproperty, they liked life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and I \nthink it has a more noble ring to it because it is not talking about \nthe property, but pursuit of happiness does involve the pursuit of \ngaining things you will own.\n  One of the things about our government and about the rule of law, and \none of the things that frankly I think a lot of people don't think \nabout but that makes us an incredibly prosperous Nation is the \ncertainty of the law. By that, what I mean is the certainty of \nownership. This gets to sort of the idea of not only do we want these \nrights for the civil protections so we can't be incarcerated or accused \nof a crime falsely without being able to defend ourselves, we also want \nthe rule of law to be consistent for everyone and not mutable. We don't \nwant it to be arbitrary. We don't want the whims of any politician or \nany executive to be able to decide what the law is.\n  This isn't the first time I have had some disagreement with the \nPresident on this. When we had some of the bankruptcies, when the car \ncompanies were going bankrupt, I believe it was with the Chrysler \nbankruptcy, that as things went through, there were people who were \ncreditors and they owned part of the company.\n  I learned this firsthand because I actually had some Fruit of the \nLoom. When Fruit of the Loom went bankrupt, I thought, well, I will get \nsomething, right? They will be bought out, and I will get some money \nwhen they are bought out. I did not get anything. I was an unsecured \ncreditor. Apparently, in the Chrysler thing, so were the labor unions.\n  Usually what happens is that as a company, unfortunately, goes \nbankrupt, all those contracts would be renegotiated, and really then \nthe car companies could become competitive. They could become like \nToyota or other successful companies that are nonunionized. And they \nmight become successful again.\n  But instead we took the actual bankruptcy law and turned it on its \nhead. When we do this and when we bail out banks and things and change \nthe rules at midpoint, it changes what investors do, and it changes \nthat certainty investors need either in banks or in car companies.\n  Pension plans invest in a lot of these things. So a lot of people \nthink, oh, well, the President had preference for the union because he \nliked the union. Well, that is fine. But teachers are in a union too, \nand they had a pension plan, and they owned Chrysler stock, and they \ngot ripped off because he changed the law and gave the money to the \nautoworkers' union. But he took it from somebody else.\n  The problem is that you need those pension funds, some of which are \nfor regular working folks. Firemen have them. Police have them. \nTeachers have them. It is one of the things that were not fully \nexplained in the Romney campaign. He got so much grief for running \nthese funds, but a lot of the people who became successful along with \nhim and who made money were just average, ordinary citizens who are \nteachers, firemen, and policemen. Their pension plan was there in Bain \nCapital. I think that was never fully explained.\n  But my point is, with the rule of law, that certainty is what creates \nwealth in our country. One of the reasons it is hard for Africa to get \nahead--Africa has great resources--diamonds and minerals. One of the \nbig reasons they do not get ahead is there is corruption in their \ngovernment. Some of that corruption we aid and abet because we give \nforeign aid directly to corrupt governments that steal it.\n  Mubarak was one of the richest men in the world--probably worth \nbetween $5 and $10 billion, maybe between $15 and $20 billion. We gave \nhim $60 billion, so I guess we should be thankful he only stole one-\nthird of it. Mobutu in Central Africa stole billions. There was no \nrunning water, no electricity. He and the soldiers around him lived \nhigh off the hog, and they took our money and stole it as well.\n  But the problem is that not only do you have the kleptocracy and the \nstealing of foreign aid, but then you do not have the certainty of your \nproperty. A lot of capital formation in our country is based on your \nhome loans. It used to be before the housing market went south, but it \nstill is. It is where a lot of capital comes from, particularly for \naverage, ordinary citizens borrowing against their house.\n  If you do not have that certainty of the law, it is a problem. So \nwhat we are talking about today is more certainty of your liberty from \nunfair prosecution or unfair arrest or unfair death, ultimately, from a \ndrone, which takes consistency of law, which takes that the \nConstitution will be adhered to and will be adhered to consistently and \nnot in an arbitrary fashion. So it is important not only for your civil \nliberties, it is also important for your private property as well to \nhave a rule of law.\n  People talk about a rule of law, and they talk about it all the time. \nI do not think it fully gets through to everybody exactly what a rule \nof law means and how important it is. Hayek wrote that nothing more \nclearly distinguishes an arbitrary society from a stable society than \nthe rule of law. He said that the rule of law is what gives that \ncertainty to the marketplace. So it is not enough just to have freedom. \nYou can have complete and random anarchic freedom, and you may well not \nget prosperity if you do not have a law that stabilizes things. You \nhave to have a police force and a judiciary that enforces contracts.\n  So that is a lot of what goes on in the developing world that they do \nnot have. They have kleptocracy, which we aid and abet by giving them \nmoney and giving it to thieves because the thieves are our friends, not \nsomebody else's friends. But then they also have this instability by \nnot having a rule of law.\n\n       The drones' presence in our skies ``threatens to eradicate \n     existing practical limits on aerial monitoring . . .\n\n  This comes from an article in Wired by Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchieri.\n\n       As Danger Room reported last month, even military drones, \n     which are prohibited from spying on Americans, may \n     ``accidentally'' conduct such surveillance--and keep the data \n     for months afterwards while they figure out what to do with \n     it.\n       The material they collect without a warrant, as scholar \n     Steven Aftergood revealed, could then be used to open an \n     investigation.\n       The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the U.S. military from \n     operating on American soil . . .\n\n  So once again, if we go back to asking the President this question: \nCan you do military strikes on Americans on American soil, you know an \neasy answer is, I will obey the law. The law says he cannot do it. Yet \nhe indicates that he is going to have different rules inside America \nthan outside America for his drone strikes, which implies that he \nthinks he can do it.\n  The Posse Comitatus Act expressly forbids the military from operating \nin the United States. So if he is going to kill Americans in America, \nit will either be in defiance of the Posse Comitatus Act or he is going \nto have to arm the FBI with drones to kill people.\n\n[[Page S1202]]\n\n  The problem is that I think once he gets into the FBI, the ludicrous \nnature of what he is asserting will really be paramount. I cannot \nimagine that he can argue at that point that we are not going to obey \nthe Bill of Rights with the FBI because we already do with the FBI.\n  So many of the answers are pretty simple here and pretty easy, and I \njust cannot imagine why he is resisting doing this.\n\n       This new map comes out almost two months after the \n     Electronic Frontier Foundation revealed another one, this \n     time of public agencies--including police departments and \n     universities--that have a permit issued by the Federal \n     Aviation Agency to use [drones] in American airspace.\n\n  ``It goes to show you how entrenched drones already are,'' said \nTrevor Timm, an EFF activist, when asked about the new map. ``It's \nclear that the drone industry is expanding rapidly and this map is just \nanother example of that. And if people are worried about military \ntechnology coming back and being sold in the US, this is just another \nexample [of] how drone technology is probably going to proliferate in \nthe US very soon.''\n\n  This is another article from February of 2013.\n  This is in Wired. It is called ``Domestic-Drone Industry Prepares for \nBig Battle with Regulators.''\n\n       For a day, a sandy-haired Virginian named Jeremy Novara was \n     the hero of the nascent domestic drone industry.\n       Novara went to the microphone at a ballroom in a Ritz-\n     Carlton outside Washington, D.C. . . . and did something many \n     in his business want to do: tenaciously challenge the drone \n     regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration to loosen \n     restrictions on unmanned planes over the United States. \n     Judging from the reaction he received, and from the stated \n     intentions of the drone advocates who convened the forum, the \n     domestic-drone industry expects to do a lot more of that in \n     the coming months.\n       There's been a lot of hype around unmanned drones becoming \n     a fixture over U.S. airspace. . . .\n\n  You may have seen just 2 days ago, I think, a pilot coming into New \nYork City saw one on the way down. And I saw the report, I think \nyesterday, saying they are still asking whose drone it was. You would \nthink certainly we would have found out in 24 hours. I would think for \ncertain it probably would be a government drone. But it is a little \nworrisome that they are seeing drones, that they do not know who is \nflying them or where they are as far as getting in the way of our \ncommercial airliners.\n\n       There's been a lot of hype around unmanned drones becoming \n     a fixture over U.S. airspace, both for law enforcement use \n     and for operations by businesses as varied as farmers and \n     filmmakers.\n\n  It sort of leads to another point--that it is not the technology that \nwe are opposed to. There are going to be all kinds of private uses for \ndrones. There have to be some rules for where they are flown so they do \nnot get in the way of airplanes. But I would think farmers and ranchers \nmight want to use drones to, I don't know, count their cattle or their \nsheep. I do not know if you do that. But there are going to be private \nuses for these drones that will not be objectionable.\n\n       All have big implications for traditional conceptions of \n     privacy, as unmanned planes can loiter over people's \n     backyards and snap pictures for far longer than piloted \n     aircraft.\n       The government is anticipating that drone makers could \n     generate a windfall of cash as drones move from a military to \n     a civilian role. Jim Williams of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration told [a conclave of the drone manufacturers \n     conference] that the potential market for government and \n     commercial drones could generate ``nearly $90 billion in \n     economic activity . . . ''\n       But there's an obstacle: the Federal Aviation \n     Administration.\n\n  The FAA has been reluctant to grant licenses out of fear that the \ndrones, which maneuver poorly, have an alarming crash rate, and are \nspoofible, don't have the sensing capacity to spot approaching \naircraft, which could complicate and endanger U.S. airspace.\n\n       The FAA has been criticized some by--there is a group \n     called the Electronic Frontier Foundation--for not being \n     transparent about its licenses. And they have filed Freedom \n     of Information Act because they would like to know whether \n     the intentions of those putting the drones up is benign or \n     whether it involves some kind of surveillance.\n\n  We talk a lot about the government spying on us, but I think there is \ngreat potential for your competitors, your enemies, and other people to \nspy on you with drones, particularly as they become cheaper. Those \nissues will be complicated. I think one way to sort of rectify or give \nan answer to those is to say your property from where it starts on the \nground up is yours. People can fly over it, but I do not think they \nshould be able to snoop and look down in it--I think probably private \nor public looking down on your property. That will be something, \nthough, that the courts will continue to have to work out.\n  There was a push last year by Congress and the Obama administration \ndirecting the FAA to fully integrate unmanned aircraft into American \nskies. It has not been nearly enough for the drone makers. The FAA is \nmonths late in designating six test sites for drones around the \ncountry. The question is when the test site selection will begin. ``I'm \nsure that's what all of you are asking now,'' says Williams, the head \nof the FAA's drone division.\n\n       Drone makers are also frustrated by the logic of existing \n     FAA regulations. Currently, a drone weighing under 55 pounds, \n     flying below 400 feet within an operator's line of sight and \n     away from an airport is considered a model airplane and \n     cleared to fly without a license. That is, if it is not \n     engaging in any for-profit activity--sort of. ``A farmer \n     can be a modeller if they operate their aircraft as a \n     hobby or for recreational purposes.''\n       Enter Novara, a 31-year-old who owns a small drone business \n     in Falls Church, Va. called Vanilla Aircraft. ``If a farmer, \n     who hopefully is profit-minded, can fly as a hobbyist an \n     unmanned aircraft,'' Novara challenged Williams, ``why can't \n     I, as the owner of an unmanned aircraft company, fly as a \n     hobbyist my own unmanned aircraft over property that I own? \n     The guidelines before this were that any commercial intent is \n     prohibited, but . . . ''\n\n  The bottom line is that there is going to be a lot of things we are \ngoing to enter into with private drones. But opposition to the \ntechnology, either for military purposes or for private purposes, is \nnot something we are going after. What we are talking about is whether \nyour privacy will be respected and whether your constitutional rights \nwill be protected.\n  This is a new article from today by Conor Friedersdorf. It is called \n``Killing Americans on U.S. Soil: Eric Holder's Evasive, Manipulative \nLetter.''\n\n       On December 7, 1941, Japanese warplanes bombed the U.S. \n     naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Six decades later, al-\n     Qaeda terrorists flew hijacked airplanes into the World Trade \n     Center and the Pentagon. Neither President Roosevelt nor \n     President . . . Bush targeted and killed Americans on U.S. \n     soil in the aftermath of those attacks. Doing so wouldn't \n     have made any sense.\n       How strange, then, that Attorney General Eric Holder \n     invoked those very attacks in a letter confirming that \n     President Obama believes there are circumstances in which he \n     could order Americans targeted and killed on U.S. soil.\n\n  It is kind of strange. The things that he gives as justification are \nthings in which we did not kill Americans.\n\n       It's possible, I suppose, to imagine--\n\n  These are Eric Holder's words now.\n\n       It's possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary \n     circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate \n     under the Constitution and applicable laws for the President \n     to authorize the military to use lethal force within the \n     territory of the United States. For example, the President \n     could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the \n     military to use force if necessary to protect the homeland in \n     the circumstances of a catastrophic attack like what happened \n     in 1941 and again on 9/11. This very scenario to be guarded \n     against is a President using the pretext of a terrorist \n     attack to seize extraordinary powers. Isn't that among the \n     most likely scenarios for the United States turning into an \n     authoritarian security state?\n\n  To be sure, if Americans are at the controls of fighter jets en route \nto Hawaii, of course Obama could order that they be fired upon. If \nAmericans hijacked a plane, of course it would be permissible to kill \nthem before they could crash it into a building. But those are not the \nsorts of targeted killings we are talking about. What we are talking \nabout is killing people not engaged in combat because you suspect them \nof being a terrorist.\n\n       If you read to the end of Holder's letter, to the passage \n     where he said--\n\n  This is Friedersdorf again.\n\n       If you read to the end of Holder's letter, to the passage \n     where he says, ``Were such an emergency to arise, I would \n     examine the particular facts and circumstances before \n     advising the president on the scope of his authority,'' it \n     becomes clear that, despite invoking Pearl Harbor and 9/11, \n     even he isn't envisioning a response to an attack in process, \n     which would have to happen immediately. So what does he \n     envision? If he can see that a\n\n[[Page S1203]]\n\n     ``for example'' is necessary to explain, he ought to give us \n     a clarifying example rather than a nonsensical one that seems \n     to name-check events for their emotional resonance more than \n     for their aptness to the issue.\n       Elsewhere in his letter, Holder writes that ``the US \n     government has not carried out drone strikes in the United \n     States and has no intention of doing so. As a policy matter \n     moreover, we reject the use of military force where well-\n     established law enforcement authorities in the country \n     provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist \n     threat.'' Interesting they reject it ``as a policy matter,'' \n     but aren't willing to reject military force in the United \n     States as a legal matter--\n\n  That is a good distinction--\n\n     even in instances where law enforcement would better \n     incapacitate the threat. For the Obama Administration, \n     conceding that the executive branch is legally forbidden to \n     do certain things is verboten,--\n\n  So it is kind of interesting. When they are willing to admit to any \nkind of limitations on their power they say: ``Policywise'' they might \nbe limited, but they are not willing to say ``legally'' they are \nlimited. This is a problem of not just this administration, but the \nprevious one of thinking that any kind of inch that they give to \nanother branch of government, that they will be losing some of their \npower and they are unwilling to do it.\n  Friedersdorf goes on to say that:\n\n       For the Obama administration, conceding that the executive \n     branch is legally forbidden to do certain things is verboten, \n     despite the fact that an unchecked executive is much more \n     dangerous than the possibility of a future President failing \n     to do enough to fight back against an actual attack on our \n     homeland.\n       Any thinking person can see that Holder's letter is non-\n     responsive, evasive, and deliberately manipulative in its sly \n     reassurances, right down to the rhetorically powerful but \n     substantively nonsensical invocation of 9/11. (Being more \n     subtle about it than Rudy Giuliani doesn't make it right.) To \n     credulously accept this sort of response on an issue as \n     important as this one is behavior unfit for any citizen of a \n     free country, where safeguarding the rule of law is a civic \n     responsibility. The time to discuss the appropriate scope of \n     the president's authority is now.\n\n  I know many would rather defer this, they would rather do this at \nanother time. But the thing is, it is now. We brought the issue up. We \nhave spent a lot of time on this issue. Why not have a discussion, \ninstead of putting me off and saying: Oh, we will have a committee \nhearing on it. Sorry you are not on that committee, but we are going to \nhave a committee hearing on this at a later date. It will never be \ndiscussed. Nothing ever happens around here. I mean, they promise you \nstuff. They say: We are going to take care of it. But it never happens. \nI think it never will.\n\n       The time to discuss the appropriate scope of the \n     president's authority--\n\n  This is Friedersdorf again.\n\n       The time to discuss the appropriate scope of the \n     president's authority is now, not in the aftermath of a \n     catastrophic attack on the nation, as Holder suggests. The \n     fact that he disagrees speaks volumes about team Obama's \n     reckless shortsightedness.\n\n  This is another article from Wired. This is from today. This is by \nSpencer Ackerman.\n\n       The Obama administration calls it ``targeted killing.'' \n     Steven Segal would call it getting marked for death. It's the \n     practice of singling out an individual linked to a terrorist \n     group, for killing, and it's been played out hundreds of \n     times in the 9/11 era--including more recently against U.S. \n     citizens like al-Qaida's YouTube preacher Anwar al-Awlaki. \n     The Obama team has said next to nothing about how it works or \n     what laws restrict it. Until Monday.\n       Attorney General Eric Holder explained the administration's \n     reasoning for killing American citizens overseas--and only \n     overseas--with drone strikes and other means during a Monday \n     speech at Northwestern University. Holder claimed that the \n     government can kill ``a U.S. citizen who is a senior \n     operational leader of al-Qaida or associated forces'' \n     provided the government--unilaterally--determines that \n     citizen poses ``an imminent threat of violent attack''--\n\n  Once again, a little bit of a problem on the imminent doctrine is \nthat ``imminent'' does not have to mean ``immediate.''\n\n     --he can't be captured; and ``law of war principles,'' like \n     the use of proportional force and the minimization of \n     collateral damage, apply.''\n\n  The reason why some of this is important--even though he is talking \nabout overseas now and not what we are trying to talk about here is \nthat since we have not been given sort of the parameters for how they \nwill kill Americans in America, we can only assume that they will work \nwith the parameters they have overseas. The whole idea that an imminent \nthreat is not immediate is problematic no matter where that doctrine is \nused.\n\n  The idea that the law-of-war principles--I think proportional force \nis a good idea as far as trying to restrain how much force we use. But \nthere are other things within the law of war that we need to be \nconcerned about; things that happen in war are not quite the same kind \nof standard that we would have in the United States.\n  Ackerman goes on and he says:\n\n       This is an indicator of our times.\n\n  This is actually Holder.\n\n       This is an indicator of our times, not a departure from our \n     laws and our values. The debate over killing Awlaki, whom \n     Holder barely discussed, began long before a Hellfire missile \n     fired from a drone killed him and fellow propagandist Samir \n     Kahn in September. Awlaki's father sued the Obama \n     administration in 2010 to compel it to reveal its legal \n     rationale for the long-telegraphed strike. The administration \n     refused, with a judge's support.\n       For months after Awlaki's killing, the government never \n     disclosed any evidence supporting its decision that Awlaki \n     posed an imminent danger to Americans beyond his rhetoric of \n     incitement. But during the February sentencing of the \n     ``Underwear Bomber,'' the government put forward a court \n     filing claiming that Awlaki worked intimately with convicted \n     would-be bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab--\n\n  Who was the Underwear Bomber.\n\n     --to blow up Northwest Airlines. Holder referred to that \n     connection in his speech.\n       Several legal scholars have wondered why the United States \n     did not have to provide Awlaki with due process of law before \n     killing him, as stipulated under the fifth amendment. Holder \n     contended that the United States actually did, even if no \n     judge ever heard the case.\n\n  Well, this is sort of an interesting point. I am not making an \nopinion on whether the fifth amendment applies to al-Awlaki overseas. I \nthink a lot of that is complicated and not necessarily certain whether \nyou can apply the Constitution to people outside the United States, or \nwhether an entity within the United States should obey the Constitution \non people outside the United States.\n  The bottom line is, in war you are not going to get due process. You \nare not going to get Miranda rights if you are fighting in battle. It \nis a little more debatable when you are not. The point is, though, that \nthey are saying they are applying the fifth amendment sort of in \nprivate to al-Awlaki.\n  The question is, if this is the standard that is going to be used in \nthe United States, it is not going to be the actual use of the fifth \namendment, which means a court and a jury, it is going to be the \npretend use that is done behind closed doors. I am not so sure you can \nhave the fifth amendment that does not involve a courtroom. I just do \nnot understand a grand jury indictment, due process, not to be deprived \nof life and liberty. I do not how it happens in private.\n  But that is the way they are administering the fifth amendment in \nprivate. They are using their discretion as to when to administer the \nfifth amendment. I do not know how that is going to work. I also do not \nthink that is appropriate for U.S. citizens. So other than the \nPresident asking and answering a question as to whether noncombatants \nwill be killed in America, we need to ask whether he is going to--\nbefore he kills them, is he going to use the fifth amendment in private \nin the Oval Office, or is the fifth amendment going to be public? If it \nis public, I do not know how you kill someone. If you are going to get \nsome kind of due process, you would have to get tried in a court. I am \nnot sure how this would go forward.\n  This is an additional quote from Holder from the same speech:\n\n       The Constitution's guarantee of due process is ironclad, \n     and it is essential--but, as a recent court decision makes \n     clear, ``it does not require judicial approval before the \n     president may use force abroad against a senior operational \n     leader of a foreign terrorist organization with which the \n     United States is at war, even if that individual happens to \n     be a U.S. citizen.''\n\n  Well, that is kind of confusing. If that is going to be the standard \nhere, I would be quite concerned. The standard over there--I think \nthere are arguments on both sides of it. But the standard over here, I \ncannot imagine that this is the standard we are going to use. Because \nbasically he is saying the Constitution applies unless we think it does \nnot apply, and then decide it does not apply.\n  But then he says, as long as we are at war. Well, who are we at war \nwith? We are at war basically with anybody who\n\n[[Page S1204]]\n\ndoes not like us around the world. I am not sure if there is ever an \nend to that. I think there are problems overseas. But particularly the \nproblem is--I think the problem at hand that we are trying to get to \nthe root of is, is this the standard? If you are using this standard \noverseas, are you going to use the standard here that basically the \nfifth amendment applies when we think it applies, and it does not apply \nwhen we do not think it applies?\n  This is Ackerman, at this point, from Wired again.\n\n       Holder did not explain why Awlaki's 16-year-old son, whom a \n     missile strike killed two weeks after his father's death, was \n     a lawful target. Holder did not explain how a missile strike \n     represents due process, or what the standards for due process \n     the government must meet when killing a U.S. citizen abroad. \n     Holder did not explain why the government can only target \n     U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism for death overseas and \n     not necessarily domestically.\n\n  As I said, a lot of these things overseas you can debate and try to \ndecide whether this is a war zone or not a war zone. But they obviously \ndo not apply in the United States. The most troubling thing about the \nkilling of the 16-year-old son of Awlaki is the President's spokesman's \nresponse to this. You know, the flippant nature of it and the \nirresponsible nature for him to have said: Well, he should have chosen \nmore responsible parents. If that is the standard we are going to have \nfor killing Americans on American soil, that we are going to kill \npeople who do not have responsible parents, we have set the bar pretty \nlow for our killing program.\n  I think al-Awlaki was killed--I don't know. I have not seen the \nclassified information. I think the son was killed probably when they \neither targeted someone else or they did what they call these signature \nstrikes where they don't know whom they are killing necessarily. They \njust think they are bad people, they came from a meeting of other bad \npeople:\n\n       The decision to kill an American, Holder said, is ``among \n     the gravest that government leaders can face.'' Targeted \n     killing is not assassination, he argued, because \n     ``assassinations are unlawful killings.'' Among the few \n     external limitations on the government's war power that \n     Holder mentioned were the approval of a local government \n     where the strikes occur--which must have pleased reluctant, \n     unsteady U.S. Allies in Pakistan and Yemen.\n\n  He is saying an interesting thing, and probably Pakistan has approved \nof most of the killings. However, Pakistan wants to come in and wants \nto convince and say: No, we haven't. They are doing it against our \nwill, but my guess is they have been told.\n\n       Some Members of Congress don't consider that a sufficient \n     safeguard.\n       ``The government should explain exactly how much evidence \n     the president needs in order to decide that a particular \n     American is part of a terrorist group,'' says Sen. Ron Wyden, \n     an Oregon Democrat who sits on the Senate's Intelligence \n     Committee. ``It is also unclear to me whether individual \n     Americans must be given the opportunity to surrender before \n     lethal force is used against them. And I'm particularly \n     concerned that the geographic boundaries of this authority \n     have not been clearly laid out.''\n\n  The point on the geographic boundaries is a pretty important point \nbecause this is one of the concerning items about what they maintain. \nThey say there are no geographic limitations. They say they get the \nauthority for war everywhere around the world, as well as war here, \nbecause they say there were no geographic limitations to the use of \nauthorization of force when we went to war in Afghanistan.\n  I think people who voted for that--and I would have voted to go to \nwar in Afghanistan--thought we were going to Afghanistan to fight the \npeople who got us on 9/11.\n  I don't think they thought, when they voted for that resolution, it \nmeant we could have war in the United States under that resolution and \nthat the standard would be one of the laws of war or one of martial law \nwithin the United States. I don't think anybody voting on it had that \nconclusion. That is a real problem. Those people are saying, including \nthe administration is saying, no geographic limitations and, \nessentially, there are no temporal limitations. We have a perpetual war \nwithout any geographic limitations, which now they want to apply war \nprinciples to killing in the United States.\n  Ackerman continues quoting Senator Wyden:\n\n       ``And based on what I've heard so far, I can't tell whether \n     or not the Justice Department's legal arguments would allow \n     the President to order intelligence agencies to kill an \n     American inside the United States.''\n\n  He is unclear about it, and he has seen a lot more information than I \nhave because he is on the Intelligence Committee and sees secure and \nclassified information. He is unsure of it.\n  This makes me think nobody in the Senate or the Congress knows \nwhether they are asserting whether they can kill Americans on American \nsoil.\n\n       Mary Ellen O'Connell, the vice president of the American \n     Society of International Law, found Holder's legal rationale \n     flimsy, stating:\n       ``First, [Holder] restates the renamed global war on \n     terror, which Obama himself condemned. Then he tries the \n     United Nations Charter Article 51 but does not include the \n     whole article: It says member states of the U.N. have an \n     `inherent right of self-defense' if an armed attack occurs. \n     Article 51 does not provide a legal green light for targeted \n     killing,'' O'Connell said in an e-mail. ``Finally, he adds \n     the argument that the U.S. may use force against States that \n     are `unable or unwilling' to act. This argument has no basis \n     in international law. It simply does not exist. So regardless \n     of how carefully you target under the law of armed conflict, \n     there is no right in the first instance to target at all.''\n\n  Without yielding the floor, I would like to entertain a question from \nthe Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Senator Paul recently sent a letter requesting some \ninformation from the Obama administration relating to drone strikes.\n  It is significant that on March 4, 2013, just a couple days ago, \nSenator Paul received back from the administration a letter signed by \nEric H. Holder, Jr., which reads as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Paul:\n       On February 20, 2013, you wrote to John Brennan requesting \n     additional information concerning the Administration's views \n     about whether ``the President has the power to authorize \n     lethal force, such as a drone strike, against a U.S. citizen \n     on U.S. soil, and without trial.''\n       As Members of this Administration have previously \n     indicated, the U.S. government has not carried out drone \n     strikes in the United States and has no intention of doing \n     so. As a policy matter, moreover, we reject the use of \n     military force where well-established law enforcement \n     authorities in this country provide the best means for \n     incapacitating a terrorist threat. We have a long history of \n     using the criminal justice system to incapacitate individuals \n     located in our country who pose a threat to the United States \n     and its interests abroad. Hundreds of individuals have been \n     arrested and convicted of terrorism-related offenses in our \n     Federal courts.\n       The question you have posed is therefore entirely \n     hypothetical, unlikely to occur, and one we hope no President \n     will ever have to confront. It is possible, I suppose, to \n     imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be \n     necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and \n     applicable laws of the United States for the President to \n     authorize the military to use lethal force within the \n     territory of the United States. For example, the President \n     could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the \n     military to use such force if necessary to protect the \n     homeland in the circumstances of a catastrophic attack like \n     the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11, \n     2001.\n       Were such an emergency to arise, I would examine the \n     particular facts and circumstances before advising the \n     President on the scope of his authority.\n       Sincerely, Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General.\n\n  It is good to have this letter as a response to Senator Paul's \ninquiry. I believe the inquiry Senator Paul raised is a legitimate one. \nIt is also essential we have some clarity with regard to the \nadministration's position on this type of an attack. It is important \nfor us to remember every time government acts, it does so at the \nexpense of the liberty of individual Americans.\n  This doesn't mean government action is bad. This simply means \ngovernment action always has to be weighed. It always has to be \ncounterbalanced against the impact it has on the citizenry. It is very \nimportant we approach these things delicately. Nowhere is this \nbalancing act more necessary than where we have circumstances in which \nour government action threatens not just the liberty but also the \nproperty or, most important, the life of an individual American. Where \nlife is threatened, the concerns of the Constitution are at their \nhighest where life is threatened as a result of government action.\n  Government owes it to the citizens to undertake all its activities \nwith utmost caution. It owes it to its citizens never to deprive human \nbeings of their lives, particularly American citizens,\n\n[[Page S1205]]\n\nunless it has done so through operation of law with what we call due \nprocess of law.\n  It is on this concept, due process of law, that the 5th and 14th \namendments of our Constitution focus so intently. Due process of law is \na familiar phrase to many Americans. We have heard this phrase over and \nover. We understand on some level what it means, but I would like to \ntalk for a few minutes in response to Senator Paul's question about the \nfact that in order to have due process of law, you need to have a \nfamiliar legal standard or at least a legal standard. You have to have \na law that is capable of being applied in a way that American citizens \ncan understand.\n  They can read the law. They can review it. They can understand what \nthe law requires of them. They can understand what it is that the law \ndemands and what it is that the law authorizes the government to do. In \nthe absence of such a law, a law that can be applied, a law that can be \nunderstood in advance of its application, you run a very real risk of \narbitrary and capricious government action, where government action is \narbitrary, capricious and where it threatens to underline life, liberty \nor property but especially life. There is the greatest level of \nconcerns where the greatest level of detail must be examined with \nregard to what the government wants to do.\n  In this circumstance, where the question relates to under what \ncircumstances, to what extent the government may take an American life, \nthe government may snuff out the life of an individual American \ncitizen, the government has an obligation to see to it and to assure \nits citizens that it will not ever undertake such an action without due \nprocess of law. To have due process of law, you need to have a \ndiscernible legal standard. A discernible legal standard is not \nentirely evident on the face of this letter. That is understandable. It \nis just a brief response to Senator Paul's inquiry.\n  It is, however, a little troubling Eric Holder doesn't do more to \nassure Senator Paul in this response to his letter that these kinds of \nactions wouldn't be necessary to undertake on American soil, that these \nkinds of actions would be fraught with constitutional problems when \nundertaken on American soil.\n  It is difficult to understand why the Attorney General wouldn't just \nsay we will not do this. This would be fraught with constitutional \nproblems. This is not something we would do.\n  Also troubling is the related point that the Attorney General has \napparently relied on some legal analysis provided by the chief advisory \nbody within the U.S. Department of Justice. The U.S. Department of \nJustice is something one might loosely describe as the largest law firm \nin the United States. It is the law firm of the Federal Government.\n  Within any law firm you have lawyers who do different things. There \nare lawyers who specialize primarily in litigation, lawyers who \nspecialize primarily in attracting agreements or in giving advice to \npeople.\n  The Office of Legal Counsel within the U.S. Department of Justice is \nthe chief advisory office within DOJ. It was the Office of Legal \nCounsel which drafted one or more memos outlining the circumstances in \nwhich the Obama administration might consider undertaking actions \ninvolving lethal force against American citizens.\n  Sadly, most of us in the Senate have been unable to review those. The \nAmerican people generally have been unable to review them, but it is \nparticularly frustrating those of us who are members of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and, therefore, have an oversight responsibility \nover the U.S. Department of Justice, have not been fortunate enough to \nreview the memoranda upon which the Obama administration has apparently \nrelied in undertaking this legal analysis.\n  I had the opportunity to question and did question this morning Eric \nHolder with regard to these memoranda. I explained to him the great \nneed we have to be able to review these memoranda, particularly as \nmembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I explained to him this is \npart of our oversight responsibilities. This is our duty. It is our \nright to see such documents, and it is very frustrating we have not \nbeen allowed to see such documents.\n  I added to that my concern what we do have is a different document, \nnot the Office of Legal Counsel memorandum but something simply \ncaptioned as the ``Department of Justice White Paper.'' I always \nthought that was an interesting phrase, ``white paper.'' I don't know \nwhy they feel the need to call it that, why they don't just call it a \npaper. Normally, we don't have legal analyses or other important \ndocuments which are written on green paper, orange paper or any other \ncolor of paper. Nonetheless they call it a white paper.\n  This paper was leaked by the Obama administration to the news media. \nThis particular paper purported to contain some analysis, perhaps in \nsummary form, the same type of analysis of what was used in the still \nsecret Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel memorandum.\n  There were a couple things I found very disturbing about the contents \nof the white paper. First, the white paper focused on the fact that the \nU.S. Government may use lethal force to kill an American citizen only \nwhere there is an imminent threat of some sort. Where the other \nconditions outlined in the memorandum are satisfied, there still has to \nbe an imminent threat of some sort. There needs to be an imminent \nthreat that the use of lethal force by the government on the U.S. \ncitizen in question is designed to confront.\n  That is a somewhat familiar legal term. It is used in other context \nto identify a circumstance in which one thing has to occur in order to \nprevent something else even worse from happening.\n  (Mr. SCHATZ assumed the Chair.)\n  An individual, for example, when confronted with an imminent threat \nto his or her own life, is entitled to use lethal force in defending \nhim or herself in order to avoid that attack--in order to avoid death. \nBut it does have to be an imminent threat. There are other examples. \nWhen a person argues that a certain action was undertaken under duress, \nthere does have to be some degree of imminence. And it is appropriate \nin this circumstance, where we are talking about authorizing the \nFederal Government of the United States of America to use lethal force \non an American citizen, that there ought to be some sort of imminent \nthreat to American national security that necessitates and fully \njustifies that action.\n  The strange thing about the white paper, this white paper that was \nleaked by the Obama administration to the news media, is that it \nredefined ``imminence.'' It redefined it completely. It defined it to \nbe something else, something that bears no resemblance to what you or I \nwould call an imminent threat. It seemed to suggest that an imminent \nthreat may occur even when there is nothing that is about to occur on \nan immediate basis that would involve a loss of American life or an \nattack on an American compound or installation or any kind of a loss or \na deprivation to American national security.\n  This is a problem because, as we discussed just a few minutes ago, in \norder to have due process of law, you have to have law operating, and \nyou have to have law operating as something other than a tool to \njustify arbitrary and capricious behavior by government. You have to \nhave a discernible, judicially manageable legal standard. Even if it is \nsomething that is never going to go through a court, it needs to be a \nlegal standard that means something, that has teeth to it, that doesn't \njust say government officials may undertake action X, Y, or Z if the \ngovernment official in question feels moved upon to take such action. \nThere needs to be something that has the capacity to restrain \ngovernment action, and it needs to be--and the basis of and by \noperation of generally applicable standards--generally applicable rules \nof law. That is what we mean when we say due process.\n  Again, due process and the restrictions that accompany it are at \ntheir highest when government wants to take an action that is designed \nto or could lead to the ending of a human life. The sanctity of human \nlife requires nothing less than that.\n  Now, there was another part of the memo that was also a little bit \ndisturbing. The other part of the memo suggested it would, of course, \nbe necessary in order to carry out an action involving lethal force \nagainst an American citizen; that efforts to capture\n\n[[Page S1206]]\n\nthat individual would somehow prove to be futile; that those efforts \nwouldn't work. But there, again, the definition supplied by the white \npaper suggested something else. The language of the white paper \nsuggested almost that the government official in question, in charge of \nthis decision to end an American citizen's life, could be made somewhat \narbitrarily, somewhat capriciously. This is a problem.\n  You don't want someone sitting there one day having the authority to \nsay so-and-so is a troublemaker, so-and-so shouldn't be there, so-and-\nso has been involved with some very bad actors. So-and-so may in fact \nbe a bad individual, may in fact be associated with people who want to \nharm the interests of the United States or may even have been involved \nin the planning of attacks on the United States, but you don't want the \ngovernment official in question to be able to end that American \ncitizen's life just on the basis of flimsy analysis, on a toothless \nlegal standard. You want the American people to continue to be able to \nlive under the rule of law and with an understanding that actions of \ngovernment, particularly those actions designed to bring an end to a \nhuman being's life, won't be undertaken lightly.\n  That is what it means to live in a society that operates under a rule \nof law as opposed to the rule of individual human beings. It is that we \nhave standards and we reduce those standards to writing. Those \nstandards are rules that are generally accepted and generally \napplicable, that govern the conduct of individuals in society, and both \nthe governors and the governed will themselves determine the behavior \nof those involved in our society.\n  So our law of laws, our rule of rules, our most fundamental law, is \nthe U.S. Constitution--this 225-year-old document that I happen to \nbelieve was written by the hands of wise men raised up by their Creator \nfor that very purpose. These were wise men who understood human nature, \nwise men who understood that whenever you put an individual in charge \nof a lot of other individuals, there are risks--risks that are inherent \nin human nature, risks that can be managed if you put certain checks \nand balances in place, and those checks and balances will ensure that \nno one person, no one group of people, will become so powerful as to \nbecome a law unto themselves.\n  You see, that is what this document, our Constitution, the \nConstitution of the United States, was designed to ensure; that we, as \nAmericans, would live free, and we would live free because our laws \nwould govern us, not the whims or the caprice of individuals.\n  Now, I do have another letter that I would like to share. This is a \nletter that was sent to my friend, Senator Paul, from Mr. John Brennan, \ncurrently serving as Assistant to the President for Homeland Security \nand Counterterrorism. This letter is dated from just earlier this week. \nIn fact, it is dated March 5, 2013, and here is what it says:\n\n       Dear Senator Paul:\n       Thank you for your February 20, 2013, letter regarding the \n     power to authorize lethal force, such as a drone strike, \n     against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, and without trial.\n       The Department of Justice will address your legal question \n     regarding the President's authorities under separate cover. I \n     can, however, state unequivocally that the agency I have been \n     nominated to lead, the CIA, does not conduct lethal \n     operations inside the United States--nor does it have any \n     authority to do so. Thus, if I am fortunate enough to be \n     confirmed as CIA Director, I would have no power to authorize \n     such operations.\n       In addition, I have asked the CIA to respond to your \n     letters of January 25 and February 12, 2013, which raise a \n     number of important questions regarding issues pertaining to \n     the advancement of America's strategic priorities around the \n     globe.\n       Sincerely, John O. Brennan.\n\n  This is helpful. This is a helpful indication from a government \nofficial who has been nominated to head the Central Intelligence \nAgency, and who acknowledges if he is confirmed to this position, he \nwould have no authority as Director of the CIA to order lethal drone \nstrikes within the United States. So that is helpful.\n\n  It is still significant that we be allowed to ask from time to time \nwhat the CIA might do with regard to other persons--other persons \nincluding U.S. citizens outside the United States--and under what \ncircumstances a lethal drone strike or a different type of lethal force \nmight be appropriate when directed toward an American citizen outside \nthe United States.\n  I notice one phrase he uses in his letter, when he says: `` . . . \nsuch as a drone strike against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, and without \na trial.'' Whenever we are talking about any person within our \njurisdiction, whenever we are talking about an American citizen, \nregardless of where that American citizen might be found, it seems to \nme we do owe that person certain responsibilities. We owe that person a \nduty of following the law, of following our most fundamental law--the \nU.S. Constitution--and following other statutory authorities we have in \nplace specifically to protect the rights and the interests, the life \nand the liberty and the property of the American people.\n  We are told those things cannot be taken by the government without \ndue process of law. Now, normally, when we take away someone's life or \ntheir liberty or their property, we entitle that person to a trial. \nThis is where our constitutional protections overlap a little bit and \nthey complement each other. We have in the fifth amendment this \nprotection that says that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, \nor property without due process of law. There, again, at a bare \nminimum, that entails the operation of these generally applicable laws \nthat actually have some standards to them. It typically also involves, \nquite necessarily, an opportunity on the part of the person being acted \nupon by government to have a trial.\n  We have elsewhere in the Constitution other protections that \nguarantee this. We have protections indicating that if a person is \ncharged with a crime by our government, under the sixth amendment they \nhave a right to a jury trial, and they have a right to counsel in \nconnection with that trial. They have a right even to counsel paid for \nby the government if they can't afford an attorney in connection with \nthat. The seventh amendment, likewise, protects the right to a trial in \nthe context of civil disputes.\n  So these and other protections overlap to guarantee that Americans \nwill have due process. Frequently, what due process entails, among \nother things, is the privation of a jury trial. You see, juries do \nperform an important function. Juries are there to help protect our \nrights. When we have a jury of our peers deciding critical questions \nwith regard to our interests in life, in liberty, in property, we see \nto it that a panel of lay persons, a panel of nongovernment officials, \na panel of citizens who have sworn an oath to do justice will do \nprecisely that, and they will not shrink from the obligation to enforce \nthe demands of the Constitution. They will not shrink to enforce the \ndemands of the law. They will not shrink from their duties, and they \nwill not see themselves as part of a government establishment.\n  This is how our constitution protects us and insulates us from the \ngovernment because we are the people; and we, the people, control the \ngovernment. We, the people, have the right to a jury trial. And when we \nactually get a jury trial, we are able to see our rights protected.\n  So, in response to the Senator's question, I do think there are some \nproblems that we confront as a society. I think the security of the \nUnited States is, of course, of paramount importance. We need to \nprotect American national security. We need to protect Americans. As we \ndo so, we also need to protect the inalienable rights of individual \nAmericans to the due process guarantees that are hundreds of years old, \nthat extend at least as far back as the drafting and ratification of \nour constitution, and are, of course, much older than that. They are \ncenturies, indeed, they are millennia old. We must continue to honor \nthem.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from Utah \nfor his expert constitutional analysis, and I rely on his advice and \nanalysis of legislation and want to thank him very much for being part \nof this debate.\n  We are in contact with the White House, and we have told the White \nHouse we will allow debate on Brennan as soon as they will give a \nclarification of what their opinion is on drone strikes in America.\n  I think after Holder's cross-examination, his opinion may not be too \nfar off from what we are asking for. But we want it clarified and in \nwriting because we think this is an important battle\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\nfor the American public and an important battle for the Constitution. \nSo if the President or the Attorney General will promise to give us \nsomething, even give us something by morning, we are more than willing \nto go ahead with the vote in the morning with that information.\n  At this time, without yielding the floor, I wish to entertain a \nquestion from the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor of the Senate in \ngreat admiration for the Senator from Kentucky, for what he is doing to \ntry to get information. All we are asked to do is to give advice and \nconsent to the President on this very important nominee to be the head \nof the Central Intelligence Agency, the key to central intelligence in \nthis Nation. I come to the floor this evening to thank my colleague \nfrom Kentucky for the leadership he has continued to show by asking \nquestions which are not just questions of his, they are questions of \nthe American people.\n  I was traveling around the State of Wyoming last week, talking to \nfolks. I went to 13 different counties in our State of 23 counties. \nThere were many questions being asked about drones, not just their \naccuracy but their intent and what this administration's policy is \nrelated to drones and how they can be used. People in my home State of \nWyoming are concerned about drones being used in the United States, not \njust specifically for attacks against American citizens but also the \nconcept in observation, in surveillance. What about our rights as \ncitizens to privacy? Those are the questions that come up as I travel \naround the State.\n  I had a telephone townhall meeting the other evening with many people \nfrom all around Wyoming on the line. They admire the questioning from \nthe Senator from Kentucky. They have concerns: Is Big Brother watching? \nWhat is happening and what role has government in observing and \nsurveillance and looking into the lives of the American people?\n  It was not until Senator Paul asked the question would there be \nstrikes on American citizens in America that I think things became very \nfocused at home and all around the country. Then we got more e-mails, \nmore concerns, because the specific question that Senator Paul is \nasking is a question that is on the minds of all Americans. I believe \nSenator Paul deserves an answer. The American people deserve an answer. \nSo it is not just Senator Paul who deserves an answer, it is an answer \nto all of the people of this country. But I appreciate Senator Paul's \nleadership in asking the specific question.\n  The Intelligence Committee, the Select Committee on Intelligence met, \nthey had hearings, they had debates, discussions, deliberations, and \nactually they voted. That is why we are here on the floor tonight, to \nask finally from the White House and from the nominee what the specific \nposition and policy of this administration happens to be on drones. I \nknow we have a unanimous consent request from Senator Paul and in a \nsecond I am going to ask him to explain and maybe reiterate his \nunanimous consent request, explain the resolution he wishes to vote on. \nI think the Senator deserves a vote. We want to make sure the public \nunderstands what we are discussing here. That is why I appreciate the \nleadership of Senator Lee who has come here as a constitutional scholar \nto address some of these concerns.\n  I think before many Senators are able to make the final decision of \nhow to vote, how to give advice and consent to the White House, we need \nmore information. We need to hear from the White House. We need to hear \nfrom the administration because the people all around the country want \nthose same questions answered.\n  We do have a situation where the Senator from Kentucky said he is \nwilling to have a vote. He is willing to allow a vote on this nominee \non the floor of the Senate as soon as his question is answered. He \nwould be happy to proceed with that vote as early as tomorrow morning.\n  The American people deserve better than they are getting right now \nfrom this administration in so many ways. This is but one. That is why \nI think all of us try to go home every weekend to learn what is on the \nminds of folks in our home States, in our home communities. This is \nclearly what I have been hearing about, traveling around Wyoming, a \nState of vast open spaces, a State of great majesty and beauty, but a \nState where people are concerned with their own privacy, with overhead \nsurveillance and of course not just their own personal privacy but \ntheir security.\n  What are the rights and responsibilities of a national government \nwhen new technology exists, as we have seen with drones? I had the \nprivilege of visiting our soldiers overseas in Afghanistan with a \nnumber of Senators in January. We have seen up close, through detailed \nvideo, the capabilities of drones, capabilities that were not there \nthat many years ago. Questions such as this would have never arisen a \nnumber of years ago because the technology was not there. But now the \ntechnology is there. With that given technology, that raises new \nquestions. That is why I think so many Americans are appreciative of \nthe work by Senator Paul to specifically ask questions that have never \nbeen asked before because the technology was not there before. Now we \nhave the technology, we have the know-how, and the question continues \nto be asked.\n  I ask my friend and colleague from Kentucky if he could explain \nperhaps his unanimous consent request, what vote he is asking for, why \nit is so important, and what it means to all of us as free citizens in \nthis great Nation.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \ncoming to the floor and helping to advance this debate. One of the \npoints that was made toward the end is about our soldiers he visited \nand that he saw the capacity of the drones. The one thing that should \nnot be lost here is that we are not arguing about the use of drones, \nparticularly in defense of our military. When people are shooting at \nour soldiers I want the best equipment in the world that we have to \ndefend them and to win our battles. That is something I think we should \nall want.\n  But I think our American soldiers would be disappointed in us here at \nhome if they felt, which I think many of them do, that they are \nfighting for our Bill of Rights, they are fighting for our \nConstitution, they are fighting for our conception of freedom--in doing \nso, I think they would be disappointed if they felt the drones that \nwere being used against the enemy in the mountains of Afghanistan and \nPakistan were going to be used against Americans in America without any \nkind of due process, because the whole idea of the Constitution is what \nthey are fighting for. That is what the President has pledged to uphold \nand preserve. So it is such an important battle.\n  The unanimous consent that we put forward, which we had hoped they \nwould let us vote on in the morning also but they have disagreed with, \nbasically says the use of drones to execute or target American citizens \non American soil who pose no imminent threat clearly violates the \nconstitutional due process rights of citizens.\n  The point we are trying to get at, which I think for the \nadministration ought to be an easy question--we are not talking about \nsomeone attacking the Twin Towers. We are in agreement that the \nmilitary can repulse attacks by American citizens in planes. Some of \nthe hijackers--I think some of them--I don't know if any of them were \ncitizens or not but--yes, some of them were citizens, I think. The \npoint is, no matter who you are, if you attack the United States you \ncan be repelled and that lethal force can be used.\n  The point is we are concerned that some of the drone strikes overseas \nare of people not involved in combat at the time, and that is another \nquestion, but here at home I don't think we want to have a standard \nwhere someone who we think might be a terrorist, who we think might be \nengaged in something, who is in a restaurant eating dinner, would be \nkilled. I think we want more protections for Americans. We want, if you \nare accused of a crime, to have the ability to defend yourself in a \ncourt of law.\n  I, without relinquishing the floor, would be happy to entertain any \nother questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come and ask my colleague if this is\n\n[[Page S1208]]\n\nsomething he may have heard about at home as well, because this is \nsomething clearly on the mind of the people of Wyoming. Of course, just \nlike Kentucky--and I will tell you when I was overseas in Afghanistan I \nran not just into soldiers from Wyoming--I met eight of them in four \ndifferent locations that I went to throughout Afghanistan. I met \nsoldiers from Kentucky in each of those locations. So we are both from \nStates with a significant commitment to our military. People over the \ncenturies have continued to fight and defend our freedoms. But today in \nAfghanistan we have soldiers from my home State and your home State \ndoing what they do to keep us free, defending the Bill of Rights, \ndefending the Constitution.\n  When we talk about the Bill of Rights, let's think about what Ronald \nReagan said. The Bill of Rights was not established to protect the \ngovernment from the people, it was established to protect the people \nfrom the government. Search and seizure, freedom of press, freedom of \nspeech, freedom of religion, our second amendment rights to own and \nbear arms--those are the constitutional rights, individual rights that \npeople are fighting for every day in Afghanistan. They want to know \nwhen they get home what sort of freedoms are there going to be in this \ncountry? Where is the role of liberty and freedom in our society?\n  That is why there is no better time, I would say, than this evening, \nbefore voting on the nominee to be the Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency--the head of the CIA for the country--what better \ntime to have this debate than during that nomination process about \nwhere is that line between freedom of individual citizens and the \nrights of a government which now has a technology which has not \npreviously been there up until most recently.\n  So I ask my friend and colleague--No. 1, I congratulate him and thank \nhim for remarkable leadership. I hear that all around my home State and \nI know he hears it at home as well. He hears it all around the country. \nBut is this a concern on the minds of people? Is there a reason we are \nhere to bring this out, not just because a couple of Senators are on \nthe floor debating it? This is a crucial issue for this Nation.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, one of the things I hear at home, similar \nto what the Senator from Wyoming is talking about, is that we hear \npeople worried about the erosion of their rights. They worry about \nstatements from the President when the President says he intends to \nprotect the Constitution--except for maybe when it is infeasible or \nwhen it is inconvenient. I think that worries people.\n  One of the other things about drones, which is not particularly \nrelated to this, necessarily, but I know in Wyoming I bet they have the \nsame concerns, is our farmers are not too happy about the government \nflying drones over their property. That is something on which we had an \ninteresting vote last year. We had a vote on whether the EPA could \ncontinue these without explaining to us. Once again, it was sort of \nsimilar to this fight in the sense that we wanted to stop the drone \nflights over farms. It was a pretty simple request, an easy request \nuntil we got the government to explain what kind of criteria, what kind \nof rules they were using for flying over farms.\n  We got 56 Senators to vote to ban these drone flights until we got \nmore information. But it is like a lot of other things in the Senate, \nit took 60 votes, so we didn't actually quite win even though we had a \nmajority.\n  With regard to what we are trying to accomplish through this, the \nmain thing we want is a public acknowledgment from the President or \nfrom the Attorney General, saying that their policy is not to kill \nnoncombatants in America. Many of the drone strikes overseas have been \nnoncombatants--at least at the time they are killed they were not \ninvolved in combat. I don't think it is too much to ask the President \nto clarify that what he means is the United States can repel invasion, \nthe United States can repel attacks, whether they are American citizens \nor not. We don't have a dispute with that. Our concern is when you look \nat the drone program overseas, a lot of people are sitting around \neating, walking, sleeping in their house--that that is not the sort of \na program I can imagine using in the United States. I cannot imagine we \nare going to have drone strikes on people while they are asleep in \ntheir home or when they are out eating in a cafe or eating in a \nrestaurant. I cannot imagine that is the standard we are going to use. \nMaybe it is just a misunderstanding. Maybe the President can clear this \nup.\n  When Attorney General Holder was there this morning, the Senator from \nTexas asked him this question and under pointed questioning it seemed \nas if he was backing toward an answer that might be acceptable. He said \nit was not appropriate, but what we are looking for from the lead legal \nofficer of the President, from the President, is something a little \nmore precise than ``I don't intend to,'' or a little more precise than \n``it is not appropriate.'' We would like him to say that they don't \nhave a legal authority to kill Americans on American soil. We just \ndon't believe they do. Targeted drone strikes in America, I don't think \nthey have the legal authority nor the constitutional prerogative to do \nthis, and they need to admit to that. It has been like pulling teeth \ntrying to get information or get them to acknowledge anything. Our goal \nis to try to get the President to acknowledge something publicly, more \nso than any kind of legislation.\n\n  We do have some legislation that we are interested in. We are not \ndemanding that it pass in order to let this nomination go forward. What \nwe are asking for is we will let them have a vote any time they want if \nthey will at least give us a little more of a clear understanding that \nthey are going to obey the law. It took a month and a half for us to \nget the response from them that the CIA doesn't operate in the United \nStates; that just is the law. It has been the law since 1947.\n  One would not think it would be that hard to get them to acknowledge \nthey are going to obey the law. The posse comitatus law has been here \nsince the 1860s, and it says the military doesn't operate in the United \nStates. How hard is it for the administration to say we are going to \nadhere to the posse comitatus law and that we are not going to use the \nmilitary in the United States? That clarifies quite a few things \nbecause if they think they are going to kill Americans with the FBI, at \nleast we already know the FBI works under the rules of the \nConstitution. I would think at that point we are getting somewhere or \nat least moving in the right direction.\n  We are not looking for something where we permanently stop the \nPresident from getting his political appointees. I have mentioned \npreviously I voted for three of the President's political appointees. \nMy point in being here doesn't have so much to do with the CIA Director \nas it has to do with the policy of the administration on drones. He \njust happens to have been in charge of that policy on drones and the \nCIA has something to do with drones overseas. At least Brennan has been \nforthright and finally came forward with a letter that says the CIA \ndoesn't operate in the United States.\n  Unfortunately, Attorney General Holder's response has been somewhat \nmuddled in the sense that he kind of says we have not yet, we don't \nintend to, but we might. Now he says there is an extraordinary \ncircumstance, but his extraordinary circumstance doesn't quite make any \nsense because it is 9/11 or Pearl Harbor. Well, in both of those \ninstances we would react immediately to stop somebody, but they would \nnot be targeted drone strikes. I cannot imagine that we would know the \nperson's name and who they are when they are flying a plane into a \nbuilding. We would respond to them, but it would not have anything to \ndo with the targeted drone strikes. It is sort of answering a question \nthat wasn't asked.\n  At this time, Madam President, and without yielding the time, I wish \nto entertain a question from the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I have been able to put my hand on the \nletter Senator Paul has written to John Brennan on February 20. This is \nsomething that I believe brought in focus the key piece of what has \nbeen on the minds of the people in my home State with regard to their \nsupport for the question that Senator Paul is asking. Since I don't \nserve on that committee and was not part of the hearings, I wish to \nreview this letter so I\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\ncan specifically ask Senator Paul about the response he has received to \nthis. Perhaps then we can share that with the American people as to why \nso many folks who have been focused on this believe it is of key \nimportance.\n  The letter from Senator Paul says:\n\n       Dear Mr. Brennan, In consideration of your nomination to be \n     Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, (CIA), I have \n     repeatedly requested that you provide answers to several \n     questions clarifying your role in the approval of lethal \n     force against terrorism suspects, particularly those who are \n     U.S. citizens.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Your past actions in this regard, as well as your view of \n     the limitations to which you were subject, are of critical \n     importance in assessing your qualifications to lead the CIA.\n\n  That is what we are doing. We are here in our role to advise-and-\nconsent the President on a nomination he has made.\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       If it is not clear that you will honor the limits placed \n     upon the Executive Branch by the Constitution, then the \n     Senate should not confirm you to lead the CIA.\n\n  The people of Wyoming carry their Constitutions in their breast \npockets. We have them with us just as Senator Bob Byrd used to do right \nhere on the Senate floor, and many Members of the Senate do. We need to \nmake sure the limits placed upon the executive branch by the \nConstitution are still upheld; otherwise, the Senate should not confirm \nMr. Brennan to lead the CIA.\n  So the letter from Senator Paul goes on to say:\n\n       During your confirmation process in the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence, committee members have quite \n     appropriately made requests similar to questions I have \n     raised in my previous letter to you.\n\n  I agree. Members of the committee did make appropriate requests and \nwanted to have those same questions answered that Senator Paul has been \noffering, and they are that you expound on your views, Mr. Brennan, on \nthe limits of executive power in using lethal force against U.S. \ncitizens. This is against U.S. citizens, especially when operating on \nU.S. soil.\n  That is among the fundamental questions I have been asked during \ntelephone townhall meetings when I travel the State of Wyoming. It \ncomes down to the use of lethal force against U.S. citizens, especially \nwhen operating on U.S. soil.\n  The letter from Senator Paul goes on and says:\n\n       In fact, the Chairman of the SSCI, Sen. Feinstein, \n     specifically asked you in post-hearing questions for the \n     record whether the Administration could carry out drone \n     strikes inside the United States.\n\n  We are now getting to the crux of the matter: drone strikes inside \nthe United States.\n  Senator Paul goes on:\n\n       In your response, you emphasized that the Administration \n     ``has not carried out'' such strikes and ``has no intention \n     of doing so.''\n\n  So has not done it, doesn't intend to do it, but it doesn't answer \nthe question that Senator Paul, the people of his home State, the \npeople of my home State, and the people all across this country are \nasking.\n\n  Senator Paul goes on in his letter to Mr. Brennan:\n\n       I do not find this response sufficient.\n\n  As people are following what the Senator from Kentucky is doing here, \nmore and more people are asking and focusing on this specific question. \nThe question I and many others have asked is not whether the \nadministration has or intends to carry out drone strikes inside the \nUnited States, but whether they believe they have the authority to do \nso. The question is about whether it has the authority to do so. The \nquestion is not whether they have carried them out, not whether they \nintend to, but do they have the authority to do so. This is an \nimportant distinction that should not and, I would add, cannot be \nignored.\n  Well, the letter goes on:\n\n       Just last week, President Obama also avoided this question \n     . . .\n\n  So the President has avoided the question when posed to him directly. \nInstead of addressing the question of whether the Administration could \nkill a U.S. citizen on American soil, he used a similar line, that \n``There has never been a drone used on an American citizen on American \nsoil.''\n  Well, we believe that. We know that to be the case. We know that is \nthe President's belief. We know that is the testimony of the nominee to \nbe the CIA Director, but it evades the question. That is actually what \nSenator Paul says in his letter.\n\n       The evasive replies from the Administration to this valid \n     question have only confused the issue further without getting \n     us any closer to the actual answer.\n\n  So it is not whether they have intent or whether they have done it \nbefore, but do they have the authority to do so. This is the \ndistinction which Senator Paul is trying to get at, as are many \nAmericans all around the country who are tuning in to this important \ndebate.\n  Senator Paul goes on to say in his letter to John Brennan:\n\n       For that reason, I once again request you answer the \n     following question: Do you believe that the President has the \n     power to authorize lethal force, such as a drone strike, \n     against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, and without trial?\n\n  Let me repeat:\n\n       For that reason, I once again request you answer the \n     following question: Do you believe that the President has the \n     power to authorize lethal force, such as a drone strike, \n     against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, and without trial?\n\n  Senator Paul goes on to say:\n\n       I believe the only acceptable answer to this is no.\n\n  And that is what the American people believe as well.\n  Senator Paul concludes:\n\n       Until you directly and clearly answer, I plan to use every \n     procedural option at my disposal to delay your confirmation \n     and bring added scrutiny to this issue and the \n     Administration's policies of the use of lethal force.\n\n  He says:\n\n       The American people are rightly concerned, and they deserve \n     a frank and open discussion of these policies.\n\n  So I come to the Senate floor tonight in support of my colleague and \nagree with what he is writing to John Brennan because the fundamental \nquestion is: Do you believe the President has the power to authorize \nlethal force, such as a drone strike, against a U.S. citizen on U.S. \nsoil and without trial.\n  Senator Paul goes on:\n\n       I believe the only acceptable answer to this is no.\n\n  So I would ask Senator Paul, through the Chair, if he could perhaps \nadd a little light to this matter. This letter was sent to Mr. Brennan \non February 20. It is now March 6. I know there has been some give-and-\ntake and back-and-forth, but the fundamental question is one that has \nbeen on the minds of the people in my home State of Wyoming, as I \ntraveled the State over the last few weeks.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, we sent our last letter to John Brennan, I \nbelieve, in the latter part of January. We got no response. We then \nsent him a second letter in the first or second week of February and \ngot no response. We then sent our third letter, which I believe is the \nletter the Senator was reading from, and that was a couple of weeks \nago. We got no response to any of these letters.\n  However, when the committee--both Republicans and Democrats--was \nholding up his nomination last week and the chairman of the committee \nasked for a response, all of a sudden we got a response. The response \nfrom Brennan was actually encouraging. The response, I believe, was \nthis morning or yesterday. The day has kind of run together. That \nresponse was basically that the CIA doesn't have the authority to \noperate in the United States and that is the rule. It has been the law \nsince the 1947 National Security Act.\n  Our concern is that the Attorney General's response has been a little \nmore vague. Basically they have not done any killings in the United \nStates yet. They don't have any intention to, but they might. The \nproblem with the ``they might'' part is they left it kind of vague. \nThey said it would have to be extraordinary, but they point out two \noccurrences in which they would not have targeted drone strikes. They \npoint out Pearl Harbor and 9/11.\n  In both of those instances, I think it is appropriate to respond \nmilitarily, but they would not have targeted drone strikes. They might \nuse drones, but they would not have targeted drone strikes because they \nwould be responding immediately to someone attacking us. I think we all \nagree that we can respond to lethal force at any point in time.\n  I think the problem is the drone program around the world often \ntargets\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\npeople who are not in combat. It is hard for me to imagine that we \nwould have people who--I don't know if they are conspiring or what they \nare doing--are talking to an individual or someone in a restaurant or \ncafe, that we wouldn't arrest them.\n  The ranking member on the Intelligence Committee made a good point. \nHe said: Particularly if they are in a noncombat area in the United \nStates, wouldn't you want to arrest them to get some information from \nthem to see if they might be a threat? One reason would be to see if \nthey are innocent or guilty. If they are truly guilty, you would \nprobably be able to get some information from them by interrogating \nthem.\n  The Senator asked the question about the limitations. That is \nultimately what we are asking Brennan, Eric Holder, the Attorney \nGeneral, and the President. What limitations do you cede to your \nauthority? The President takes an oath that he is going to preserve, \nprotect, and defend the Constitution. He says he will do that, but the \noath doesn't say: I intend to do that. It says: I will preserve, \nprotect, and defend the Constitution.\n  The problem we have is that when John Brennan has been asked what are \nthe limitations to your authority, his response has been that we have \nno geographic limitations. He says he gets that from the use of \nauthorization of force to go to war in Afghanistan. The problem with \nthat is I don't think people who voted for that intended that there \nwould be no limitations and that we could have war anywhere.\n  Then the question is: Is there a limitation at the U.S. border?\n  Well, there is a law--a posse comitatus law--from after the Civil War \nwhich says the military doesn't operate here. It is not because we \nthink the military are bad people, we just have different rules for the \nmilitary. Our soldiers are not used to dealing with due process, and we \ndon't make them. On a battlefield when they are shooting, they don't \ngive people their Miranda rights. They don't get to have a jury trial.\n  There is none of that going on on the battlefield so soldiers don't \nhave to deal with that, but policemen in our country have different \nrules of engagement. They are required to deal with that, and we want \nthat because we want there to be a process because we have always been \nconcerned in our country--we broke away from the mother country in \nEngland because we were concerned about too much power. We wanted that \npower to be reined in.\n  So our biggest problem is that when they say they have no geographic \nlimitations, that could include America. So that was our next question. \nSenator Wyden asked Brennan in the committee: Do you have the authority \nto do strikes in America? John Brennan's answer was--this was the first \nanswer before we got the second answer: Well, we want to optimize \ntransparency and we want to optimize secrecy, and that was his \nconclusion. It was like, what does that mean? So that is when we got \nmore and more involved with asking this question and asking it \nrepeatedly.\n  But I think there are limitations. Ultimately, there is a limitation \nof the Constitution, but also there is a big debate that needs to go on \nabout what are the limitations of what we voted on when we went to war. \nI was all in favor of doing everything possible to those who attacked \nus on 9/11, of going to Afghanistan. We need to figure out how and what \nthe completion of that mission is, and whether that use or \nauthorization of force is open-ended, forever, or whether we are ever \ngoing to vote on that again, which I think means when we vote on that \nagain, we retain that power to bring it back to the Senate, to the \nCongress. It doesn't mean we would not do it again, but we should have \nthat debate and a vote again if we are going to have another war.\n  At this time I would be happy to entertain another question from the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. What I just heard from the Senator from Kentucky is \nthat these questions were asked in a bipartisan way. This was not \npartisan at all. I heard Senator Wyden from Oregon had similar \nquestions. So this is a request for information.\n  Now, I have been able to find a copy for the first time of that \nJanuary 25 letter that Senator Paul referenced to John Brennan, sent to \nhim in his capacity as Assistant to the President for Homeland Security \nand Counterterrorism, and I just wanted to go through some of that and \nperhaps ask Senator Paul some specific questions related to it because \nit is my understanding that he has not gotten any kind of response to \nthat.\n  The Senator mentioned three specific letters: First, the January 25 \nletter, then the letter of February 14, and then the letter of February \n20 which, asks, really, the ultimate question: Do you believe the \nPresident has the power to authorize lethal force such as a drone \nstrike against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil and without trial?\n  So now I have all three of those letters sent by Senator Paul to Mr. \nBrennan in his capacity currently as the Assistant to the President for \nHomeland Security and now the nominee to be the head of the Central \nIntelligence Agency.\n  So the letter goes:\n\n       As the Senate moves forward with its consideration of your \n     nomination to be the next director of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, it will be necessary to examine not only \n     your qualifications and record, but also to determine whether \n     you will provide the necessary leadership as the head of an \n     agency that operates under unique rules for transparency and \n     that quietly holds significant influence over the advancement \n     of America's strategic priorities around the globe.\n\n  No other agency is like the CIA--unique rules for transparency. So \nSenator Paul goes on:\n\n       After reviewing your record as well as the record of \n     President Obama to whom you have provided a great deal of \n     advice and direction on issues of national security and \n     terrorism, I must ask several questions to help inform my \n     decision on your nomination.\n\n  That is what a responsible Senator does, a Senator who has taken \nquite seriously his role in providing advice and consent to the \nPresident on a nominee--a key nominee of a specific agency that \noperates under unique rules for transparency.\n  So I think it is absolutely appropriate that Senator Paul would write \nsuch a letter, and the questions raised are appropriate, many of which \nhave been raised in a bipartisan way.\n  So question No. 1: Do you agree with the argument put forth on \nnumerous occasions by the executive branch that it is legal to order \nthe killing of American citizens and that it is not compelled to \nexplain its reasoning in reaching that conclusion? Do you believe this \nis a good precedent for the government to set?\n  What better, clearer question to ask than that? He goes on:\n\n       Congress has been denied access to legal opinions and \n     interpretations authorizing placement of U.S. citizens \n     believed to be engaged in terrorism on targeting notices, \n     thus denying Congress the ability to perform important \n     oversight.\n\n  Oversight is a key role of this Congress. Oversight is a key, \ncritical role of this branch of government, of Congress.\n  Senator Paul goes on:\n\n       Will you provide access to those opinions as well as future \n     opinions?\n\n  Very reasonable question.\n  The Senator said:\n\n       Would it not be appropriate to require a judge or a court \n     to review every case before the individual in question is \n     added to a targeting list?\n\n  Legitimate question.\n\n       Please describe the due process requirements in place for \n     those individuals being considered for an addition to a \n     targeting list.\n       Would you agree that it is paradoxical that the Federal \n     Government would need to go before a judge to authorize a \n     wiretap of a U.S. citizen overseas, but possibly not to order \n     a lethal drone strike against the same individual?\n\n  I want to go back to this question when I am visiting with Senator \nPaul, but this is the kind of thing I get asked in Wyoming, and I am \nsure the Senator from Kentucky is hearing the same thing: Would you \nagree that it is paradoxical that the Federal Government would need to \ngo before a judge to authorize a wiretap on a U.S. citizen overseas, \nbut possibly not to order a lethal drone strike against the same \nindividual?\n  So what you have to do if you wanted to perform a wiretap would be \nmore than you would have to do if you wanted to do a drone strike. I \nthink it is a very legitimate question because if not, Senator Paul \ngoes on to ask:\n\n       Please explain why you believe something similar to the \n     FISA standards should not be applied in regards to illegal \n     action against\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\n     U.S. citizens. Is it still your intent to codify and \n     normalize the so-called disposition matrix, a targeting list \n     that you helped to establish--\n\n  This would be Homeland Security Counterterrorism Assistant Brennan--\n\n       to direct counterterrorism operations in future \n     administrations as well as the targeted killing procedures \n     you have outlined in your playbook?\n\n  Then Senator Paul goes on and asks:\n\n       Aside from the President, how many people have access to \n     the full disposition matrix? Of those, how many participate \n     in the process to add individuals to the targeting list, and \n     how many have the authority to veto an individual's \n     inclusion?\n\n  This is a very thoughtful letter from Senator Paul to Mr. Brennan \ndated January 25, 2013. I want to continue to share with the American \npeople the questions that have been asked by Senator Paul because I \nthink they are so telling and so appropriate:\n\n       How many times have you specifically objected to an \n     individual's inclusion on a targeting list? How many times \n     have you recommended to the President against including an \n     individual on the targeting list?\n\n  These are questions people want to know the answers to:\n\n       How often are the criteria used for determining whether an \n     individual should be included on a targeting list amended?\n\n  Not simply reviewed; he is not asking about a review but an \namendment.\n\n       How many government officials and which agencies \n     participate in establishing these criteria? Does the National \n     Counterterrorism Center have final say over all criteria?\n\n  Anybody who watches this issue closely has asked these questions and \nwants to know the answers.\n\n       Of those individuals who have been but are no longer \n     included in the disposition matrix or other target list, how \n     many have already been killed? How many have been removed \n     from the list by other means? How many individuals remain in \n     the disposition matrix or other targeting list today? And how \n     does the number compare to the number in prior years? Is the \n     number growing? Is the number shrinking? Is the number \n     static? What is happening to those numbers?\n       How many U.S. citizens have been added to this disposition \n     matrix or other targeting list? How many remain on the list? \n     How many U.S. citizens have been intentionally killed by U.S. \n     drone strikes since 2008? How many have been unintentionally \n     killed by U.S. drone strikes during that same period of time?\n       In how many countries has the United States executed a \n     drone strike against a presumed terrorist?\n       In each of the countries where the United States has \n     executed a drone strike in the past 4 years, please provide a \n     year-to-year estimate of those who self-identify or otherwise \n     associate with al-Qaida within that country.\n\n  I come to read this as somebody who has just come to see the capacity \nof the drones. I see the junior Senator from Texas has been on the \nSenate floor as well. He and I traveled together to Afghanistan. We \nhave been able to see directly video from drone strikes. We know the \ncapacity. We know their ability to target precisely. These are \nquestions that in previous wars were not asked because the technology \nwas not there, but now these are questions that are asked, that are \nbeing asked, which is why I am so grateful for the leadership of \nSenator Paul in asking these questions.\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       You have indicated that no credible evidence exists to \n     support recent claims that civilian casualties resulted from \n     U.S. drone strikes.\n\n  Again, this is the letter from Senator Paul to John Brennan. He asks:\n\n       Please indicate how you define credible evidence and what \n     process is in place to evaluate the legitimacy of alleged \n     civilian casualties.\n       Which countries have publicly stated their support for U.S. \n     drone strikes within their territory? Have any publicly \n     indicated support for U.S. drone strikes in the long term?\n\n  In this letter:\n\n       How relevant is the opinion of the public in the countries \n     where U.S. drone strikes are ongoing? In those countries, how \n     would you characterize public opinion toward U.S. drone \n     strikes?\n       In light of civilian casualties caused by the extensive use \n     of drone strikes under your guidance, do you continue to \n     stand by your remark that ``sometimes you have to take life \n     to save lives?''\n       Do you condone the CIA's practice of counting certain \n     civilians killed by U.S. drone strikes as militants simply \n     because they were of military age and within close proximity \n     of a target? Do you believe such accounting provides an \n     accurate picture of our drone program?\n\n  These are key questions to be asked for a nominee to the Central \nIntelligence Agency and they deserve answers before anyone makes a vote \nyes or no.\n\n       What changes to the CIA review process will you put in \n     place or have you attempted to put in place in your previous \n     role to prevent further unintentional killings of U.S. \n     dissidents? What role did you play in approving the drone \n     strike that led to the death of the under-aged U.S. citizen, \n     son of al-Awlaki? Unlike his father, he had not renounced his \n     U.S. citizenship. Was this young man the intended target \n     of the U.S. drone strike which took his life? Further, do \n     you reject the subsequent claim apparently originating \n     from anonymous U.S. Government sources--\n  Always a concern when you hear anonymous U.S. Government sources--\n\n     that the young man had actually been a military age male of \n     20 years or more of age, something that was later proven \n     false by the release of his birth certificate.\n\n  Senator Paul goes on in the letter:\n\n       Do you believe that the inadvertent killing of civilians \n     and the resulting anger from local populations should cause \n     us to limit rather than expand the drone program?\n\n  Key question:\n\n       The CIA has and will reportedly continue to have \n     authorization to carry out lethal drone strikes in Pakistan, \n     autonomously and without approval from the President. Will \n     you seek to reduce or eliminate this practice or keep it in \n     place? Will you hold to the discussed 1 or 2 year phaseout of \n     this authority or work to expedite the phaseout?\n\n  I could go on and on because these are key questions Senator Paul \nasked, and it all gets back to the fundamental question of: Do you \nbelieve the President has the power to authorize lethal force, such as \na drone strike against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil and without trial?\n  So as I look at this letter of January 25 and look at the questions \nbeing asked:\n\n       Do you believe the lethal drone strikes constitute \n     hostilities as defined by the War Powers Act?\n       On what legal basis does the administration derive \n     authorization to conduct such strikes?\n\n  Then the President's own words:\n\n       The President has stated that al-Qaida has been decimated. \n     Do you believe this assertion is correct and, if so, what is \n     it that we are now targeting if not al-Qaida?\n\n  That is a fundamental question that came up in the hearings with \nthen-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. When she came to the Senate, \nto the Foreign Relations Committee, they changed their tune and said: \nNo, it was core al-Qaida; not just al-Qaida but core al-Qaida in \nAfghanistan, but, fundamentally, the tune has changed.\n  Senator Paul goes on:\n\n       Is the U.S. drone strike strategy exclusively focused on \n     targeting al-Qaida or is it also conducting counterinsurgency \n     operations against militants seeking to further undermine \n     their governments such as in Yemen? Would you support \n     expansion of the CIA's drone program in Mali to provide \n     support to counterterrorism operations?\n\n  We all know what happened there and the impact in Benghazi and the \nconcern that those who weren't captured or tried in Benghazi for the \natrocities there went then to Mali. So, again, a key question.\n  The Senator goes on:\n\n       Do you believe a long-term, sustained drone strike program \n     can eliminate all threats to the American people or \n     completely eliminate al-Qaida as you have indicated in your \n     intent? If not, how would we eventually wind down the drone \n     program? At what point do you believe drone strikes will \n     reach the point of diminishing returns? If so, can it be done \n     on the scale the drone program operates on now or would it \n     have to be expanded?\n\n  I was going to specifically ask Senator Paul to discuss this \nquestion:\n\n       Do you support the Attorney General's 2012 guidance to the \n     NCTC that it may deliberately collect, store and continually \n     assess massive amounts of data on all U.S. citizens for \n     potential correlations to terrorism, even if the U.S. \n     citizens targeted have no known ties to terrorists?\n\n  That gets into the whole thing we started on earlier today. Where is \nthe role of individual freedoms, the right to trial, the right to be \nheard, the right to present their case? What about the fundamental \nrights in the Bill of Rights?\n\n  The final question here to Mr. Brennan is this:\n\n       Please describe in detail the steps you have taken as \n     assistant to the President as well as transparency measures \n     you would support as Director of the CIA to improve the \n     transparency of the administration's counterterrorism policy.\n\n  Mr. President, I would just say that they are extremely well-thought-\nout\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\nquestions by a very thoughtful Senator and questions to which the \nAmerican people would like to have answers.\n  There is more to the letter, but I would like to take a second to ask \nSenator Paul if he feels those have been adequately addressed and if he \nfeels he has gotten closer to the solution to the question of, do you \nbelieve the President has the power to authorize lethal force such as a \ndrone strike against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil and without trial? \nThat would be my question to Senator Paul.\n  (Mr. SCHATZ assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we have sent three different letters over \nthe last month and a half or so, and we really have not gotten a \ndetailed response to any of the letters.\n  We finally had one question answered from John Brennan, and that \nquestion was answered by him by saying the CIA does not operate within \nthe United States, which is a reassertion of the law, which we at least \nappreciated. But they have not responded by saying they will follow the \nlaw. We have not gotten an adequate answer yet, although we are getting \ncloser to it.\n  Maybe the Senator from Texas can give us a little more insight into \nthis in the sense that the question now really is not just Brennan. \nBrennan has answered that the CIA cannot operate in the United States. \nBut there is a question: Can the military operate in the United States? \nAnd this question was asked, I think very poignantly, by the Senator \nfrom Texas today, trying to get an answer from the Attorney General on \nthis question: Can you kill Americans on American soil who are not \ninvolved in combat? The answer has been evasive because he has brought \nup basically a red herring: Pearl Harbor or the Twin Towers, which none \nof us are disputing that the military can respond to a lethal attack \nwith lethal force.\n  So what I would like to do without relinquishing the floor is see if \nthe Senator from Texas would like to respond as to his interpretation \nof what he was hearing from Attorney General Holder and whether the \ncomments he was hearing--if Attorney General Holder were willing to \nsort of try to complete that conversation in a letter to us--whether \nactually we might get close to actually being on the same page.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for allowing me to ask \nhim a series of questions and to address both what the Attorney General \nsaid and the substantive issue.\n  I wish to begin my questioning, though, with simply an observation. I \nwould like to take a moment to thank the Senator from Kentucky. I have \nhad the privilege of serving in this body 9 weeks, and today is the \nfirst day I have ever had the extraordinary privilege of speaking on \nthe floor of the Senate. On my first time to speak on the floor of the \nSenate, I found myself being given the chance to read from Travis's \nletter from the Alamo. As I observed walking off the floor of the \nSenate, as they say in the beer commercial, it don't get no better than \nthis. So I thank the Senator from Kentucky for giving me the \nopportunity to be welcomed to the floor of the Senate and having a \nchance to stand with him fighting for liberty.\n  There are a number of things I would like to address and ask the \nviews of the Senator from Kentucky. I will begin by observing, as I did \nthe last time the Senator from Kentucky and I had a colloquy, that \nTwitter never sleeps, and we heard from a number of tweets across the \ncountry. But those have not ceased. So since the Senator from Kentucky \nis still prohibited from looking at his cell phone, I wanted to prevent \nhim from going into technology shock and withdrawal and provide an in-\nperson feed for him.\n\n       This is about The Constitution. Stand with Rand. Get it \n     together GOP.\n       Stand with Rand. Rand praising Dem OR Sen Ron Wyden for \n     raising the same questions and concerns he has. Where are all \n     the other Dems?\n       Sad day when killing Americans is up for debate. Sad day \n     that every Senator is not up there with him. Stand with Rand. \n     We are watching you guys.\n       I don't know how Sen Rand Paul does it . . . I'm tired just \n     from WATCHING him. . . . a tip of the cap to you, sir. Thank \n     you. Stand with Rand.\n       Sen Rand Paul is extemporaneously giving a better human \n     rights speech than Barack Obama ever has. Stand with Rand.\n\n  And I am pretty certain that for the record I can confirm that no \nteleprompter was in front of the desk of the Senator from Kentucky.\n\n       Sen Rand Paul, Jimmy Stewart would be proud, sir.\n       Sen Rand Paul, look what's trending. Stand with Rand.\n       It's been awhile since I could say I am a proud American. \n     Thank you, Rand Paul. Stand with Rand.\n       Rand Paul might be waiting a long time for an answer from \n     The White House. Stand with Rand.\n\n  I would note that it has been 10 hours, so that would indeed be a \ncorrect observation of fact.\n\n       Democrats--Why not just agree that the POTUS cannot use \n     drones to summarily kill US citizens on US soil? Stand with \n     Rand.\n       Sen. Rand Paul crosses 8 hr threshold of filibuster. Stand \n     with Rand.\n       Stand with Rand, please.\n       Sen Rand Paul did not filibuster for the right or the left, \n     he did it for every person in this country. Stand with Rand.\n       Once you give up your rights, you will not get them back. \n     Believe that. Stand with Rand.\n       We should all go to the U.S. Capitol and Stand with Rand.\n\n  I would note that quite a few Members of the House of Representatives \nhave crossed over the Capitol and joined us precisely to stand with \nRand, as have the men and women in the gallery who have been here \nthroughout this long and historic stand.\n\n       Finally able to sit and watch the Rand Paul filibuster. \n     Just epic. Stand with Rand.\n       Read the constitution and explain why each sentence is \n     relevant to today. Not worthless and outdated.\n       7 hours and counting for Sen Rand Paul in the filibuster. \n     This can end, Brennan, just say u won't unilaterally kill us. \n     Stand with Rand.\n       America is watching. Stand with Rand.\n       I get the feeling that a more libertarian stance is the \n     only thing which can bring about a fresh start for the GOP. \n     Stand with Rand.\n       I stand with Rand in his 9th hr awaiting the President \n     saying he doesn't have the power to kill Americans at will.\n       ``I haven't killed anyone yet and I have no intention of \n     killing Americans, but I might''--Barack Obama. Stand with \n     Rand.\n       The federal government was closed today. Yet Sen Rand Paul \n     working overtime. YouDaMan.\n\n  D-a-M-a-n is the precise spelling of that.\n\n       Sen Rand Paul, 100% support you. Keep going. Stand with \n     Rand.\n       This isn't a filibuster. This is a line in the sand drawn \n     with a quill pen that penned the constitution.\n\n  I think that one is particularly cool.\n\n       Do you agree with your colleague, Rep Justin Amash? Stand \n     with Rand.\n\n  Almost always the answer to that one should be yes.\n\n       Do you stand with Sen Rand Paul and demand an answer from \n     the WH on extra-judicial assassinations of Americans?\n\n  There is a word we do not hear too often within our own borders--\nassassinations. Yet that is exactly what we are talking about here \ntonight.\n\n       Don't think I've ever been quite so proud to say I'm from \n     Kentucky. Stand with Rand.\n       Sen Rand Paul getting to the heart of issues. Not partisan \n     politics, but a question of due process.\n       He's just about 8 hours away from having the 5th longest \n     filibuster.\n\n  I apologize to the Senator from Kentucky if that is less than \nencouraging.\n\n       Stand with Rand.\n       I have a renewed sense of hope for our leaders in \n     Washington today. Thank you, Sen Rand Paul, for standing by \n     We The People. Stand with Rand.\n       I am a strong liberal supporter and two time Obama voter. I \n     Stand with Rand.\n       Dr. Rand Paul, Excellent, excellent work today. We stand \n     with Rand, too.\n       I hope Sen Rand Paul Can keep them up all night. There \n     hasn't been a real filibuster on the Senate floor in years. \n     Stand with Rand.\n\n  And I would note, as I was walking in, that this is certainly the \nleast well-shaven I have been on the Senate floor. And it is \nparticularly ironic that the desk at which I am standing, in addition \nto having been the former desk of a great hero of mine, Senator Barry \nGoldwater, was also the former desk of Senator Richard Nixon. So \nperhaps that spirit is animating the 5 o'clock shadow that I find \nmyself at 10 o'clock at night sporting.\n\n       Stand with u I do. Stand with Rand.\n\n  I wonder if that one was from Dr. Seuss.\n\n       Stand with Rand because you have the freedom to do so.\n       Obama is going to have to address the points raised by \n     Paul. Stand with Rand.\n       I stand with Rand . . . best line of the filiblizzard thus \n     far. RT--\n       Yet another of Senator Rand Paul's miraculous tweets that \n     he did from the floor of the Senate, a tweet of Senator Rand \n     Paul--\n       ``They shouldn't just drop a hellfire missile on your cafe \n     experience.''\n\n\n[[Page S1213]]\n\n\n  I would suggest to the Senator from Kentucky that at the end of what \nI am sure will be a long and very distinguished career in politics, \nfighting for every American, that with statements such as that, a \nsubsequent career at Starbucks may indeed be promising.\n\n       The fight for liberty has a real hero. May the spirits of \n     past patriots fuel you.\n       Until you get an answer, Rand, keep on going. Let's take it \n     into tomorrow.\n       Is suspicion enough? Obviously not. Sen Rand Paul.\n       If you have family or friends in the Middle East, you might \n     be a terrorist. Stand with Rand.\n       For the first time since November, I feel like I see a \n     light at the end of the tunnel. It is a long tunnel. Stand \n     with Rand.\n       Sen Rand Paul: If you have no bounds, you have an unlimited \n     imperial presidency. So true.\n       Sen Rand Paul, eight hours, and still going strong. Thanks \n     for standing for the Constitution. God bless you. Stand with \n     Rand.\n       Thank you, Rand Paul, for standing up for our Constitution. \n     We are behind you. Stand with Rand.\n       Go get 'em, Rand Paul. Great way to end my birthday. Stand \n     with Rand.\n\n  I hope we do not make it to that individual's next birthday.\n\n       Best TV I've seen in a while. Stand with Rand.\n       Sen Rand Paul, I'm superproud of my Senator today. I have \n     always been proud of him, but today I'm more proud than ever. \n     STAND WITH RAND.\n       My kids--watching Rand Paul give a lesson to the country--\n     on their own, without me telling them to. Stand with Rand. \n     Thank you, Sen Rand Paul.\n       Why won't Obama say that he won't use drones to kill \n     noncombatant U.S. citizens on U.S. soil? Seems a simple \n     question. Stand with Rand.\n       Senator Rand Paul, thank you. Be encouraged and stay \n     strong. Would stand there with you if we could. We are no \n     longer free. Thank you for standing up for freedom.\n\n  ``Stand with Rand'' is trending worldwide. That is pretty darn cool.\n\n       Rand Paul goes into his 9th hour of filibuster over drones. \n     Watch it here.\n\n  I will not read the link to C-SPAN.\n\n       Senator Rand Paul, I am so proud of you. Way to stand tall. \n     Stand with Rand.\n       Senator Rand Paul, your loyalty and dedication to we the \n     people are not going unnoticed. Stand with Rand.\n       If you give back your rights, don't ever expect to get them \n     back. Stand with Rand.\n       Call the White House. 202-456-1111. Take a stand.\n\n  For some reason, I feel compelled to read that tweet a second time.\n\n       Call the White House. 202-456-1111.\n       Rand Paul, standing for liberty and freedom. God bless you. \n     Stand with Rand.\n       Rand Paul, the 21st century version of Washington, \n     Jefferson and Madison.\n       No matter how you fall politically, you have to admire Rand \n     Paul's absolute conviction.\n       I cannot stop watching Senator Rand Paul filibuster. \n     Greatness. Stand with Rand.\n       Are you going to retweet Stand with Rand all night? I am. \n     Liberty. Rand Paul.\n\n  And the final one.\n\n       Senator Rand Paul, I am a grandma who just learned how to \n     Twitter tonight so that I could stand with Rand and the \n     Constitution.\n\n  The first question I will ask of the Senator from Kentucky--and I \nhave several more--is simply: What would you say to these millions of \nAmericans and people worldwide who are coming together to stand with \nRand?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for coming to \nthe floor. I am overwhelmed with all the responses. What I would say is \nthat I think there are things that are more important than \npersonalities, more important than party, and they are the things our \ncountry was founded upon.\n  These are the things that bring people together who want us to stand \nand say these protections will exist. The interesting thing about our \nConstitution is it protects people who are--those who are defenseless \noften, those who can be falsely accused of crimes is what the \nConstitution is there for. I think there are people from all walks of \nlife who say my brother was falsely accused or my brother was put in \njail for 5 years or something, either they did not do it or it was an \ninappropriate sentence.\n  I think people understand the idea of wanting to be protected from \nfalse accusation, not only for something where you might be put in \nprison but for something, in this case, you might be killed for. We all \nunderstand. All you have to do is get online to read comments to any \nkind of story online to know people make all kinds of wild accusations \nand wild comments online. Do we want to have that be one of the \nindications for whether you might be targeted for surveillance or \nwhether you might be targeted for a drone strike, that anything such as \nthis could happen without you having your due process, that the fifth \namendment somehow would be optional, that the executive branch would \ndecide when they are going to apply the fifth amendment.\n  I am overwhelmed with the responses. I think it is something that \nunifies people. It has brought together both people from the Democratic \nside of the aisle as well as the Republican side of the aisle because, \nto me, this is not about whether the President is a Republican or \nDemocrat. I have supported several of his nominees. I have supported \npeople because I think he has the right to make political nominations, \neven though I do not agree with much of any of the nominees or the \npolitics of the administration.\n  This is different. There is a constitutional principle. We are here \ntoday to filibuster against or for a constitutional principle not \nnecessarily an individual. But it is something I think a lot of \nAmericans believe strongly in. I thank Senator Cruz very much for the \ncomments I have gotten from the Senator and I would entertain any other \nquestions.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I do \nindeed have additional questions. The heart of what the Senator is \nstanding for, what some of the other Senators tonight are standing for, \nis liberty. I think that has always been the foundational value in the \nUnited States of America.\n  Our country was founded by Framers who understood that concentrated \npower is always inimical to liberty, that any time great power is \nundivided the freedom of the people is at jeopardy. As Lord Acton \nobserved: Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts \nabsolutely. It is for that reason that the Framers of our Constitution \ndid what the Supreme Court has described as splitting the atom of \nsovereignty, taking what used to be one discrete indispensable concept \nof power and sovereignty and breaking it up, breaking it up between the \nthree branches of the Federal Government and breaking it up between the \nFederal Government and the 50 States and the local government as well.\n  The purpose of doing all that is to prevent what James Madison in \nFederalist No. 10 described as factions. Today we would call them \nspecial interests that might take control of one branch of government. \nIf all power were concentrated in the Executive, and one faction, one \nspecial interest was to gain influence in that Executive, then the \nliberty of the people would be at peril.\n  In Federalist 10, Madison explained the factions are never going to \ngo away. Human nature is such that we will divide into factions with \ndifferent interests. The genius of the Framers was not to imagine human \nnature was somehow different than it was but to recognize that it was. \nAs the Federalist Papers explained: If men were angels, no government \nwould be necessary. The great challenge in forming a government is to \nenable the governed to do what it must. Yet at the same time oblige it \nto govern itself.\n  For that reason, splitting the atom of sovereignty, separating power \nprevents any one branch of government from acquiring unchecked power. \nIt is, indeed, the responsibility of this body to do what we are doing \nnow. If a President of the United States decrees the power to take the \nlives of U.S. citizens on U.S. soil without due process of law, I would \nsuggest it is integral to the oath of office of every Member of the \nSenate and every Member of the House of Representatives to stand and \nsay: Mr. President, respectfully, no, you may not. The Constitution \ngives you no such power. Each of us on entering office--in my case just \na few weeks ago standing on those steps, the Vice President asked me to \nraise my hand and take an oath to honor and defend the Constitution. \nEvery Member of this body took that oath.\n\n  It is our responsibility, especially when one branch of the \ngovernment is overreaching, is usurping power that the Constitution \nforbids him and that is threatening to the liberty of the people, it is \nthe responsibility of all of us to stand and resist that.\n  One of my alltime heroes, Ayn Rand in ``Atlas Shrugged,'' described \nhow the\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\nparasitical class would put into place arbitrary power, standardless \nrules precisely so the productive citizens in the private sector would \nhave to come on bended knee to those in government seeking special \ndispensation, seeking special favors, because that arbitrary and \nstandardless rule empowers the political class and disempowers the \npeople.\n  I could not help but think about Ayn Rand's observation this morning \nas I heard the Attorney General over and over refuse to say it would be \nunconstitutional for the Federal Government to kill a U.S. citizen on \nU.S. soil. He would say it would be inappropriate. He said that three \ntimes in response to direct questioning. It would be inappropriate and \nwe should trust him. The Federal Government would not do so.\n  I found myself thinking of those arbitrary standards Ayn Rand talked \nabout; that if the only protection we the people have against the \nFederal Government choosing to take the life of a U.S. citizen on U.S. \nsoil is our trust that they would refrain from doing what is \ninappropriate rather than the protections of the Constitution, then I \nwould suggest our liberty is fragile indeed.\n  Indeed, when we think about the concentration of power, no judicial \nopinion is more important than Justice Robert Jackson's concurring \nopinion in the Youngstown Steel seizure case. Justice Jackson, as the \nSenator from Kentucky knows, was a giant on the U.S. Supreme Court. My \nformer boss, Chief Justice William Rhenquist, served as a law clerk to \nJustice Robert Jackson.\n  Indeed, Justice Jackson took time off from serving on the U.S. \nSupreme Court to serve as the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, \nduring which he made the powerful observation following World War II, \nwhen the United States brought to trial the horrific war criminals in \nthe Nazi regime.\n  Justice Jackson observed at Nuremberg that four great nations, \nflushed with victory and stunned with injury, stay the hand of \nvengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment \nof the law, is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever \npaid to reason.\n  I would suggest to the Senator from Kentucky, and I feel confident he \nwould agree, that what we are talking about right now is the tribute \nthat power must and should pay to reason and that unchecked power is \nalways a threat to liberty.\n  As Justice Jackson opined in Youngstown Steel seizure ``that \ncomprehensive and undefined Presidential powers hold both practical \nadvantages and grave dangers for the country will impress anyone who \nhas served as a legal adviser to a President in a time of transition \nand public anxiety.''\n  Those words could have been written as easily tonight as they were \nhalf a century ago. Justice Jackson continued:\n\n       While the Constitution diffuses power to better secure \n     liberty, it also contemplates that practice will integrate \n     the dispersed power into a workable government. It enjoins \n     upon its branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy \n     but reciprocity. Presidential powers are not fixed but \n     fluctuate, depending on their disjunction or conjunction with \n     those of Congress.\n       When a President acts pursuant to an express or implied \n     authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, \n     for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus \n     all that Congress can delegate.\n\n  Justice Jackson explains:\n\n       No. 2: When the President acts in absence of either a \n     congressional branch or denial of authority, he can only rely \n     upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of \n     twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent \n     authority, or in which the distribution is uncertain. \n     Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence \n     may sometimes, at least, as a practical matter, enable, if \n     not invite, measures on independent Presidential \n     responsibility. In this area, any actual test of power is \n     likely to depend upon the imperatives of events and \n     contemporary imponderables, rather than on abstract theories \n     of law.\n\n  Now, perhaps, prior to 11:45 today, Eric Holder and John Brennan \nwould have argued they fall into this second category, a category where \nCongress has been silent and, accordingly, they might presume some \nPresidential power. But as of 11:45 today, they can no longer claim \nthat.\n  Justice Jackson explained the third category of Presidential powers.\n\n       When the President takes measures incompatible with the \n     expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its \n     lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own \n     constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of \n     Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain executive \n     presidential control in such a case only by disabling the \n     Congress from acting upon the subject. Presidential claim to \n     a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be \n     scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is the \n     equilibrium established by our constitutional system.\n\n  As we stand here tonight, later than the typical hour for the Senate \nbeing in session, indeed, later than many Members of this body had \nanticipated being in Washington, DC--many Members of this body had \nenvisioned being on planes and returning home by now--it occurs to me \nthat those Senators who have heeded the encouragement of the twitterers \nto stand with Rand, those Senators who have come here today, I am \nreminded of Henry the Fifth, as Shakespeare observed:\n\n     What's he that wishes so?\n     My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin;\n     If we are mark'd to die, we are enow\n     To do our country loss; and if to live,\n     The fewer men, the greater share of honour.\n     God's will. I pray thee, wish not one man more.\n     By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,\n     Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;\n     It yearns me not if men my garments wear;\n     Such outward things dwell not in my desires.\n     But if it be a sin to covet honor,\n     I am the most offending soul alive.\n     No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.\n     God's peace. I would not lose so great an honour\n     As one man more methinks would share from me\n     For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more.\n     Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,\n     That he which hath no stomach to this fight,\n     Let him depart; his passport shall be made,\n     And crowns for convoy put into his purse.\n     We would not die in that man's company\n     That fears his fellowship to die with us.\n     This day is call'd the feast of Crispian.\n     He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,\n     Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,\n     And rouse him at the name of Crispian.\n     He that shall live this day, and see old age,\n     Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,\n     And say ``To-morrow is Saint Crispian.''\n     Then he will strip his sleeve and show his scars,\n     And say ``These wounds I had on Crispian's day.''\n     Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,\n     But he'll remember, with advantages,\n     What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,\n     Familiar in his mouth as household words--\n     Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,\n     Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester--\n     Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.\n     This story shall the good man teach his son;\n     And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,\n     From this day to the ending of the world,\n     But we in it shall be remembered--\n     We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;\n     For he to-day that sheds his blood with me\n     Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,\n     This day shall gentle his condition.\n     And gentlemen in England now-a-bed\n     Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,\n     And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks\n     That fought with us upon St. Crispin's day.\n\n  I would observe to the Senator from Kentucky that those glorious \nsentiments expressed centuries ago are precisely applicable to the \nstand here tonight because it is a stand against, indeed it is a stand \nagainst an administration that refuses to acknowledge limits on its \npower. It is a stand for the same purpose, for liberty.\n  There is a frustration across this country, a frustration not with \nDemocrats or Republicans, not with one party or another, a frustration \nwith entrenched politicians in Washington who don't seem to work for \nanybody.\n  I am convinced there is something credible happening in this country \nwhen the people are standing and reminding the men and women of this \nbody that every one of us works for ``we the people.'' It is our \nprincipal task to stand and defend liberty, especially when liberty is \nthreatened.\n  Indeed, that St. Crispin's Day speech had a saying--and even in some \nways a different manifestation. In one of the greatest movies of all \ntime, Patton, the opening scene of Patton, I will confess to the \nSenator of Kentucky I have more than once in preparation for an oral \nargument in court simply watched George C. Scott marching out in front \nof a flag the size of North Dakota. Standing in front of the flag, \nGeneral Patton observed in a tribute to that very same speech I just \nread--I am going to modify it slightly to make it PG.\n\n\n[[Page S1215]]\n\n\n       I want you to remember that no ``fellow'' ever won a war by \n     dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor \n     ``fellow'' die for his country.\n       Men, all this stuff you've heard about America not wanting \n     to fight, wanting to stay out of the war is a lot of horse \n     dung. Americans traditionally love to fight. All real \n     Americans love the sting of battle.\n       When you were kids you all admired the champion marble \n     shooter, the fastest runner, big-league ball players, the \n     toughest boxers.\n       Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser.\n       Americans play to win all the time. I wouldn't give a hoot \n     in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans \n     have never lost and will never lose a war because the very \n     thought of losing is hateful to Americans.\n\n  George C. Scott continues as Patton:\n\n       Now there's another thing I want you to remember. I don't \n     want to get any messages saying we are ``holding our \n     position.'' We're not ``holding'' anything. Let the Hun do \n     that. We're advancing constantly. We're not interested in \n     holding on to anything except the enemy. We're going to hold \n     on to him by the nose and kick him in the ``posterior.'' \n     We're going to kick the ``heck'' out of him all the time and \n     we're going to go through him like crap through a goose.\n       Thirty years from now when you're sitting around your \n     fireside with your grandson on your knee and he asks you, \n     ``What did you do in the great World War II?'' You won't have \n     to say, ``Well, I shoveled 'manure' in Louisiana.''\n\n  That same sentiment, the same sentiment in St. Crispin's Day speech, \ntalked about a tradition that has been a tradition in America for \ncenturies, of men and women rallying against hard odds, rallying \nagainst challenging obstacles.\n  (Ms. HEITKAMP assumed the chair.)\n  I would observe that fight should not be a partisan fight. This is \nnot a question of Republican or Democrat, liberty, the right to life of \nevery American citizen. Arbitrary taking at the hands of the Federal \nGovernment should not simply be a value that one side or another of \nthis Chamber embraces.\n  Indeed, I would note during the hearings this morning with Eric \nHolder, some of the most enthusiastic audience participants in that \nhearing were self-identified members of Code Pink, who I would suggest \nare not ordinarily individuals who would be described as card-carrying \nmembers of the Republican Party.\n  But liberty does not have a partisan affiliation. Indeed, to the \nSenator from Kentucky, I think it is an interesting question what the \nreaction in this Chamber and outside would be if the very same \nstatements that have been made were made by a President who happened to \nbe Republican. I think there is little doubt the outcry would be \ndeafening, and rightly so. I will say to the Senator from Kentucky, if \na President made the identical representations and happened to have an \n``R'' behind his or her name, I have not one shadow of a doubt that the \nSenator from Kentucky would be standing here 10 hours protesting the \narbitrary assertion of power by a President regardless of whether we \nshare his party or not.\n  Indeed, I would note to the Senator from Kentucky this is a scenario \nwhich is not entirely hypothetical. Prior to serving in this body, I \nhad the great privilege of serving my home State of Texas as the \nsolicitor general of Texas. During that time, we faced a tragic and \nepic battle in a case called Medellin v. Texas.\n  Medellin began with a crime that shocked the conscience. Two little \ngirls were horrifically abused and murdered by a gang in Houston. They \nwere apprehended, confessed, and they were convicted by a jury of their \npeers, quite rightly.\n\n  At that point, the case took a very strange turn because the World \nCourt, which is the judicial arm of the United Nations, issued an order \nto the United States to reopen the convictions of 51 murderers across \nthis country, including one of the murderers in this case, Jose Ernesto \nMedellin.\n  I will tell you, Jose Medellin wrote a four-page handwritten \nconfession in that case. It is one of the most chilling documents I \never had the displeasure of reading. In it he bragged about hearing \nthose little girls beg for their lives. A tiny detail he included in \nthose letters was in many ways the most haunting, and I know it will \nremain with me for the rest of my life. He described how the youngest \nof those girls was wearing a Mickey Mouse watch and how he kept it as a \ntrophy of that night because he was so proud of the atrocities they had \ncommitted. It is truly sickening what those young boys did that \nevening. And yet the World Court asserted a power that heretofore has \nnever been asserted. It was the first time in history a foreign court \nhas ever tried to bind the U.S. justice system. The World Court claimed \nthe authority to reopen those convictions, so Texas stood up and fought \nthe World Court.\n\n  I had the honor of arguing this case twice in front of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. On the other side, 90 foreign nations came in against \nthe State of Texas--90 nations came in and argued the U.S. justice \nsystem should be completely subject to the authority of the World Court \nand the United Nations.\n  Also on the other side, most disturbingly, was the President of the \nUnited States. The President signed a two-paragraph order that \nattempted to order the State courts to obey the World Court. Again, \nthat order, like the World Court's order, was unprecedented. It was the \nfirst time in history any President had ever attempted to order the \nState courts to do anything.\n  Unfortunately, the President at issue in that case was a Republican. \nIt was President George W. Bush, a man for whom I worked, a man who, in \nmany respects, I respect. Yet in that case, he asserted a power that \ncould be found nowhere in the Constitution. And in consultation with my \nboss at the time, Attorney General Greg Abbott, I went before the U.S. \nSupreme Court and argued on behalf of the State of Texas that the \nPresident of the United States has no authority to give away U.S. \nsovereignty.\n  That was done notwithstanding the fact that he was a Republican, \nnotwithstanding the fact the President was the former Governor of my \nhome State of Texas. Because at the end of the day, defending liberty, \ndefending sovereignty, defending the Constitution is not a partisan \nchoice. It is not a game of dodge ball with shirts and skins; that if \nyour team happens to have the ball, you stick together. Every one of us \nhas taken an oath of office and we have an obligation to stand up.\n  So I stood before the U.S. Supreme Court representing the State of \nTexas and arguing that no President of the United States, be he \nRepublican or Democrat, has the authority to give up U.S. sovereignty \nand make the State courts subject to the World Court.\n  I would note in that case the State of Texas had support from a \nnumber of unlikely sources. Indeed, we had a wide range of amicae--\nfriends of the court--who came in and supported us. One brief was filed \non behalf of law professors. It was joined by several law professors, \none of whom, John Yoo, is widely considered the law professor with the \nmost expansive view of Presidential authority. And, indeed, he was an \nindividual who served in the Justice Department and had advocated under \nPresident Bush an expansive view of Presidential authority.\n  That very same brief was joined by Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the \nUniversity of California at Irvine School of Law. Dean Chemerinsky is a \nvery well-known and proud liberal academic. I suspect it may well be \nright that this is the only time ever that John Yoo and Erwin \nChemerinsky joined a single brief before the U.S. Supreme Court. And \nboth agreed, despite the fact they come from very different places in \nthe legal academy, that unchecked power in the hand of the executive is \nfundamentally a threat to liberty.\n  Indeed, I would note for the Senator from Kentucky, in talking to \nboth of them and asking for their support in Medellin, I made the point \nto each to imagine a President from the other side who might have the \npower that was being asserted.\n  To the friends of mine on the right, I suggested that if a President \nhad the power to set aside State laws on grounds of international \ncomity, which was the basis that was being asserted in that case--\nwithout any sanction from Congress, without any sanction from another \nbranch of the Federal Government, but simply on his own unilateral \nauthority--an activist President on the left could use that power to \nassert, for example, that in his or her judgment the marriage laws of \nall 50 States should be set aside.\n  It may well be that all 50 States will choose to set their marriage \nlaws aside. That is a judgment right now that has\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\nbeen in the hands of the voters in each State. But regardless of what \nthe 50 States decide--and I suspect they will not decide the same \nthing--it seems to me clear that no President has the authority \nunilaterally, with the flick of a finger, to remove laws from the State \nbooks of all 50 States.\n  Likewise, to my friends on the left, I asked them to envision their \nnightmare of a rightwing President. They each had slightly different \nincarnations, but they all managed to do that. And I said: If this \nassertion of power is correct, that any President can set aside any \nState law if he or she deems it inconsistent with international comity, \neven though no treaty requires this--and, indeed, in Medellin the \nJustice Department maintained no treaty required this, this was simply \na power that was being asserted to further comity, to further our \nrelationships with foreign nations--I suggested if the President has \nthat power, what is to stop a President on the right from saying: I am \nsetting aside the punitive damages laws in all 50 States? It upsets \ncomity when foreign companies are subject to punitive damages awards; \ntherefore, tort reform shall be the law of all 50 States.\n  And for that matter, there are States such as California that persist \nin putting in place incredibly restrictive environmental laws. If the \nPresident has the authority to flick aside State laws, what would \nprevent a President on the right from saying those environmental laws \nare no more?\n  I would note for the Senator from Kentucky that my view on all those \nquestions was very clear and very straightforward. No President may do \nso, whether he or she is of the right or of the left. If the Federal \nGovernment is to set aside a State law, it may do so only through \nexercise of the supremacy clause. The Framers required that in order to \nset aside a State law that had been adopted by the democratically \nelected legislature in the State, that two branches had to work \ntogether in concert, either through legislation that passes the House \nof Representatives, passes the U.S. Senate and is signed into law by \nthe President or through the form of a treaty that is signed by the \nPresident and ratified by two-thirds of the U.S. Senate. But in both \ninstances the Framers required two branches to work together.\n  Why? The same reason we discussed before. The reason from Federalist \n10, that you do not want power unified in one branch of government, \nwhere a faction, a special interest, may seize control of it. You want \nit divided.\n  I will note that it was an unusual position for the State of Texas to \nappear before the U.S. Supreme Court and argue that an action by a \nRepublican President and former Governor of the State of Texas was \nunconstitutional. Yes, I can tell you I was very proud to have the \nopportunity to do just that, and I was even more proud when the Supreme \nCourt of the United States ruled by a vote of 6 to 3 in favor of the \nState of Texas, concluding, No. 1, that the World Court has no \nauthority whatsoever to bind the U.S. justice system; and No. 2, the \nPresident has no authority under the Constitution to give away our \nsovereignty.\n\n  I would suggest that is the way our system is supposed to work; that \nall of us, regardless of party, should be standing together for \nliberty. And when I think of standing for liberty, some of the \nfrustration people have across this country is they feel it doesn't do \nany good. It doesn't make a difference who they vote for. Whoever they \nvote for, they go to Washington and keep spending money, and spending \nmore money, and more money, and more money, and the debt goes up and up \nand up, and the Federal laws get bigger and bigger and bigger and \nbigger, and the Federal regulations get more and more and more, and \nnothing seems to change. And I understand that frustration. It is a \nreal frustration. It is a frustration I share, and I know it is a \nfrustration the Senator from Kentucky shares.\n  I would suggest that part of the import of tonight is that the \nSenator from Kentucky is standing with millions of Americans who are \nfrustrated by politicians in Washington who are unwilling to rock the \nboat, who are unwilling to stand for change. I am reminded that change \ncan sometimes seem hopeless. Indeed, I mentioned that the desk I am \nstanding at was previously occupied by Barry Goldwater. I have yet to \nacquire, but I intend to acquire, a leather-bound copy of ``Conscience \nof a Conservative,'' which I intend to keep in this desk.\n  When Barry Goldwater became a national leader, it was thought \nimpossible for his views to receive a wide audience. The views that \nwere in the ascendancy were the views of the left; that government \ncontrol of the economy, of our lives, was the proper and right \ndirection for our Nation.\n  I am reminded of someone else, as the Senator from Kentucky knows, \nwho gave a speech on October 27, 1964. He said the following:\n\n       I have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recently have \n     seen fit to follow another course. I believe that the issues \n     confronting us cross party lines. Now, one side in this \n     campaign--\n\n  And here he is referring to the campaign in 1964 for President.\n\n       --has been telling us that the issues of this election are \n     the maintenance of peace and prosperity. The line has been \n     used, ``We've never had it so good.''\n       But I have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity \n     isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the \n     future. No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden \n     that reached a third of its national income. Today, 37 cents \n     out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax \n     collector's share,\n\n  Ah, those were the days.\n\n       and yet our government continues to spend $17 million a day \n     more than the government takes in.\n\n  Would that we could say today the government spends only $17 million \na day more than it takes in.\n\n       We haven't balanced our budget in 28 out of the last 34 \n     years. We've raised our debt limit three times in the last 12 \n     months,\n\n  I will remind you this speech was given in 1964, not last week.\n\n       and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger \n     than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world. \n     We have $15 billion in gold in our treasury; we don't own an \n     ounce. Foreign dollar claims are $27.3 billion. And we've \n     just announced that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase 45 \n     cents of its total value.\n\n  Again, a scenario with which we are quite familiar.\n\n       As for the peace that we would preserve, I wonder who among \n     us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or \n     son has died in South Vietnam and ask them if they think this \n     is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely. Do they \n     mean peace or do they mean we just want to be left in peace? \n     There can be no real peace while one American is dying \n     someplace in the world for the rest of us. We're at war with \n     the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his \n     long climb from the swamp to the stars, and it's been said if \n     we lose that war, and in doing so lose this way of freedom of \n     ours, history will record with the greatest astonishment that \n     those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its \n     happening. Well, I think it's time we ask ourselves if we \n     still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the \n     Founding Fathers.\n\n  This next section is a section particularly dear to my heart. It was \ngiven before I was born.\n\n       Not too long ago, two friends of mine were talking to a \n     Cuban refugee, a businessman who had escaped from Castro, and \n     in the midst of his story one of my friends turned to the \n     other and said, ``We don't know how lucky we are.'' And the \n     Cuban stopped and said, ``How lucky you are? I had someplace \n     to escape to.'' And in that sentence he told us the entire \n     story.\n\n  Turning and seeing the junior Senator from Florida, I know he and I \nboth know, as I hope every Member of this body knows, just how precious \nand fragile the freedom is that we enjoy in this country.\n  As President Reagan continued in that speech:\n\n       If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to. \n     This is the last stand on Earth.\n\n  This idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no \nother source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest \nand most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man. \nThis is the issue of this election: whether we believe in our capacity \nfor self-government or whether we abandon the American revolution and \nconfess that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capitol can \nplan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.\n\n       You and I are increasingly told that we have to choose \n     between a left or right. I would like to suggest there is no \n     such thing as left or right. There is only up or down--[Up] \n     man's old-age dream, the ultimate in individual freedom \n     consistent with law and order, or down, to the ant heap of \n     totalitarianism. Regardless of their sincerity, their \n     humanitarian motives, those who would trade freedom for \n     security have embarked on this downward course.\n\n\n[[Page S1217]]\n\n\n  Given the topic of this discussion, the asserted power of the \nPresident to take the life of a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil without due \nprocess of law, that last portion bears reading again. ``Those who \nwould trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward \ncourse to the ant heap of totalitarianism.''\n  In this vote-harvesting time, they use terms like the ``Great \nSociety,'' or as we were told a few days ago by the President, we must \naccept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people. But \nthey've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves; \nand all of the things I now will quote have appeared in print. These \nare not Republican accusations. For example, they have voices that say, \n``The cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic \nsocialism.'' Another voice says, ``The profit motive has become \noutmoded. It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state.'' \nOr, ``Our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of \nsolving the complex problems of the 20th century.'' Senator Fullbright \nhas said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded. He \nreferred to the President as ``our moral teacher and our leader,'' and \nhe says he is ``hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power \nimposed on him by this antiquated document.'' He must ``be freed,'' so \nthat he ``can do for us'' what he knows ``is best.'' And Senator Clark \nof Pennsylvania, another articulate spokesman, defines liberalism as \n``meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of \ncentralized government.''\n  Well, I, for one, resent it when a representative of the people \nrefers to you and me, the free men and women of this country, as ``the \nmasses.'' This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America. \nBut beyond that, ``the full power of centralized government''--this was \nthe very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that \ngovernments don't control things. A government can't control the \neconomy without controlling people. And they know when a government \nsets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its \npurpose. They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its \nlegitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as \neconomically as the private sector of the economy.\n  Now, we have no better example of this than government's involvement \nin the farm economy over the last 30 years. Since 1955, the cost of \nthis program has nearly doubled. One-fourth of farming in America is \nresponsible for 85 percent of the farm surplus. Three-fourths of \nfarming is out on the free market and has known a 21 percent increase \nin the per capita consumption of all its produce.\n  I am going to skip further along, to the end of the speech which, I \nwill confess, not unlike the speeches given on this floor, was not a \nshort speech. I will move to the end where President Reagan continued \nand said:\n\n       Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of \n     the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution \n     of peace without victory. They call their policy \n     ``accommodation.'' And they say if we will only avoid any \n     direct confrontation with the enemy, he will forget his evil \n     ways and learn to love us. . . . We cannot buy our security, \n     our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an \n     immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now \n     enslaved behind the Iron Curtain, ``Give up your dreams of \n     freedom because to save your skins we are making a deal with \n     your slave masters.'' Alexander Hamilton said, ``A nation \n     which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, \n     and deserves one.'' Let's set the record straight. There is \n     no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there \n     is only one guaranteed way you can have peace--and you can \n     have it in the next second--surrender.\n       Admittedly there's a risk in any course we follow other \n     than this, but every lesson of history tells us the greater \n     risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter that we \n     face. You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear \n     and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains \n     and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did \n     this begin?\n       You and I have the courage to say to our enemies. ``There \n     is a price we will not pay. There is a point beyond which \n     they must not advance.'' And this, this is the meaning in the \n     phrase of Barry Goldwater's ``peace through strength.''\n       Winston Churchill said, ``The destiny of man is not \n     measured by material computations. When great forces are on \n     the move in the world we learn we are spirits--not animals. \n     And he said, ``There is something going on in time and space, \n     and beyond time and space which, whether we like it or not, \n     spells duty.''\n       You and I have a rendezvous with destiny.\n       We will preserve for our children this, the last best hope \n     of man on Earth or we will sentence them to take the last \n     step into 1000 years of darkness.\n       We will keep in mind and remember that Barry Goldwater has \n     faith in us, he has faith that you and I have the ability and \n     the dignity and the right to make our own decisions and to \n     determine our own destiny.\n       That path, the path of standing and fighting for freedom, \n     even when it seems daunting, even when it seems the gestalt \n     of the moment is on the other side, is a path with many \n     honorable forebears.\n\n  I can tell you, speaking and echoing the sentiment of the millions on \ntwitter, of the people following this stand for principle tonight, if \nthe 100 Senators in this body stand together and say regardless of \nparty, liberty will always prevail; regardless of party, the \nConstitution is the governing body, the governing document in this \nNation, then we will be doing our jobs.\n  I commend Senator Paul for a lonely stand that, as the night has worn \non, has not proven quite so lonely. Indeed, were he the only Senator \nstanding at his desk this evening, it would not be lonely in that \ncircumstance either because he would be standing shoulder to shoulder \nwith millions of Americans who do not wish the Federal Government to \nassert arbitrary power over our lives, over our liberty, over our \nproperty, but who, instead, want a government that remains a limited \ngovernment of enumerated powers that protects the God-given rights each \nof us is blessed to have.\n  The question I ask: What in the Senator's judgment is America without \nliberty? Who are we, if we are not a free people?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \nremarks. I think he has hit it exactly on the head. The question is a \nvery pertinent question. The question is really where do we go from \nhere.\n  I see this as a struggle. I see that we are engaged in an epic \nstruggle, but it is not a struggle between Republicans and Democrats; \nit is a struggle between the President and the Constitution.\n  The question is, Does the President have the power and the \nprerogative to have his way regardless of the Constitution?\n  The question is, Does the Attorney General get to say that he will \nadhere to the fifth amendment when he chooses to? Is there a choice for \nAmerican citizens on American soil that they either get the fifth \namendment protections or they don't get the fifth amendment \nprotections? This really is a struggle not only between the President \nand the Constitution but between the Senate and the Congress and the \nPresident, to say whether the President gets to determine this policy \nor whether this is a policy that should come from Congress.\n  I think we should be asking not just for the President to give his \nmemos on drones, we should be giving him our memos on drones. We need \nto be dictating the law to the President and not acquiescing and giving \nthe President this authority. This should be a battle between the \nexecutive and the legislative. It should involve Republicans and \nDemocrats trying to restrain the President from saying that he has the \nability to decide when you get fifth amendment protections and when you \ndo not.\n  At this time, I, without yielding the floor, would like to entertain \na question from the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, let me congratulate the junior Senator from \nTexas on a fantastic question. In that question he used Shakespeare \nreferences; he used references to the movie ``Patton.'' I didn't bring \nmy Shakespeare book, so let me just begin by quoting a modern-day poet. \nHis name is Wiz Khalifa, called ``Work Hard Play Hard.'' That is how it \nstarts.\n  If you look at time, I think it is a time when many of our colleagues \nalso expected to be back in the home State playing hard, but we are \nhappy we are still here working hard on this issue. It is actually \npretty stunning. If you watch from home you hear the audience of people \nwatching on the news or whatever, what is going on here. I think it is \nimportant to explain what exactly is happening here. What is happening \nis pretty straightforward.\n\n[[Page S1218]]\n\n  The Senator from Kentucky has asked a question of the administration. \nIt is a pretty straightforward question. Is it constitutional for the \nFederal Government to kill a noncombatant citizen in the United States? \nWe all have strong feelings about that program. We all have \nstrong feelings about the war on terror. These are all legitimate \nissues, but this is a very direct question that has been asked.\n\n  What would have resolved this hours ago, from my understanding--and \nif I am incorrect the Senator from Kentucky will correct me in a \nmoment--my understanding is he has offered two ways to bring this to a \nresolution. One is just a clear, unequivocal statement from the White \nHouse that says, of course, it is unconstitutional. That is not going \nto happen. Unconstitutional. Just a straightforward statement of that \nmagnitude.\n  I have been watching on television the last few hours. I saw the \nSenator from Kentucky say they have reached out to the White House. \nThey have been, I believe, unable to get a direct response.\n  The other is I heard he made a motion to have a resolution heard that \nmade it clear that was the sense of this body. The sense of this body \nwould be that this is unconstitutional. Again, pretty straightforward.\n  Let's just say there are those among us who believe this is \nimportant. I don't know anybody in this body who believes a \nnoncombatant U.S. citizen in the United States who is not doing \nanything of imminent danger should somehow be killed by the U.S. \nGovernment, nor do people at home believe that either. It was the sense \nof the Senate that this was the case, and in exchange for that vote, of \ncourse the vote on Mr. Brennan would move forward, and that has been \nrejected. This doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\n  I actually went to a movie--one of the great American movies, ``The \nGodfather''--and there was a quote in that movie. I don't have the \nPatton quote, but I have ``The Godfather'' quote, and this is the best \nknown one, ``I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.'' To me these are \nstraightforward offers they can't refuse. Yet they have been refused. I \nthink that is stunning.\n  The third thing I wish to say--I want you to imagine what this \nconversation would be like tonight if the President was George W. Bush \nand if this issue was about George W. Bush. Just imagine that for a \nmoment now--if he had been asked this direct question and refused to \nanswer--what this Chamber would look like and what the arguments being \nmade would look like tonight. Imagine that for a moment.\n  That takes me back to another modern day poet by the name of Jay-Z \nfrom one of the songs he wrote: It's funny what seven days can change, \nit was all good just a week ago. I don't know if it was all good a week \nago, but I can tell everyone that things have changed.\n  If the President was George W. Bush and this was the question asked \nof him and the response was the silence we have gotten, we would have a \nvery different scenario tonight except I actually believe the Senator \nfrom Kentucky would make the exact same arguments he is now making on \nthe floor.\n  I want everyone who is watching to clearly understand--and if I am \nwrong, the Senator from Kentucky is going to correct me--that what he \nis asking is a simple, straightforward response or, if we cannot get \nthat, a simple and straightforward response from the Members of this \nbody in a sense of the Senate resolution vote. Both have been rejected.\n  The last observation I would have tonight is that there have been \npretty phenomenal legal analyses on the floor. That reminds me of the \nmost famous quote from ``The Godfather'' that was never actually used \nin the movie. I don't know how that happened. Maybe they cut it out. \nHere is the quote: ``A lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a \nhundred men with guns.'' I don't know how that is relevant to this, but \nI thought it was a very good quote. I thought I would bring it up \nbecause I went to law school. I am a lawyer. I was a land use and \nzoning attorney, which meant if I wound up in the courtroom, something \nwent horribly wrong with the land use and zoning application.\n  The point is we have had good arguments on the constitutional issues \nwith regard to this, and I think those are important to discuss. I am \nglad so much time has been spent on those. It is important for the \npeople at home to fully understand the legal arguments here because I \nthink they are important. They go to the heart of our Constitution. \nThey go to the heart of our civil liberties. They go to the heart of \nthe things that distinguish our Nation.\n  I think what is stunning to me--clearly the constitutional issue is \nimportant--is how simple and straightforward this issue is and how \neasily it could have been resolved. I don't know how many hours we are \ninto this now--I think it is about 11 hours and 15 minutes--but we \ncannot get a straightforward answer. The Members of this body deserve \nthat. The Members of this body deserve an answer. It doesn't matter \nwhat party you or the President is in. This is an important question \nthat is being asked.\n  All of this could be over if we get a straightforward answer. I think \nthat is something every Member of this body should care about. It is \nnot a Republican question. It is not a conservative question. It is a \nconstitutional question, a relevant question, and one that should be \neasy to answer.\n  They are refusing to answer it for some reason. I don't know if it is \nbecause of pride or it is beneath them or they have something else \ngoing on or the answer department was shut down. Either way I don't \nunderstand how they cannot answer this very straightforward question.\n  It reminds me of another line from ``The Godfather'' when Michael \nturns to Fredo and says: Fredo, you are my older brother, and I love \nyou but don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again. \nThat is kind of what is happening here. As an institution--as the \nSenate--we have a right to those answers. It doesn't matter who the \nPresident is. We have a job to do that we are held responsible for and \nthat we are held accountable.\n  Thirty years from now, forty years from now, twenty years from now, \nten years from now, these sorts of decisions will have ramifications \nlong after we are gone. All of us here will be gone and there will be \nother people in these chairs. Maybe it will be our children, \ngrandchildren or great-grandchildren who will visit this building, and \nthey will read about the time we served here. If we make mistakes, \nhistory will record those mistakes and hold us accountable for those \nmistakes. If things are happening today that set the groundwork for \nfuture administrations--because that is the other thing we need to \nremember. No matter how anyone feels about the current President, he is \nnot going to be President forever. The precedence he sets could very \nwell guide what future Presidents do.\n  So the point is, if we are laying the groundwork and making mistakes \nby not asking certain questions, history will hold us accountable for \nthat and that is all of us. It is not one of us, not five of us, not \nthe Republican part of the Senate but all of us. We have a right to ask \nthese questions and to get these questions answered. That is not being \nan obstructionist, that is not being partisan, that is being a Senator.\n  I have only been here 2 years, but I know enough of this process \nalready to know that when the majority changes or when a new President \nis elected, at some point every single one of us is going to want to \nhave an answer from the administration or some other branch of \ngovernment and they are going to hold us off. They are going to give us \nthe Heisman and stiff-arm us and not answer the question. I would sure \nhope at that moment--whether you agree with that person or not--that \nyou would stand and defend their prerogative and right as a \nrepresentative of their State to get legitimate questions answered in a \nstraightforward way.\n\n  As I said earlier today when I came to the floor, this issue is about \nthis institution as much as anything else. It is about the right of \nevery single Member of this body to be able to ask legitimate questions \nof the administration or other branches of government and to get a \nstraightforward answer.\n  I guess the question I have for the junior Senator from Kentucky is--\njust to clarify my understanding--that this issue could have been \nbrought to a resolution quite a long time ago if the White House had \nmade their feelings well known in a statement. They could\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\njust put that out in a 30-second statement, and it would be done. Just \ncome out and say it, that it is unconstitutional to kill U.S. citizens \nthat are noncombatants who are in the United States. That is one route.\n  The other thing that could have ended this is the unanimous consent \nmotion he made to have this body vote on the sense of the Senate, and \nthat would have brought it to a vote. Is that accurate? Are those the \noptions before us?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, that is exactly the sequence of things. We \nhave been in contact with the White House throughout the night. We have \nmade several phone calls to the White House. We told them we are \nwilling to allow a vote on the Brennan nomination. All we ask in return \nis that we get a clear implication of whether they believe they have \nthe authority under the Constitution to target Americans on American \nsoil. I think it is a question that is fair to ask, and we have been \nwilling to let them have the vote at any time either earlier tonight, \nobviously, as well as in the morning. All we ask in return from the \nWhite House is a clarification.\n  The last report I got from the White House is that they were done \ntalking tonight. I hope that doesn't mean they are done talking \ntomorrow. I think this struggle is an important struggle, and I think \nthere needs to be clarification from the White House before this goes \nforward. This is a point in time when the question has been raised. I \nthink it is important for them to answer the question, and the fifth \namendment is not optional. They don't get to choose to adhere to the \nfifth amendment. This applies to U.S. citizens on U.S. soil, and there \nare no exceptions to that.\n  Without yielding time, I would like to entertain a question from the \nSenator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nyielding for a question. I appreciate his diligence in continuing at \nthis late hour to get an answer to some very important questions.\n  I think many of us when we got up and came in this morning were \npreparing and getting ready for the big blizzard of 2013 which, of \ncourse, never materialized here in Washington, DC. Evidently, there \nwere a lot of agencies of government that were not here today. Perhaps \nwhen they get back, maybe the Senator from Kentucky will get an answer \nto his question. I think it is a straightforward question.\n  I am someone this evening who has supported the use of drones in \nfighting the war on terror. I think they have been very effective in \nkilling terrorists, people who want to do harm to the people of this \ncountry. But I think the question that has been raised by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky--and the reason we are here this evening--has to do with \na straightforward issue. He has a sense of the Senate on which he is \nprepared to have the Senate go on record, and it is very simple and \nvery straightforward. It says: Resolved that it is the sense of the \nSenate that, No. 1, the use of drones to execute or target American \ncitizens on American soil who pose no imminent threat clearly violates \nthe constitutional due process rights of citizens.\n  No. 2, the American people deserve a clear, concise, and unequivocal \npublic statement from the President of the United States that contains \ndetailed legal reasoning including, but not limited to, the balance \nbetween national security and due process, limits of Executive power, \nand distinction between treatment of citizens and noncitizens within \nand outside the borders of the United States, the use of lethal force \nagainst American citizens, and the use of drones and the application of \nlethal force within the United States territory.\n  It is a very straightforward resolution, a sense of the Senate, and \nall that the Senator from Kentucky is simply doing is trying to get a \nresponse and get a vote on that and make that the statement of the \nSenate. He obviously wants to get the President of the United States, \nthe White House, and Mr. Brennan--whose nomination is pending before \nus--to make a clarification on that point.\n  It is not like this issue popped up overnight. The Senator from \nKentucky has been trying for some time to get an answer to this \nquestion. He has submitted numerous letters addressed to Mr. Brennan.\n  This is a letter from February 12 where he poses numerous questions, \none of which is: Do you believe that the President has the power to \nauthorize lethal force, such as a drone strike, against a U.S. citizen \non U.S. soil? What about the use of lethal force against a non-U.S. \nperson on U.S. soil? These are straightforward questions to which the \nSenator from Kentucky deserves an answer, and this is a perfectly \nfitting and appropriate time in which to try and get that answer.\n  The nomination of the CIA Director is an incredibly important and \nstrategic position in this country, and under the Constitution of the \nUnited States, article II, section 2, the President has the power by \nand with the advice and consent of the Senate to make treaties provided \ntwo-thirds of the Senators concur. ``He shall nominate, and with the \nadvice of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public \nministers, counsels, judges of the Supreme Court, and other officers of \nthe United States.''\n  It is the advise and consent power that the Senate has under the \nConstitution that the Senator from Kentucky is exercising on this \nnomination.\n  Again, it has been pointed out many times on the floor of the Senate \ntoday this is not something that is a partisan issue. It is not a \nDemocratic or Republican issue. This is something that has \nramifications. It is a constitutional question. It has to do with due \nprocess under the law. It has to do with the advise and consent power \nof the Senate under the Constitution. So when the Senator from Kentucky \ncontinues to press the administration for a straightforward answer, he \ncontinues to get sort of these vague, ambiguous answers, if you will. \nAgain, these are questions that did not just pop up overnight. Back on \nJanuary 25 of this year, 2013, the Senator from Kentucky posed to Mr. \nBrennan a series of questions at that time. The follow-on letter, which \nI quoted from earlier, was from February 12. He put forward questions, \nsuch as:\n\n       Do you agree with the argument put forth on numerous \n     occasions by the executive branch that it is legal to order \n     the killing of American citizens and it is not compelled to \n     explain its reasoning in reaching this conclusion? Do you \n     believe this is a good precedent for the government to set?\n\n  He goes on to ask another question:\n\n       Would it not be appropriate to require a judge or court to \n     review every case before the individual in question is added \n     to a targeting list? Please describe the due process \n     requirements in place for those individuals being considered \n     for addition to a targeting list. Would you agree it is \n     paradoxical that the Federal Government would need to go \n     before a judge to authorize a wiretap on U.S. citizens \n     overseas but possibly not to order a lethal drone strike \n     against the same individual? If not, please explain why you \n     believe something similar to the FISA standard should not be \n     applied in regard to lethal actions against citizens of the \n     United States.\n\n  These are straightforward questions. These are questions to which I \nbelieve the Senator from Kentucky deserves an answer. Many of us this \nevening, at this late hour, are here to support him in that endeavor \nand his attempt at least to try--as this nomination moves through the \nprocess--to get the answers to the questions that would allow him to \nperform the advise and consent function that is in the U.S. \nConstitution as it applies to nominations and as it has been \nimplemented here by the Senators in history.\n  I want to say to the Senator from Kentucky--and I have a question for \nhim in a moment--that it is remarkable to see this process unfold. In \nmy time here--and I came in the 2004 election; started my service in \nthe U.S. Senate in January of 2005--I have not seen a time where we had \na Senator who as a matter of principle stood down here for the number \nof hours he has today and insisted on getting some answers. I give him \ngreat credit for the job he has done in pressing this issue.\n  He has not been given that answer yet. It sounds as though it has \nkind of come up to the line a couple of times. It is very simple. They \ncould put this thing to rest. All they have to do is come forward and \nanswer that very simple question about the legal authority to target \nAmerican citizens on American soil with drone attacks. It doesn't seem \nto me, at least, that it would be that hard of a question to answer. \nThey say as a matter of policy\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\nthey have not done that and they don't have any intention of doing it \nin the future. Why don't we put this issue to rest once and for all, \nand the Senator from Kentucky will allow the process to go forward and \nMr. Brennan can get his vote.\n  In the time I have been here, at least, it certainly is remarkable to \nme to see the amount of effort the Senator from Kentucky has put \nforward in trying to get an answer to a very straightforward question. \nI give him great credit for that, because a principled stand is \nsomething we don't see enough of around here. So to stand here and use \nhis powers as a Senator in a way that is very fitting with the \ntradition and history of this great institution--we look at the U.S. \nSenate and those who have come before, the place of great characters of \nour history, including Calhoun and others who have graced the U.S. \nSenate and some of the great debates that have occurred in the past. It \nis nice to see a discussion and debate about a major constitutional \nissue, a major constitutional question.\n  I, as do many of my colleagues who are here this evening, support the \nSenator from Kentucky in his quest to get answers. I think it is \ncertainly appropriate. I think it certainly should be expected that the \nadministration respond to what are very straightforward questions with \nregard to the issue that has been raised by the Senator and I hope that \nanswer will be forthcoming. If it is not, it is entirely possible, I \nsuppose, that this could continue for some time into the future.\n  But in any event, I ask the Senator from Kentucky what it will take \nin terms of some sort of affirmation, some sort of answer, some sort of \nresponse from the White House, from the nominee, the Director of the \nCIA, to satisfy the question he has raised. It seems to me, at least as \na Senator from South Dakota, that the question he poses is a \nstraightforward and simple one and merely requires a very simple \nanswer.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for \nhis remarks and would make the comment that I, as has he, have seen \nwhat drones can do to protect our soldiers and no one is arguing \nagainst that. No one is arguing against drones or any other kinds of \nforce to defend the country against any kind of an attack. What we are \narguing for is that noncombatants--people not engaged in combat in our \ncountry--are due fifth amendment protections, and that the White House \nshould acknowledge this. This is important because the drone strikes \noverseas, when looking at the category and looking at the way they are \nbeing done and under what standards, there are some of those standards \nthat we don't think are appropriate for U.S. citizens on U.S. soil. So \nwe are asking for a clarification. We think Attorney General Holder got \nclose to that today, under the duress of cross-examination. We wish to \nsee him do it voluntarily in a nice, concise statement and we would be \nhappy to vote on the Brennan nomination as early as tomorrow morning.\n  I wish to yield time to the minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my colleague from Kentucky. First let me say I \nthink our mutual constituents will certainly learn----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, was there a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. First let me thank my friend from Kentucky for his \ncourage and conviction. Having been here a while in the Senate, we have \nonly rarely, as Senator Thune pointed out, had extended debate on any \nmatter. A body that came into existence for the purpose of lengthy \ndiscussions of weighty issues has, in recent years, had very little \nlengthy discussion of weighty issues.\n  If I understand the issue the Senator from Kentucky feels so \npassionately about, it is that the administration should answer a \nquestion that is pretty easily stated, as I understand it, as follows: \nDoes the administration take the view that a drone strike against a \nU.S. citizen on U.S. soil would be an appropriate use of that weapon? \nAm I correct that is the question the Senator from Kentucky hopes to \nget an answer to from the administration?\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And I assume the Senator from Kentucky shares my view \nthat it is a pretty easily understood question. It strikes me that the \nquestion again is pretty easily understood and has to be something the \nadministration has given some thought to, given the development of this \nnew weapon.\n  I heard Senator Barrasso earlier today talking about how this \ntechnology has changed--we would never have thought of this a few years \nago--this technology has actually changed warfare in a very dramatic \nway. So as I understand it, what the Senator from Kentucky is looking \nfor is how this dramatic new weapon applies to the U.S. Constitution--\nhow the use of it applies to the U.S. Constitution on American soil.\n  So I think it is entirely appropriate that the Senator from Kentucky \nengage in an extended debate with the support of his colleagues to get \nthe answer to this question. I wanted to congratulate him for his \ntenacity, for his conviction, and for being able to rally the support \nof a great many people, as well as people who have come over from the \nHouse of Representatives who feel also, I gather, that this is a \nlegitimate question the administration ought to be answering.\n\n  I might say, at whatever point we get to a cloture vote to extend \ndebate on the nomination of Brennan, it is my view cloture should not \nbe invoked. This is a controversial nominee. Should cloture be invoked, \nI intend to oppose the nomination.\n  I congratulate my colleague from Kentucky for this extraordinary \neffort.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I wish to thank the minority leader for \nhis remarks and for his insightful questions. The question about \nwhether the President has actually gotten involved with what the rules \nwill be has actually been somewhat broached. He was asked at Google \nabout whether this could occur and he said, Well, the rules would have \nto be different outside than inside. So it implies they have thought \nabout what the rules should be outside, but to my knowledge no one in \nthe Intelligence Committee has been informed what the rules are inside.\n  It troubles me that they think they have the authority to do targeted \ndrone strikes inside, particularly when there are examples of the Twin \nTowers and 1941 Pearl Harbor. Those would be attacks we would repulse \nno matter who we knew was coming in. There wouldn't be a targeted \nstrike on an individual at a designated time. We would repulse those \nattacks militarily and they wouldn't even fall into the category of \nwhat we are talking about here as targeted drone strikes. We might use \ndrones, but they wouldn't be what we are talking about. These are \nquestions we have been asking all day. So they have answered a \nquestion, just not the question we asked.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I wish to yield for a question to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I wish to spend a couple of moments here \nrevisiting the context in which this discussion occurred. I want to \ncommend the Senator from Kentucky for raising what I think is an \nextremely important issue and forcing the attention of this body to \nthis issue at an appropriate time, which he has done, and, I might add, \nat great personal inconvenience to himself.\n  This arose from a letter the Senator from Kentucky sent to Mr. \nBrennan, the nominee for the Director of Central Intelligence, and the \nresponse he got. These are short letters. I want to review this so it \nis very clear exactly what was posed and what the response was and \nwhere we are at the moment in this debate.\n  The letter from the Senator from Kentucky begins:\n\n       Dear Mr. Brennan: In consideration of your nomination to be \n     the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, I have \n     repeatedly requested that you provide answers to several \n     questions clarifying your role in the approval of lethal \n     force against terrorism suspects, particularly those who are \n     U.S. citizens. Your past actions in this regard as well as \n     your view of the limitations to which you are subject are of \n     critical importance in assessing your qualifications to lead \n     the CIA. If it is not clear that you will honor the limits \n     placed upon the executive branch by the Constitution, then \n     the Senate should not confirm you to lead the CIA.\n\n  Clearly, this is the idea that is under scrutiny this evening.\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       During your confirmation process in the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence, committee members have quite \n     appropriately made a request similar to questions I have \n     raised in my previous letter to you, that you expound on your \n     views on the limits of executive power in using lethal force \n     against U.S. citizens, especially when operating on U.S. \n     soil. In fact, the chairman of the SSCI--\n\n  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n\n       Senator Feinstein, specifically asked you in post-hearing \n     questions, for the record, whether the administration could \n     carry out drone strikes inside the United States. In your \n     response, you emphasize that the administration ``has not \n     carried out'' such strikes, and ``has no intention of doing \n     so.'' I do not find this response sufficient.\n\n  Let me just add editorially, I do not know how anyone could find that \nsufficient. It clearly is an evasion of the question. That doesn't \nanswer the question that was posed by Senator Feinstein, just as we \nhaven't been able to get an answer to the question posed by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       The question that I and many others have asked is not \n     whether the administration has or intends to carry out drone \n     strikes inside the United States, but whether it believes it \n     has the authority to do so. This is an important distinction \n     that should not be ignored.\n\n  And this, of course, goes to the heart of the question: Does this \nadministration believe it has the authority to carry out a lethal \nstrike by a drone against an American citizen on American soil.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       Just last week, President Obama also avoided this question \n     when posed to him directly. Instead of addressing the \n     question of whether the administration could kill a U.S. \n     citizen on American soil, he used a similar line that ``there \n     has never been a drone used on an American citizen on \n     American soil.''\n       The evasive replies from the administration to this valid \n     question have only confused the issue further without getting \n     us any closer to an actual answer.\n\n  I would say that is--again, this is my editorial comment--I think \nthat is a generous assessment. When a direct question is asked and the \nparty to whom the question is directed repetitively evades the \nquestion, it makes one seriously wonder what their intentions are.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       For that reason, I, once again, request you answer the \n     following question: Do you believe that the President has the \n     power to authorize lethal force such as a drone strike \n     against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil and without a trial? I \n     believe the only acceptable answer to this is no. Until you \n     directly and clearly answer, I plan to use every procedural \n     option at my disposal to delay your confirmation and bring \n     added scrutiny to this issue and the administration's \n     policies on the use of lethal force.\n       The American people are rightly concerned and they deserve \n     a frank and open discussion on these policies.\n       Sincerely, Rand Paul, M.D., United States Senator.\n\n  I have to say, this is a very straightforward and simple question. It \nhas been posed clearly. It has been posed repeatedly.\n  Now I want to share with my colleagues the answer, such as it is, \nthat we have received, the most recent answer that was directed to the \nSenator from Kentucky which, again, I would suggest is not responsive \nto the question.\n  A letter dated March 4, addressed to Senator Paul, says:\n\n       On February 20, 2013, you--\n  Referring to Senator Paul--\n     wrote to John Brennan requesting additional information \n     concerning the Administration's views about whether ``the \n     President has the power to authorize lethal force, such as a \n     drone strike, against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, and \n     without trial.''\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       As members of this Administration have previously \n     indicated, the U.S. government has not carried out drone \n     strikes in the United States and has no intention of doing \n     so. As a policy matter, moreover, we reject the use of \n     military force where well-established law enforcement \n     authorities in this country provide the best means for \n     incapacitating a terrorist threat. We have a long history of \n     using the criminal justice system to incapacitate individuals \n     located in our country who pose a threat to the United States \n     and its interests abroad. Hundreds of individuals have been \n     arrested and convicted of terrorism-related offenses in our \n     federal courts.\n       The question you have posed is therefore entirely \n     hypothetical, unlikely to occur, and one we hope no President \n     will ever have to confront. It is possible, I suppose, to \n     imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be \n     necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and \n     applicable laws of the United States for the President to \n     authorize the military to use lethal force within the \n     territory of the United States. For example, the President \n     could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the \n     military to use such force if necessary to protect the \n     homeland in the circumstances of a catastrophic attack like \n     the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11, \n     2001.\n       Were such an emergency to arise, I would examine the \n     particular facts and circumstances before advising the \n     President on the scope of his authority.\n       Sincerely,\n       Eric H. Holder, Jr.\n       Attorney General\n\n  The reason I read the entire letter is because I did not want anyone \nto think any part of this was taken out of context or anything was \nbeing left out.\n  When you read the entire letter, in response to the entire letter \nthat was sent as a request, I think it is very clear. This \nadministration refuses to answer a simple and very important and very \nlegitimate question.\n  Our Attorney General suggests that under a certain set of \ncircumstances--which he will not specify any guiding principles or \nrules that would allow us to understand those circumstances--he would \nexamine the facts and circumstances and then advise the President on \nthe scope of his authority.\n  There is no suggestion of what legal authority he has to do this. \nThere is no description of the constitutional authority. I find this \nvery disturbing. We have all observed the very new developments that we \nare experiencing in national security. The minority leader alluded to \nthis in some respects.\n  As I mentioned earlier today, there is no question we have a \nrelatively new phenomenon in our national security challenges. It is \nonly in very recent times that we have come to understand the nature of \na whole new kind of enemy. It is not just a nation state anymore, which \nhas historically been the nature of military threats. But now there is \na very different kind of threat--dispersed, somewhat affiliated, \nsometimes affiliated, hard to discern--a geographically widespread \nnetwork of terrorists. That is very different than the traditional \nnation state. That is a different kind of threat, and we have spent a \nlot of time trying to come to terms with how best to address this.\n  In an overlapping period of time, a new technology has emerged. We \nhave developed it. It is an amazing technology that gives us the \nability from vast distances away to send out a very sophisticated \nunmanned aircraft that is quite lethal and quite capable of destroying \na target. I think most of us probably feel that there are many cases \nwhere this is an appropriate tool under an appropriate set of \ncircumstances. But, frankly, I think it should be the subject of an \nongoing discussion: How would we use this? Under what circumstances? \nDoes the President have unlimited unilateral authority? That is a \ndiscussion we ought to have about the use of this technology overseas \nwhere I think, as I say, it has a very important, very useful, very \nlegitimate function.\n  But when we are talking about using this, the American Government \nusing this military asset to kill American citizens on American soil, I \nam a little shocked that there is not an automatic presumption that \nthat is not permissible--certainly not legal. I cannot understand the \nconstitutional basis for this. I would certainly suggest that the \nburden ought to be on those who would suggest that that is permissible.\n  So what the Senator from Kentucky has said is: Just tell us the \nanswer to this question. Do you believe you actually do have this \nauthority? And could you tell us that? If they believe they have this \nauthority--and since they will not answer unequivocally that they lack \nthe authority, it is hard to infer anything other than that perhaps \nthey think they do have this authority.\n  It obviously raises a whole lot of very important questions, such as \nunder what circumstances would you feel you have the authority to \nexercise this power? And exactly who would be targeted? And how would \nyou decide whom to target? And in the event you are carrying out a \nstrike using lethal force of this magnitude on American soil against an \nAmerican citizen, what kind of criteria would govern your judgment \nabout the risks that would be imposed on innocent people who are in the \nvicinity? And what about any judicial review at all? Would there be any \nappropriate role for it because, of\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\ncourse, we have a very long tradition of due process.\n  There are a lot of Americans who have serious reservations about the \nidea of indefinite detention on American soil. Indefinite detention is \npretty tame compared to being destroyed by a drone.\n  So I would suggest the failure of the administration to answer this \nbasic question of whether they believe they have the authority to do \nsomething that is completely unprecedented is a very fundamental and \nimportant question and completely legitimate. And it is completely \nappropriate for this body to insist on an answer to this question \nbefore we would go ahead and confirm a person who would have enormous \npower and authority over a variety of national security issues.\n\n  I want to commend the Senator from Kentucky for putting a bright \nlight on this issue. This is a very important issue, and, as I \nmentioned earlier, he has done it at great personal inconvenience to \nhimself because he has a passionate commitment to the liberty of the \nAmerican citizens. He manifests that all the time in many ways, and \nthis is one of the ways he is doing it. I commend him for that.\n  I would conclude my question by addressing the Senator, through the \nPresiding Officer. My question for the Senator is, has there been any \nchange in the status of the lack of response from the administration \nsince the last time we have heard from the administration?\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, we have been asking the question of the \nWhite House all day, and we have said all along that we would allow the \nvote to proceed, but we have not gotten any response from the White \nHouse. The consideration of whether we will get a response tonight I \nthink is unlikely. We will still keep pressing the issue in the morning \nas well.\n  But with regard to the Senator's remarks, I think one of the things I \nhope will come out of this debate will be that we will reassert our \nauthority as a function of the separation of powers, where our body \nwill say to the President: We not only would like your drone memos on \nhow you think you can do this, but we should reassert our authority and \ntell the President, this is how we think you should do it, and this is \nthe law that is going to dictate and circumscribe how you will do this.\n  That is an authority that I think has been long necessary and we have \nbeen letting go by the side and I think we should reassert.\n  At this time, Madam President, I wish to yield to----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. PAUL. Without relinquishing the floor, I will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Kentucky, and I apologize to my \nfriend from Wisconsin. I know he has been waiting. But the question \nasked by the Senator from Pennsylvania prompted me to recall a specific \nset of circumstances which I think address his concerns, our mutual \nconcerns, about the use of lethal force.\n  I know we are talking about this in the context of drones, but a \ndrone is a weapon, and there are other weapons by which our government \ncan use lethal force to kill people.\n  So I think, going to the question the Senator asked Mr. Brennan, in a \nmore generic sense, the question is, When can our government use lethal \nforce in the United States against perhaps U.S. citizens? I think it is \na legitimate question.\n  I was not misleading the Senator earlier when I said there is a \nscheduled hearing--the only scheduled hearing--on this question coming \nup before the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, which I \nchair. And the ranking member is Senator Cruz of Texas who was here \nearlier.\n  So I think it is important, and it is an important constitutional \nquestion, but, while my colleague from Pennsylvania is here, I wish to \nrecount a set of circumstances for him, and then pose a question to the \nSenator.\n  The circumstances were September 11, 2001. Some of us were in this \nCapitol Building, in fact, just outside this door. As we came to work, \nwe heard that some plane had crashed into the World Trade Center in New \nYork. As we were watching on television, a few minutes after 9, a \nsecond plane crashed into the World Trade Center--the adjoining \nbuilding. We all know what happened following that.\n  As we were in our meeting here, just a few feet away, we started \nseeing black, billowy smoke coming across the Mall right outside our \nwindow here. A third plane, taken over by these terrorists, was \ncrashing into the Pentagon. What we did not know at the time was that \nthere was a fourth plane. But we evacuated the Capitol. All of us, \nliterally every one, raced out of this building to stand on the lawn \noutside. It was not a safe place, but we did not know where to go--all \nthe tourists, all the staff, and all the rest.\n  It was not but a few minutes that we were out there, and we heard \nsomething that sounded like a shot, a discharge of a weapon. In fact, \nit was fighter planes that were being scrambled to protect the United \nStates Capitol. At that time, the order had gone out to all commercial \nairplanes in the United States: Land immediately, so that we would know \nwho was in our airspace and not responding to that command.\n  It turns out there was a fourth plane involved, and that plane \ncrashed in Pennsylvania, we believe because of the heroism and bravery \nof the passengers on board; that when they realized what was happening, \nthey tried to take control of that plane before it could be used as a \nweapon.\n  Many people believe that plane was aimed for this building or for \nsomeplace in Washington, DC. We had scrambled our military planes. And \nhad that plane not crashed into the countryside in Pennsylvania and \ncome within the airspace of this Capitol, I think we know what would \nhave happened. Our government would have used lethal force--military \nlethal force--to shoot down a civilian airplane that was threatening, \nwe believed, the lives of innocent Americans. It would have been the \nuse of lethal force on our soil to stop a person or persons whom we \nbelieved were terrorists about to kill innocent Americans.\n  So when I listened to the response from Attorney General Holder in \nhypothetical and put it in the context of 9/11, I can imagine that \nPresident Bush might have been called on in an instant to make a \ndecision as Commander in Chief to bring down the fourth plane before it \ncrashed into another building and killed innocent people.\n  That is a circumstance, I would say to the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand the Senator from Kentucky, which I fully understand and expect the \nCommander in Chief to respond to.\n  So I do not think this is such a clear and easy situation. It is \nimportant that we have this hearing and explore the many \npossibilities--the possibility of a terrorist overseas who threatens \nour safety and the use of lethal force, drones or otherwise, the \npossibility of a non-U.S. terrorist in the United States and use of \nlethal force to deter them. And then obvious questions: What if it is a \nU.S. citizen overseas? What if it is a U.S. citizen in the United \nStates?\n  I joined 10 other Senators asking for the same legal memos, which I \nthink the Senator would like to see as well, justifying whatever course \nof action this administration has used. I think it is a legitimate \nconstitutional responsibility of the Senate and the House and this \nCongress.\n  But I also understand, having lived through--as all of us did in some \nrespect--9/11, the complexity of those decisions that have to be made \nin such a fashion.\n  So my question to the Senator--as I said before, we have to end with \na question mark--don't you consider the situation of 9/11 and the use \nof lethal force, even military force, to shoot down a civilian plane--\nif it had survived the passenger effort in Pennsylvania and was headed \nfor the U.S. Capitol--to be a legitimate exercise of a Commander in \nChief to protect the United States?\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, absolutely. My answer to the question the \nSenator raised is absolutely. We have the right to defend ourselves. It \nwould have been a decision that has to be made imminently because a \nlethal threat needs to have a lethal response immediately.\n  My whole problem with this whole debate is, none of us disagrees with \nthat, I do not think. We all agree that you can repel an imminent \nattack. We all agree if someone is outside the Capitol with a rocket \nlauncher or grenade launcher, lethal force can be used\n\n[[Page S1223]]\n\nagainst them. None of us disagrees on that.\n  We are talking about a targeted drone program where we target \nindividuals. Overseas, the standard seems to include people who are not \nactively engaged in combat who we think either might be in the future \nor have been in the past. I do not think that standard can be used in \nthe United States. I think when you are in a battlefield, you do not \nget due process. If you are shooting at Americans, drones can hit you \nanytime, missiles can hit you. There is no due process in a battle.\n  This is a big debate because many have said the battlefield is here. \nBut if the battlefield is here, that would imply the fifth amendment \ndoes not apply here. The President has said he will use the fifth \namendment in the process of deciding drone attacks overseas, but he \ndoes not get the option to kind of use it privately. Using the fifth \namendment privately to me is not using the fifth amendment.\n  I will say, I have a great deal of respect for the Senator from \nIllinois. We have often been on the same side on civil liberties \nissues. I do not question that he and I may well see eye to eye on this \nissue, that targeted killings of people in restaurants, in their house, \nin a hotel, are not something we can or will tolerate. It contravenes \nthe Constitution. It is a simple question. The President should simply \nanswer that question. I think Attorney General Holder was coming in the \ndirection of that. But why is it so hard? Why is it like pulling teeth \nto get them to admit they do not have this power? Presidents need to \nmore easily say: By golly, no, the Constitution says you cannot do \nthat. The fifth amendment does apply. There are no exceptions to the \nfifth amendment for American citizens on American soil. That is all we \nare asking.\n  But I think the 9/11 comparison and Pearl Harbor is a red herring in \nthe sense that none of us disagrees with repelling a lethal attack, an \nimminent lethal attack, an ongoing lethal attack with lethal force. No \none disagrees with that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield further for a question?\n  The white paper that has been presented to us by the Justice \nDepartment concludes that the right to national self-defense and the \n2001 authorization to use military force gave the U.S. Government legal \nauthority to kill a U.S. citizen in a foreign country that is not an \narea of active hostilities, if the target is a senior operational \nleader of al-Qaida or an associated force. So it is qualified in that \nregard.\n  The white paper argues, such an attack does not violate the \nconstitutional rights of a U.S. citizen in this circumstance, ``if he \nposes an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States.'' \nImminent threat. No. 2, ``his capture is not feasible,'' or the Justice \nDepartment white paper goes on to say, ``and the operation complies \nwith the law of war principles, such as the need to minimize collateral \ndamage.''\n  I will say to the Senator, I stand with him. I want an answer to his \nquestion. I think we should pursue it on a bipartisanship basis, as we \nhave many issues together in the past. I think it is a legitimate \nquestion. But I would say that the white paper we have been given \nrelative to this U.S. citizen overseas has some fairly narrow \ncircumstances in terms of the use of force.\n  When it comes to the use of that force in the United States, I \nbelieve the circumstances should be just as narrow, if not more. I \nwould say to the Senator, I am genuine in my concern for bringing these \nissues out in a full hearing of our constitutional subcommittee. I \nthink I have answered the question. I hope he appreciates my sincerity.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, in very quick response to that, one of the \nfew problems with that is they also go on to say that imminent does not \nneed to be immediate. You are also implying that you can kill this \nAmerican citizen in a noncombat situation, not an active battlefield. I \ndo not accept that standard for the United States. It is another debate \nwhether we accept the standard overseas. I think it is an important \ndebate. But the debate about whether that is a sufficient standard for \nAmerica, it is not. To kill someone not in combat--one, it is not wise. \nYou are not going to get any information. When someone is eating \ndinner, why do you not send the police over and arrest them? To kill \nsomeone who is in a noncombat situation in America is unacceptable in \nAmerica under any circumstances. I think we need to come to an \nagreement on that.\n  I wish to yield for a question to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, all of us have come down \nhere to support a very legitimate request to have a legitimate question \nanswered. I think the Senator deserves those answers. If not an answer \nfrom the White House, he at least deserves a vote.\n  I started watching here this morning. The Senator started about \n11:57. It is now past midnight. I think my primary action is one of \njust being puzzled. I have been here for 2 years. I have never served \nin any kind of legislative body. I certainly came to the Senate \nthinking this was the world's greatest deliberative body. What I found \nis a body that is utterly dysfunctional. Even though this is actually \none of the best examples of how this body ought to work, it is also an \nexample of that dysfunction. I cannot believe this issue has not been \nresolved within a half hour, within an hour. Just take a vote.\n  We have a number of our colleagues from the House coming here in \nsupport of the Senator from Kentucky. The House is operating, I \nbelieve, as our Founders intended. They are passing budgets. They are \ndebating issues. They are passing real pieces of legislation that, \nunfortunately, are being dropped over here in the Senate, where those \ngood pieces of legislation die. That is a real shame.\n  For example, I serve on the Budget Committee of the Senate. I have \nbeen on that Budget Committee for 2 years. We have not yet voted on a \nbudget in the Budget Committee. This is, by the way, when this Nation \nis facing a fiscal crisis unlike anything we have ever faced in our \nhistory. We have racked up 4 years now where our debt exceeds \n$1 trillion. There is no end of that in sight. We have not passed or \neven brought to the floor an appropriations bill all year long. How can \nwe function as a body if this is how it operates?\n\n  A number of Republican Senators joined the President at his gracious \ninvitation for dinner tonight. It was an excellent dinner. It was a \ngenuine, sincere, open discussion of the fiscal problems facing this \nNation. I was part of a group of 44 Senators a year and a half ago, \nalmost 2 years now, who also joined the President prior to the final \ndebate on the first debt ceiling in the summer of 2011. The President \nof the United States leaving that meeting should have come away with a \nvery strong understanding that those 44 Republican Senators were \nincredibly sincere in their desire to work with the President, to work \nwith our colleagues across the aisle, to solve these problems. I will \ntell you, I am one Senator who ran for office not to become a Senator \nbut because we are losing this country. We are bankrupting it.\n  One of the things I do when I talk around the country, I make it a \npoint that fortunately I do not know of any parent who would willingly \nmax out their credit cards, get in debt way over their heads never \nintending ever to pay it off, but fully intending to pass it off to the \nchildren and the grandchildren. I do not know any parent that way, \nfortunately. But as a society that is exactly what we are doing.\n  Frequently in this political town, Republicans are accused of waging \na war on women, waging a war on immigrants. None of that is true. What \nWashington is doing is we are waging a war on our children. We are \nmortgaging their future. It is absolutely immoral. Americans have got \nto stop and consider what it is we are actually doing to future \ngenerations.\n  So I felt good at the dinner with the President tonight--I think all \nof my colleagues did. I hope the President did--with a pretty strong \nsense, once again, that there is a great deal of sincerity, a great \ndeal of desire to roll up our shirt sleeves, put down partisan \nbickering, put down partisan differences, work together to solve this \nproblem.\n  I think there has got to be a realization that neither side is going \naway. If we are going to start solving these problems, we have got to \nstart working together. We have got to return the Senate into that \ndeliberative body that\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\nour Founders intended it to be. We have got to be willing to be held \naccountable. We have got to take votes. It should not be that hard. We \nshould not be afraid.\n  I would ask the Senator from Kentucky--as I understand it, this is \npuzzling that we are here now after midnight. I applaud the Senator for \nhis resolve here. That is why he sees every Member coming down here and \nproviding the support. But I think all he wanted was either unanimous \nconsent or possibly a vote on this simple question:\n\n       Resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       No. 1, the use of drones to execute or to target American \n     citizens on American soil who pose no imminent threat clearly \n     violates the Constitutional due process right of citizens.\n\n  That seems like a pretty simple question, seems like one most \nSenators would want to express their opinion by taking a vote, or \nallowing this resolution to pass by unanimous consent. So I guess my \nonly question is, is that all the Senator is looking for, either an \nanswer from the White House or a simple unanimous consent agreement or \na simple vote?\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. Yes, \nwe had two simple requests tonight. The first was for a vote on a \nnonbinding resolution to express our opinion that it is \nunconstitutional to kill Americans on American soil. That was denied by \nthe majority party.\n  The second request we have had, in communication with the White \nHouse, is for the White House to say or clarify their opinion that they \nare not going to be doing targeted drone strikes on noncombatants in \nAmerica. We have not had much success with either one. We will continue \nto ask that question.\n  I have told them I will remove myself from the blockage of John \nBrennan's nomination as soon as we get some clarification from the \nWhite House. I am still hopeful in the morning that they will do that, \nand by doing that, we can move forward with it.\n  But I have been more than willing to compromise, because I do not \nthink it is so much about John Brennan as it is about a constitutional \nprinciple, that I want the President to publicly acknowledge the fifth \namendment does apply to Americans in our country, and that we are not \ngoing to cherry-pick when we apply the fifth amendment.\n  At this time, I wish to yield for a question from the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT. The drone issue is not an issue. It is not a question \nabout Democrats versus Republicans or the DNC versus the GOP. It is not \na question about the executive branch versus the legislative branch. It \nis not a question about conservatives versus liberals. It is a question \nabout the Constitution.\n  Another one of our friends said that this Nation, our great Nation, \nneeds to stand and recognize what Rand Paul is doing today for \nAmericans. All of our aspirations mean nothing, nothing at all without \nour rights.\n  Another said you do not have to like our political party. You did not \neven have to like Senator Rand Paul to stand with Rand. You only need \nto be against the assassination of Americans without due process on \nU.S. soil.\n  I will close with the question that we have heard many times already. \nWhy will this administration not simply state it is unconstitutional \nand illegal--unconstitutional and illegal--for the government to kill \nAmericans in the United States on our soil or, as I think about it, it \nis illegal on the soil of Greenville, SC, it is illegal in Oconee \nCounty, SC.\n  It is illegal in Charleston, SC. It is illegal throughout the coast \nof South Carolina, without due process, to kill an American citizen. Is \nthat what you are asking?\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I think it is an easy question to have \nanswered, and it boggles my mind. I think the President in general, \nthough, and other Presidents in general, hang on to their power with a \ntenacious grip, and they don't want to allow that there is any \npossibility that by saying they don't have this power, they have given \nup some power.\n  I think that is a mistake for Presidents. I think it goes against \nwhat the candidate, Barack Obama, was for and the Senator, Barack \nObama. I hope in the morning when they wake up they will think about \nwhat Candidate Barack Obama said in 2007 and what Senator Barack Obama \nonce stood for as a Senator; that is, the power of the Presidency is \nlimited and checked by the Constitution.\n  Madam President, at this time I would like to yield for a question \nfrom the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Senator for yielding, and I want to commend \nthe Senator for this 12-hour long quest.\n  I think it is now. It is an important topic. I recently traveled to \nAfghanistan and received a briefing there about the drone program and \nhow it is working in Afghanistan. After seeing that briefing, seeing \nexamples of how it is being used, I have to tell you, I was awed by it. \nI thought what a powerful weapon, what a great weapon, in this case, to \nuse against terrorists.\n  My second thought is what happens when that is in the hands of our \nenemy. I can tell you, it is a sobering thought to think of what \nhappens when our enemies get this kind of technology. It is also \nsobering to think of what could happen if we use this technology here \ndomestically. I think the question you have asked is totally right and \nproper. Where does the President derive authority? Does he believe he \nhas the authority to use these weapons or any kind of weapon for lethal \nmeans when there is no imminent threat?\n  I think the question the Senator is asking, if I understand that \nquestion correctly, is right and proper. My understanding is all you \nwant to find out is does the President believe the administration has \nthe authority to use lethal means in this manner domestically; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, that is correct. It is a simple question. \nI think we are not asking for any heavy lifting here. We are asking the \nPresident: Do you have the authority.\n  I think it is important that it is a legal question in the sense we \nwant to ask and get a legal, constitutional response. We are not \nasking--we probably won't do it, we don't intend to do it, or it is not \nappropriate, or it is not, as a policy matter we don't like doing it. \nWe want the constitutional answer: Do you really believe you have the \nconstitutional authority to do this.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today, in support of Senator \nPaul's filibuster on the nomination of John Owen Brennan, to be \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency. I have stated my \nopposition to Brennan's nomination from the beginning.\n  During my time on the Intelligence Committee and as chairman, I \npresided over hearings before which Mr. Brennan testified.\n  His inability to give a straight yes or no answer was greater than \nany other witness I experienced. But his approach is exactly what we \nsee from the Obama administration today.\n  Senator Paul has asked a very simple question to which the President \nrefuses to give a direct answer. The appropriate question is: Will the \nadministration clarify any circumstance when it is acceptable to target \nand kill American citizens on American soil?\n  Senator Paul is only asking for a clear, unwavering statement that \nprotects Americans' fifth Amendment rights as well as our national \nsecurity. All Americans await the answer.\n  The Senate's duty is to conduct oversight and ensure our government \nis protecting its people and the Constitution. In that regard Senator \nPaul's filibuster has been true to our oversight, obligations and \nduties; and I congratulate him.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, at this point I would like to recognize \nfor a question, without yielding the floor, the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. A question I have with regard to an issue that was raised by \nmy friend a few minutes ago, my friend, my distinguished colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Illinois, touches upon an important point, upon a \nprinciple of law which dates back centuries and has application in \nmyriad contexts, one that deals with the concept of imminence.\n  My friend from Illinois is certainly correct in pointing out the \nwhite paper leaked by the Obama Department of Justice to the news media \nrecently does include some analysis that talks about imminence.\n  It is significant, however, to point out, on page 7 of that white \npaper the\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\nadministration goes on to essentially eviscerate that concept of \nimminence. In fact it makes clear that this condition, that is the \ncondition dealing with imminence, with the idea of protecting an \nimminent threat of violent attack against the United States ``does not \nrequire the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack \non U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate \nfuture.''\n  That is at the top of the first full paragraph on page 7 of the very \nsame white paper that my friend from Illinois was quoting.\n  In response to that question, it is important to point out that they \nhave taken the imminence out of imminent. There is no more imminence in \nthis standard. So if, in fact, we are to believe the white paper is the \ncorrect assessment of the administration's position, it is no longer an \nimminent standard. It is something else. It is something of a new \ndevelopment. It is something that was created out of whole cloth by \nthis administration that has nothing to do with the traditional \nimminent standard.\n  I ask my friend from Kentucky whether this is consistent with time-\nhonored notions of due process.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, this is exactly what I understand. It is a \nsignificant problem. I will be happy to yield if there is a question \nfrom across the aisle or a question that is in the form of an \nexplanation as well on his understanding, if we understand this \nincorrectly, this is a real problem. Because the idea of imminence that \npeople think of is someone leveling a weapon at you, you are in a \nbattlefield, and all of these things which none of us disagrees there \nshould be a response.\n  The problem is it really is. I am not an attorney, so it is easy for \nme to disparage attorneys even though I am standing among two I \nadmire--more, probably. The whole point is that sounds like a bunch of \ngovernment attorneys got together and tried to write some gobbledygook \nno one could understand and doesn't make sense; that imminence now \nmeans something that is not immediate.\n  I would be happy to entertain a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This is getting perilously close to a debate, and I am \nsorry, for those observing, it looks like the Senate is actually in a \ndebate.\n  The obvious question is was bin Laden an imminent threat to the \nUnited States when we took him out? I think he was.\n  Was he hatching a plot to cause harm to the United States in an \nimminent manner? Probably not.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I would say touche, a good response, I \nthink well worth thinking about and difficult in the sense that I don't \nthink there are any of us who really were opposed to getting bin Laden. \nThere is a question, you are right, exactly whether there was imminence \ninvolved.\n  I think, though, when we start talking about standards, whether we \nhave standards in battlefields, standards overseas, and standards at \nhome, I think the standard at home has to be incredibly high. I don't \nbelieve we are involved in a battlefield here. I don't believe you have \ngiven up due process here. I don't know that bin Laden had any due \nprocess.\n  I yield for a question from the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  I would point out that the questions of imminence, I don't think, are \ndifficult as has been suggested. Indeed, I would like to thank the \nsenior Senator from Illinois for braving this long evening and for \nexpressing his equal and heartfelt concerns about the limitations on \nthe power of the executive to take the lives of U.S. citizens on U.S. \nsoil.\n  I would point out that at the hearing we had yesterday with the \nAttorney General there was a series of questions exploring in further \ndepth what the position of this administration was because, in response \nto the inquiry of the Senator from Kentucky, Attorney General Holder \nput in writing that he could imagine circumstances in which it would be \npermissible to take the lives of U.S. citizens on U.S. soil.\n  The two examples he gave were Pearl Harbor and 9/11. As the Senator \nfor Kentucky responded, and I think everyone here agrees, those \nexamples are unobjectionable. Both of those instances were instances of \ngrievous military attacks. I think nobody doubts that if Kamikazi \nplanes are coming down on our ships in Pearl Harbor, the United States \ncan use lethal force to take out those planes and to save the lives of \nour service men and women. There is no question about that, legal or \notherwise.\n\n  Likewise, I think nobody doubts if terrorists have taken over an \nairliner and are steering it into a building, that tragic a decision \nwould be as heartrending as the decision on 9/11 must have been for the \nPresident to give the order to shoot down that fourth commercial \nairline--if it began approaching yet another target where it could \ninflict thousands of deaths--I think nobody disputes that stopping an \nimminent, immediate, act of violence, and indeed, a military act of war \nis fully within the authority of the Federal Government.\n  The question posed to the Attorney General was the question Senator \nPaul had asked originally--not that question--rather, it was if there \nis an individual, a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil who is suspected of being \na terrorist, and for whom we can say arguendo there is abundant \nevidence to demonstrate this individual as a terrorist, and if this \nindividual is on U.S. soil and is not currently an imminent threat of \nviolence--if he or she is sitting in a cafe in rural Virginia having a \ncup of coffee, the question I posed to the Attorney General is, in \nthose circumstances, would it be constitutional for the U.S. Government \nto send a drone to kill that U.S. citizen on U.S. soil with no due \nprocess of law if that individual did not pose an imminent threat?\n  In my judgment that was not a difficult question. I think the answer, \nfrankly, I expected was, of course not. Of course the Federal \nGovernment cannot kill a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil who does not pose an \nimminent threat. That has been the state of the law from the day our \nConstitution came into effect and from before.\n  Instead, the first response of the Attorney General was it wouldn't \nbe appropriate to use lethal force there, and we wouldn't do so. I \npressed the question again on the Attorney General and said: With \nrespect, the question is not whether it is appropriate, it is not a \nquestion of prosecutorial discretion. Do we trust you would not choose \nto exercise lethal force in those circumstances? Rather, it is a \nquestion would it be constitutional to kill a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil \nwith a drone if that individual did not pose an imminent threat?\n  The second time the Attorney General said: I don't believe it would \nbe appropriate. Yet a third time I asked the Attorney General: I am not \nasking about appropriateness. As the Attorney General of the United \nStates, you are the chief legal officer for this Nation. Does the \nDepartment of Justice have a legal opinion as to whether it is \nconstitutional for the U.S. Government to kill a U.S. citizen on U.S. \nsoil if he or she does not pose an imminent threat? Yet a third time \nthe answer was it wouldn't be appropriate.\n  Then, finally, when asked a fourth time, the Attorney General said: \nWhen I say ``appropriate,'' I mean it wouldn't be unconstitutional.\n  Finally, after asking four times, the Attorney General agreed.\n  My response to that questioning was: General Holder, I am very glad \nyou have stated that position. I emphatically agree with that position. \nI don't understand why it took such gymnastics to get to that position. \nI wish you had simply said that in response to Senator Paul now 2 days \nago. It would have been a very straightforward and simple thing to say.\n  What I also said to the Attorney General is Senator Paul and I have \ndrafted legislation which will make explicitly clear the U.S. \nGovernment may not kill a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil who does not pose \nan imminent threat.\n  I hope, based on the Attorney General's representations, the \nDepartment will support that legislation. That ought, in my judgment, \nbe legislation which should be bipartisan legislation that should pass \nthis body 100 to 0 because it is truly phrased with as unobjectionable \na legal truism as I could come up with.\n  I will admit I have been flabbergasted as these days have gone on why \nJohn Brennan, when asked by Senator Paul this question, did not simply \nsay no. Why didn't Eric Holder, when\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\nasked repeatedly, simply say no--at least not at the first. Why now, \nover 12 hours since this filibuster has proceeded, the White House has \nnot put in writing the absolutely correct statement of constitutional \nlaw the Federal Government cannot kill U.S. citizens on U.S. soil if \nthey do not pose imminent threats.\n  I would note, with the hypothetical that the Senator from Illinois \nposed to Senator Paul, even in that situation, Osama bin Laden was a \nhorrible enemy of the United States who committed a grievous act of \nterror and was the mastermind behind it. I am very glad that after a \ndecade-long manhunt, we were able to find him and we were able to, on a \nmilitary battlefield, take him out. I would suggest that if he were not \nin Pakistan, if he were living in an apartment in the suburbs of \nChicago, and if he were asleep in bed--and even if he were Osama bin \nLaden, a really, really, really bad guy--there is nothing in the \nConstitution that gives the Federal Government the authority to fire a \nmissile at an apartment with a sleeping person in it in the United \nStates of America if that individual was a U.S. citizen. And if he was \nin the United States, what we would do is what we would expect to do \nwith any other really, really, really bad guy, which is go in and \napprehend him.\n\n  Behind enemy lines, you can't always do that. There are things that \nhappen on the battlefield that we would never do at home. But I would \nsuggest that any argument that says someone sleeping at home in bed \npresents an imminent threat is an argument that stretches the bounds of \nthe word ``imminence'' beyond where its natural meaning should lie.\n  If an individual is pointing a bazooka at the Pentagon or robbing a \nbank or committing another crime of violence, there is no doubt that \nforce--and lethal force--can be used to stop that crime of violence. \nBut I think that there likewise should be no doubt that the Federal \nGovernment lacks the authority to kill U.S. citizens on U.S. soil if \nthere is no imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm.\n  So I am hopeful that the results of this extended discussion will be \nseveral. I am hopeful, No. 1, it will prompt the White House to do what \nthe White House has heretofore refused to do, which is, in writing, \nexplicitly answer the question posed by Senator Paul now over a week \nago and expressly state as the position of the United States of America \nthat the Federal Government cannot kill a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil if \nthat individual does not pose an imminent threat of death or grievous \nbodily harm.\n  I also hope that a consequence of this extended discussion is that we \nwill find widespread agreement in this body behind passing legislation \nto make clear that the Constitution does not allow such killings. I am \nhopeful that legislation will command wide support on the Republican \nside of the aisle but likewise wide support on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle.\n  I would hope for and would certainly welcome the support of the \nsenior Senator from Illinois and, indeed, every Member of the \nDemocratic caucus. And should this body come together in a bipartisan \nway or, even better, in a unanimous manner and clarify that the \nConstitution prohibits killing U.S. citizens on U.S. soil absent an \nimmediate threat, I would suggest this debate will have accomplished a \ngreat deal because it will have made clear the limits of the Executive \npower, and it would be, indeed, carrying out the finest traditions of \nthis body--serving as a check on unchecked government power.\n  So I would ask the Senator from Kentucky, does he agree that if those \nwere the outcomes of these proceedings, this would have indeed been a \nbeneficial proceeding for helping focus the American people on these \nissues and helping draw a line that the Executive cannot cross \nconsistent with the Constitution?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I am hopeful that we have drawn attention to \nthis issue; that this issue won't fade away; that the President will \ntomorrow come up with a response. I would like nothing more than to \nfacilitate the voting and the continuation of the debate tomorrow. I \nhope the President will respond to us. We have tried repeatedly \nthroughout the day, and we will see what the outcome of that is.\n  I would like to thank my staff for being here for a long day, for \ntheir help. I would like to thank fellow Senators for being supportive \nof this cause. I would like to thank the Members of Congress who came \nover to support this cause, as well as the clerks, the Capitol Police, \nthe staff of the Senate, the doorkeepers--who, apparently, I may have \ngotten in trouble--and anybody else who came to support us, and even \nthe senior Senator from Illinois, for better or worse, for being here \nto support the cause. The cause here is one that I think is important \nenough to have gone through this procedure.\n  I sit at Henry Clay's desk, and they call Henry Clay the ``Great \nCompromiser.'' When I came to Washington, one of my fellow Senators \nsaid to me: Oh, I guess you will be the great compromiser. I kind of \nsmiled at him and laughed. I learned a little bit about Henry Clay and \nhis career.\n  People think some of us won't compromise, but there are many \ncompromises. There are many things on which I am willing to split the \ndifference. If the Democrats will ever come to us and say: We will fix \nand we will save Social Security, what age we change it to, how fast we \ndo it--there are a lot of things on which we can split the difference. \nBut the issue we have had today is one on which we don't split the \ndifference. I think you don't get half of the fifth amendment. I don't \nthink you acknowledge that the President can obey the fifth amendment \nwhen he chooses. I don't think you acknowledge that the fifth \namendment, due process, can somehow occur behind closed doors.\n  So while I am a fan of Henry Clay, I have often said I am a fan of \nCassius Clay. Cassius Clay's weapons of choice were said to be his pen \nand his Bowie knife. He was said to be so good with the first, that he \noften had recourse to the latter. He was a fierce abolitionist. He \ndidn't suffer fools, and he didn't compromise often.\n  But what I would say is that it is worth fighting for what you \nbelieve in. I think the American people can tolerate a debate and a \ndiscussion. There has been nothing mean-spirited about this debate for \n12 hours. I think, in fact, more of it would be even better. I wish we \nhad more open and enjoined debate. The senior Senator from Illinois has \nbrought up good points, and I think there is much discussion. I just \nhope that this won't be swept under the rug and that this isn't the end \nof this but that it is the beginning of this.\n  I would go for another 12 hours to try to break Strom Thurmond's \nrecord, but I have discovered there are some limits to filibustering, \nand I am going to have to go take care of one of those in a few minutes \nhere. But I do appreciate the Senate's forbearance in this, and I hope \nthat if there are some on the other side of the aisle who have been \nlistening and feel they may agree on some of these issues, they will \nuse their ability to impact the President's decision and will, No. 1, \nsay the Senate should be trying to restrain the executive branch, \nRepublican or Democratic, and, No. 2, will use their influence to try \nto tell the President to do what I think really is in his heart, and \nthat is to say: Absolutely, we are not going to be killing Americans \nnot in a combat situation. We will obey the fifth amendment; that the \nconstitution does apply to all Americans and there are no exceptions.\n  I thank you very much for your forbearance, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). There will be order. Expressions \nof approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me first, on a personal note, thank \nthe Senator from Kentucky. He and I have agreed on many things and \nworked together on many more, and there is much common agreement on \nwhat we hope to achieve with this issue, as important as it is, and I \nthank him for his spirited defense of his position today in these 12 \nhours. I want to excuse him from the floor whenever he wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1226-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1226-S1227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NOMINATION OF JOHN OWEN BRENNAN TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL \n                          INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Grant saw an advertisement for the school and \nthought the program he enrolled in would give him the skills he needed \nto succeed in the workforce after he left the Marines. After enrolling \nat the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, Grant became concerned about the \nquality of the school. He started doing his own research about the \nschool, the program, and how many of the graduates actually got a job. \nWhat he realized was the program wasn't going to provide him with the \nskills that were promised. In fact, the jobs that his program would \nhave prepared him to do didn't even require a college degree.\n  Grant decided the program at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh was not \nworth his time or the Government's money--he was on the GI bill--so he \ndecided to transfer to a community college. The problem was none of his \ncredits from the Art Institute of Pittsburgh would transfer to any \nschool, not even to a community college. Although he received GI bill \nbenefits, those benefits did not cover the costs, all the costs of the \ninflated tuition of this Art Institute of Pittsburgh. After 1 year in \nthe program--1 year--Grant had borrowed $32,000 over and above his GI \nbill benefits. Now Grant is in debt with worthless college credits from \na for-profit school, the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. He is now \nattending a community college, learning the skills he needs to succeed. \nHe still is going to have to struggle to pay off $32,000 in debt to a \nfor-profit school that was a worthless experience. He says one-quarter \nof his paycheck goes to his loans and he is living paycheck to \npaycheck. He says he cannot save for anything and all his money goes \nfor student loans. He would save for retirement if he could.\n  Grant was lucky, in some ways. Many of his peers stay at for-profit \ncolleges and take on $70,000 or $80,000 or more in student loans, only \nlater to find out the education at these for-profit schools was \nvirtually worthless. Students also discover their credits will not \ntransfer. That ought to be the first question any student asks: If I go \nto your for-profit school, will any other school recognize my credits? \nIn this case the Art Institute of Pittsburgh would have had to answer \nno, and that might have given Grant some pause.\n  These students such as Grant are stuck with mortgage-sized debts and \nend up with no home to show for it and worthless college credits. Grant \nSchaffer's credits would not transfer because his school had a \ndifferent accreditation than even the community college he now attends.\n  It is a little known fact these for-profit schools do not reveal to \nstudents: The credits will not transfer anywhere because the school is \nnot accredited.\n  Our current accreditation system favors schools, not students. That \nis upside-down. Schools pay accreditors to accredit them, creating a \ncozy relationship that does not foster any real accountability. Once a \nschool is accredited, the Government dollars just flow in, but an \naccreditation is not always the guarantee of academic quality that most \nstudents believe it is and not all accreditations are equal.\n  The University of Phoenix, the largest university in the United \nStates, was recently told by its accrediting agency that the school \nwould be put on notice. The regional accreditor, the Higher Learning \nCommission, announced it had some real problems with the way the \nUniversity of Phoenix is running its business and treating its \nstudents. More accreditors, both regional and national, should take a \ncloser look at the schools they accredit and the standards used to \naccredit them.\n  How many more people have to go through the experience of Grant \nSchaffer? Essentially, this former Marine wasted his GI bill benefits \nand got into more debt than he can realistically manage and has nothing \nto show for it from a for-profit school. We need to look at the current \nsystem of accreditation, consider how for-profit schools are \naggressively recruiting our military, as well as using up the DOD \ntuition assistance benefits and veterans' GI bill benefits for low-\nincome students. We need to commit to reforming our current system to \nprotect our students and not to protect those who are in charge of the \nfor-profit schools. We need to direct taxpayers' dollars to affordable, \nmeaningful education that will literally help our men and women in \nuniform and students across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1227-4", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1227-S1228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LYMAN HUBBARD, SR.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last year, we lost a great American from \nmy hometown of Springfield, IL, and I rise today to pay tribute to him \nand his legacy.\n  Lyman Hubbard, Sr., grew up on a small farm near Springfield that had \nbeen in his family for 165 years--long enough that at one point the \nfamily's lawyer for the land was a local attorney named Abraham \nLincoln.\n  In high school, Mr. Hubbard was a member of the National Honor \nSociety, ran track, and played basketball and football. I have heard \nsomeone who knew him at the time say that he was ``the best athlete in \nSpringfield.'' And he was an Eagle Scout.\n  During World War II, before he had even graduated from high school, \nhe signed up to serve his country in the Air Force.\n  When he graduated from pilot training, he became the only person from \nSpringfield to join the Tuskegee Airmen the first African-American \nmilitary aviators in the U.S. Armed Forces. From there, he fought for \nboth our Nation and for racial equality. He logged more than 7,000 \nhours of flight time in the course of his multitour career, flying \nplanes from the B-25 bomber to the EC-121 Super Constellation. He flew \nthem well and became a leader among his peers, ultimately earning a \nBronze Star, an Air Medal with oak leaf clusters, the Air Force \nCommendation Medal, and a Vietnamese Honor Medal. Lyman Hubbard \naccomplished all of this despite the well-documented discrimination \nthat the Tuskegee Airmen faced.\n  The people of Springfield, and all of us, owe a great deal to Lyman \nHubbard, Sr., not just for his exceptional valor in combat but also for \nhis devotion to preserving the history of the city of Springfield.\n  When the Lincoln Colored Home, one of the first African-American \norphanages in the United States and a historic property, was at risk of \nbeing destroyed, Mr. Hubbard purchased the home outright to save it and \nplanned to turn it into a community center.\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\n  While we may have lost Lyman Hubbard, Sr., his legacy lives on.\n  Just last week, it was announced that his sons will donate a \ncollection of their father's medals, badges, and photographs so that we \ncan all have a chance to see them.\n  They will be displayed at the Abraham Lincoln Capitol Airport in \nSpringfield, and I hope that those of us who can will take the time to \nsee them and reflect on the life and heroism of Lyman Hubbard, Sr.\n  I know I will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1228-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BILL ROBERTSON\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise today to say a few words in honor of Bill \nRobertson, an extraordinary man from Rockford, IL, whom we recently \nlost to illness.\n  Bill Robertson was a public servant in the best sense of the term. \nFor the last few years, he was considered the voice of reason on the \nRockford, IL, City Council, but his service started well before his \nelection to the City Council.\n  After college, he served in the Marines before signing up for the \nRockford Fire Department. To put this another way, after serving in a \njob where he would have been under fire, he decided to take a job \nrunning into fires. It made sense to him, and he loved it.\n  He spent 36 years of his life in that fire department, rising to \ncommand the department's training academy. He will be remembered for \nalways knowing cadets by name and frequently checking in to see how \nrecruits were doing.\n  He did so well that in 1991 he was asked to be the ninth chief in the \nRockford Fire Department's 133-year history. He held that job for 17 \nyears, until he retired in 2008.\n  Retirement turned out to be short-lived for Bill Robertson. In 2009, \nhe was elected to the Rockford City Council, and he quickly became a \nleader there too.\n  His council colleagues recall that, even in a time of bitter and \noccasionally over-the-top politics, Robertson always strove for common \nground and acted as a voice of reason. Perhaps that is one of the \nreasons one of the many reasons so many people from the Rockford \ncommunity came to pay tribute and celebrate his life when he passed \naway. I am told there were hundreds of well-wishers in attendance, and \nI am sorry Loretta and I were not able to be there to pay our respects \nto this generous leader.\n  Each and every one of them were touched by the good work he did \nthroughout his life. He will not be forgotten, but he will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1228-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING DR. STEPHEN B. THACKER\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today in honor and memory of \nStephen B. Thacker, MD, MSc, RADM/ASG, retired, USPHS, who passed away \non Friday, February 15, 2013.\n  Dr. Thacker was a true public health hero whose long and \ndistinguished career at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nbegan as an Epidemic Intelligence Service, EIS officer in 1976. On his \nfirst day, he was sent out on an investigation of an unknown illness, \nwhich turned out to be the first recognized Legionnaire's epidemic. \nThroughout his 37 years at CDC, Dr. Thacker was a leader of public \nhealth science and the professionals who practice that science. \nPrograms under his leadership introduced thousands of professionals to \ncareers in public health and brought epidemiology directly into middle \nschool and high school classrooms. He was instrumental in launching the \nfield epidemiology training programs in more than 35 countries.\n  In all of the many position he held, Dr. Thacker was a steadfast \nchampion of epidemiology, public health surveillance, and the \ndevelopment of a global public health workforce. Programs developed or \nexpanded under his leadership have introduced thousands of \nprofessionals to careers in public health. Given all this, it is no \nsurprise that Dr. Thacker's accomplishments were recognized through \nmore than 40 major awards and commendations throughout his career, \nincluding the Surgeon General's Medallion, which he received just 2 \nweeks before his death.\n  Dr. Thacker's accomplishments were only exceeded by his treatment of \nall persons with dignity, honesty, and respect. His career has embodied \nthe best of CDC's commitment to science and, most importantly, to \nservice.\n  I offer my deep condolences to Dr. Thacker's family. Mr. President \nand colleagues, please join me in honoring the memory of Dr. Steve \nThacker. I believe there is no question that his important influence on \npublic health will continue well into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1228-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1228-S1229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WOODS EASTLAND\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Woods E. \nEastland of Indianola, MS, as the recipient of the 2012 Harry S. Baker \nDistinguished Service Award. The officers of the National Cotton \nCouncil of America recently selected Mr. Eastland to be the 27th \nrecipient of this award, which is given annually to the individual who \nhas contributed most significantly to the advancement of the U.S. \ncotton industry.\n  In bestowing this honor on Woods E. Eastland, the National Cotton \nCouncil cited his extraordinary leadership during his year as the \ncouncil's chairman and his continued service to the U.S. cotton \nindustry. The Harry S. Baker Distinguished Service Award was started in \nhonor of former council president Harry S. Baker, and it is the \nindustry's most prestigious award.\n  Woods E. Eastland is the chairman of the board of Staple Cotton \nCooperative Association and the Staple Cotton Discount Corporation, \nwhich are headquartered in Greenwood, MS. He served as their president \nand CEO from 1986 until 2010. A native of Doddsville, MS, Mr. Eastland \nearned a B.A. degree from Vanderbilt University and a J.D. degree from \nthe University of Mississippi School of Law. He practiced law and was a \nfaculty member of the Jackson School of Law from 1972 until 1974. In \n1974, Woods married Lynn Ganier Wood and became a cotton, soybean and \nrice grower in Sunflower County, MS. He and Lynn have two children and \nthree grandchildren.\n  Woods E. Eastland, in addition to being a farmer, has built a \nremarkable record of service to the cotton industry, his State and our \nNation. He is a past chairman of the National Cotton Council, past \npresident and chairman of Cotton Council International, and a past \ndirector of the Memphis Branch Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. He \nwas a member of the board of managers of the New York Board of Trade \nwhen it was formed from the merger of the Cotton and Coffee, Sugar and \nCocoa Exchanges. He served 1 year as the vice chairman of the board of \ngovernors of the New York Board of Trade.\n  In 2005, during Mr. Eastland's term as the council's chairman, \ninternational trade in cotton and textiles dominated the U.S. cotton \nindustry's policy concerns. In addition, the World Trade \nOrganization's, WTO, Doha Round of negotiations was a primary focus of \nthe cotton industry during Mr. Eastland's tenure as council chairman.\n  Under Mr. Eastland's leadership, the council worked as part of a \nfiber/textile/labor initiative that successfully convinced the United \nStates to self-initiate WTO-sanctioned textile safeguards to impose a \nmeasure of discipline on the shipment of Chinese textiles into our \ncountry. U.S. officials were also persuaded to make changes in \nprovisions of the Dominican Republic--Central America Free Trade \nAgreement that led to the U.S. cotton industry's support for \ncongressional approval of that pact.\n  Mr. Eastland traveled to Geneva and Washington, D.C., to confer with \nkey trade officials on trade developments and to convey the U.S. cotton \nindustry's message that cotton should not be singled out for different \ntreatment from the rest of agriculture in the WTO Doha negotiations.\n  Beyond his year of service as the Council chairman, Mr. Eastland has \nremained active in Council leadership. He was named chairman of the \ncouncil's Trade Promotion Authority task force in 2007 to guide the \nindustry on trade promotion policy. He is an advisor to the Council's \nboard of directors and an active member of its Operations Committee.\n  I am pleased to congratulate Mr. Eastland on receiving this \nprestigious award, and to commend him for his contributions to the \ncotton industry, American agriculture and fair trade.\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1229-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Manchin, Ms. \n             Warren, and Mr. Brown):\n       S. 468.

A bill to protect the health care and pension benefits of our \nnation's miners; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in West Virginia, we revere our \nminers--the men and women who put their lives on the line every single \nday to provide for their families and bring light and heat to millions. \nTheir grit, their courage and their determination are inspirational to \neach of us. The work they do every day provides nearly half of our \nNation with power and it helps underpin the economy of the State we \ncall home.\n  For their hard work in these grueling jobs mineworkers receive \npromised pensions and lifetime health benefits. Health care for all \nretirees is important. But, in many cases, it is even more so for \nretired miners, who have stared the possibility of injury or illness in \nthe face every day. Unfortunately, today there are looming threats to \nthe pensions of more than 100,000 mineworkers and to the healthcare \nbenefits of nearly 12,000 miners and their dependents.\n  The miners' pension fund is on the road to insolvency. It has been \nhit by the perfect storm--the recent financial crisis, the smaller \nnumber of active mineworkers who provide the funding base for the \npension plan, and the large number of ``orphans'' who receive their \npensions under the plan. These ``orphans'' are retired mineworkers for \nwhom a company no longer makes contributions to the pension fund, \ntypically because the company is out of business.\n  Additionally, the bankruptcy of one coal company is threatening the \nhealth benefits of nearly 12,000 miners and their dependents, the vast \nmajority of whom never worked for the company that is actually going \nbankrupt. So despite the fact that they were promised lifetime \nhealthcare benefits by their employers when they gave their lives to \nthis industry doing the hardest work imaginable under that sacred \npledge they are now losing those benefits because a company they never \nworked for is going bankrupt. That is unfair and unjust.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Coalfield Accountability and \nRetired Employee Act. This legislation protects pensions for more than \n100,000 mineworkers by taking excess funds from the Abandoned Mine Land \nReclamation Program and transferring that money to the miners' 1974 \npension plan. The Coalfield Accountability and Retired Employee Act \nalso would protect retiree health benefits by making any retiree who \nloses benefits following the bankruptcy or insolvency of his or her \nemployer eligible for the health benefits provided by the COAL Act. \nAnd, importantly this legislation would hold employers accountable for \nthe commitments they make to their workers. That is just basic \nfairness.\n  Supporting our Nation's miners is not a new issue for our country and \nit is not a new fight of mine. Dating back to President Harry Truman, \nthe Federal Government has assumed a responsibility to our mineworkers. \nIn 1992, I was deeply proud to work on the passage of the COAL Act, \nthrough which we recommitted to our miners that a promise made would be \na promise kept. That bill allowed the transfer of interest accruing to \nthe unappropriated balance of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to be \nused to provide health care for a large number of orphaned miners and \ntheir widows. This helped avert a nationwide coal strike and it \npreserved health benefits for 200,000 retired miners and their widows. \nThis Federal commitment was renewed in the 2006 amendments to the \nAbandoned Mine Reclamation Program that again protected the healthcare \nplans of miners from insolvency.\n  Now, 20 years after passing the COAL Act, I am again renewing my \ncommitment to the hardest working people I have ever known with the \nCoalfield Accountability and Retired Employee Act. We must preserve the \nsolvency of our miners' pension plans and protect the healthcare \nbenefits they need, earned and were rightfully promised. This is about \nhuman decency, it is about doing what is right, and it is about having \nthe backs of those who have ours deep underground.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Blunt):\n  S. 475.

A bill to amend the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Development Act \nto extend to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park \nCommission; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to reintroduce \nlegislation to support greater public involvement in the administration \nof one of Maryland's most treasured National Historical Parks. The \nChesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park Advisory Commission \nAct ensures that the communities located along the 184\\1/2\\ mile-long \nC Canal National Historical Park have a voice with the National Park \nService regarding decisions affecting the administration of the Park. \nThe Commission keeps the people and small businesses most affected by \nthe operation of the C Canal National Historical Park informed and \ninvolved in the decisions surrounding the Park. Citizen involvement in \nthe governmental process is a hallmark of our democracy and the C \nCanal National Historical Park Advisory Commission Act exemplifies the \ngoal of ensuring the public's role in government decision making.\n  The importance of the Commission is intrinsically tied to the \nuniqueness of the C Canal National Historical Park. The Park covers \nan area of 20,000 acres winding North and West along the Potomac River \nfrom the heart of Georgetown's old industrial district in Washington \nD.C. to Cumberland, MD nestled in the valleys and mountains of Western \nMaryland. The Park's watered canal, contiguous towpath, popular among \ncyclists, backpackers, day hikers and runners, hundreds of historic \nstructures and towns like Hancock, Hagerstown, Brunswick, Harpers \nFerry, Williamsport and Sharpsburg that grew during the Canal's heyday, \nall tell the story of how the C Canal once served as a crucial East/\nWest commercial link. The Park also preserves pristine views of the \nPotomac River, evocative of the C Canal's working days. At its widest \npoints, the C Canal National Historical Park spans less than two-\ntenths of a mile across and in many areas directly abuts neighboring \ncommercial and residential properties bordering the Park.\n  During the commercial operation of the C Canal, these towns were \nlocal commercial centers where area farmers and tradesman utilized the \ncanal boats to deliver their goods to market. Today, the hospitality \nand tourism industries of these communities thrive upon the C Canal \nNational Historical Park's popularity and are integral to enhancing the \npark user experience. Whether it is a hotel or Bed and Breakfast to \nspend the night in, a restaurant or diner to grab a meal, stores to \nshop in and perhaps stock up on camping provisions, boathouses to rent \na canoe for the afternoon, bike shops to service a flat tire or make \nrepairs to your bike or any of the myriad of goods and services park \nvisitors may need, the communities along the C Canal are as important \nto the Park user experience as the Park's users are to maintaining \ntheir businesses.\n  In 2009, more than 3.75 million people visited the C Canal National \nHistorical Park. To put it in perspective, in 2009, more people visited \nthis historic treasure than the number of people who visited \nYellowstone, Yosemite, the Everglades or Shenandoah National Park. Much \nof the C Canal National Historical Park's success is attributable to \nthe positive relationship that has developed over time between the \nNational Park Service and the local community leaders that span the \nlength of the Park. The Park's Commission has greatly facilitated this \nrelationship.\n  The Commission provides the vital link between the affected \ncommunities that the Park runs through and the National Park Service. \nThe Commission ensures that the public is engaged in the numerous \nprocesses surrounding operational policy and infrastructure maintenance \nand restoration projects on the C Canal National Historic Park. The \nCommission plays a vital consultation and planning role for park \nactivities and operations. The cooperation that has developed between \nthe Commission and the National Park Service helps tie the Park to its \ncommunities. The Commission serves a purely advisory function and does \nnot have the authority to make binding park policy.\n  The Commission was first established as part of the 1971 Chesapeake \nand Ohio Canal Development Act sponsored by Rep. Gilbert Gude, R-MD. \nEvery ten years, a bill like mine comes before Congress, when the 10-\nyear extension of the Commission's authorization expires. Three times \nover a 40-year period extension bills have passed by unanimous consent \nand without controversy. My bill is another 10-year extension of the \nAdvisory Commission's authorization and makes no changes to the \nCommission's authority. Legislative precedent has never set an \nauthorization amount for the Commission, but the Commission has always \nfunctioned at a nominal cost.\n  The General Services Administration's Federal Advisory Commissions \nAct database determined that the C Canal Advisory Commission's \nexpenses totaled $33,199 for fiscal year 2010. All expenses came out of \nthe National Park Service's general operating budget. Expenses covered \nthe cost of travel for commission members, $295, Federal staff time, \n$28,074, and miscellaneous expenses, $4,830, like meeting space, \nprinting, supplies and website maintenance.\n  The National Park System is a showcase of America's natural and \nhistorical treasures. So much of the National Park System's success is \nrooted in the citizen stewardship projects and the involvement of \ncaring citizens and community leaders. Like so many of our National \nParks the C Canal National Historical Park has an extensive backlog \nof maintenance and repair projects. The Commission plays a critical \nrole in helping keep these projects moving forward and assisting the \nNational Park Service with their completion because there is \nrecognition of the shared responsibility between the Park Service and \nthe Commission about the importance of continuing to make the Park a \ndesirable tourism and outdoor recreation destination. The Commission \nprovides that bridge between the government and public. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1233]]\n\n                                 S. 476\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CHESAPEAKE AND OHIO CANAL NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK \n                   COMMISSION.\n\n       Section 6(g) of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Development \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 410y-4(g)) is amended by striking ``40'' and \n     inserting ``50''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 477. A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to modify a \nprovision relating to gaming on land acquired after October 17, 1988; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Tribal \nGaming Eligibility Act.\n  This bill sets forth what I believe is a very reasonable, moderate \nstandard for where tribes are allowed to open gaming establishments.\n  The standard is simple: a tribe must demonstrate that it has a modern \nand an aboriginal connection to the land before it can open a gaming \nestablishment on it.\n  The new standard is needed because too many tribes in California and \nacross the nation are ``reservation shopping''. They look for a \nprofitable casino location, and then seek to put that land in trust \nregardless of their historical ties to the area.\n  To be clear, most tribes do not fit this mold. Most play by the rules \nand acquire land in appropriate locations.\n  But as wealthy Las Vegas casino interests search for ways to expand \ntheir gaming syndicates, the problem is getting worse. These syndicates \nhave no interest in preserving native cultures and they have little \ninterest in pursuing other forms of economic development; so they also \nhave little interest in limiting casinos to bone fide historical tribal \nlands.\n  The tragic part is that these casinos are going up despite objections \nfrom communities and other Native American tribes. That is why I am \nintroducing the Tribal Gaming Eligibility Act.\n  This legislation addresses the problems that arise from off \nreservation casinos by requiring that tribes meet two simple conditions \nbefore taking land into trust for gaming:\n  First the tribe must demonstrate a ``substantial direct modern \nconnection to the land.''\n  Second, the tribe must demonstrate a ``substantial direct aboriginal \nconnection to the land.''\n  Simply put, tribes must show that both they, and their ancestors, \nhave a connection to the land in question.\n  California voters thought they settled the question of reservation \nshopping in 2000 when Proposition 1A authorized the Governor to \nnegotiate gambling compacts with tribes, provided that gaming only \noccurred ``on Indian lands.''\n  The words ``on Indian lands'' were critical. This made clear that \ngaming is appropriate only on a tribe's historical lands, and voters \nendorsed this bargain with 65 percent of the vote.\n  But fast-forward 12 years and this agreement is being put to the \ntest. More than 100 new Las Vegas style casinos have opened in the \nState in the last 12 years.\n  Unfortunately things aren't slowing down; the Department of the \nInterior has approved three extremely controversial new casinos just \nlast year, some nowhere near the tribe's aboriginal territory or \ncurrent reservation.\n  When given the opportunity voters have rejected the idea of \nreservation shopping. Two years ago in Richmond, CA, a tribe proposed \ntaking land into trust at Point Molate to open a 4,000-slot-machine \nmega-casino. Proponents touted it as a major economic engine for a \ndepressed area.\n  But the voters of Richmond knew the reality was far different. The \nproject threatened to burden state and local government services, and \nit threatened to irreparably change the character of the community.\n  So Richmond voters made it clear how they felt by overwhelmingly \nrejecting the advisory measure by a margin of 58 to 42. Voters also \nelected two new city council members who strongly opposed the casino. \nIt was an unambiguous rejection of this reservation shopping proposal.\n  Fortunately the Department of the Interior rejected the misguided \nPoint Molate proposal. But voters in Yuba County were not so lucky.\n  In 2005, Yuba County voters had an opportunity to weigh in on a \ncasino in this mostly rural and suburban Northern California community. \nBy a margin of 52-48, voters rejected the proposal. Many cited concerns \nabout crime as a reason they opposed the project.\n  But after the dust settled, the Department of the Interior decided to \nmove forward with the project anyway. Despite the fact that voters \nrejected it and only one of the 21 public officials in the area polled \non the issue expressed support for the project.\n  Moreover, the Department's claim that even one local official \nsupported the project is dubious. The so-called support is based on a \nMemorandum of Understanding the County entered into prior to the \nadvisory election. The county never offered a letter of support when \nconsulted and still has not to this day.\n  As a former mayor, I know the financial pressures that local \ngovernments face, especially in these tough times. The temptation to \nsupport large casinos, with the promises of hundreds of construction \njobs, can be strong.\n  But I also know the heavy price that society pays for the siren song \nof gambling. This price includes addiction and crime, strained public \nservices and increased traffic congestion.\n  Some Indian gaming proponents and their out of state gaming syndicate \nbackers would have us believe that these off-reservation gaming \nestablishments are a sign of growth and economic development.\n  But a 2006 report, titled Gambling in the Golden State, paints a \ndifferent picture. The report compiled a comprehensive body of research \non the effects of casinos on their surrounding communities. The results \nwere staggering.\n  New casinos are associated with a 10 percent increase in violent \ncrime and a 10 percent increase in bankruptcy rates.\n  New casinos are also associated with an increase in law enforcement \nexpenditures of $15.34 per resident.\n  California spends an estimated $1 billion to deal with problem-\ngamblers and pathological-gamblers, 75 percent of which identify Indian \ncasinos as their primary gambling preference.\n  The report confirms what many local elected officials and community \nactivists already know: casinos come at a tremendous cost.\n  Some have tried to mischaracterize my legislation. They have said it \nlimits the sovereignty of tribes or it destroys the ability to \nundertake economic development.\n  But I am here today to say that nothing could be farther from the \ntruth.\n  The bill preserves the right of tribes to acquire trust land in any \nlocation, provided they secure the approval of the Governor and meet \nthe strict two-part determination standards.\n  The bill puts no limits on where a tribe can acquire land for any \npurpose other than gaming.\n  Because the fact of the matter is that most casinos are appropriately \nplaced, on historical tribal lands, and there is no need to argue about \nthe legitimacy of these establishments.\n  My legislation only deals with those proposals that are truly beyond \nthe scope of Congressional intent when the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \nwas passed in 1988.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 478. A bill to clarify that the revocation of an alien's visa or \nother documentation is not subject to judicial review; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, back in 2003, the Government \nAccountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, issued a \nreport that revealed that suspected terrorists could stay in the \ncountry after their visas had been revoked on grounds of terrorism \nbecause of a legal loophole in the wording of revocation papers. The \nGAO shed light on a serious problem in our visa policies that posed a \nthreat to our national security. The GAO found that many individuals \nwere granted visas, but later, the FBI and intelligence community \nsuspected ties of terrorism. The FBI didn't share the derogatory \ninformation with our consular officers in\n\n[[Page S1234]]\n\ntime. Consular officers had one tool at their disposal, and that was to \nrevoke the visas. But, many of the individuals had made it to the \nUnited States.\n  What the GAO found was that even though the visas were revoked, \nimmigration officials couldn't do a thing about it because the \nrevocation didn't go into effect until after the alien departed. They \nwere handicapped from locating the visa holders and deporting them. \nToday, our immigration agents may not be able to locate the individual \neven if they could deport them.\n  The GAO report opened our eyes and showed us how revocations were not \nbeing used effectively, and how terrorists could exploit a loophole to \nstay in the country. Since the GAO report was issued, I have attempted \nto plug this hole in the system. Today I am reintroducing a bill to \ngive the Department of Homeland Security a critical tool that allows \nthe Secretary to issue revocations and remove aliens from the United \nStates without the hurdles they currently face.\n  Let me elaborate. Under current law, visas approved or denied by \nconsular officers abroad are non-reviewable. We give our consular \nofficers great latitude to protect the country and make a determination \nif an applicant is eligible for admission into the United States. This \nis known as consular non-reviewability. In 1950, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, in Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, determined that ``it is \nnot within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by \nlaw, to review the determination of the political branch of the \nGovernment to exclude a given alien.''\n  Justice Minton, in his decision, stated, ``At the outset we wish to \npoint out that an alien who seeks admission to this country may not do \nso under any claim of right. Admission of aliens to the United States \nis a privilege granted by the sovereign United States Government. Such \nprivilege is granted to an alien only upon such terms as the United \nStates shall prescribe. It must be exercised in accordance with the \nprocedure which the United States provides.''\n  The doctrine of non-reviewability is a long-standing one that allows \nthe Department of State to keep foreign nationals from entering the \nUnited States. But, the doctrine should be applied in instances when a \nperson is granted a visa, enters in the country, and the Government \nsubsequently revokes that visa.\n  There are some national security implications at stake. The ability \nto deport an alien on U.S. soil with a revoked visa is nearly \nimpossible today if the alien is given the opportunity to appeal the \nrevocation. So, in effect, the State Department doesn't use their \nauthority to revoke. In fact, I am told they aren't doing it at all \nwhen the alien, even a potential terrorist, is in the country. They \nneed a change so that foreign nationals are not able to freely roam our \ncommunities when they shouldn't be here in the first place.\n  Secretary Chertoff, former Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity agreed that the policy needed to be changed. When Secretary, \nhe said,\n\n       The fact is that we can prevent someone who's coming in as \n     a guest. We can say, ``You can't come in overseas,'' but once \n     they come in, if they abuse their terms and conditions of \n     their coming in, we have to go through a cumbersome process. \n     That strikes me as not particularly sensible. People who are \n     admitted as guests like guests in my house--if the guest \n     misbehaves, I just tell them to leave; they don't get to go \n     to court over it.\n\n  What's more, allowing judicial review of revoked visas, especially on \nterrorism grounds, could jeopardize the classified intelligence that \nled to the revocation. It can force agencies such as the FBI and CIA to \nbe hesitant to share information. Why would our intelligence community \nshare information with the State Department if they knew State wouldn't \nrevoke a visa when the alien is in the U.S.? Current law could be \nreversing our progress on information sharing. Intelligence officials \nneed to share information with immigration and consular officers to \nprevent terrorists from entering the United States and to impede their \nmobility.\n  My bill would give the U.S. Government the ability to expedite the \ndeportation of suspected terrorists by applying the same ``non-\nreviewability'' standard for revocation decisions. It would treat \nrevocations similar to visa denials. My bill gives the Federal \nGovernment the ability to deport an alien who has already entered the \nUnited States but shouldn't have ever been granted a visa.\n  Terrorists took advantage of our system before 9/11. We can't let \nthat happen again. We should not allow potential terrorists and others \nwho act counter to our laws to remain on U.S. soil and run to the \ncourts and seek relief from deportation. We need to ensure that the \ngovernment has all the tools at its disposal to keep the homeland safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Portman, and Mr. \n        Pryor):\n  S. 479.

Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Small \nBusiness Efficiency Act with my colleagues Senators Nelson, Portman, \nand Pryor. Many small businesses rely on Professional Employer \nOrganization, PEOs, and to handle many of their human resources \nresponsibilities. The Small Business Efficiency Act will provide an \nimportant layer of certainty and protection for small business owners \nand their workers by eliminating any ambiguity about a certified PEOs \nability to assume employment tax responsibility. It further implements \nsafeguards for the certified PEOs small business clients. This will \ngive small businesses peace of mind that their human resources and \nemployment tax responsibilities are taken care of so they can focus on \ntheir core business and create more jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this common sense legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Sanders, and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 482. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nprotections for consumers against excessive, unjustified, or unfairly \ndiscriminatory increases in premium rates; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we have made great strides in \nimproving the accountability of health insurance companies and \nprotecting consumers from egregious practices. However, despite the \nprogress we have made, many States still lack the ability to regulate \nexcessive health insurance rate increases.\n  Health insurance premiums in the individual and small group market \ncontinue to grow beyond the rate of medical inflation. The Affordable \nCare Act has brought greater scrutiny to the market and we've seen some \ngreat progress. In fact, the number of requested increases in health \ninsurance premiums beyond 10 percent comprised 75 percent of rate \nfilings in 2010, and that has declined to 34 percent in 2012. This is a \nlarge step forward but without closing the remaining loophole not all \nconsumers will be able to benefit from protection from unreasonable \nrate increases. Health insurance companies will continue to do what \nthey have done for far too long: put their profits ahead of people. \nRapidly escalating insurance costs strain businesses, families, and \nindividuals.\n  Currently, 15 States still have little or no authority to block or \nmodify unreasonable rate increases in the individual and small group \nmarkets. This means that even when the state's insurance regulators \nfind a rate increase to be excessive, they do not have the ability to \nblock or modify the increase. The Health Insurance Rate Review Act \ncreates a Federal fallback for States currently lacking this authority. \nThis will create parity across the country and give greater consistency \nof review and accountability for insurance companies seeking to raise \nrates beyond what is reasonable.\n  This legislation is a simple, commonsense solution: for States where \nthe insurance commissioner does not have or use authority to block \nunreasonable rate increases, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \ncan do so.\n  Affordability is vital to insuring access to quality health care. A \n2010 survey by the Commonwealth Fund found\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\nthat 70 percent of people with a health problem found it difficult or \nimpossible to find affordable coverage on the individual market. This \nproblem goes beyond the increased cost of overall medical care. From \nthe year 2000 to 2010, average premiums for family coverage increased \nby 117 percent, compared to medical inflation which rose close to 49 \npercent.\n  Insurance premiums make up a higher percentage of household income \nthan ever before, increasing around three times faster than wages are. \nThis means that more and more families have to choose between health \ncare and daily living expenses, saving for retirement, and education. \nThis is unacceptable, and more must be done to protect consumers.\n  The Affordable Care Act made important steps forward in defining the \nrate review process and making rate increases and reviews public \ninformation. This has improved transparency but falls short of creating \na strong rate review system in all States, and relies too heavily on \nthe notion that public disclosure of rates will cause insurance \ncompanies to change their behavior every time they should.\n  I believe there needs to be a Federal fallback in states that lack \nthe legal authority, capacity, or resources to conduct strong rate \nreview.\n  In some States, like California, companies are not required to go \nthrough prior approval before rate increases go into effect. This means \nthat when the California Insurance Commissioner finds rate increases to \nbe unreasonable and excessive, he has no authority to actually stop or \nmodify the increases to consumers. California is facing double digit \nrate hikes again this year and this legislation would help prevent such \nexcessive increases.\n  Earlier this year the California Insurance Commissioner found a rate \nincrease by Anthem Blue Cross to be unreasonable and the company \ndecided to proceed anyway. This affected around 250,000 small business \npolicy holders who saw an increase of around 10.6 percent, and when \ncombined with previous increases the average rate hike over two years \nreaches 19.5 percent.\n  In 2012, proposed rate increases across nine States by the John Alden \nLife Insurance Company and Time Insurance Company were found to be \nunreasonable but went forward anyway. These increases varied from a 12 \npercent increase in Louisiana to a 24 percent increase in Wisconsin. \nThese increases in the individual and small group market also affected \nArizona, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Virginia, and Wyoming.\n  In some States, insurance commissioners already have this authority \nand are using it to protect consumers. This bill doesn't touch what \nthey are doing.\n  In New York, because state regulators have the authority to modify \nrates, the average individual market increase for 2013 is four and a \nhalf percent instead of the initial request of a nine and a half \npercent increase.\n  In 2011, the Connecticut Insurance Department found an increase of \nnearly 13 percent by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield to be excessive, \nand approved a four percent increase instead.\n  Also in 2011, some North Dakota consumers on the individual health \ninsurance market were facing a nearly 30 percent increase before state \nregulators stepped in and decreased the proposed hikes by almost half.\n  I strongly believe that we need to take action to strengthen the law \nso all consumers get the protection of effective health insurance rate \nreview. I appreciate working with Representative Schakowsky, who is \nsponsoring the House companion bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Health Insurance \nRate Review Act to stand up for American families struggling to pay for \nhealth coverage. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this \nimportant issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 483. A bill to designate the Berryessa Snow Mountain National \nConservation Area in the State of California, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Berryessa \nSnow Mountain National Conservation Area Act. Congressman Mike Thompson \nand I introduced this legislation in the 112th Congress, and I am glad \nto continue working on this effort with him in this new Congress.\n  This important legislation designates close to 350,000 acres of \npublic lands in Lake, Mendocino, Napa, Solano, and Yolo Counties as the \nBerryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area, or NCA. The area is \na haven for hiking, camping, rafting, and horseback riding, and is home \nto a diverse array of wildlife including black bears and bald eagles.\n  My bill does not add any new lands to the Federal Government, the \nlands included in this NCA are already managed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the U.S. Forest Service and \nit does not apply to state or private lands. A National Conservation \nArea designation will require these three agencies to develop a multi-\nagency management plan in consultation with stakeholders and the \npublic, improving coordination on wildlife preservation, habitat \nrestoration, and recreational opportunities. Creation of the NCA will \nalso help the agencies take a more coordinated approach to preventing \nand fighting wildfires, combating invasive species and water pollution, \nand stopping the spread of illegal marijuana growth.\n  By unifying these individual places under one banner, my bill helps \nput the Berryessa Snow Mountain region on the map as a destination for \nnew visitors. This region is one of the most biologically diverse, yet \nleast known regions of California. By raising its profile, an NCA \ndesignation will boost tourism and increase business opportunities in \nthe region's gateway communities. The Outdoor Industry Association has \nestimated that outdoor recreation supports 732,000 jobs and contributes \n$85.4 billion annually in consumer spending to California's economy, \nunderscoring the immense potential of sites such as the proposed \nBerryessa Snow Mountain NCA to drive local economic growth. \nAdditionally, the region will become recognized by more people as \nuniform signage and publications are created to reach more diverse \naudiences, allowing them to learn more about this beautiful area.\n  Creation of this proposed National Conservation Area has strong \nsupport from a large coalition of local governments, elected officials, \nbusiness owners, landowners, farmers, private individuals, and many \nconservation and recreation groups. This bill is the culmination of a \ngrassroots effort of concerned citizens taking the initiative to care \nfor the beautiful areas in their communities, and I am proud to support \ntheir work and commitment.\n  The Berryessa Snow Mountain region deserves national status and \nrecognition, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Enzi, \n        Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Blunt, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 484. A bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act relating to \nlead-based paint renovation and remodeling activities; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lead \nExposure Reduction Amendments Act of 2013.\n  In April 2010, an EPA rule governing work done in homes constructed \nbefore 1978 took effect. The aim of this rule is to protect at-risk \npopulations, defined as pregnant women and children under the age of \nsix, from harmful lead paint dust particles that may be generated \nduring home construction, rehabilitation, and remodeling work. While \nlead paint was generally discontinued from in-home use in the 1960s and \n1970s, the rule applies to all homes built before 1978 and requires all \ncontractors to be certified by the EPA and be supervised by an EPA \ncertified renovator while following rigorous and costly safe lead work \npractices.\n  Some of these requirements include sealing off the area where the \nrenovation is occurring; removing all objects from the work area; \ncovering any porous work areas with smooth, cleanable areas; using \nspecial tools that have emission exhaust controls; vacuuming all items, \nincluding people's clothes, who leave the work space; and generally \ncleaning the work area to ensure there is no dust following completion \nof the job.\n  I believe everyone in this chamber stands strongly behind the intent \nof the rule, which is to protect children\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\nand pregnant women from the harmful effects of lead. With 20 kids and \ngrandkids, I appreciate the importance of the rule, and the potential \nit has to further decrease lead exposure. But this rule does add \nsignificant cost to the completion of renovation jobs and adds \nsignificant regulatory hurdles to many small business owners in \nsituations where it may not at all be necessary.\n  Fortunately, the original rule included an opt-out provision for \nhomeowners who did not have any at-risk individuals living in their \nhomes. Provided the contractor made them aware of the potential lead-\npaint risks, the homeowner could give the contractor permission to \ncarry out the job without following the EPA's lead safe work practices. \nThis makes sense because the health issues caused by renovation work in \nhomes with lead paint are minor for adults and older children who are \nnot members of the at-risk population.\n  But in July 2010, just three months after the rule took effect, the \nEPA removed this opt-out provision. By doing this, EPA more than \ndoubled the number of homes requiring safe work practices and increased \nthe economy-wide cost of compliance by well more than $336 million by \nEPA's own estimate, which is significantly less than reality.\n  Further, EPA has failed to meet the requirements of its own rule \nbecause there are no commercially available lead paint test kits. Test \nkits would allow contractors to see whether work spaces include any \nlead paint, and if none is detected then the contractor would not have \nto follow lead safe work practices, which makes sense. Unfortunately, \nthe test kits that are currently available produce 60-percent false \npositives, requiring many homeowners to pay significantly more for home \nremodeling work, even though there may not be any lead to protect them \nfrom.\n  The bill I'm introducing today is simple. It would first require the \nEPA to restore the opt-out provision. If homeowners have no residents \nwho are at-risk to lead paint contamination, then they should be able \nto waive the regulatory requirement.\n  The bill will also suspend the rule for homes built after 1960 if the \nEPA does not develop workable test kits, unless those homes include \nmembers of the at-risk population. The bill would also provide a de \nminimis exemption for first-time paperwork violations against \ncontractors. The EPA has focused its enforcement efforts on these \nviolations despite the fact that the contractors may be appropriately \nfollowing safe lead practices.\n  Finally, the bill prohibits EPA from expanding this regulation to \ncommercial and public buildings until it has completed a study to \ndetermine the risk of such practices. EPA is in the process of writing \nthese regulations even though it has not yet completed the \ncorresponding study. If there is no risk, why would EPA issue \nregulations? They would be a solution in search of a problem. EPA needs \nto do its due diligence and determine whether there would be any \nmeaningful health benefits from extending this rule to other areas.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate my dedication to the cause of \nprotecting the health of vulnerable populations, and particularly \npregnant women and children. But it is important for EPA's regulations \nto be pursued in a way that make sense, and that is what my bill \nintends to do. This is an ongoing goal of mine as a senior member of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 484\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 6\n\n       Whereas the United States enjoys broadcasting and sound \n     recording industries that are the envy of the world, due to \n     the symbiotic relationship that has existed among those \n     industries for many decades;\n       Whereas, for more than 80 years, Congress has rejected \n     repeated calls by the recording industry to impose a \n     performance fee on local radio stations for simply playing \n     music on the radio, as such a fee would upset the mutually \n     beneficial relationship between local radio and the recording \n     industry;\n       Whereas local radio stations provide free publicity and \n     promotion to the recording industry and performers of music \n     in the form of radio air play, interviews with performers, \n     introduction of new performers, concert promotions, and \n     publicity that promotes the sale of music, concert tickets, \n     ring tones, music videos, and associated merchandise;\n\n[[Page S1238]]\n\n       Whereas committees in the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives have previously reported that ``the sale of \n     many sound recordings and the careers of many performers have \n     benefitted considerably from airplay and other promotional \n     activities provided by both noncommercial and advertiser-\n     supported, free over-the-air broadcasting'';\n       Whereas local radio broadcasters provide tens of thousands \n     of hours of essential local news and weather information \n     during times of national emergencies and natural disasters, \n     such as on September 11, 2001, and during Hurricanes Katrina \n     and Rita, as well as public affairs programming, sports, and \n     hundreds of millions of dollars worth of time for public \n     service announcements and local fund raising efforts for \n     worthy charitable causes, all of which are jeopardized if \n     local radio stations are forced to divert revenues to pay for \n     a new performance fee;\n       Whereas there are many thousands of local radio stations \n     that will suffer severe economic hardship if any new \n     performance fee is imposed, as will many other small \n     businesses that play music including bars, restaurants, \n     retail establishments, sports and other entertainment venues, \n     shopping centers, and transportation facilities; and\n       Whereas the hardship that would result from a new \n     performance fee would hurt businesses in the United States, \n     and ultimately the consumers in the United States who rely on \n     local radio for news, weather, and entertainment, and such a \n     performance fee is not justified when the current system has \n     produced the most prolific and innovative broadcasting, \n     music, and sound recording industries in the world: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress should not impose any new \n     performance fee, tax, royalty, or other charge relating to \n     the public performance of sound recordings on a local radio \n     station for broadcasting sound recordings over the air, or on \n     any business for such public performance of sound recordings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/06/senate-section/article/S1238-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n        committee on homeland security and governmental affairs\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.
