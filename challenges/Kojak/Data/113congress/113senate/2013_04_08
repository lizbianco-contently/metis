Madam President, I would like to welcome back the Presiding \nOfficer and all the staff. I hope our 2-week Easter break was \nrefreshing to everyone.\n  This month, the Senate will deal with a number of important matters, \nincluding judicial nominations and Cabinet nominations and a water \nresources measure.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  The Senate will also consider a package of legislation designed to \nsafeguard Americans from gun violence.\n  In the wake of last year's terrible tragedy in Newtown, CT--a mass \nshooting we will never forget and that claimed the lives of 20 little, \ntiny boys and girls and 6 educators--I said shortly thereafter I would \nbring antiviolence measures to the Senate, and we are going to do that. \nIt is time Congress engaged in a meaningful conversation and a \nthoughtful debate on how to change the law and culture that allowed \nthis violence to grow so much.\n  I have said every idea should be debated and every issue should get a \nvote. From better mental health treatment, more secure schools, \nstronger background checks, banning assault weapons, the size of \nmagazines or clips, and other issues, these ideas should get a vote. \nThere are strong feelings and deep disagreements about some of these \nmeasures, but every one of these measures deserves a vote, a yes or a \nno--no hiding, no running from an issue that has captivated America.\n  There is no better place than in the Senate to begin a national \nconversation about such critical issues, even if they are divisive \nissues. We shouldn't stifle debate, run from tough issues or avoid \ndifficult choices. This body--the world's greatest deliberative body--\nhas a proud tradition of such robust and constructive debate.\n  I am deeply troubled a number of my Republican colleagues went so far \nas to send me a letter saying: We will agree to nothing. There will be \nno debate. There will be nothing. We want the Senate to do zero on \nanything dealing with stricter gun measures. They don't even want to \nlet us vote.\n  This flies in the face of a Senate tradition of spirited discussion \nthat began in the first days of this institution. There is simply no \nreason for this blatant obstruction except for the fear of considering \nantiviolence proposals in full view. Yet many Senate Republicans seem \nafraid to even engage in this debate--to have amendments to strengthen \nthe legislation or, if they want, to offer amendments to weaken what \nthe law is today.\n  In short, let's have a debate on violence in America. I repeat: Many \nSenate Republicans seem afraid to even engage in this debate. Shame on \nthem.\n  The least Republicans owe the parents of these 20 little babies who \nwere murdered at Sandy Hook is a thoughtful debate about whether \nstronger laws could have saved their little girls and boys. The least \nRepublicans owe them is a vote.\n  The least Republicans owe the families and friends of those gunned \ndown at a movie theater in Colorado and a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and \na shopping mall in Oregon and every day on the streets of American \ncities is a meaningful conversation about how to change America's \nculture of violence. The least Republicans owe America is a vote.\n  The legislation on the floor would keep guns out of the hands of \nconvicted criminals and safeguard the most vulnerable Americans--our \nchildren.\n  This proposal is supported by 9 out of 10 Americans. Background \nchecks, 9 out of 10--90 percent of Americans--believe we should do \nsomething, and I get a letter from a group of Republicans saying: Don't \ntouch it. We don't want anything to do with it.\n  It flies in the face of what 90 percent of Americans want. If \nRepublicans disagree with the measure, let them vote against it. One of \nmy Democratic colleagues said: Here are some of the things I want to \nvote against. Good. They are free to vote against it. If they don't \nlike the laws that now exist in America, offer an amendment to make it \nweaker or stronger, depending on how they look at it. They shouldn't \nshut down debate or prevent us from voting on many thoughtful proposals \nto curb violence.\n  On issue after issue, Republicans have called for a return to so-\ncalled regular order. They come to the Senate floor saying let's return \nto regular order. They ask for the opportunity to offer amendments. \nThey have called for free and open debate in the Senate. Those who have \nbeen yelling the most for this free and open debate are the people who \nsent me a letter saying: We are going to filibuster everything relating \nto guns. Talk about speaking out of both sides of their mouth. This is \nthe poster child of that.\n  When they encounter an issue they are afraid to debate in full public \nview, they want to thwart debate altogether. They have threatened to \nfilibuster this legislation which was passed out of committee under \nregular order. That is what they said they wanted. They have threatened \nto block debate on this measure, to which they are able to offer \namendments.\n  I am happy to see a few reasonable Republicans who have stated \npublicly they are willing to engage in an important conversation on \nthis issue. They have urged their more extreme colleagues not to resort \nto the same tired tactics of obstruction. But it will take more than 1 \nor 2 or 3 reasonable Republicans to ensure the families of 30,000 \nAmericans killed by guns each year get the respectful debate they \ndeserve.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Unfortunately, the type of Republican obstruction that could prevent \nthe Senate from debating and voting on antiviolence legislation is \nnothing new. For the last few years, Republicans have practically \nground the work of the Senate to a halt. Republicans have filibustered \ncountless job creation measures. Since President Obama took office, \nRepublicans have systematically slow-walked or blocked scores and \nscores of judicial executive branch nominations, including even--for \nthe first time in the history of our country--the nomination of the \nSecretary of Defense who, by the way is a former Republican Senator. \nPending nominees have waited an average of 1 year for a Senate vote--\nalmost 1 year, about 280 days.\n  Republicans have openly filibustered 57 of President Obama's \nnominees, but they have secretly stopped scores and scores of \nnominations by secret holds and procedural hurdles. Republicans have \njammed executive branch nominees even when they have no objection to \nthe nominee's qualifications, just to eat up valuable floor time.\n  I am concerned about this dysfunction, but I am not the only one. \nVirtually every American thinks this is foolish, the way things are \ngoing. The Nation is watching the Senate to see whether we will ever \nfunction efficiently again. They are watching.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues will work with Democrats going \nforward to prove the Senate is not completely broken.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/08/senate-section/article/S2440-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2440-S2449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SAFE COMMUNITIES, SAFE SCHOOLS ACT OF 2013--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       CMS Financial Information\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, it is said that information is the \nmost valuable commodity. In politics you probably know that information \nis power. The bigger government gets, the more valuable government \ninformation becomes to financial markets. This is especially true of \ninformation from agencies such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices. It is that agency that my remarks are about.\n  CMS controls $748 billion in government spending per year. That is \nbillions with a B. Today, there are questions surrounding CMS's ability \nto safeguard nonpublic information. This is not about secrecy in \ngovernment, it is about government secrets having an impact on the \nstock market.\n  This is not the first time I have raised similar questions with the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services. In 2011 I received \ninformation from a whistleblower that CMS employees were spending large \namounts of time in meetings with Wall Street executives. I wrote to CMS \nwith these concerns. The response I received was very troubling. CMS \ncould not tell us how many meetings were taking place with these Wall \nStreet executives. CMS could not tell us who from Wall Street was in \nthese meetings. CMS could not tell us how much time they spent with \nthese executives.\n  In fact, the only thing CMS could tell us was that it did not track \nany of this information. Private businesses have stiff controls over \naccess to nonpublic information, the same sort of stiff controls the \nFederal Government ought to employ for things that would impact the \nmarket and give somebody an extraordinary opportunity the average \ncitizen does not have.\n  The only specific step that CMS took was issuing a two-page memo to \nits employees. This goes back to that period of time I was asking the \nquestions in 2011. The memo limited the release of market-moving \ninformation before the close of the stock markets. Now, that is the \nright thing to do.\n  That memo presumably was not followed by somebody. Who, we do not \nknow because on April 1, that requirement appears to have been \nviolated. According to the Wall Street Journal, at 3:42 p.m., Height \nSecurities, a political intelligence broker, issued an advisory note to \nits employees. This note said--it is right here in the chart: ``We now \nbelieve that a deal has been hatched to protect Medicare Advantage \nrates'' from the minus 2.3 rate update issued in the advanced notice \nmid-February.\n  This note goes on to suggest that clients purchase related stocks \nsuch as Humana. Between 3:42 p.m. and the market close, and that was \njust 18 minutes later, volumes for affected companies spiked--look \nhere--spiked in the last 18 minutes to more than $\\1/2\\ billion.\n  In fact, the combined volume of shares traded for those companies for \nthose 18 minutes was higher than the rest of the entire trading day. \nNot only did large numbers of shares change hands, but also buyers who \ngot the information first likely made a heck of a lot of money. For \nexample, Humana stock rose 8.6 percent in a matter of minutes.\n  Of course, this looks like political intelligence at work--political \nintelligence meaning the industry of political intelligence at work. A \npolitical intelligence broker gets ahold of nonpublic government \ninformation before it is widely released, and a select few paying \nclients end up reaping the rewards.\n  We just had a study out by the Government Accountability Office \nstudying the political intelligence community. The Government \nAccountability Office reports that the world of political intelligence \nis murky. In other words, people are using government. They are \nprofiting from it. But nobody knows who they are.\n  The public and Congress have little insight into how government \ninformation is collected. Collecting is one thing, but it is sold. \nPeople who collect it make money, and in the instances you see here, \nwhen that gets out people in the know make money.\n  So who pays for that information? We all know since 1946 lobbyists \nhave had to register, and in more recent legislation have had to \ndisclose their clients, what they lobby on, and how much they get paid. \nEven campaign donors have to report what they give to various \ncampaigns.\n  Political intelligence brokers are exempt from any transparency. Yet \nyou see they are around gathering information that should not be out to \nthe public until after the market closes. They are benefiting from it \nand a lot of other people benefit from it.\n  Now, because there is no transparency about the political \nintelligence community, we have to find out what caused this to happen. \nDid the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services employees leak this \ninformation? Was there a leak from another government source? Either \nway we need answers to these questions.\n  Tomorrow is Acting Administrator Tavenner's confirmation hearing \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee. This acting director is a very \nqualified person. I think she will be able to answer our questions--at \nleast I hope so. So I want her to know, and the Senate to know, that I \nplan on asking Ms. Tavenner several questions: How did this information \nget from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to a political \nintelligence broker? What steps will CMS take to ensure this does not \nhappen again? And was the memo they sent violated?\n  I hope she recognizes the importance of these questions. I hope she \ncomes prepared to take responsibility. I hope she comes prepared to \nexplain how she plans to hold someone accountable because in this town, \nif heads do not roll, nothing changes. She has been a good Acting \nAdministrator of this agency. She wants the Senate to confirm her to \nthe job. This is her opportunity to show us that she is worthy of that \nconfirmation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Mary Jo White Nomination\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I rise today to discuss the confirmation of Mary Jo \nWhite as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Ms. White has had an impressive career--from prosecuting terrorists \nand white-collar criminals as a U.S. attorney for the Southern District \nof New York to heading a large litigation department in private \npractice. There is little doubt that Ms. White has the Wall Street \nexpertise necessary to navigate the complex issues before the SEC.\n  I come to the floor today to discuss a critical problem I have asked \nMs. White to prioritize as Chair of the SEC. Currently, when a bank \nissues a structured finance product, it needs to get the product rated \nby the credit rating agencies, and the bank pays them for the ratings. \nThe banks have an interest in getting high ratings, and the credit \nrating agencies have an interest in getting repeat customers. Of \ncourse, this creates a fundamental conflict of interest. This conflict \nplayed a key role in the financial meltdown. It is a problem we sought \nto address in the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation we passed in \n2010. Yet it is a problem that remains. It is awaiting action by the \nSEC--more than 5 years after the financial crisis hit and nearly 3 \nyears since Dodd-Frank was signed into law.\n  Resolving the problem of the conflict of interest in the rating \nindustry will be a vital test of the SEC under Ms. White's \nchairmanship. In a meeting we had together last month in my office, Ms. \nWhite expressed her appreciation of the importance of this issue and \nher commitment to scrutinize conflicts of interest inherent in the \ncredit rating industry. I look forward to working with her to find a \nmeaningful solution to alleviate the ongoing threat to our financial \nsystem posed by these conflicts of interest. The next concrete step in \nthat process is a roundtable the SEC will hold on this issue in May. \nThat roundtable must be a balanced assessment of the issue, and it must \nlead to meaningful action by the SEC.\n  This is not, to be sure, the only issue in financial reform facing \nthe SEC. I wish to talk a little bit about why I\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\ncare so passionately about reforming the credit rating process and why \nthis is so important.\n  In the years leading up to the 2008 financial collapse, the credit \nrating agencies were enjoying massive profits and booming business. Of \ncourse, there is nothing wrong with massive profits and booming \nbusiness in and of themselves, but there was one fundamental problem: \nBooming business was coming at the expense of accurate credit ratings, \nwhich is supposed to be the entire reason for the existence of the \ncredit rating agencies.\n  The fact that the credit rating agencies were not providing accurate \nratings should come as no surprise given the industry's compensation \nmodel. Credit rating agencies were and still are paid to issue ratings \ndirectly by the big Wall Street banks issuing the paper and requesting \nthe ratings. If a rating agency--let's say Moody's--doesn't provide the \ntriple-A rating the bank wants, the bank can just take its business \nover to Fitch or S's. That is called ratings shopping, and it \ncontinues to this day. The opportunity for ratings shopping creates an \nincentive for the credit raters to give out those triple-A ratings even \nwhen they are not warranted, and that is exactly what happened with the \nsubprime, mortgage-backed securities that played such a crucial role in \nthe financial crisis, and it happened over and over again. It became \ningrained in the culture of the industry.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator \nLevin, took a close look at the big three credit rating agencies, \nexamined millions of pages of documents, and released an extensive \nreport detailing the internal communications at Moody's, S, and \nFitch. Among the many troubling e-mails, there was one from an S \nofficial that sums up the prevailing attitude quite nicely: ``Let's \nhope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards \nfalters.''\n  With all the risky bets in the financial sector--and bets on those \nbets--our financial sector had indeed become a house of cards. But \nwithout the conduct of the credit raters, the house of cards would have \nbeen one card tall because it gave triple-A ratings to these bets on \nbets on bets--these derivatives.\n  Two years after that e-mail was written, that house of cards didn't \njust falter, it collapsed. Because that house of cards had grown so \ntall--thanks to the credit rating agencies--when it collapsed, it \nbrought the entire American economy down with it. The financial \nmeltdown cost Americans $3.4 trillion--let me say that again--$3.4 \ntrillion in retirement savings. It triggered the worst crisis since the \nGreat Depression with its massive business failure and mass \nforeclosures and job losses and the explosion of our national debt.\n\n  The crisis profoundly affected the everyday lives of millions of \npeople across the country in so many negative ways, including in \nMinnesota. People lost their homes, their jobs, their health insurance. \nI know the Presiding Officer saw it in New Mexico. I saw it in \nMinnesota. Every Senator here saw it in their State.\n  In May 2010 I called on Minnesotans to participate in a field hearing \nto learn about their experiences during the financial collapse. I would \nlike to share some highlights from the testimony presented by Dave Berg \nof Eden Prairie, MN.\n\n       My situation mirrors the situation of thousands of \n     Minnesotans in my age group--and illustrates why it is so \n     important to reform the way Wall Street operates. I am 57 \n     years old and looking for a job. After having spent most of \n     my career in the IT field, I have been out of work for 14 \n     months . . . Throughout my working career, I saved for \n     retirement. I participated in pension and 401(k) plans that \n     my former employers matched. I thought I would have a secure \n     retirement because I was doing the right thing . . . Much of \n     my overall retirement security is now gone . . . At the age \n     of 57, I need to again start building up a nest egg so I can \n     hopefully retire in my seventies. This was not my plan.\n       As a job seeker in my 50s, I am not alone. Twice weekly, I \n     meet with groups of job seekers, many of whom are in the same \n     situation as I am. While we keep our outlook positive, most \n     of us are faced with the prospect of starting over and we are \n     resigned to the fact that we could be working in our \n     seventies.\n       The downturn of the economy, caused in part by the abuses \n     on Wall Street, led to the loss of my retirement security. \n     Reforming the way Wall Street operates is important to me \n     personally, because I have a lot of saving yet to do--and I \n     simply cannot afford another Wall Street meltdown. I need to \n     have confidence in the markets--and I need to know that there \n     is accountability to those who caused this financial crisis.\n\n  As Dave points out, he is not alone. Everyone in this body has heard \nstories like this. It is hard to overestimate the extent to which the \ncredit rating agencies contributed to the financial crisis in which \nthousands of Minnesotans lost their homes, thousands lost their jobs, \nand far too many Minnesotans had their hopes for the future dashed.\n  They are not seeking retribution from Wall Street, they just need to \nknow it will not happen again. They know that there is a problem and \nthat the problem needs to be fixed. We do not need further proof of \nthat, but we get it in the recent complaint filed by the Department of \nJustice against S in which DOJ alleges--as it said when it filed the \ncomplaint--that the credit rating agency ``falsely represented that its \nratings were objective, independent, and uninfluenced by S's \nrelationships with investment banks when, in actuality, S's desire \nfor increased revenue and market share led it to favor the interests of \nthese banks over investors.''\n  The complaint highlights the patently problematic way the credit \nrating agencies habitually did their business. One e-mail obtained in \nthe investigation from a high-level S official reads:\n\n       We are meeting with your group this week to discuss \n     adjusting criteria for rating CDO's of real estate assets . . \n     . because of the ongoing threat of losing deals.\n\n  CDOs--collaterized debt obligations--are one of those derivatives or \nbets that added stories to the house of cards. This official had \napparently become so comfortable with the culture of conflicts of \ninterest that he appeared to have no reservations about putting it in \nwriting.\n  I am glad the Department of Justice is pursuing a case against the \nS, but DOJ's action is not enough. It is backward-looking and \naddresses past harms, but my concern is that the conduct continues to \nthis day. The credit raters are still influenced by the relationships \nwith the banks because that is who pays them. It is a clear conflict of \ninterest and we need to prioritize actions that will prevent another \nmeltdown in the future.\n\n  That is exactly what Congress--and I--did as part of the financial \nreform legislation in 2010. As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nreform act, I proposed a solution with my friend and colleague Senator \nRoger Wicker of Mississippi. If our provision is implemented in full, \nit would root out the conflicts of interest from the ``issuer pays'' \nmodel. The amendment Senator Wicker and I offered to the financial \nreform bill directed the Securities and Exchange Commission to create \nan independent self-regulatory organization that would select which \nagency--one with the adequate capacity and expertise--would provide the \ninitial credit rating of each product. The assignments would be based \nnot only on capacity and expertise but also, after time, on their track \nrecord. Our approach would incentivize and reward excellence. The \ncurrent pay-for-play model--with its inherent conflict of interest--\nwould be replaced by a pay-for-performance model. This improved market \nwould finally allow smaller rating agencies to break the Big Three's \noligopoly.\n  The oligopoly is clear. The SEC estimates that as of December 31, \n2011, approximately 91 percent of the credit ratings for structured \nfinance products were issued by the three largest NRSROs--Fitch, \nMoody's, and S of which was implicated in the PSI \ninvestigation. The other five agencies doing structured finance make up \nthe remaining 9 percent.\n  The current oligopoly doesn't incentivize accuracy. However, if we \nmove to a system based on merit, the smaller credit rating agencies \nwould be better able to participate and could serve as a check against \ninflated ratings, helping to prevent another meltdown.\n  In our proposed model, the independent board would be comprised \nmainly of investor types--managers of endowments and pension funds--who \nhave the greatest stake in the reliability of credit ratings, as well \nas representatives from the credit rating agencies and banking \nindustries, and academics who have studied this issue.\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\n  Our amendment passed the Senate with a large majority, including 11 \nRepublican votes, because this is not a progressive idea and it is not \na conservative idea--it is a commonsense idea.\n  The final version of Dodd-Frank modified the amendment and, to be \nfrank, put more decisionmaking authority in the hands of the SEC in how \nto respond to the problem of conflicts of interest in the credit rating \nindustry. The final version directed the SEC to study the proposal \nSenator Wicker and I made, along with other alternatives, and then \ndecide how to act.\n  The SEC released its study in December. The study acknowledged the \ncontinued conflicts of interest in the credit rating industry and \nreviewed our proposal and many of the alternatives, laying out the pros \nand cons of each without reaching a definitive conclusion on which \nroute to pursue.\n  The next step is a roundtable the SEC is holding on May 14. I will be \nparticipating in the event, and I hope that under Ms. White's \nleadership the SEC will make the roundtable a meaningful and balanced \ndiscussion of the different possibilities for reform. I have said all \nalong that I believe the proposal of Senator Wicker and myself is a \ngood one--and the right one--the more I have thought about it and \nlooked at it over these few years. But if someone makes a compelling \ncase for an alternative--an alternative that truly alleviates this \ndanger of this inherent conflict of interest--I will gladly lend it my \nsupport. Following the roundtable the SEC must take prompt and decisive \naction to implement a meaningful plan for reform.\n  But don't get me wrong. The need for reform is obvious and necessary, \nand I will pursue this issue until the American economy is no longer \nsubject to these unnecessary risks. Too many Minnesotans--too many \nAmericans--were devastated by a financial crisis to which the credit \nrating agencies contributed mightily. The conflicts of interest in the \ncredit rating agencies must be addressed so they don't contribute to \nyet another crisis.\n  Ultimately, it is up to the SEC to act, and the action they take on \nthis issue will be an important measure of Ms. White's tenure as chair \nof the Commission. Ms. White has assured me she will give this critical \nissue the attention it deserves. I congratulate Ms. White on her \nconfirmation and I do intend to hold her to that commitment. I look \nforward to working with her and the rest of the Commission on this very \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Confronting The Great Challenges\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to deliver my maiden speech as a \nU.S. Senator from Nebraska.\n  I am humbled by the trust placed in me by Nebraskans and inspired by \ntheir confidence to confront the great challenges before us.\n  Our Nation's story began when bands of patriots fought a revolution \nto secure independence from an out-of-touch King residing an ocean \naway. The Framers believed a representative government closer to the \npeople would be more responsive and better able to provide opportunity \nfor individuals.\n  From the start, leaders of good will and strong views disagreed over \neconomic theories, the size of government, and foreign policy. \nImportantly, though, these divergent beliefs have been a source of \nnational strength--not weakness--and through vigorous debate about the \nproper size and role of government, we have built a powerful nation.\n  But as recent partisan disagreements prove, democracy is messy, and \nthe best way forward is not always clear. While I do not aim to resolve \nthis contest of ideas with a single speech, I do wish to outline a \ncourse I intend to chart during my time in the Senate.\n  To understand my views, one must first understand Nebraska. \nNebraska's motto is ``The Good Life''--a fitting maxim for a State with \nthe second lowest unemployment rate in the country.\n  Make no mistake, Nebraska's economic success and sound fiscal footing \nis no accident. Similar to 45 other States, Nebraska is legally \nrequired to balance its budget. But unique to Nebraska is a \nconstitutional prohibition against incurring State debt greater than \n$100,000. That is a radical concept for lawmakers here in Washington.\n  We can imagine Nebraskans' dismay when they take stock of our \nNation's $16 trillion debt and annual trillion-dollar deficits. \nNeedless to say, Nebraskans know better.\n  Nebraska is known for its pioneer history and sturdy spirit, its \nprime grazing grasses and plentiful crop production, its abundant \nnatural resources, growing metropolitan areas, and vibrant small towns. \nBut the State's greatest treasure is its people.\n  Nebraskans are hard working. We get up early to work farms and \nranches and return home late after attending local school board \nmeetings. I make this claim as a family rancher and a former school \nboard member myself.\n  Nebraskans run thriving small businesses on Rockwellian Main Streets \nand they sweat on factory floors. We lead multinational corporations \nand we are builders. We build homes, we build roads and infrastructure.\n  Nebraskans value community. We join the PTA, we coach Little League \nteams after long workdays, and we volunteer for our churches and our \nsynagogues. We work hard, but we are people with perspective. \nNebraskans are tough. We are tested by droughts, by fires and floods, \nand a changing global economy. We have even endured nine-win football \nseasons. We are strong-willed people--you have to be to survive a \nwinter on the Great Plains--and we adapt, we innovate, and we grow.\n  Nebraska is home to the only unicameral legislature in the Nation. As \na former two-term State senator, I was privileged to serve in the \nUnicameral for 8 years. Notably, State senators in Nebraska are \nnonpartisan. No matter party or ideological affiliation, any senator \ncan serve in leadership. The only requirements are knowledge and \nability.\n  Serving in the Nebraska legislature taught me the importance of \nbuilding relationships and seizing opportunities so we can work across \nparty lines. That is a critical skill in order to avoid gridlock.\n  Similar to many Nebraskans, I am deeply concerned about the future of \nour Nation. That is why I entered public service.\n  No single issue is more important to our future than the Federal \nGovernment's addiction to spending. There are two main problems with \ngovernment spending: First, runaway spending has failed to generate \neconomic growth. Since 2009, the Federal Government has spent roughly \n$15 trillion. This spending spree includes $830 million in stimulus \nspending that was sold as ``help for the private sector.''\n  Instead, this so-called investment focused on growing the government.\n  The result of this increased government spending has been a largely \njobless economic recovery, a record number of Americans stuck in \npoverty and spiraling national debt. Rather than empowering individuals \nto improve their lives, these bad economic policies have held Americans \nback.\n  To change course toward renewed prosperity, I support a limited \ngovernment focused on fulfilling its core duties and responsibilities, \na limited Federal Government performing its first constitutional \ncharge: providing for the common defense.\n  To protect the Nation we must maintain a highly trained, well-\nequipped fighting force. Equally important, a limited government keeps \nits promises to veterans who have risked life and limb in defense of \nfreedom. A limited Federal Government has a responsibility to fund \ncritical needs such as a 21st-century infrastructure. To the surprise \nof many in Washington, this can be done without raising taxes. Existing \nsources of revenue are sufficient for government to meet its \nfundamental responsibilities.\n  As a member of the Nebraska Legislature, I introduced legislation \ndirecting a portion of Nebraska's existing sales tax to fund new road \nconstruction. I worked with my colleagues, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, to utilize only existing revenue. With the right mix of hard \nwork and good will the legislature passed this bill. The State will now \nbe able to fulfill that\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\nfundamental core duty, that fundamental responsibility of government, \nand improve Nebraska's communities without raising taxes. We can make \nsimilar progress in Washington. Again, it is a matter of setting \npriorities.\n  The second problem with government spending is that it robs hard-\nworking taxpayers of their personal income just to grow bigger \ngovernment. Big government crowds out the private sector and it stifles \ninnovation. This means more Solyndra-style investment rather than \npolicies that provide for the kind of risk takers who launch a world-\nchanging business from their garage.\n  Big government requires big funding. Rather than forcing Americans to \nforfeit more of their hard-earned tax dollars to Uncle Sam, I support \npolicies that lower taxes, that bolster the private sector. Only then \nwill the United States finally emerge from this long economic \nrecession.\n  Nebraskans understand that the bigger the government, the smaller the \nindividual. The smaller the individual, the less attention is paid to \nfreedom and personal responsibility. Limited government, on the other \nhand, remains grounded closer to home. Government that is closer to \nhome is better suited for meeting individual needs, creating more \nopportunity, more efficiency, and more growth.\n  The expansion of government and the subsequent erosion of freedom are \nnot always obvious at first. Freedom can be chipped away at slowly but \nsteadily through new legal requirements, such as ``employer mandates'' \nin the health care law or misguided attempts to regulate farm dust or \nthe size of our soft drinks. Eventually individuals are constrained by \nlack of choice, society drifts without progress or creativity, and the \neconomy stagnates.\n  As President Reagan cautioned:\n\n       The nature of freedom is that it is fragile. It must be \n     protected, watched over, sometimes fought over.\n\n  Reagan was right. Freedoms must be carefully guarded. We must remain \nvigilant against any attempt, large or small, to diminish it. Yet \ndespite this fragility, our God-given freedom is vast, limited only by \nthe boundaries we impose on it. Nebraskans understand vastness. We know \nwhat it is like to look up at the night sky and see stars that are \nundiminished by city lights. We appreciate the land which appears to \nroll without end. Yet it remains in need of care. Vastness gives us \nperspective. Some perspective would go a long way in Washington.\n  Beyond the beltway's chattering class, there exists a Nation of quiet \nheroes: parents grateful for the dignity of hard work; entrepreneurs \nwilling to take great risks to build businesses; farmers and ranchers \ndutifully tending the land and livestock; soldiers proudly wearing our \nNation's uniform; veterans bearing scars, both physical and invisible, \nreminding us of freedom's price; and children whose simple joy dispels \nour cynicism, which can come with everyday struggles.\n  While our Nation faces many challenges at home and around the world, \nonly petty politics holds us back from overcoming them. We are a great \nand generous nation. We have faced seemingly insurmountable obstacles \nbefore and each generation has conquered them with that uniquely \nAmerican combination of grit and grace. I believe, and Nebraskans \nbelieve, our Nation's future is bright.\n  The United States remains the hope of the world, but this moment, \nthis uncertain moment, requires real courage from our leaders. That is \nnot to say the debate over the role of government or taxes or spending \nwill be resolved by this Congress, but we can do better.\n  This is what we were sent here to do. Americans are not mediocre. \nThey are exceptional and deserve exceptional leaders.\n  Today the whole world mourns the loss of such a leader, an uncommon \nwoman born into common circumstances, the daughter of a grocer, former \nBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She was a woman who stood \ntall for principle. Yet she had the wisdom to seize opportunities and \nwork with allies and foes alike to achieve great things for the British \npeople. Along with her partner and friend Ronald Reagan, she helped to \nlead the world away from the long shadow of the Iron Curtain to a \nfreer, more prosperous time. I admired her political courage to make \nthose difficult decisions, and I hope to do the same here in \nWashington.\n  I look forward to standing tall for Nebraska values and working with \nmy colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, on commonsense solutions to \nthese ongoing challenges. I am proud to represent the citizens of \nNebraska here in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                       Welcoming Senator Fischer\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, Nebraskans have every reason to be proud \nof Senator Fischer and her very impressive start here in the Senate. \nShe has proven herself to be a thoughtful leader in our State, a \nreasoned voice in our legislature which listened to her and followed \nher leadership. She has been firm in her principles, while also \ndemonstrating a serious commitment to reaching across the aisle to \nsolve problems. From successful legislation encouraging rural broadband \nto visiting our troops in Afghanistan, Senator Fischer has had a very \nactive first few months.\n  Her experience as a State Senator undoubtedly helped her to hit the \nground running here in Washington and also grounded her in the \nprinciples which are so important to Nebraskans, the people she and I \nrepresent. I am proud to say I look forward to teaming up with Senator \nFischer in the weeks and months ahead.\n  In view of the fact I have announced I won't be seeking reelection, \nshe will soon be the senior Senator from the State of Nebraska, and I \nhave no doubt whatsoever she will do a great job. I am proud to be her \ncolleague and congratulate her on her maiden speech.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from \nNebraska in welcoming our new colleague to the Senate. She is going to \nbe an incredibly welcome addition to this body. I have had the \nprivilege of traveling with her on the trip to Afghanistan Senator \nJohanns just mentioned, and it was an opportunity for us to visit with \nservicemembers from our home State. She had the opportunity to meet \nservicemembers from Nebraska, many of whom voted for her but had not \nyet had the opportunity to meet her personally as they were serving \noverseas at the time of the election. They joined with other Nebraskans \nin knowing they made the right choice to represent them.\n  We heard a wonderful message today, the message of government and the \nmessage of freedom. I wish to join my colleagues in welcoming this \nrancher, community volunteer, and former State legislator to the \nSenate. She will make, through her grace and her grit, incredible \ncontributions, not just for her State but also for our Nation and the \nbetterment of all the people through this great opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I also wanted to welcome the Senator \nfrom Nebraska. I am honored to be her mentor.\n  There are three things I wish to say. First, we need a woman rancher \nin the Senate. I was sitting here thinking about the last famous woman \nwho was a rancher, Sandra Day O'Connor. She grew up on a ranch.\n  Second, she possesses interest in agriculture and the pragmatic, \npractical economic issues shared by a lot of us in the Midwest. I am \nlooking forward to working with her on those issues.\n  Third, when she speaks about bipartisanship, she means it. She comes \nfrom a background where she actually worked to get things done in her \nState legislature. We need more of this in the Senate.\n  Welcome, Senator Fischer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to add my voice in stating it is wonderful to have \nSenator Fischer on my committee, where we are doing good work. We like \nto say in the committee the public works side is a very collegial side \nand the environmental side is a little less. I am proud to have her \nwith us working on the new Water Resources Development Act. I look \nforward to working closely with her. I congratulate her on her maiden \nspeech. It is like getting the first scratch on your car: You need to \njust do it, and you did it very well.\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  I have been coming to the floor on Monday evenings--I don't know how \nmany people have actually taken note of the fact--every Monday the last \nseveral months to speak about an issue no one in the Senate wishes to \nspeak about very much. I shouldn't say no one; maybe 25 of us do. The \nissue is climate change. I think it is very important we have in the \nRecord and place in the Record everything we know about climate change \nso future generations will see at least a few of us understood the \nissue. We are willing to step forward and do something about this \nissue.\n\n\n                              Gun Control\n\n  I wish to say I personally am very grateful to the people of \nConnecticut for responding to the Sandy Hook tragedy with such focus, \nintelligence, compassion, and common sense. I include in that ``thank \nyou'' the Democrats and Republicans who came together to pass some of \nthe most sensible gun laws which balance gun rights with the need for \npeople to be safe. They need to be safe in a movie theater, safe in the \nschools, and safe in their homes. I think the American people totally \nunderstand when 90 percent of them support background checks. I am so \nproud of my colleague Senator Feinstein. She and I have been working on \nthis issue for a long time.\n  A very long time ago, in the early 1990s, there was a crazed gunman \nwho walked into a law office with an automatic weapon. He killed \npeople. One of them was my son's very dear, good friend, killed while \nprotecting his wife from the shooter. I know from that experience and \nwatching my son's loss at a relatively young age--right out of law \nschool--what it did to my son, let alone what it did to the families of \nthose who were gunned down by this Gian Luigi Ferri, who walked into \n101 California Street and sprayed those bullets as fast as he could.\n  After this tragedy the State of California passed an assault weapons \nban, which has been in place since. Senator Feinstein brought the issue \nof the U.S. assault ban to the floor of the Senate. I will never forget \nstanding here watching the vote, because it was such a close vote. We \ndid in fact ban those weapons of war. When George Bush was President, \nthe ban expired and was never put back in.\n  Where do we stand today? I would say, just to be rhetorical with you, \nthere are 31,000 reasons to pass sensible gun legislation. This is how \nmany people die a year at the hands of a gun.\n  I watched very carefully the Judiciary Committee take up this issue \nas they looked at various provisions. I wish to thank them for passing \nthe provision I worked on with Senator Collins, a bipartisan bill. This \nwill ensure we have grants to school districts that wish to make some \ncapital improvements to their plants to, for example, build a perimeter \nfence or put in some cameras or hot lines. That particular provision \nreceived strong bipartisan support. I am actually working with Senator \nGraham now to expand it even a little more.\n  However, this is not enough. I think securing our schools is very \nimportant. You should not do so in a one-size-fits-all way. Wouldn't it \nbe helpful to this great country if we were able to keep guns out of \nthe hands of known criminals? Wouldn't it be wonderful for our great \nNation if we could keep guns out of the hands of the severely mentally \nill? Wouldn't it be important to expand background checks so people \ndon't go around the current system and slip through with the \nconsequence of facing the families who will never, ever be the same \nbecause of what they have lost?\n  I wish to thank our President. People have said he needs to do so \nmany things, too many things. A President needs to do a lot of things. \nEvery day he wakes up there is something else which needs his \nattention, but he has never forgotten the promise he made to those \nparents of Sandy Hook. It is my understanding they are coming to \nCapitol Hill and visiting various Senate offices. They are looking into \nthe eyes of the Senators if they are able to arrange a meeting with \nthem and saying: Please, we know you may not like every aspect of the \nbill, but don't filibuster the bill. Allow us to take it up and then \nvote your conscience. You owe the country.\n  What would we say to our children who were gunned down? Anyone who \nknows a 6-year-old, 5-year-old, 7-year-old child knows the beauty and \njoy of that age with everything in front of them. The fact anyone could \nhurt a child is beyond our capacity to imagine. To take a gun into a \nschool and slaughter these children is beyond belief. We must respond. \nThe way to respond is not to say we are not going to take up this \nlegislation because we love the National Rifle Association. The \nNational Rifle Association has a right to its opinion. I will say that \nover and over. They have a right to their opinion, as does the ACLU and \neach one of us. We all have the right to our opinion. At some point we \nneed to come together on commonsense legislation when 90 percent of the \npeople support background checks to keep those weapons out of the hands \nof the people who shouldn't have them.\n  What is taking so long to vote on this and do this for 90 percent of \nthe people? I listened to one commentator today who said 90 percent of \nthe people wouldn't even agree today was Monday. When 90 percent of the \npeople agree with background checks, let's embrace this idea. Who cares \nwhose idea it was? Who cares who wrote the legislation? What we need to \ncare about are those children and the thousands of people who are \nkilled every single year.\n  I suspect the Presiding Officer, along with me, remembers the Vietnam \nwar and what it did to this country. It was a tragic war which killed \nabout 50,000 of our beautiful young people over a 10-year period. It \ntore this country apart. It stood this country on its head. We lose \n31,000 people every year to gun violence. We should be chomping at the \nbit to do this legislation.\n  Having said that, I know there is some very good work going on right \nnow across the party lines on the background check. I hope Senator \nManchin and Senator Toomey come together on this issue, because it \nwould be a breakthrough.\n  I certainly believe, whether the agreement is forthcoming or not, we \nneed to take up this bill. This bill is not controversial. It talks \nabout making sure there are no straw purchases where someone comes in \nwho is qualified to buy guns, receives them, and turns around and sells \nthem to someone who isn't qualified. It doesn't pass the test. We have \nto increase the penalties for that.\n\n  Of course, as I said, the school safety provisions I will be \nsupporting. As to the ban on assault weapons of my colleague Senator \nFeinstein, I have not heard one person explain to me why weapons of war \nshould be on our streets. I don't see it. I mean the most I can get out \nof the other side is, well, that is just a start. If we start there, we \nwill go there, we will go there, and we will go there. That is a \nridiculous argument to me. We don't need weapons of war on our streets. \nWe don't need high-capacity clips on our streets.\n  So I commend the Judiciary Committee for doing its work: Senator \nLeahy--I know how hard other Senators on that committee are working--\nSenator Schumer and Senator Feinstein. I, myself, and my staff are \nworking with Senator Graham to even boost up the school security piece. \nBut we need to respond to 90 percent and 85 percent of the people; \notherwise, I don't know whom we represent. We are sent here by the \npeople, and the people are looking at this in their sorrow and their \ndetermination to do something about it, and we cannot fail the test.\n  President Obama, as I started to say before, has not taken his eye \noff this ball, just like he hasn't taken his eye off the immigration \nball, the North Korea ball, and the Syria ball. You name it--this \neconomy, jobs, getting our fiscal house in order--this President has \nbeen handed quite a deck of cards, and he is working on all of it. I \nbelieve he has done what he promised he would do when he made those \npromises to the parents of the Sandy Hook Elementary School. I know he \nis bringing them here to the Hill, and let me tell them now: You don't \nhave to come and see me. I am with you, and I will do everything I can. \nDon't worry about stopping at our office, just tell us what we can do \nto help.\n  When I watched the Judiciary Committee I was so interested because \nSenator Cruz made the point: This is a right to bear arms; it can't be \nmessed with, period, end of story. The committee pointed out to him--\nwhich I\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\nthought was quite right--that no right is unlimited. Mr. President, we \nhave the freedom of speech, but we can't scream out in a theater there \nis a fire unless there is a fire. You can't do that. You can't slander \nsomebody. You can't libel somebody. With every right comes \nresponsibility.\n  So my belief is there is a right to bear arms. People who are \nqualified to have a weapon can have it. They want it to defend their \nfamilies, they want it certainly for hunting, that is fine. That is \nfine with me. I support the sensible gun laws we have in California. If \nyou want to carry a concealed weapon in our State, you have to go to \nthe sheriff or the police chief and make your case. I support that. \nOther colleagues don't support that. I respect that.\n  The bill they have worked so hard on in the committee is really not \nanything radical. They are commonsense steps so people who have a \nsevere mental illness can't get their hands on a gun, and someone who \nknowingly sells guns and ammunition to a criminal or someone who is not \nqualified gets punished. That is important. We make sure there is a \nbackground check if you buy a gun at a gun show.\n  So I guess you can tell I am a little perplexed as to why it is \ntaking us so long to bring this up. But the good news is Colorado \npassed sensible gun laws, Connecticut did, and California has sensible \ngun laws. I am so proud of those States. But let's face it, it doesn't \ndo much good if you live in a State that has these protective laws when \nthe State next door has no laws and so the most violent criminal can go \nand get whatever kind of gun, whatever kind of clip that he wants. I \nsay he; I don't say she. I don't want to ever have to say she, so I \nwill say he.\n  It is time. I just came back from California where I spent the break \nand listened to people. They are rooting for us to get something done, \nquite clearly. We have had our tragedies--oh, my God--in schools, in \nrestaurants, in law offices, and we understand. We have 38 million \npeople in our State. It is crowded. We have to learn to live together \nin peace. If we have disagreements, we have to work them out. So \nsensible gun laws are at work in our State, but we sure would like to \nsee those sensible gun laws across the country so that our people are \ntruly safe.\n  People talked to me about that, and they talked to me about \nimmigration reform. I had an incredible meeting in Los Angeles with the \ngroups of people who are going to be impacted by that. Again, we are so \nhopeful we will have that legislation before us soon. In our committee, \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, which I chair, we are ready \nto go to work with the Water Resources Development Act. This is a \nlittle lighter topic. It deals with our water infrastructure and making \nsure our ports are dredged, making sure we are protected from storms. \nWith the extreme weather we have had--and Hurricane Sandy was certainly \njust the latest example--we need to pass this Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. So we are ready to go as soon as we finish the gun \ndebate.\n  I spoke to Senator Reid, and we are hopeful we will be able to go to \nthe WRDA bill.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  I will close with my Monday night talk on climate. And I have to say, \nwe face a lot of threats. I have talked about one huge threat we face--\na society that has too many deaths from gun violence--but we also have \na very different kind of threat you don't see as clearly called climate \nchange, and it is dangerous.\n  This is my fourth speech on climate. The first time I took to the \nfloor I talked about the fact that USA Today is doing a year-long \nreport on climate, and they call their report ``Why You Should Sweat \nClimate Change.'' It describes how climate change--they call it climate \ndisruption--is happening all around us.\n  I talked about a report on another talk entitled the ``2013 High Risk \nList'' that was released by GAO, the Government Accountability Office, \nwhich is a government watchdog agency, and it informs us that climate \ndisruption and the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather \nevents such as Sandy threaten our Nation's financial security. Look \nwhat it cost. Sandy was $60 billion, $70 billion, $80 billion, and we \nstepped to the plate and helped, as we should have. We can't keep doing \nthis. We are struggling to get this economy on track.\n\n  I also spoke about another aspect, which is the effect on public \nhealth of too much carbon in the air. Today I want to talk about \nanother issue that I find kind of intriguing because whenever I try to \nbring the subject up to colleagues--except for the 25 or so of us who \nreally care about this--they say to me something like, well, it is \nridiculous for America to act. China has to act first because they are \na terrible actor. If they do not act, what is the point of our taking \nthe lead?\n  Well, I have to say that is an argument I find insulting to America. \nI don't want to wait for China to take the lead on anything because \nthey do not share our values. We don't wait for China to act on issues \nsuch as human rights before we protect human rights. We don't wait for \nChina in terms of the way they treat their workers. We have read about \nthat. We don't wait for China, especially on environmental issues. We \nhave to act. China is not a role model. We should be the role model.\n  China is already suffering serious consequences for failing to \naddress pollution in the course of its economic development. Remember, \nour colleagues are saying: Wait for China. You may not be able to see \nanything on this photograph--I can hardly see it and I am standing next \nto it--because of the smog and the filth that is in the air in China. \nWhen I made a trip there on climate change and other issues, I never \nsaw the Sun. One day we went out and our guides were so excited, they \nsaid: It is sunny today. No, it wasn't. There was this layer of smog \nand a little bit of light was shining through.\n  So I say to my colleagues who tell us to wait for China, we should \nwait for them--the worst actor on the world stage--before we take up \nthe most dangerous challenge that we face in terms of science?\n  China now has hazardous levels of air pollution and toxic emissions. \nThey do not care. The only reason they are trying to do something about \nit now is people don't even want to go there and people are getting \nsick and dying there. They need to work their people to their last \nbreath, and their last breath is coming a little too early.\n  According to a new scientific study from the Health Effect Institute \non leading causes of death worldwide, outdoor air pollution contributed \nto 1.2 million premature deaths in China in 2010, which is 40 percent \nof the global total. Here it is. Outdoor air pollution contributed to \n1.2 million premature deaths in China in 2010 because their air is so \nfilthy.\n  What makes my friends believe they will go after carbon pollution any \nmore than they went after smog or soot or anything else? They are not. \nIt is going to get worse.\n  Urban air pollution is set to become the top environmental cause of \nmortality worldwide by 2050, ahead of dirty water and lack of \nsanitation. It is estimated that 3.6 million people could end up dying \nprematurely from air pollution every year, mostly in China and India.\n  I am so excited to have this Presiding Officer in the Senate. He is \nsuch a strong supporter of our landmark environmental laws. But we face \nthe rollback of those laws every day right here in the Senate. I feel \nlike saying to my colleagues: Go to China.\n  Let's have another picture of that again. Go to China. This is what \nyou want America to be? I represent Los Angeles. It used to look a \nlittle like this, not quite as bad. But we did what we had to do. We \nsaid to the polluters: Clean up your act. You have to. It is part of \nthe cost of doing business, just as emitting carbon has a cost, carbon \nis the cause--too much carbon. We need some carbon, but too much carbon \nis the cause of climate change, so we have to put a price on it. People \nwho pollute should have to pay for it, and that will drive us to clean \nenergy. That is the way it works.\n  The cost of environmental degradation in China was $230 billion in \n2010 or 3.5 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product. The people \nthere are very afraid to speak out, so when they do speak out you know \nsomething is really bad. In January, outrage boiled over as air \npollution in China reached record levels--well beyond what Western \nenvironmental agencies consider hazardous. The cost of environmental\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\ndamage in China is growing rapidly amid industrialization.\n  I saw myself the U.S. Embassy in Beijing has used air quality \nmonitoring technologies in and around their compound so they know if \ntheir little kids can even go outside to play.\n  We are working to help the Chinese understand what happens when you \nhave too much pollution. We know it because we are the leader. They are \nnot the leader; they are the culprit. My colleagues say don't do \nanything about carbon pollution because they have to do it first. Don't \nwait for them. They don't get it. Maybe by now they are starting to get \nit, but I am not waiting for them. We have to do what the President \nsaid, which is take the initiative.\n  Decades ago, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio was on fire, massive air \npollution hung over our cities, and our lakes were dying from \npollution. The American people demanded action. We didn't wait for \nChina or anybody else. We passed landmark laws: the Clean Air Act, the \nClean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Superfund, all these \ngreat landmark pieces of legislation that came from the committee on \nwhich I serve. I stand on the shoulders of those former chairmen--\nRepublican and Democratic--including John Chafee, whom I loved, who was \nso strong, and, by the way, strong on sensible gun laws too.\n  People say, oh, they predicted terrible things would happen to our \nsociety when we passed these landmark laws. But guess what happened \nover the last 40 years. America's gross domestic product has risen by \nover 200 percent. So this is not a choice between economic development \nversus environmental cleanup. They go hand in hand, because if we can't \nbreathe, we can't work. If we can't breathe, we can't go to school. \nWhen you are in your State and you visit a class--any age but \nparticularly the younger ones in the elementary schools--ask them how \nmany of them have asthma or know someone with asthma.\n  It is a shocking thing that happened to me in an area that has very \nclean air--San Francisco--but not clean enough, obviously, because at \nleast one-third to one-half of the children raised their hand.\n  We know we are doing the right thing, but we have to protect and \ndefend against these constant environmental riders. We face them on the \nbudget. We face them constantly. They want to turn back the clock, and \nit makes no sense because we have seen a lot of environmental \ntechnology and growth of jobs--3.4 million people employed in clean \ntechnology. So it is in our Nation's DNA to turn a problem into an \nopportunity and not say: Well, yes, this is bad. Superstorm Sandy was \nbad. We know it is bad when 99 percent of the scientists say this is \nbad and we see what is happening in Greenland and we see what is \nhappening in the Arctic and we see what is happening with heat waves \nand we see and we see, but we just sit back because the oil companies \nlike to do business the way they are doing it. They don't want to lose \nany business. They don't want to see us move to those clean cars, the \nclean energy. It is sad.\n  To say wait for China, the next person who tells me that, I am going \nto make them look at this picture. I am going to force them to look at \nthis picture. Wait for China? They can't see anything there. We have to \nrise to this challenge.\n  According to the National Oceanic Administration, in 2011, there were \n14 extreme weather events. What do I mean by extreme weather? Terrible \nfloods, droughts, storms, wildfires. Each of them cost at least $1 \nbillion. And we had 11 such disasters in 2012. I heard Governor Cuomo \nof New York say: We prepared for a once-in-50-years flood, and we are \ngetting them every year. That is what is happening on the ground. These \nextreme weather events reflect an unpaid bill from climate disruption, \na tab that will only grow. I talked about the $60 billion tab from \nSuperstorm Sandy.\n  We have started to address carbon pollution. That is the very good \nnews. President Obama, working with Senators Snowe and Feinstein, did \nsomething very important to make sure we have better fuel economy, and \nthe standards go into effect between 2012 and 2025. They will provide \nhuge benefits. Guess what. When this program is implemented, consumers \nwill save $8,000 over the life of their car. Why? Because they are \ngetting better fuel economy.\n  I drive a hybrid Prius in California. I am getting about 140 to 150 \nmiles a gallon because I do my little trips and then I come home and I \nplug it in. It is truly remarkable. It is saving our family money and \nit is helping to save the environment. This is a win-win-win. But if we \nlisten to my friends, they look at it as lose-lose-lose. They are dour \nabout the idea of taking the lead. We have to take the lead.\n  What we do impacts the world. When our Nation reduces its carbon \npollution, it makes a difference. We account for 20 percent of the \nglobal pollution. China accounts for about the same, but I am not \nwaiting for our society to look like this.\n  Here is the great news: When we reduce carbon pollution, there are \nside benefits. The side benefits are we are not going to look like this \nbecause we are also going to shift over to those clean technologies, \nhave less smog, less soot, and our people will be able to breathe.\n  Peer-reviewed science has forecasted the United States could \nsignificantly contribute to reducing the likelihood that we will avoid \nextreme impacts of climate disruption. We know we are already facing \nsome disruption, but the quicker we move, the more we cut back on that \ncarbon pollution, the better. Addressing climate change will have many \ninvestments in solar and wind and clean energy, strengthening our \ndomestic renewable energy sector. I am so proud of California. We are \nmoving in that direction and doing well.\n  According to the Pew Charitable Trust, clean energy policies could \nprovide up to a $2.3 trillion market--not billion but trillion--for \ninvestments in renewable energy. So we can ignore this opportunity to \nbe a market leader in renewables and then take those inventions all \nover the world or we can do it and benefit our economy.\n  I saw today that former Secretary of State George Schultz, a resident \nof my great State and who was part of the Reagan administration, penned \nan important article about why we should go to a carbon tax. A carbon \ntax, a simple thing: If someone produces carbon pollution, they have to \npay for every ton. His idea is give that back to the American people. \nHelp them pay for those transition periods of time where we are going \nto move toward that clean energy. I am very pleased he wrote that \narticle, and I am hoping to get him before our environment committee to \ntalk about it.\n  We have to step up to the plate on climate. Every one of us has an \nobligation to do it. I know it is hard, because with the exception of a \nstorm such as Sandy and then heat waves that are outrageous, we don't \nthink about it. I understand why. It is not pleasant. We have so many \nchallenges on our hands--budget challenges, education challenges, \nimmigration challenges, gun violence challenges. So if it is not right \nin front of us where we see it every day or read about it every day or \nit is not hitting our State every day, I understand why some people \nwould prefer to ignore it. But we owe it to our kids and our grandkids \nto be leaders. This is our time. We didn't pick this time to be born to \nlive, but here we are, and here are these scientists telling us: Wake \nup, do something or we are facing a planetary emergency.\n\n  Every Monday night that I can be here, I will be here. I want to make \na record, at least for history if not for political action--which is \nwhat I truly want--that we do something. The President visited San \nFrancisco recently. I hope he will continue to do the right thing. It \nis lonely for him because he doesn't have a legislature that gets it.\n  But let me say to colleagues who are definitely, I can assure you, \nnot watching this but who may read about this speech: Don't ever say to \nme: Let's wait for China because that is an insult to America and it is \nan insult to our people. We are going to wait for a country that \ndoesn't care about its people enough so that the people have to run \naround in masks, and they can't even see anything, it is so smoggy and \ndirty there. So don't tell me: Wait for China, because that argument--\nor as they would say in certain parts of the country, that dog don't \nhunt. I don't say that in my part of the country. What I say is that \nmakes no sense whatsoever.\n  I will continue to come here in the hopes that we can come together \non this issue, in the hopes that President Obama will keep on moving, \nin the hopes that my State and the Northeast and other States are going \nto move on this issue. I will protect their right to do it. I will \ndefend against anyone who comes to roll back the Clean Air Act--which, \nunfortunately, Senator Inhofe came at us with an amendment in the \nbudget that said the Environmental Protection Agency should no longer \nhave the ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions--imagine--and we \nhad\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\nmore than 40 votes for that position. That is scary. That is akin to \nsaying we should stop worrying about smoking and get 45 votes to say it \nis no big deal. This is a big deal.\n  I will just keep on making the talks on Monday nights, if I can. I \nwish to thank my staff. They are working so hard to put this together \nin a coherent way, so perhaps after 6 months of making these speeches, \nwe have a story to tell from beginning to end that would be compelling \nenough so no one will ever say to me: Let's wait for China to fix their \nproblem, and people might actually come up and say: Put me on as a \ncosponsor on that Sanders-Boxer bill or the Sheldon Whitehouse bill \nthat puts a price on carbon.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Anne Smedinghoff\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have often come to the floor to talk \nabout the remote and sometimes dangerous places around the world where \nour USAID and State Department Foreign Service Officers serve.\n  We all know about the difficult and dangerous places our brave \nmilitary personnel serve, often at great sacrifice. We sometimes lose \nsight of their civilian diplomatic and aid colleagues working side by \nside.\n  I am always impressed that no matter where on the planet one travels, \nthere is an outpost of American ideals and talent dedicated to \ndiplomacy, human rights, and helping the less fortunate.\n  These civilians serving abroad can face a variety of threats. Yet \nthey do it with dedication, patriotism, and a belief that the United \nStates should always be a voice for good in the world.\n  Sadly, today I come here with a heavy heart, as the life of one of \nthe brightest young officers from my home State of Illinois was cut \nshort on Saturday in one of those dangerous places.\n  Twenty-five-year-old Anne Smedinghoff eagerly volunteered to serve \nthe United States in Afghanistan on her second assignment as a State \nDepartment Foreign Service Officer. She was clear-eyed in her \ndetermination to make a tangible improvement in the lives of those \naround her. And after 2 years at our Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela, \nAnne joined the Public Diplomacy team at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.\n  Anne was a bright spot on the Embassy compound, known to her friends \nand coworkers as an intelligent, caring, and optimistic young officer \nwho worked hard to help Afghan women and children.\n  On Saturday, Anne traveled to Zabul Province to donate books to a \nschool.\n  In a cowardly attack, a suicide bomber detonated near her convoy. \nAnne was killed along with four other Americans--three U.S. \nservicemembers and a Department of Defense civilian. Several others \nwere wounded.\n  Anne leaves behind her parents, brother, and two sisters, as well as \ncountless relatives, friends, and coworkers who deeply mourn her loss, \nnot only personally but also as an example of the deep dedication our \ndiplomats demonstrate every day in outposts all around the world.\n  I know my colleagues join me in our heartfelt condolences to her \nfamily and in our ongoing appreciation for the sacrifices made by our \ndiplomatic corps.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Roger Ebert\n\n  This morning I went to a funeral in Chicago at Holy Name Cathedral. \nThere was a large--in fact, it was a huge crowd. It was a tribute to \nAmerica's foremost movie critic Roger Ebert, who passed away last week. \nIt was my good fortune to know Roger and his wife Chaz and to be one of \nhis greatest fans. Like myself, he hailed from downstate Illinois. He \nwas born in Urbana.\n  In his memoir ``Life Itself,'' he tells an amazingly detailed story \nof his youth growing up downstate and how he finally made it to the big \ntime, the Chicago Sun Times in Chicago, after he had been editor of the \nDaily Illini on the campus of the University of Illinois.\n  Roger came to movie criticism almost by accident, but in no time at \nall he set the standard, not only for the United States, maybe for the \nworld. Rahm Emanuel, our mayor in Chicago, in a tribute to Roger today, \nsaid at the service that he wanted to personally thank Roger Ebert for \nsparing us from going to see so many terrible movies. So many of us \nwould wait before we went to a movie, as the mayor said, to check the \ntime of the movie but also to check what Roger Ebert thought about the \nmovie. He was a go-to person when it came to movie criticism.\n  As you came to read the book about his life, there was much more than \nthat. He was a brilliant mind. From a very early age, he had an \ninsatiable appetite for the world around him. He used that in his \nskills as a journalist at the Chicago Sun Times and in analyzing the \nwhole genre of movies, from the earliest classics all the way through \nthe most modern. That life experience really put him in good stead when \nit came to taking a look at movies from the human perspective.\n  He, of course, became famous on television with Siskel, Roeper, and \nso many others. Most of us watched that program with a lot of joy as \nthe two of them would squabble from time to time over whether a movie \nwas worth seeing. But there was much more to Roger than that. We came \nto know today, in tributes that were paid to him, his deep sense of \nsocial justice, not just in the way he analyzed things but in his life \nitself. He really was committed to fairness and to helping the little \nguy. It showed in the way he lived his life, in the way he set a \nstandard as a journalist.\n  Chaz, his wife, came along late in life for him but became a true \npartner. The two of them were inseparable, and they were a dynamic team \nin so many ways. But the things about Roger's life that impressed me \nthe most--the most--was after he was stricken with cancer. It was a \ndevastating cancer. He went through a series of operations. He \neventually had his face literally deformed by the surgeries, as he lost \nhis jawbone. Then he lost his ability to speak. Then he lost his \nability to eat--to eat. Yet he soldiered on. He continued to write, \nreviewing movies, using computer-assisted voice translation so that he \ncould express himself through a keyboard in words. He wrote a blog \nevery day that I used to go to from time to time, not only because it \nwas so good--so many insights into things I had never thought about--\nbut also because it was inspiring that he would get up and go to work \nevery single day when others in that same circumstance would probably \njust give up. Roger never gave up. That, to me, showed that he not only \nhad a great mind and a great heart but a great spirit.\n  What a turnout today at Holy Name Cathedral for Roger Ebert. The \nbalcony was full--if there had been a balcony--of fans with two thumbs \nup for a great movie critic, a great human being, and a great son of \nIllinois.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the close of \nmy remarks here an excerpt from Roger Ebert's memoir entitled ``Life \nItself'' in which he talks about death and very boldly says, ``I do not \nfear death.'' It is an inspiring message that he penned over a year and \na half before he actually died. It is an indication of the kind of \nspirit he brought to his life, a spirit we all admire to this day.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Apr. 4, 2013]\n\n                    Roger Ebert: I Do Not Fear Death\n\n                            (By Roger Ebert)\n\n       I know it is coming, and I do not fear it, because I \n     believe there is nothing on the other side of death to fear. \n     I hope to be spared as much pain as possible on the approach \n     path. I was perfectly content before I was born, and I think \n     of death as the same state. I am grateful for the gifts of \n     intelligence, love, wonder and laughter. You can't say it \n     wasn't interesting. My lifetime's memories are what I have \n     brought home from the trip. I will require them for eternity \n     no more than that little souvenir of the Eiffel Tower I \n     brought home from Paris.\n       I don't expect to die anytime soon. But it could happen \n     this moment, while I am writing. I was talking the other day \n     with Jim Toback, a friend of 35 years, and the conversation \n     turned to our deaths, as it always does. ``Ask someone how \n     they feel about death,'' he said, ``and they'll tell you \n     everyone's gonna die. Ask them, In the next 30 seconds? No, \n     no, no, that's not gonna happen.\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\n     How about this afternoon? No. What you're really asking them \n     to admit is, Oh my God, I don't really exist. I might be gone \n     at any given second.''\n       Me too, but I hope not. I have plans. Still, illness led me \n     resolutely toward the contemplation of death. That led me to \n     the subject of evolution, that most consoling of all the \n     sciences, and I became engulfed on my blog in unforeseen \n     discussions about God, the afterlife, religion, theory of \n     evolution, intelligent design, reincarnation, the nature of \n     reality, what came before the big bang, what waits after the \n     end, the nature of intelligence, the reality of the self, \n     death, death, death.\n       Many readers have informed me that it is a tragic and \n     dreary business to go into death without faith. I don't feel \n     that way. ``Faith'' is neutral. All depends on what is \n     believed in. I have no desire to live forever. The concept \n     frightens me. I am 69, have had cancer, will die sooner than \n     most of those reading this. That is in the nature of things. \n     In my plans for life after death, I say, again with Whitman:\n       I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I \n     love,\n       If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.\n       And with Will, the brother in Saul Bellow's ``Herzog,'' I \n     say, ``Look for me in the weather reports.''\n       Raised as a Roman Catholic, I internalized the social \n     values of that faith and still hold most of them, even though \n     its theology no longer persuades me. I have no quarrel with \n     what anyone else subscribes to; everyone deals with these \n     things in his own way, and I have no truths to impart. All I \n     require of a religion is that it be tolerant of those who do \n     not agree with it. I know a priest whose eyes twinkle when he \n     says, ``You go about God's work in your way, and I'll go \n     about it in His.''\n       What I expect to happen is that my body will fail, my mind \n     will cease to function and that will be that. My genes will \n     not live on, because I have had no children. I am comforted \n     by Richard Dawkins' theory of memes. Those are mental units: \n     thoughts, ideas, gestures, notions, songs, beliefs, rhymes, \n     ideals, teachings, sayings, phrases, cliches that move from \n     mind to mind as genes move from body to body. After a \n     lifetime of writing, teaching, broadcasting and telling too \n     many jokes, I will leave behind more memes than many. They \n     will all also eventually die, but so it goes.\n       O'Rourke's had a photograph of Brendan Behan on the wall, \n     and under it this quotation, which I memorized:\n       I respect kindness in human beings first of all, and \n     kindness to animals. I don't respect the law; I have a total \n     irreverence for anything connected with society except that \n     which makes the roads safer, the beer stronger, the food \n     cheaper and the old men and old women warmer in the winter \n     and happier in the summer.\n       That does a pretty good job of summing it up. ``Kindness'' \n     covers all of my political beliefs. No need to spell them \n     out. I believe that if, at the end, according to our \n     abilities, we have done something to make others a little \n     happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, \n     that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy \n     is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime \n     starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is \n     true no matter what our problems, our health, our \n     circumstances. We must try. I didn't always know this and am \n     happy I lived long enough to find it out.\n       One of these days I will encounter what Henry James called \n     on his deathbed ``the distinguished thing.'' I will not be \n     conscious of the moment of passing. In this life I have \n     already been declared dead. It wasn't so bad. After the first \n     ruptured artery, the doctors thought I was finished. My wife, \n     Chaz, said she sensed that I was still alive and was \n     communicating to her that I wasn't finished yet. She said our \n     hearts were beating in unison, although my heartbeat couldn't \n     be discovered. She told the doctors I was alive, they did \n     what doctors do, and here I am, alive.\n       Do I believe her? Absolutely. I believe her literally--not \n     symbolically, figuratively or spiritually. I believe she was \n     actually aware of my call and that she sensed my heartbeat. I \n     believe she did it in the real, physical world I have \n     described, the one that I share with my wristwatch. I see no \n     reason why such communication could not take place. I'm not \n     talking about telepathy, psychic phenomenon or a miracle. The \n     only miracle is that she was there when it happened, as she \n     was for many long days and nights. I'm talking about her \n     standing there and knowing something. Haven't many of us \n     experienced that? Come on, haven't you? What goes on happens \n     at a level not accessible to scientists, theologians, \n     mystics, physicists, philosophers or psychiatrists. It's a \n     human kind of a thing.\n       Someday I will no longer call out, and there will be no \n     heartbeat. I will be dead. What happens then? From my point \n     of view, nothing. Absolutely nothing. All the same, as I \n     wrote to Monica Eng, whom I have known since she was six, \n     ``You'd better cry at my memorial service.'' I correspond \n     with a dear friend, the wise and gentle Australian director \n     Paul Cox. Our subject sometimes turns to death. In 2010 he \n     came very close to dying before receiving a liver transplant. \n     In 1988 he made a documentary named ``Vincent: The Life and \n     Death of Vincent van Gogh.'' Paul wrote me that in his Arles \n     days, van Gogh called himself ``a simple worshiper of the \n     external Buddha.'' Paul told me that in those days, Vincent \n     wrote:\n       Looking at the stars always makes me dream, as simply as I \n     dream over the black dots representing towns and villages on \n     a map.\n       Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be \n     as accessible as the black dots on the map of France?\n       Just as we take a train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we \n     take death to reach a star. We cannot get to a star while we \n     are alive any more than we can take the train when we are \n     dead. So to me it seems possible that cholera, tuberculosis \n     and cancer are the celestial means of locomotion. Just as \n     steamboats, buses and railways are the terrestrial means.\n       To die quietly of old age would be to go there on foot.\n       That is a lovely thing to read, and a relief to find I will \n     probably take the celestial locomotive. Or, as his little \n     dog, Milou, says whenever Tintin proposes a journey, ``Not by \n     foot, I hope!''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, last month, I spoke at the Judicial \nConference about the damaging effect of sequestration on our Federal \ncourts and our system of justice. These indiscriminate cuts are already \ncausing both Federal prosecutors and Federal public defenders to be \nfurloughed. The Administrative Office of U.S. Courts has done its best \nto address these cuts, but the judicial system can only weather the \neffects of sequestration for so long before it is irreparably harmed. \nIn a letter dated March 5, 2013, Judge Thomas Hogan, the director of \nthe Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, wrote that the cuts from \nsequestration could not be ``sustained beyond fiscal year 2013 and will \nbe difficult and painful to implement.'' He went on to note: ``The \nJudiciary cannot continue to operate at such drastically reduced \nfunding levels without seriously compromising the constitutional \nmission of the federal courts.'' In that same letter, he wrote that \nsequestration will mean reduced funding for drug testing and mental \nhealth treatment, and fewer probation officers.\n  Along the same lines, last month Andrew Cohen wrote an article in The \nAtlantic entitled ``How the Sequester Threatens the U.S. Legal \nSystem.'' He suggests that sequestration will threaten defendants' \nconstitutional rights, and law enforcement's ability to effectively \nfight crime, writing: ``Beyond a reasonable doubt, the sequester is \nhaving a profound and pernicious effect on the government's ability to \nobserve its constitutional commands--and to provide justice to its \ncitizens.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of Judge Hogan's letter and the \narticle from The Atlantic be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  Justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy testified before the \nHouse Appropriations Committee last month about the impact of \nsequestration and budget cuts. Justice Kennedy said that funding for \nprograms like drug testing and mental health services is ``[A]bsolutely \nurgent for the safety of society.'' The Justices also noted the harm \nthat would result from cuts to public defenders, as the government \nwould then have to pay private defense attorneys to provide counsel. \nJustice Breyer highlighted the additional costs to the government from \nmistakes being made in trials, including wrongful convictions.\n  These budget cuts to our courts are also bad for our economy. Fewer \ncourt staff will mean further delays for civil and bankruptcy cases. \nThere are already more than 30,000 civil cases that have been pending \nfor more than 3\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\nyears. We know that justice delayed is justice denied, and hardworking \nAmericans who look to our courts to protect their rights deserve \nbetter.\n  Even before sequestration went into effect, our Federal courts have \nspent nearly 4 years burdened by unnecessarily high numbers of judicial \nvacancies. Judicial vacancies have been near or above 80, and for over \n2 years were at ``historically high'' levels, according to the \nCongressional Research Service. The Senate must do much more to fill \nthese vacancies and make real progress.\n  Unfortunately, Senate Republicans have been unwilling to work with \nPresident Obama. The Judiciary Committee's ranking Republican member \nrecently expressed concern that not all judicial emergency vacancies \nhave nominees. Of the 35 judicial emergency vacancies, 24 are in States \nwith Republican Senators. In fact, close to half of all judicial \nemergency vacancies are in just three States, each of which is \nrepresented by two Republican Senators. Those Senators should be \nworking with the White House to fill those vacancies. Even for judicial \nemergency vacancies in those three states that have a nominee, \nRepublican Senators have not supported moving forward. So I encourage \nRepublican Senators to work with the President to find good nominees \nfor those important vacancies and to allow qualified nominees to move \nforward. I take very seriously our responsibilities of both advise and \nconsent on nominations. Senators should stop pocket filibustering the \nPresident's nominees and work with him to fill these judicial \nvacancies.\n  Regrettably, qualified, consensus nominees are being delayed, even \nnominees who are supported by home State Republican Senators. They are \nsubjected to unnecessary and unprecedented delays on the Senate floor. \nThese nominees have been vetted in a lengthy process, and often have \nthe support of all Senators on the Judiciary Committee, so there is no \nreason we cannot consider them in regular order. For the last 4 years, \nSenate Republicans have consistently refused to consent to what used to \nbe the routine consideration of consensus judicial nominees. That is \nwhy the Majority Leader has been forced to file cloture on 30 of \nPresident Obama's nominees, which is already over 65 percent more \nnominees than had cloture filed during the 8 years of the George W. \nBush administration. Many of those nominees are then confirmed \nunanimously after months or even a year of waiting. There is no good \nreason the Senate cannot consider them more expeditiously. These \ndeliberate delaying tactics hurt the Senate, our courts, and the \nAmerican people.\n  Before the most recent recess, the Senate was finally allowed to vote \non the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to fill a judicial vacancy \non the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She currently \nserves as Vice Chair and Commissioner of the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission, to which the Senate previously confirmed her. Previously, \nKetanji Jackson was a counsel at Morrison & Foerster LLP and an \nAssistant Federal Public Defender in the Office of the Federal Public \nDefender in the District of Columbia. After graduating, cum laude, from \nHarvard Law School, where she served as Supervising Editor of the \nHarvard Law Review, she served as a law clerk to Judge Patti Saris of \nthe District of Massachusetts, Judge Bruce Selya of the First Circuit, \nand Justice Stephen Breyer of the U.S. Supreme Court. When confirmed, \nshe will be the first female African-American judge appointed to the \ncourt in 32 years and the only one currently serving on the court. She \nhad her hearing last year and her confirmation could have been \nexpedited then. It was not and she is among those who had to be \nrenominated by the President this year. Her nomination was then \nreported unanimously in February by the Judiciary Committee.\n  The Senate was finally allowed to consider, as well, the nomination \nof Troy Nunley to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Eastern \nDistrict of California. That court has one of the heaviest caseloads \nper judge of any in the country. Judge Nunley could and should have \nbeen confirmed last year when the Judiciary Committee reported his \nnomination unanimously. Instead, he was among those Republican Senators \nrefused to consider before adjourning. The President had to renominate \nhim and the Senate Judiciary Committee again voted unanimously to \nproceed with his confirmation this year more than a month ago. He is \ncurrently a judge of the Superior Court of California and he served \npreviously as Deputy Attorney General for the California Department of \nJustice and as Deputy District Attorney for both the Sacramento County \nDistrict Attorney's Office and the Alameda County District Attorney's \nOffice. He has the support of both his home State Senators, Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Boxer.\n  The Senate will also vote on the nomination of Raymond Moore to fill \na judicial emergency vacancy in the District of Colorado. He currently \nserves as the Federal Public Defender in the Federal Public Defender's \nOffice for the Districts of Colorado and Wyoming in Denver, CO, where \nhe formerly served as the Acting Federal Public Defender and as an \nAssistant Federal Public Defender. Raymond Moore has also worked in \nprivate practice and served as a Federal prosecutor. He received the \nABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary's highest possible \nrating, unanimously ``well qualified,'' and has the support of his home \nState Senators, Senator Udall and Senator Bennet. He was reported \nunanimously last February by the Judiciary Committee.\n  There are still another 15 judicial nominees pending before the \nSenate. All of these nominees had to be renominated after being \nreturned at the end of the last Congress. It is unusual to have such a \nbacklog so early in a Congress, and this is the result of Senate \nRepublicans' refusal to allow votes on 11 nominees at the end of last \nyear, including Judge Nunley, and their refusal to consider another \nfour, which included the D.C. district court nominee being confirmed \ntoday, who had hearings and could have been expedited. We have yet to \nwork our way through the nominees who were available for Senate \nconsideration and confirmation last year. The delayed consideration of \nthose nominees, at this pace, could easily extend into June. I urge \nSenate Republicans to join with us so that we can clear the calendar \nand confirm these consensus nominees during the current work period. \nLet us come together in a bipartisan manner and restore the best \ntraditions of the Senate. The Americans who depend on our courts for \njustice deserve no less.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          [From the Atlantic]\n\n           How the Sequester Threatens the U.S. Legal System\n\n                           (By Andrew Cohen)\n\n       When the chief justice of the United States and the chief \n     judges of each of the federal circuits gavel down the semi-\n     annual meeting of the Judicial Conference of the United \n     States on Tuesday, they will have on their agenda an unusual \n     item: the alarming impact of the funding ``sequester'' on the \n     nation's federal court system. The world won't end if \n     students are denied the chance to tour the White House. It \n     will not end if our National Parks open days late this \n     spring. But citizens everywhere will see vital legal rights \n     denied or delayed by the forced budget cuts.\n       All of the constituencies of the judiciary agree on this \n     issue. Federal trial judges are quietly seething at the \n     inability of the legislative and executive branches to avoid \n     sequester. Federal public defenders, whose budgets have been \n     cut twice in two months, are furloughing and laying off \n     staff. The attorney general of the United States has \n     expressed grave concern on behalf of prosecutors and federal \n     law enforcement officials. And court administrators are \n     expressing alarm over the effect of the cuts upon federal \n     judicial services.\n       At the core of the problem is the fact that the judicial \n     branch is financially beholden to the other two branches of \n     government. This separation of powers was designed by our \n     nation's founders to limit the judiciary's independence, and \n     it has, and nowhere is this dynamic more visible than when a \n     chief justice like John Roberts has to grovel for funding or \n     otherwise justify the judiciary's minuscule portion of the \n     budget. If the sequester isn't unconstitutional per se, it is \n     causing an unconstitutional effect upon the swift, fair and \n     equal administration of justice.\n\n\n                    For Federal Court Administrators\n\n       In a letter forwarded last week to members of the House and \n     Senate Appropriations and Judiciary committees, U.S. District \n     Judge Thomas F. Hogan, the Reagan appointee who now serves as \n     director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, \n     succinctly described the scope of the problem:\n       Public safety will be impacted because there will be fewer \n     probation officers to supervise criminal offenders released \n     in our\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\n     communities. Funding for drug testing and mental health \n     treatment will be cut 20 percent. Delays in the processing of \n     civil and bankruptcy cases could threaten economic recovery. \n     There will be a 30 percent cut in funding for court security \n     systems and equipment and court security officers will be \n     required to work reduced hours, thus creating security \n     vulnerabilities throughout the federal court system. In our \n     defender services program, federal defender attorney staffing \n     levels will decline, which could compromise the integrity of \n     the defender function . . .\n       Dennis Courtland Hayes, president of the American \n     Judicature Society, the non-partisan national organization \n     dedicated to the preservation and improvement of the American \n     legal system, was even blunter in late February with the \n     statistics he offered:\n       Nationally, up to 2,000 more court staff could be laid off \n     or furloughed under sequestration. This would come on top of \n     the more than 1,800 positions eliminated by the courts over \n     the past 18 months, representing a potential 18% reduction in \n     court staff since July 2011 . . . Of particular concern to \n     the American Judicature Society, which has worked for decades \n     to improve access to the courts for self-represented \n     litigants, those people seeking justice without a lawyer \n     would have fewer services to help them navigate the judicial \n     system.\n       ``Sequestration's almost $350 million cut will not be fully \n     felt in one day, one month or even one year,'' Judge Hogan \n     wrote last week. ``Reductions of this magnitude strike at the \n     heart of our entire system of justice and spread throughout \n     the country. The longer the sequestration stays in place, the \n     more severe will be its impact on the courts and those who \n     use them.'' The federal judiciary is being held hostage, in \n     other words, because of the failure or the refusal of \n     Congress and the White House to make a responsible budget \n     deal.\n\n\n                      For Federal Public Defenders\n\n       If federal court administrators offer the big picture \n     impact of the sequestration, federal public defenders all \n     over the country are sharing the details on an office-by-\n     office basis. These stories are bad in two dimensions. First, \n     there is the grim business of laying off desperately needed \n     federal workers. Second, there is the impact those layoffs \n     will have on ordinary people who for one reason or another \n     are involved in the federal court system. It's really quite \n     simple: The people being laid off try each day to help the \n     rest of us secure our constitutional rights.\n       Let's start with Jon Sands, the longtime Federal Public \n     Defender for the District of Arizona. Last month, Sands was \n     forced to lay off 10 employees from the defenders' office. \n     There were more cuts to federal public defenders' offices \n     earlier this month (the Defender Program budget was slashed \n     5.17 percent in February and another 5.52 percent last week). \n     ``Even with the layoffs, I still must furlough,'' Sands told \n     me this weekend via email. He wrote:\n       We have clients who need mental health experts to examine \n     them, but whom must wait until the next budget allotment \n     comes. We have investigators who can no longer go to the \n     scenes of crimes, but call instead. We watch pennies so we \n     can order transcripts. The impact of sequestration in \n     criminal justice further makes the playing field uneven, \n     with DOJ able to shift resources, while we can't. We are \n     seeing offices shuttered, and staff sent home for 30, 40 \n     even possibly 90 days.\n       In Utah, when news of furloughs hit the federal PDs office, \n     Kathy Nester told me over the weekend that ``several \n     [Assistant Federal Public Defenders] stepped up to take extra \n     days because we have staff that are single moms and this \n     financial blow would be devastating to them and their kids.'' \n     Another federal public defender, who asked to remain \n     unidentified because of the nature of the situation, is \n     facing a thirty-day furlough and had to lay off four \n     employees. His story:\n       I laid off a young off a young [Assistant Federal Public \n     Defender] Thursday, and he said he still wanted to work for \n     us full-time while looking for other work. Makes me want to \n     cry. Laid off a clerical type in another office. She is going \n     for disability, but meanwhile, may come back 3 days a week \n     with no pay, and staff there are covering her bus fare and \n     coffee and lunch each day out of their own pockets. \n     Definitely makes me want to cry.\n       Other federal public defenders have been more formal with \n     their expressions of concern. In the Eastern District of \n     Virginia, Michael Nachmanoff, the Federal Public Defender, \n     informed the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals via letter \n     last week that ``at least seven public defender offices (and \n     one community defender office) . . . will be required to turn \n     down major case assignments--such as death penalty cases, \n     large white collar cases and representation of defendants \n     facing civil commitment''--as a result of the sequester.\n       Nachmanoff's counterpart in the Western District of New \n     York, Marianne Mariano, offers more examples of the impact of \n     the sequester upon federal judicial employees. In a letter \n     last week to Dennis Jacobs, the Chief Judge of the 2nd U. S. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, Mariano wrote: ``I anticipate all \n     attorneys and staff will be furloughed 22 days. I have one \n     employee who volunteered to take 28 days of leave without \n     pay.'' In the Northern District of Texas, federal public \n     defenders just warned judges that they ``anticipate a likely \n     need to withdraw from cases that require expert witnesses \n     because our budget for expert witnesses has been decimated.''\n\n\n                        For the American People\n\n       One federal public defender, who also asked to remain \n     anonymous because of the sensitivity of the current \n     situation, offered this overview of what sequestration will \n     mean to those who often need legal help and guidance the \n     most. He wrote:\n       Sequestration has hit the truly indigent clients of the \n     Federal Defender particularly hard. For example, Spanish-\n     speaking families often write moving letters of support for \n     relatives facing federal sentencing. Defenders have routinely \n     paid to translate these letters translated into English, and \n     these mitigation documents have played a central role in \n     federal sentencing. With budget cuts, however, Defenders can \n     no longer afford to pay outside interpreters the translation \n     fees. As a result, Spanish-speaking families have effectively \n     been silenced at sentencing, depriving indigent clients of \n     critical evidence in mitigation.\n       The cuts have been particularly brutal for mentally-ill \n     defendants. Many federal defendants suffer from a host of \n     mental illnesses, and retained psychiatric evaluations are \n     critical in determining competency, challenging allegations, \n     and ensuring proper psychotropic medication is administered. \n     Sequestration has devastated funds for these psychiatric \n     experts. As a result, Defenders are forced to rely on their \n     own lay knowledge, ``talk'' their client through appearances \n     and pleas, and struggle with the risk of first submitting to \n     an evaluation by government psychiatrists.\n       Even if you are not mentally ill, the sequester will impact \n     you. If you are a creditor or a debtor and you want to \n     resolve a bankruptcy in a timely fashion. If you are on \n     federal probation and you can't get in to see your officer. \n     If you are a state or local prosecutor and you no longer have \n     federal funds to help you prosecute drug cases. If you are \n     waiting for a federal drug test. If you are responsible for \n     courthouse security or care about the safety of judges and \n     court staff. If you want to go to trial in a civil case or \n     are charged with a federal crime.\n\n\n                      For Federal Law Enforcement\n\n       It's not easy on the other side of the fence, either. On \n     the one hand, Congress and the Obama Administration want \n     aggressive enforcement of criminal laws. On the other hand, \n     they have been willing through the sequester to financially \n     neuter the organizations directly responsible for such \n     enforcement. National Public Radio's Carrie Johnson, in a \n     smart report last week, revealed that Justice Department \n     employees already are receiving their furlough notices. The \n     FBI's abilities will be harmed, she reports. And then there \n     is this:\n       At that meeting in Washington this week, state attorneys \n     general worried about their share of the pie under a huge \n     federal grant program. Janet Mills, the attorney general in \n     Maine, was waving her hand with a question for Holder. \n     ``Could you please comment on the prospects for continued \n     funding through the Byrne grants for drug enforcement and \n     drug prosecutions and other criminal justice measures?'' \n     Mills asked. Holder said the states are right to worry about \n     federal participation in drug task forces and other money the \n     department sends to the states to help fight crime.\n       Crime--and specifically border patrol work. Word in Arizona \n     is that Operation Streamline, the longtime federal program of \n     aggressive arrest and prosecution of unlawful immigrants, \n     reportedly has been eased in the Ajo sector of the state as a \n     result of the sequester--evidently there isn't enough money \n     to pay for the overtime for law enforcement officials. For \n     his part, Attorney General Eric Holder told Senate Judiciary \n     Committee members during his appearance last week:\n       As we speak, these cuts are already having a significant \n     negative impact not just on Department employees, but on \n     programs that could directly impact the safety of Americans \n     across the country. Important law enforcement and litigation \n     programs are being disrupted. Our capacity--to respond to \n     crimes, investigate wrongdoing, and hold criminals \n     accountable--has been reduced. And, despite our best efforts \n     to limit the impact of sequestration, unless Congress quickly \n     passes a balanced deficit reduction plan, the effects of \n     these cuts--on our entire justice system, and on the American \n     people--may be profound.\n       Beyond a reasonable doubt, the sequester is having a \n     profound and pernicious effect on the government's ability to \n     observe its constitutional commands--and to provide justice \n     to its citizens. That's why the members of the Judicial \n     Conference have a difficult and delicate task this week. The \n     judges and administrators must adequately express the scope \n     of their concern, and effectively explain the impact the \n     sequester will have on the judiciary, without offending the \n     very politicians who control the federal judiciary's budget. \n     It's not right. It's not fair. It's a terrible testament to \n     judicial independence. But sadly it's the way the politics of \n     law works in America today.\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                      Administrative Office of the\n\n\n                                         United States Courts,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Administrative Office of the United \n     States Courts (AO) recently received several requests for \n     information about how the Judiciary is preparing to handle \n     the impact of funding sequestration. The Judiciary's efforts \n     to address this budgetary emergency have been extensive, \n     involving countless hours spent by judges, and court and AO \n     staff working to determine how best to withstand the severe \n     cuts while still continuing to perform core constitutional \n     duties. As background, following months of information \n     gathering and planning, the Executive Committee met on \n     December 19, 2012, to consider proposed actions to deal with \n     the impact of sequestration on the federal courts. With \n     enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the \n     subsequent delay in the effective date of sequestration, from \n     January 2 to March 1, 2013, the Executive Committee met again \n     on February 7, 2013, to finalize actions based on updated \n     sequestration calculations for the Judiciary.\n       We consider the emergency measures approved by the \n     Executive Committee (discussed below) to be one-time only. \n     They cannot be sustained beyond fiscal year 2013 and will be \n     difficult and painful to implement. The Judiciary cannot \n     continue to operate at such drastically reduced funding \n     levels without seriously compromising the constitutional \n     mission of the federal courts. This is especially true if \n     those funding levels continue into fiscal year 2014 and \n     beyond. We are hopeful that Congress and the Administration \n     will ultimately reach agreement on alternative deficit \n     reduction measures that render the current sequestration cuts \n     unnecessary.\n       The Executive Committee approved a number of emergency \n     measures that applied primarily to the non-salary parts of \n     the Judiciary budget. Because of our decentralized budget and \n     management system for the courts, the planning is primarily \n     done on the local level. The goal of the emergency measures \n     was to minimize the impact of sequestration on court staff by \n     providing maximum flexibility to court managers. This was \n     only partially successful. The sequestration cuts that went \n     into effect March 1, 2013, total nearly $350 million for the \n     Federal Judiciary. Fiscal year 2013 court allotments on a \n     national level would have declined by 14.6 percent below \n     fiscal year 2012 allotments. Instead, after applying the \n     emergency measures, court allotments have declined by 10.4 \n     percent below fiscal year 2012 allotments. While this is a \n     marked improvement, the allotments, after sequestration and \n     implementation of the emergency measures, could still result \n     in up to 2,000 on-board employees being laid off or thousands \n     of employees facing furloughs for one day each pay period (a \n     10 percent pay cut). These sequestration staffing losses \n     would come on top of the almost 9 percent decline in staff \n     (over 1,800 probation officers and clerks' office staff) that \n     has already been experienced in the courts since July 2011.\n       These budget reductions to the Judiciary will have serious \n     implications for the administration of justice and the rule \n     of law. Public safety will be impacted because there will be \n     fewer probation officers to supervise criminal offenders \n     released in our communities. Funding for drug testing and \n     mental health treatment will be cut 20 percent. Delays in the \n     processing of civil and bankruptcy cases could threaten \n     economic recovery. There will be a 30 percent cut in funding \n     for court security systems and equipment and court security \n     officers will be required to work reduced hours, thus \n     creating security vulnerabilities throughout the federal \n     court system. In our defender services program, federal \n     defender attorney staffing levels will decline, which could \n     compromise our defender function, and delay payments to \n     private attorneys appointed under the Criminal Justice Act \n     could for nearly three weeks in September. Sequestration will \n     also require deep cuts in our information technology programs \n     on which we depend for our daily case processing and on which \n     we have successfully relied in past years to achieve \n     efficiencies and limit growth in our budget.\n       I have enclosed for your information a description of \n     guidance regarding sequestration given to federal courts \n     nationwide in late February. While some of it is technical in \n     nature, our guidance provides important information for the \n     courts on funding levels under sequestration as well as \n     practices for managing payroll and personnel activities under \n     sequestration. As the enclosed description indicates, \n     decisions about court closures, furloughing staff or other \n     adverse personnel actions, managing court operations at lower \n     funding levels, and salary policies under sequestration, \n     reside with each court unit. Allowing individual court units \n     to set their own funding priorities under sequestration is \n     consistent with the decentralized structure of the federal \n     court system and long established Judiciary budget execution \n     policies. I have, however, urged courts to delay \n     implementation of any involuntary personnel actions, such as \n     furloughs or terminations, until April when we hope to have a \n     clearer picture of full-year funding for fiscal year 2013.\n       I hope this letter has provided you with insight into the \n     actions we are taking to address sequestration as well as the \n     devastating impact the cuts will have on the administration \n     of justice in this country.\n       This letter is being provided in similar form to the \n     chairman and ranking minority member of the House and Senate \n     Judiciary Committees and to the chairman and ranking minority \n     member of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees and \n     their relevant subcommittees. If you require any additional \n     information, please contact our Office of Legislative \n     Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Thomas F.

Ham is \nretiring from the U.S. Army and his current position as Commander of \nthe U.S. Africa Command. On this occasion I believe it is fitting to \nrecognize General Ham's years of uniformed service to our Nation.\n  General Ham has served and led at all levels in the Army. He began \nhis career as an enlisted infantryman in the 82nd Airborne Division and \nhe retires as a theater level commander. He was commissioned as a \nsecond lieutenant through the Reserve Officers' Training Corps in the \nInfantry as a Distinguished Military Graduate of John Carroll \nUniversity in Cleveland, OH in 1976. General Ham's distinguished \nmilitary service has taken him all over the United States, Italy and \nGermany. Prior to his current command he served as the commanding \ngeneral of U.S. Army Europe.\n  During these last 24 months as Commander, U.S. Africa Command, he has \nled combat operations to oust a tyrant, coordinated economic and \ninfrastructural development programs to improve conditions on the \nground, and orchestrated international security cooperation activities \naimed at strengthening the abilities of American and African forces to \ndeal with the range of complex challenges facing the continent. These \nwere no small tasks and all the while he continued to make the well-\nbeing of our service men and women his highest priority. I can think of \nno better leader to have had carrying the guidon!\n  Our Nation and our international partners will feel the loss of this \ndistinguished soldier and statesman. I join many members of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee in expressing my respect and gratitude to \nGeneral Ham for his outstanding service to our Nation. The strength of \nour Nation is our Army; the strength of our Army is our soldiers. Thank \nyou, General Ham, for your service as a soldier and general, and for \nkeeping our Nation Army Strong!

Mr. President, today I honor an exceptional warrior. \nAfter a lifetime of service to our Nation, Gen. John R. Allen is \nretiring from the U.S. Marine Corps. On this occasion I believe it is \nfitting to recognize General Allen's years of uniformed service to our \nNation.\n  The general was commissioned a second lieutenant following graduation \nfrom the Naval Academy with the class of 1976. He has led at every \nlevel from platoon to theater command, including being the first Marine \nCommandant of the U.S. Naval Academy. He spent 2 years in Iraq's Anbar \nprovince, where he led an effort to reach out to Sunni tribal leaders \nto try to persuade them to stand against al-Qaida militants--a shift \nthat helped turn the course of the war in western Iraq. And during his \nrecent command in Afghanistan, which he proclaimed to be ``the honor of \na lifetime,'' he spent 19 months winding down America's longest war \nwhile strengthening Afghanistan's military to fight insurgency.\n  General Allen's record of service is remarkable and highly decorated. \nHe has distinguished himself in every aspect from graduating with \nacademic honors to receiving some of the highest military awards of the \nU.S. and foreign armed forces. However, he recognizes the most \nimportant distinction, and that is his family. In the last decade he \nhas spent plenty of time away from his family in service to our Nation. \nHe said that his family had not vacationed\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\nsince his two adult daughters were young. His service and sacrifice \nwill truly be missed by a grateful nation, and we hope that he gets \nthat vacation he so clearly deserves and more.\n  Our Nation will feel the loss of this distinguished officer, warrior \nand patriot; however, I have the utmost respect for his decision to put \nhis family first. I join many members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in expressing my respect and gratitude to General Allen for \nhis outstanding service to our Nation.

Mr. President, today I honor an exceptional warrior and \nscholar. After a lifetime of service to our Nation, Gen. James N. \nMattis is retiring from the U.S. Marine Corps and his current position \nas Commander of the United States Central Command. On this occasion I \nbelieve it is fitting to recognize General Mattis' 41 years of \nuniformed service to our Nation.\n  The general was commissioned a second lieutenant on January 1, 1972. \nHe has served in every major combat operation of his era and led at \nevery level from platoon to theater command. Upon promotion to \nbrigadier general, he commanded first the 1st Marine Expeditionary \nBrigade and then Task Force 58, during Operation Enduring Freedom in \nsouthern Afghanistan. As a major general, he commanded the 1st Marine \nDivision during the initial attack and subsequent stability operations \nin Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. General Mattis led marines into \nAfghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003--the defining conflicts of our \nage.\n  General Mattis is well known for his dedication and intellect. When \nselected to command the U.S. Central Command, then Secretary of \nDefense, Robert Gates, called him ``one of the military's most \ninnovative and iconoclastic thinkers.'' He has proved to be that and \nmore. General Mattis is known to carry books on philosophy with him on \nevery combat mission. He is said to have a personal library of over \n6,000 books that he takes with him to every new command. Even more \nimportant than his intellect and bravery, is his ability to connect \nwith and lead our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. In March 2003, \nhe wrote a letter to all forces under his command, telling them to \n``engage your brain before you engage your weapon.'' I have had the \npleasure of meeting those under his command and am always impressed by \nthe respect and favor he carries amongst them.\n  I most respect General Mattis' willingness to speak truth to power. \nHis candor is a facet of a professionalism that has been exacted over a \nlifetime and exercised during a most impressive military career. \nThoughtful leaders throughout government will feel his absence. I join \nmany past and present members of the Senate Armed Services Committee in \nmy gratitude to General Mattis for his outstanding leadership and his \nunwavering support of servicemembers. General James Mattis' service has \nevinced the meaning of the words ``Semper Fidelis.'' I wish him ``fair \nwinds and following seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/08/senate-section/article/S2453-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RIDING FOR CHANGE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last month a group of 26 cyclists set off \non a 3-day, 400 mile journey from Newtown, CT, to the steps of our \nNation's Capitol. They began their ride with a stop at Sandy Hook \nElementary School, a place that should be synonymous with childhood, \ninnocence, and learning. Instead, for now, it reminds us of tragedy. \nThe cyclists left Newtown that morning to bring Washington a simple \nmessage: It is time for Congress to finally take steps to stop gun \nviolence.\n  These riders were not special interest groups or highly paid \nlobbyists. They were everyday people--teachers, police officers, \nlibrarians, healthcare professionals. People like Heather Peck, a \nschool psychologist and mother of two from Newtown, who wrote that she \nwas riding ``for those beautiful smiling faces that I see coming down \nthe hallway each day and their right to feel safe and secure at \nschool.'' Like Gary Lyke of Brookfield, CT, a Vietnam veteran who wrote \nthat he was riding ``in the hope I can help encourage our leaders to \njoin in creating meaningful, common sense laws making it safe for \nchildren to grow and inherit the freedoms I and other veterans served \nfor.'' Like Officer Jeff Silver of the Newtown Department of Police \nServices, who wrote simply, ``I ride for commonsense gun control \nlaws.''\n  But sadly, in a Nation where polls have shown that a majority of \nAmericans support background checks for all gun sales, the status quo \ndefies common sense. Around our country today, anyone, including \nconvicted felons or domestic abusers or the mentally ill, can go to a \ngun show and purchase a firearm without having to pass any sort of \nbackground check. Studies have estimated that 40 percent of U.S. gun \nsales are conducted by unlicensed sellers without background checks. In \n2012, an estimated 6.6 million guns were sold in this way, no questions \nasked.\n  Likewise, in a Nation where studies have shown that mass shootings \ninvolving assault weapons result in an average of 14.8 people shot. It \nis startling that almost anyone can walk into a shop or gun show and \npurchase the same type of military-style assault rifle that was used at \nSandy Hook Elementary that horrible day. This includes suspected \nterrorists, because nothing in current law prohibits individuals on \nterrorist watch lists from purchasing firearms, unless they fall into \nanother disqualifying category. Polls have shown that 63 percent of \nAmericans support a ban on the assault weapons and high-capacity \nammunition magazines that lead to such horrific crimes.\n  Legislation has already been introduced into the Senate that, if \nenacted, would make our society and our schools safer. For example, I \nam a cosponsor of the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous \nTerrorists Act. This bill would close the `terror gap' in Federal law \nby denying the transfer of a firearm when a Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, FBI, background check reveals that the prospective \npurchaser is a suspected terrorist and the Attorney General has a \nreasonable belief that the purchaser may use the firearm in connection \nwith terrorism. I am also a cosponsor of the Assault Weapons Ban of \n2013, which would stop the flood of military-style assault weapons into \nour society.\n  We should listen to the Sandy Hook riders and take action. We should \nlisten to our law enforcement communities, who have implored us to ban \nthe military-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines which \ncan so easily escalate confrontation into murder and a killing of one \nor two people into a massive slaughter. No law can prevent all \ntragedies, but these bills could help prevent some. They could help \nstop another quiet elementary school from falling victim to a Sandy \nHook tragedy. They could help save the lives of children. That is more \nthan enough reason to act. I urge my colleagues to swiftly take up and \npass these measures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/08/senate-section/article/S2453-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2453-S2454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FISHING RESTRICTIONS PREVENTION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Her \nstrong commitment to her community showed in everything she did. She \nwas a State committeewoman, chair of the 41st LD Democrats, and a \ndelegate to the Democratic National Convention too many times to count.\n  But more importantly, she was a dedicated mother, grandmother, wife, \nand friend to many.\n  You could always count on Barb helping out.

No matter how small the task, Barb would \nmake it fun.\n  As a longtime Mercer Island resident, her kindness and grace inspired \nall who were around her.\n  Barb passed away on March 17, 2013, from pancreatic cancer at the age \nof 71.\n  Barb is survived by her husband Art, her two children, Randy and \nBetsy Geller, daughter-in-law Jennifer Hubbard Geller, and her two \ngrandchildren, Rachel and Lucy Geller.\n  She will be missed by many, but her legacy of service will live on \nwith all she has touched.\n  I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in paying homage to \nBarbara Geller.

Mr. President, I would like to call attention to \nPurple Up! for Military Kids Day in Alaska celebrated on April 19th as \npart of the Month of the Military Child. Every April since 1986, to \nhonor the unique contributions and sacrifices military children make in \nsupport of their parents, the Department of Defense names April as the \nMonth of the Military Child.\n  On a designated day in April, people across the United States and in \nAlaska come together by wearing purple in honor of our servicemembers' \nchildren. Nationwide, more than two million kids have a parent or \nparents serving in either an Active Duty or Reserve role for the U.S. \nArmed Forces. In my home State of Alaska, more than 13,000 children \nhave one or more parents on full-time duty status in the military.\n  Purple Up! is a fun way to show our support and is an opportunity to \ncall attention to these special challenges faced by military kids.\n  The frequent moves and multiple deployments faced by these families \nadd even more strain to the difficult task of growing up.

It allows families living in FEMA-\ndesignated flood plains to rebuild their home in the event it is \ndestroyed by fire.\n  The bill allows communities to waive requirements that were meant to \nblock reconstruction after floods, but have been applied to block \nreconstruction of homes after fires and other natural disasters as \nwell.\n  I was first made aware of this issue by a constituent from \nSacramento. Her home in the Natomas neighborhood burned down, and when \nshe applied for a permit to rebuild it she was denied. The County \ninformed her that FEMA floodplain regulations required her to elevate \nthe home 20 feet above ground level because of existing deficiencies in \nthe levee protecting her neighborhood.\n  Can you imagine what that would look like? Every house in the \nneighborhood at ground level, and one home towering 20 feet above the \nrest?\n  More importantly though, the cost would be exorbitant. And it would \nbe imposed by the federal government on a family trying to get back on \nits feet after a personal tragedy.\n  When the home burned down, the family collected $71,000 from their \ninsurance company. Contractors estimated the cost to restore the home \nto its original condition was $170,000--a significant burden, but one \nthe family was willing to bear.\n  But when the family factored in the cost of elevating their home 20 \nfeet, the cost skyrocketed. Contractors estimated the elevation project \nwould cost an additional $200,000.\n  Just to restore their home to its previous size and condition, the \nfamily would owe $300,000 more than what they received from their \ninsurance.\n  There is a fundamental issue of fairness at stake.\n  This family tragically lost their home and many of their personal \nbelongings. But instead of helping the\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\nfamily during this difficult time, the federal government is instead \nblocking them from rebuilding. Why? Because the federal government has \nfailed to maintain adequate flood protection.\n  It just doesn't seem fair.\n  The Fire-Damaged Home Rebuilding Act addresses this issue by allowing \nlocal communities to grant variances to FEMA flood plain regulations \nwithout jeopardizing their participation in the program.\n  The legislation allows waivers to be granted only if all of the \nfollowing conditions are met.\n  Communities must already have taken steps to repair damaged levees, \nsuch as seeking Federal authorization of a levee project, and there \nmust be previously existing plans to obtain the requisite 100-year \nflood protection in the near future.\n  The destroyed house must be within a deep floodplain where it would \nbe too expensive and unsightly to elevate the home.\n  The new home must be built within the footprint of the destroyed \nstructure.\n  The homeowner cannot qualify for new insurance discounts; and the \nproperty has never been associated with a claim to the National Flood \nInsurance Program.\n  Representative Doris Matsui and I worked with FEMA to ensure that \nthese limitations will only allow individual to rebuild very limited \ncircumstances.\n  I strongly oppose new development in the flood plain. It is \nirresponsible to permit new homes or businesses in an area where you \nknow that flooding is likely.\n  But rebuilding a single existing home after a tragic fire is \ndifferent than building a new tract of homes. If an entire neighborhood \nis burned down, for instance, it should be rebuilt at a safe level. A \nsingle home is also different than building new schools or new shopping \nmalls, which would be prohibited under the bill.\n  But just to be sure that local governments don't abuse this power, \nthe number of waivers they can approve is capped at ten per year. We \nneed to make sure that the waiver is used judiciously.\n  The FEMA regulations were put in place to block individual homeowners \nfrom voluntarily renovating and improving their homes. It was also \ndesigned to block homeowners from rebuilding after a flood. By doing \nso, the federal government limits its liability for future flood \ninsurance claims.\n  I agree with the goals of those FEMA regulations. But fire-damaged \nhomes clearly do not fit in either category. So we need to adjust the \nlaw to eliminate an unfortunate and unintended consequence of an \notherwise good policy.\n  City and County governments must be empowered to make case by case \njudgments about whether it makes sense to elevate damaged structures by \n10, 15, or 20 feet when the rest of the neighborhood remains at ground \nlevel.\n  That is exactly what the Fire-Damaged Home Reconstruction Act does. \nIt provides limited authority to local governments, which will allow \nthem to do what makes sense for their communities.\n  This is a commonsense piece of legislation, and I hope my colleagues \nwill work to quickly adopt the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/08/senate-section/article/S2457-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 92--AUTHORIZING THE EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                             THE JUDICIARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nthe Judiciary; which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                               S.

The Presiding Officer \n     may sustain the point of order as to some or all of the \n     provisions against which the Senator raised the point of \n     order. If the Presiding Officer so sustains the point of \n     order as to some of the provisions (including provisions of \n     an amendment, motion, or conference report) against which the \n     Senator raised the point of order, then only those provisions \n     (including provision of an amendment, motion, or conference \n     report) against which the Presiding Officer sustains the \n     point of order shall be deemed stricken pursuant to this \n     section. Before the Presiding Officer rules on such a point \n     of order, any Senator may move to waive such a point of order \n     as it applies to some or all of the provisions against which \n     the point of order was raised. Such a motion to waive is \n     amendable in accordance with rules and precedents of the \n     Senate.

Any such motion shall be debatable. In any case \n     in which such point of order is sustained against a \n     conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such \n     conference report by operation of this subsection), no \n     further amendment shall be in order.\n\n     SEC. 405. SUPERMAJORITY ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       Section 425(a)(1) and (2) of the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974 shall be subject to the waiver and appeal \n     requirements of subsections (c)(2) and (d)(3) of section 904 \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n     SEC. 406.

EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       Congress adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, \n     and as such they shall be considered as part of the rules of \n     the Senate and such rules shall supersede other rules only to \n     the extent that they are inconsistent with such other rules; \n     and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     the Senate to change those rules at any time, in the same \n     manner, and to the same extent as is the case of any other \n     rule of the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 416.

SENSE OF SENATE ON UNDERUTILIZED FACILITIES OF THE \n                   NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION \n                   AND THEIR POTENTIAL USE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     (NASA) is the ninth largest real property holder of the \n     Federal Government, with more than 124,000 acres and more \n     than 4,900 buildings and other structures with a replacement \n     value of more than $30,000,000,000.\n       (2) The annual operation and maintenance costs of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration have increased \n     steadily, and, as of 2012, the Administration has more than \n     $2,300,000,000 in annual deferred maintenance costs.\n       (3) According to Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the \n     Administration continues to retain real property that is \n     underutilized, does not have identified future mission uses, \n     or is duplicative of other assets in its real property \n     inventory.\n       (4) The Office of Inspector General, the Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO), and Congress have identified the \n     aging and duplicative infrastructure of the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration as a high priority and \n     longstanding management challenge.\n       (5) In the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, Congress \n     directed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to \n     examine its real property assets and downsize to fit current \n     and future missions and expected funding levels, paying \n     particular attention to identifying and removing unneeded or \n     duplicative infrastructure.\n       (6) The Office of Inspector General found at least 33 \n     facilities, including wind tunnels, test stands, airfields, \n     and launch infrastructure, that were underutilized or for \n     which National Aeronautics and Space Administration managers \n     could not identify a future mission use and that the need for \n     these facilities have declined in recent years as a result of \n     changes in the mission focus of the Administration, the \n     condition and obsolescence of some facilities, and the advent \n     of alternative testing methods.\n       (7) The Office of Inspector General found that the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration has taken steps to \n     minimize the costs of continuing to maintain some of these \n     facilities by placing them in an inactive state or leasing \n     them to other parties.\n       (8) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has a \n     series of initiatives underway that, in the judgment of the \n     Office of Inspector General, are ``positive steps towards \n     `rightsizing' its real property footprint'', and the Office \n     of Inspector General has concluded that ``it is imperative \n     that NASA move forward aggressively with its infrastructure \n     reduction efforts''.\n       (9) Existing and emerging United States commercial launch \n     and exploration capabilities are providing cargo \n     transportation to the International Space Station and offer \n     the potential for providing crew support, access to the \n     International Space Station, and missions to low Earth orbit \n     while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     focuses its efforts on heavy-lift capabilities and deep space \n     missions.\n       (10) National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     facilities and property that are underutilized, duplicative, \n     or no longer needed for Administration requirements could be \n     utilized by commercial users and State and local entities, \n     resulting in savings for the Administration and a reduction \n     in the burden of the Federal Government to fund space \n     operations.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this concurrent resolution assume--\n       (1) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     should move forward with plans to reduce its infrastructure \n     and, to the greatest extent practicable, make property \n     available for lease to a government or private tenant or \n     report the property to the General Services Administration \n     (GSA) for sale or transfer to another entity;\n       (2) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     should pursue opportunities for\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\n     streamlined sale or lease of property and facilities, \n     including for exclusive use, to a private entity, or \n     expedited conveyance or transfer to a State or political \n     subdivision, municipality, instrumentality of a State, or \n     Department of Transportation-licensed launch site operators \n     for the promotion of commercial or
