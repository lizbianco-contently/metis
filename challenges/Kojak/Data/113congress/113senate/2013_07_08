The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1238) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     to extend the current reduced interest rate for undergraduate \n     Federal Direct Stafford Loans for 1 year, to modify required \n     distribution rules for pension plans, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at 5 p.m. the Senate will proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the nomination of Gregory Phillips of \nWyoming to be U.S. circuit judge for the Tenth Circuit. At 5:30 p.m. \nthis evening there will be a rollcall vote on confirmation of the \nPhillips nomination.\n\n\n                     Passing Bipartisan Legislation\n\n  Mr. REID. I welcome back the Presiding Officer, the President pro \ntempore of the Senate. I hope he and all of my colleagues had a restful \nand productive week with the instate work that was done during the 10 \ndays we were gone.\n  It was a pleasure to meet and spend time with my constituents in \nNevada over the break and with my family. I had a wonderful time with \nmy family. Four of my children were there--actually, five were there \nfor a short period of time, all five of them. We had a wonderful Fourth \nof July at my son's home. Everyone was there--neighbors. There was a \ngreat party. My grandson set off the fireworks. I am not going to ask \nwhere he got them, but there were a lot of fireworks and there was a \nlot of fun. It was a real celebration.\n  Everywhere I went I saw immense enthusiasm for this historic \nbipartisan immigration reform bill we passed before the Fourth of July. \nOften I heard how pleased Nevadans were to finally see bipartisanship \nin the Senate. They saw bipartisanship blossom. This has happened far \ntoo rarely in recent years. Americans of all political stripes are \nunited behind the need for commonsense reform. Even a large majority of \nRepublicans believes immigration reform will be good for the economy \nand good for national security.\n  As everyone here knows, I don't often tout the accomplishments of \nPresident Bush--Bush No. 2--but I really appreciate what he did at the \nfirst public event at his new library in Texas. It was an event \nhonoring into our country new immigrants to become citizens. After the \nevent, the President spoke about the need for passing the Senate bill. \nWhen he was President, to his credit, he did everything he could to try \nto get it done, but Republicans would not follow the direction he felt \nwe should go. Senate Republicans did follow that in the last vote. We \nhad 68 votes, and 14 of my Republican colleagues voted with us. I \nappreciate that, and I appreciate what President Bush did to focus his \nattention on this again.\n  I appreciate all the groups around the country, from the chamber of \ncommerce to other conservative groups, who are running paid \nadvertisements on television saying they--the Republicans here in the \nHouse--should pass the legislation we passed here. The only Republicans \nwho aren't yet convinced are in Washington in the House of \nRepresentatives. Republicans around the country believe it is important \nthat we do this immigration reform legislation. As I indicated, 68 \nSenators voted for this historic reform, but our responsibility didn't \nend with that vote. It is our duty to convince our colleagues in the \nHouse that, yes, they should vote with us.\n  Bipartisan immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship \nmakes economic sense as well as political sense. Unfortunately, over \nthe last few weeks Speaker Boehner has taken a different route that is \none of ignoring the needs of the American people. Rather than moving to \nthe center and advancing a bill that would appeal to moderates on both \nsides of the Capitol, Speaker Boehner has repeatedly tried to pass \nlegislation with only Republican votes.\n  The Hastert rule, named after a recent Republican Speaker--passing \nonly\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\nbills that have the support of the majority of the majority, the only \nthing they are going to let happen--doesn't work, and it is bad for the \ncountry. Any major legislation passed by the House of Representatives \nwith only Republican votes has no hope of advancing here or being \nsigned into law by the President.\n  I hope the Speaker has learned his lesson from recent high-profile \nfailures of his shortsighted Hastert rule--post office, farm bill, \nonline sales tax, immigration. Eventually he will be forced to take up \nthe bill we passed here or the country will be left with no immigration \nreform at all, which will be a bad outcome.\n  The Speaker should dispense with the posturing and delay and do the \nright thing, and he should do it now. He should take up the Senate farm \nbill on which Chairman Stabenow worked so hard. They should pass that \nbill. They should take it up over there and pass it. Farmers are \nwaiting, and all the nutrition groups around the country are waiting. \nHe should do that right now.\n  He should take up the Senate immigration bill. I say that for the \nsecond or third time today. This measure--a farm bill that passed \noverwhelmingly on bipartisan votes in this Chamber--the passing of the \nfarm bill would create jobs and reduce the debt by some $23 billion. \nAnd it is important to note that there are reforms both in the farm and \nfood stamp programs without balancing the budget on the backs of hungry \nAmericans. In fact, it goes a long way toward reducing our debt.\n  Passing the immigration bill would help 11 million people who are \nalready contributing to our economy and our society to get right with \nthe law. It would boost our economy and make our country safer, all the \nwhile reducing the deficit by about $1 trillion over the next two \ndecades.\n  I remind the Speaker that there is no shame in passing bills that \nmoderates from both parties can support. Americans want their elected \nofficials to work together to fix the Nation's problems. This is what \nwe did in the Senate. I promise the formula will work in the House of \nRepresentatives as well. The Speaker should try that.\n  Sticking to the Hastert rule has prevented the House from passing \nlegislation to reform the ailing Postal Service. Postal reform passed \nover here on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. The Speaker refused to \neven consider it last Congress, didn't even take it up.\n  Sticking to the Hastert rule prevented the House from passing a \nmeasure that would give brick-and-mortar stores parity with online \ncompetitors. We passed that on a bipartisan vote. It is heartbreaking \nall over America. I see it in Nevada when I go by these strip malls and \nsee places that, if they had the advantage of not having to pay sales \ntax--which is what happens online--they would be in business. They \nwould go back into business if the sales tax would have to be paid by \nthe people who sell their goods over the Internet. It is unfair. Why \nthe Speaker doesn't take that up I don't know.\n  We already know that sticking to the Hastert rule prevented the House \nfrom passing a farm bill last month and last year.\n  This month sticking to the Hastert rule prevented the House from \npassing immigration reform that would become law.\n  Insisting on the Hastert rule also prevented Speaker Boehner from \nreaching across the aisle to find a sensible solution to our rising \nstudent loan interest rates. Right now, what they have done on the \nother side is worse for students than doing nothing at all. The \nlegislation passed by the House would balance the budget on the backs \nof struggling students--would attempt to balance it, at least. The \nHouse legislation is worse for students than doing nothing at all. \nUnder the House plan, as interest rates start to rise, student loan \nrates will rise with them. Soon loan rates will be more than double. I \nmet with the White House, one of the President's assistants. I said: \nTell me what happens in 3 years. He had to acknowledge that the rates \nwould be well over 6.8 percent.\n  To find a responsible solution to the student loan issue and every \nother major issue facing this Congress, the Speaker should work with us \nand his Democratic colleagues in the House instead of against them. He \nshould remember that the only way to pass meaningful legislation in \neither Chamber is to do so with votes from both reasonable Democrats \nand reasonable Republicans.\n  I am told the Speaker is going to come out with a statement today \nsaying: We passed our student loan legislation. Now why can't the \nSenate pass it?\n  I repeat, the Speaker's student loan legislation that passed the \nHouse is worse than doing nothing. The Hastert rule has been bad for \nthis country, and Speaker Boehner should get away from it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/08/senate-section/article/S5514-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

It is indeed a humbling honor to serve the great people of \nSouth Carolina in the Senate. I am so grateful for the support I have \nreceived from South Carolinians.\n  The success of the Palmetto State can be measured in many ways, but \ntoday, let me share the success of our economic engine. From insourcing \njobs from other countries, jobs such as Otis Elevators in Florence, SC, \nor the high-tech boom that is happening throughout South Carolina, \ncompanies such as BMW in the upstate continue to expand. Michelin, in \nAnderson County expands. Continental Tires finds a home in Sumter, SC, \nand there are more than 5,000 new jobs on the coast of South Carolina \nbecause of Boeing. And let's not forget Aiken, SC, where Bridgestone \nhas made a new home. South Carolina is and will continue to be a \nleading manufacturing engine for America.\n  I stand before you today on the shoulders of two very amazing \nAmericans. One has gone home to be with the Lord. The other is my hero, \nmy mother, Frances Scott.\n  Growing up in a single-parent household, my mother would have to work \nsometimes 16-hour days in order to keep me and my brother off of \nwelfare. She wanted us to have a good example of someone who believed \nin hard work for us to follow.\n  My mother used to tell me all the time that if you shoot for the Moon \nand you miss, you will be among the stars. But I didn't always listen \nto my mother. By the time I was a freshman in high school, I was \ndrifting. Have you ever noticed that you don't really drift in the \nright direction? As a freshman in high school, I failed out. I failed \nworld geography. I think I am the only U.S. Senator to fail civics. I \nalso failed Spanish and English.\n  When you fail Spanish and English, they don't call you bilingual. \nThey call you bi-ignorant because you can't speak in any language.\n  That's where I found myself. I found myself in a very strong and hard \nposition, but good fortune strikes. I had two blessings. One was a \nmother who believes that sometimes love has to come at the end of the \nswitch. For those of you who are not aware of what a switch is, it is a \nmotivational apparatus, and it encouraged me a lot. I will say that, \nalong with my mentor John Moniz, who came along at the right time--I \nwas a sophomore--I found my way back on the path. John Moniz was a \nChick-fil-A operator who made such a major impact in my life over the \nlast three decades.\n\n[[Page S5515]]\n\n  John came along as I was a sophomore in high school, and he taught me \nsome very, very valuable lessons. A couple of those lessons John \nstarted teaching me very early on were about being a business owner. \nJohn believed that you could literally think your way out of \npoverty. You didn't have to be an entertainer or an athlete, but you \ncould become an entrepreneur. So John started teaching me some of the \nlessons of being a business owner. He said having a job is a good \nthing, but creating jobs is even better.\n\n  John would teach me later that in earning an income, you have done \nwell. But if you can learn to create a profit, you have done \nfantastically. He taught me some other lessons about individual \nresponsibility. John once told me: If you don't like where you are, \nlook in the mirror. Blame yourself. John was trying to teach me some \nvery valuable lessons about individual responsibility.\n  I learned very quickly from John that if you were a part of the \nproblem, you were also part of the promise; that in fact if you saw \nyourself as a part of your obstacle, you may have found the key \ningredient to your opportunities. It took a little time before the \nlessons of my mentor and the strong discipline of my mother started to \ngerminate in my soul, but it finally did.\n  After 4 years of having John as my mentor, something very tragic \nhappened. At the young age of 38, John suddenly passed away. I remember \nthe day before his funeral as though it were yesterday. I sat down and \nwrote out my mission statement: to positively impact the lives of a \nbillion people with the message of hope and opportunity--hope being my \nfaith in Christ Jesus and opportunity being the lessons of financial \nliteracy and financial independence I learned from my mentor John \nMoniz.\n  I decided to follow in the footsteps of my mentor John. I started my \nown business, and I learned very quickly the challenges of signing the \nfront of the paycheck when you could not sign the back for yourself. \nOver the last two decades, as a business owner and as an elected \nofficial--whether it was as a member of the county council or a member \nof the South Carolina House of Representatives or being elected to the \nU.S. Congress--I have used as my foundation the lessons I learned from \nmy mentor and my mother.\n  During my time here in the Senate I will focus on a few key issues, \nincluding education, economic empowerment, and controlling our spending \naddiction. As a small business owner over the last 15 years I can tell \nyou firsthand that our Tax Code is broken. With the highest corporate \ntax rate in all the world, and the taxing of small and family-owned \nbusinesses at an alarming rate, we will continue to produce a slow-\ngrowth economy.\n  The regulatory nightmare facing our small business owners today is \nonly worsened by the ``Unaffordable Care Act,'' as my good friend \nCongressman Kucinich said yesterday.\n  Further, with over 70,000 pages of new regulations in the last 5 \nyears, the compliance cost for small business is staggering. We do not \nsimply need a delay in the employer mandate, we need a repeal of the \nemployer mandate.\n  On education, I can tell you as a poor kid, by the time I was in the \nfourth grade, I had already attended four schools. It is very difficult \nfor us to fund the right school with the sometimes transient nature of \npoverty where you have to move a lot. I believe the system and the \npeople closest to the child are in the best position to provide the \nhighest quality of education for that child. So there is no way a \nbureaucrat in Washington, DC, can better educate a child in Lexington \nCounty than that child's parents and the teachers who are so involved \nin that education.\n  We need a national debate on education. Parents need more choices so \ntheir kids will have a chance. So let's debate it. Let's debate charter \nschools, let's debate public school choice, private school choice, tax \ncredits, home schools. Whatever it takes to improve our education \nsystem should be on the table for discussion.\n  Let me close with this. If we create a competitive Tax Code and a \nfair, sensible regulatory environment, as well as a world-class \neducation system, we will create the best economy known to man, as we \nhave in times past. You see, the best and the brightest days are still \nahead for America. Our strongest moments, our strongest stands, are \nstill in our future. I believe in the greatness of America because I \nhave experienced the goodness of her people. In America, an ordinary \nguy like me can be blessed with an extraordinary opportunity like this. \nThank you, and God bless America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I congratulate our good friend from \nSouth Carolina on his maiden speech and the opportunity, obviously, to \nlearn more about his inspirational early life and the bilingual nature \nof his beginning and the way he interpreted those lessons both from his \nmother and from his mentor into the extraordinary success he has had \nboth in the private sector and the public sector. I wish to say, on \nbehalf of my colleagues, it is an honor to serve with him.\n  Mr. SCOTT. I thank the Leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I want to join the Republican leader in \nexpressing my appreciation of Senator Scott today, not just for his \nmaiden speech but because we have new pages on the Senate floor and so \nit is their first time, and I see the bright eyes of these young people \nlooking up to the Senator as he gives his maiden speech as he talks \nabout the next generation.\n  I was thinking a bit, because I saw an editorial the Senator had \nwritten published Sunday a week ago--``IRS targeting scandal shows need \nfor reform''--and so I was happy to hear the Senator talking about some \nof the things happening there, because he talks about responsibility, \naccountability, and the kinds of things we heard in his maiden speech \ntoday. He writes in a concise way, also a courageous way, so I want to \njoin the Republican leader in welcoming the new Senator and his \ncomments, and I look forward to working with him for many years to \ncome.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SCOTT. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in congratulating our \nrecently arrived colleague from South Carolina on his maiden speech. It \nstrikes me we all want the same thing pretty much. We want an \nopportunity and we want to make sure our kids get the best quality \neducation so they can compete in a global economy. But to be honest \nabout it, we do have different approaches on how to achieve those \ngoals, it strikes me, across the aisle.\n  There are those who believe the government should play a bigger, more \nexpansive role, and they have their own ideas and approach; and there \nare those of us who believe in limited government, and that that is \nmost consistent with individual freedom and the opportunity to strive, \nto work hard, and to succeed. It is that notion of earned success. So \nwe have a different approach, and I know the Senator from South \nCarolina agrees with that.\n  I also believe the Senator from South Carolina has been a tremendous \naddition because of his background and his upbringing. Some people \nmight say we don't need more lawyers in the Senate, and he certainly is \nnot one of those, but he is somebody who has succeeded in the private \nsector, been marvelously successful now both in the House and here in \nthe Senate. So it is great to have him as part of the Senate and \ncontributing his unique perspective and being able to articulate as he \ndoes so well how small-government, limited-government principles apply \nto that concept of earned success that all of us want not only for \nourselves but for our families as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in complimenting \nthe Senator from South Carolina, No. 1, because of his work ethic. I \nhave the privilege of being the ranking Republican member of the \ncommittee that has maybe the broadest jurisdiction, the most diversity \nof any of our committees--Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--and I \nhave observed how hard Senator Scott has worked and how well prepared \nhe has been in his first several months as a Senator. He has spoken out \non labor issues, he has made a major contribution to the debate we had \non whether we need a national school board or local control on\n\n[[Page S5516]]\n\nelementary and secondary education. When other Senators are doing other \nthings, he is right there at the committee hearings. So he has made a \nquiet, effective, principled, studious contribution to the Senate, in \nmy experience, these first few months, and I am delighted to have him \nhere.\n  He has done so well I have invited him to come to Tennessee on Friday \nto speak to one of the largest gatherings we have annually in the \nState, and he has agreed to come, and we are grateful for that.\n  Finally, I would compliment him on one other thing. Sometimes I like \nto tell stories about the person for whom I came to the Senate to \nwork--Senator Howard Baker. When Senator Baker first came in 1967, I \nwould say to the Senator from South Carolina, the Republican leader was \nhis father-in-law Everett Dirksen. Senator Baker made his maiden \nspeech, probably from a back row about like Senator Scott is making \nhis, and his father-in-law was sitting right where Senator McConnell \nsits, listening to the whole thing. It went on, and it went on, and it \nwent on for nearly an hour. After it was over, Senator Dirksen came \nover to Senator Baker, and Senator Baker said to his father-in-law: \nWell, how did I do? Senator Dirksen, the Republican leader, said to the \nnew Senator: Maybe, Howard, you should occasionally try to enjoy the \nluxury of an unexpressed thought.\n  So I congratulate Senator Scott for his succinct maiden address. He \nis not only effective, studious, and diligent, he knows how to speak \nhis words clearly and succinctly, and it is wonderful to see him.\n  Mr. SCOTT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/08/senate-section/article/S5516-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Specialist Robert A.

A former coworker described these as ``the best \nsteaks ever.''\n\n  Specialist Pierce's friends say the money he earned at his part-time \njob went to fixing his truck. His love of auto mechanics led him to do \nmost of the work himself. Specialist Pierce's family said he joined the \nmilitary in 2011 to make a difference.\n  He served in South Korea before his assignment at Fort Campbell. He \nwas a member of A Company, 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment, \n101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell, KY. SPC Robert Pierce was only \n20 when he gave his life for his country last month while on patrol in \nAfghanistan. Specialist Pierce is a true American hero who made the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep his wife Christian and the rest of his \nfamily and friends in their thoughts and prayers.\n  On behalf of a grateful Nation, I humbly offer my sincerest gratitude \nfor his patriotism and selfless sacrifice.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

McQUAID\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on Monday, July 1, 2013, Joseph C. McQuaid \nwas laid to rest, with full military honors, in the Fort Logan National \nCemetery in Denver, CO.\n  A proud World War II veteran, Joseph ``Big Joe'' McQuaid will rest \nbeside his brother John ``Hootcher'' McQuaid, also a World War II \nveteran. Joe was one of the most unique, memorable persons I have known \nin my lifetime. He was also my brother-in-law.\n  Joe was born on March 16, 1919 in the family farmhouse near Stuart, \nIA. A proud Irishman, Joe always noted that his birthday was one day \nbefore St. Patrick's Day. Joe, his two brothers, and sister were born \nand raised in a loving, but very poor, family. His father ``Willie'' \nwas a self-taught, accomplished musician, playing the fiddle and piano \nin local bands around Iowa.\n  From an early age, Joe was known as ``Big Joe'' because he was a big \nbear of a man, standing 6 feet 4 inches and tipping the scale around \n240 pounds, all muscle and bone. He used to show off his strength by \ntearing phonebooks and decks of cards in half as if they were pieces of \npaper. This always impressed a lot of young kids.\n  Joe also liked to balance heavy, unwieldy objects, such as \nlawnmowers, on his chin. It wasn't only heavy objects he could balance. \nHe is the only person I have ever seen who could balance a straw broom \non his nose. He could entertain a group of kids for hours by doing his \nbalancing tricks.\n  When the Great Depression hit the Midwest, Joe's family, like so many \nothers, was in dire economic straits. So Joe, at the age of 16, went to \nwork in the Civilian Conservation Corps, the CCC. The legal age was 18, \nbut because of Joe's size and the poverty at home, Joe said he was 18 \nand thus joined the CCC. Young men left home, lived in CCC camps, \nworked on building dams and dikes, cleared roads in winter, cleaned up \nafter floods, and created State parks and recreation areas. CCC camps \nwere run in a semimilitary fashion.\n  Joe worked at the CCC camps for 3 years and was paid $36 a month. As \nJoe remembered, he sent $30 home and kept $6 for himself. He often said \nthe CCC was President Roosevelt's best program.\n  The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Joe went right down to the \nrecruiting office and signed up for military duty. He joined the Navy \nand spent most of the war years as a Boatswain Mate First Class on \ndestroyer escorts, escorting troop ships and cargo ships the United \nStates to Russia, England, and North Africa.\n  His ship, the USS Marchand, sank several German U-boats and rescued \nsurvivors of cargo and troopships sunk by enemy torpedoes. Joe was \npresent at Normandy on D-day, again protecting the troopships and big \ncruisers from enemy submarines.\n  After the war in Europe ended, Joe was sent to the Pacific as a \nBoatswain Mate on a troopship headed to the Philippines. During his \nvoyage, Joe's ship was attacked by Japanese kamikaze planes. As the \nacting Chief Boatswain Mate, Joe got all the anti-aircraft guns manned, \ntaking a 50 caliber mount himself. They brought down all the enemy \naircraft, and not one hit the ship. Joe remembered how one crashed in \nthe water so close that ocean spray and parts of the aircraft landed on \nthe ship's deck.\n  Sometime after that, on their way to the Philippines, Joe ordered--\nthrough his boatswain pipe--all hands on deck for an important \nannouncement from the captain. The captain said that after dropping two \natom bombs on Japan that wiped out two cities, President Harry S Truman \nsaid the Japanese surrendered and the war was over. There was \nunrestrained cheering and backslapping among the troops and sailors. \nJoe asked the captain if he should use his boatswain pipe to call them \nto order, and the captain said ``No, no, let them go.'' They refueled \nat sea, and headed back to Honolulu.\n  After nearly 4 straight years at sea, dodging and sinking U-boats in \nthe North Atlantic, surviving kamikaze attacks in the Pacific, ``Big \nJoe'' was back in Iowa with a chest full of medals and his beloved \nboatswain pipe.\n\n[[Page S5517]]\n\n  For his life thereafter, Joe could keep you entranced with his war \nstories and what shipboard life was like in the frigid waters of the \nNorth Atlantic.\n  Joe was so proud of his service and his fellow World War II comrades. \nHe was truly one of the ``Greatest Generation'' of young Americans.\n  Joe passed away on January 31, 2013, with his loving wife June by his \nside. He was just about 2 months shy of his 94th birthday.\n  Up to his 93rd birthday, Joe always marched every year in the \nVeteran's Day parade wearing his original World War II Navy blues, a \nwhite sailor's cap jauntily placed on his head, a chest full of ribbons \nand medals, and his cherished boatswain's pipe hung around his neck. At \nage 88 he participated in one of the honor flights from Denver to \nWashington, DC, for World War II veterans to see the World War II \nMemorial.\n  After my mother died and Joe had married my sister Sylvia, I went to \nlive with them, and Joe became almost a surrogate father to me. I was \n13 years old. As we both grew older, we took many trips together and he \nbecame more like my older brother. Joe was so unique. He was a gifted \nobserver of human behavior and interactions. He could fix anything. He \nmade beautiful objects out of wood, some of which I still have in my \nhome. He was also the best storyteller I have ever met.\n  Many years after my sister died of cancer, Joe met and married June, \na talented artist in her own right, and they had a wonderful, loving \nlife together.\n  Joe is survived by his wife June; his sister Mary Ann; his four \nchildren, Theresa, Joe Kelly, Danny, and Mary; four grandchildren, \nSean, Ryan, Erin, and Ciera; and four step grandchildren, Terry, \nKristen, Shauna, and Dawn.\n  ``Big Joe'' led a full, challenging, and interesting life. He was \ntruly one of our ``Greatest Generation,'' a true patriot who loved his \ncountry, his family, and his many friends.\n  He helped to make America a better nation for all.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we are now deep in the heart of summer \nvacation for millions of families and students all across this country. \nIt is a wonderful time, something families look forward to--maybe some \nparents more so than others. But it is a very strange summer in \nNewtown, CT. It is the first summer that 20 families are waking up \nevery morning without a 6- or 7-year-old they planned on spending days \nat the beach or afternoons at the park with or mornings getting ready \nfor what would have been their second-grade year. It is a very \ndifferent summer, this summer in Newtown, CT.\n  A lot of people ask me: How is the community recovering? How are they \ncoming back? And while there is some rebound happening, it is still \nvery much a community in crisis. When students go back to school in the \nfall, they are not going to be going back to Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool. That school is going to be knocked down. There is no way \nfamilies, teachers, and administrators can return to that place. So \nonce again this fall the students of Sandy Hook Elementary School will \nbe bused one town over to a school that was, up until January of this \nlast year, a place none of them had seen, and they will once again be \nin a year of transition--once again, for many families, still a year of \ncrisis.\n  I am not sure any of those families could imagine in the days and \nweeks after the shooting on December 14 of last year that when they \nsent their kids back to school--their surviving brothers and sisters--\nin the fall of 2013, that in that intervening time, in response to the \nmost vicious mass school shooting in this country's history, the \nresponse from the Congress would be nothing, zippo, zero.\n  This is a summer of crisis in Newtown. It will be another difficult \nfall. But what leaves people in Newtown shaking their heads is that \nthis place has done absolutely nothing; that when their kids return \nback to school, the laws of this Nation will be no different, will do \nnothing more to protect their sons and daughters when they and millions \nof other kids across the country return to school in September.\n  And it is not as though we have not seen since Newtown more evidence \nfor why we need to change our laws. I have come to the floor virtually \nevery week since this horrific incident to remind people that the \ntragedy has not ended; that since December 14, 5,893 people have been \nsenselessly killed by guns. Since December 14, 5,893 people have been \nkilled through gun violence.\n  I think we should continue to talk about who these people are; that \nwe should give voices to these victims, so that it is not just the 20 \n6-year-old and 7-year-old children we have all heard so much about--\nabout Jack Pinto and Dylan Hockley, and Noah Pozner and Grace \nMcDonnell. We know these kids, and I will continue to talk about who \nthey were and who they could have been, but every single day we lose \nabout 30 more people to gun violence.\n  Last June we saw a mass shooting that was eerily similar to the one \nin Newtown--a mass shooting in Santa Monica, CA, in which five people \nwere killed; the father and the brother of the gunman, but also three \ncompletely unrelated and innocent bystanders who just happened to be in \nand around the school when this young man, 23 years old, deeply \ndisturbed, started firing, almost indiscriminately and randomly, on his \nway to and at the campus.\n  It was eerily similar because, once again, it was an assault weapon, \nan AR-15 model, the weapon of choice for mass assailants in this \ncountry these days. And once again he had high-capacity magazines. \nReportedly, 1,300 rounds of ammunition were on his person. Every case \nis unique, but over and over these mass shootings are occurring with \nthe same type of weapons and the same type of high-capacity ammunition. \nYet we do nothing to acknowledge this trend.\n  Let me talk a second about who these people were who were killed that \nday in California, because they have stories that are not unlike the \n5,800-plus stories I could tell on the floor, if we had time, with \nrespect to the people who have died since December 14.\n  Carlos Navarro Franco was 68 years old. He was the groundskeeper at \nthe college for 22 years. He was dedicated to two things above all--\nthat college and his family. That is what the president of the college \nsaid after his death--everything Carlos did was for the college and for \nhis family. He was truly a family man, the president of the college \nsaid. He was a dedicated husband, a father, and an integral part of \nSanta Monica's college family. He dedicated his work to the campus \ngrounds and was enjoyed by students and visitors for two decades.\n  He was with his daughter that day. Marcela Franco was 26 years old \nand pursuing a degree in psychology at California State University. She \nhad registered to take summer classes at the school where her father \nworked and she was on her way with her father to buy textbooks that \nday. She initially survived the gunfire but she never regained \nconsciousness after the attack. She was described by her aunt as smart, \nbeautiful, and outgoing. Her aunt said, ``She was daddy's girl.'' So \nthe blessing is they went together.\n  Margarita Gomez was the same age as Carlos Navarro Franco. She lost \nher life that day. She was fondly referred to on campus as the \n``recycle lady'' because she could be seen almost every weekday walking \naround campus, rolling her cart, picking up used bottles and cans. She \nwould plop them in her cart and then take them to get recycled. \nObviously, most people thought she was homeless and that she was \ncollecting these bottles and cans as a means to be able to survive, but \nthat wasn't the case. Margarita had actually been diagnosed with \ndiabetes, and it was her doctor's recommendation that she exercise \nmore. She was also an active member of a senior Latino club that met \nevery Thursday at the Virginia Avenue park and she was very interested \nin the St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital cause--a charity the \nsenior Latino club happened to give money to. So she put these two \nthings\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\ntogether--a recommendation she should exercise more and an interest in \nhelping this club and the charity it was affiliated with--and decided \nshe would take this cart around town for exercise, pick up cans and \nbottles, recycle them, and then donate the money to charity.\n  The ``recycle lady,'' Margarita Gomez, was walking around campus that \nday picking up cans and bottles so she could donate the money to help \nsick kids, and she was gunned down by an assailant using an assault \nweapon with high-capacity ammunition clips. It is a pretty unbelievable \nstory. These three special individuals, along with the father and the \nson, are among the 5,893.\n  But it is not just the mass shootings that we are talking about. \nFrankly, the vast majority of these killings are one-off deals over \nsome of the most petty arguments or disputes one could imagine. But \nbecause guns are so easily found, so readily accessible in our \nneighborhoods, these silly arguments end up in deaths, such as one that \nhappened in my State of Connecticut just a couple weeks ago on June 16.\n  Isaac Smith was a couple days away from graduating from New Britain \nHigh School. He was a great athlete, played football and baseball, and \nhe was hoping to continue playing those sports after high school when \nhe went to college. He apparently talked to his friends a lot about how \nproud he was going to be to graduate.\n  On the night of June 16, police received a call around midnight about \ngunshots. They arrived at the scene and found Isaac Smith--a couple \ndays away from graduation--in his driveway with a gunshot wound to the \nback of his head. Police are still trying to figure out what happened. \nApparently, he was involved in a transaction for a pair of high-end \nsneakers when something went wrong and the other guy he was either \nselling the sneakers to or buying the sneakers from, 26-year-old \nJonathan Gibbs of Meriden, shot him--over a pair of sneakers.\n  These are who these 5,893 people are: They are victims of mass \nviolence, they are victims of senseless gunfire, and they all share \nsomething in common. They deserve a response from the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives. They deserve us doing something more than \nnothing.\n  At least the Senate brought up a bill on the floor earlier this year. \nWe got 55 votes for a bill that wasn't perfect, but it at least said \ncriminals shouldn't have guns and that we should have a system that \nmakes sure that is the case; that gun trafficking--when someone buys a \nmessload of guns legally and then sells them illegally on the streets \nof our cities--should probably be a Federal crime; that we should have \nmore resources in our mental health system to take care of people who \nwant and need help. We got 55 votes for that, which is pretty \nunbelievable given the fact that 90 percent of the American public \nsupport all of those things. One would think we could have gotten more \nthan 55 votes.\n  The House of Representatives has done nothing. It hasn't even had a \ndebate.\n  These numbers will continue to mount. Next week I will be down here, \nand the number will probably be north of 6,000. Then, after the August \nrecess, it will be creeping up to 7,000. We can't get rid of every \nsingle one of these deaths.\n  I will admit to you that Jonathan Gibbs who shot Isaac Smith was a \nlegal gun owner. He didn't even actually have a criminal history. The \nfact is, while not every single one of these deaths is preventable, \nmany of them are.\n  So I will continue to come down and talk about these victims with the \nhope that someday--perhaps this fall, perhaps next year, perhaps the \nyear after--we can take action in the Senate that will maybe not stop \nthe growth of this number but will at least slow its acceleration.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The interest rate on student loans doubled on July 1. \nBecause Congress failed to act, our lowest income students are now \npaying twice as much on these new loans. While students are paying \nmore, the Federal Government is boosting its own profits--$51 billion \nin profits from the student loan programs in 2013 alone. This is just \nplain wrong.\n  The government is making obscene profits on these loans--profits we \ncan and should cut back on to help our kids who are struggling to pay \nfor college. But Republicans have repeatedly blocked our efforts to \npass a short-term fix that would save students from higher interest \nrates.\n  This week the Senate will vote to fix this problem. The bill, Keep \nStudent Loans Affordable Act, was introduced by Senators Jack Reed and \nKay Hagan. It would drop the rate on direct student loans back down to \n3.4 percent for 1 year, retroactively as of July 1, and give Congress \ntime to develop a plan to do the three things we need to do: Reform \nstudent loan interest rates on new loans, refinance $1 trillion in \nexisting debt, and lower college costs for all of our kids.\n  Republicans have a different approach. Despite the obscene profits of \nthe current program, they propose to make even more money from \nstudents. Their current proposal would bring in an extra $1 billion in \nprofits off the backs of our students.\n  Listen to the numbers. New loans will produce $184 billion in profits \nfor the U.S. Government over the next 10 years. That includes the 6.8 \npercent interest on direct loans, all the borrowing costs, all the \nadministrative costs, and all the bad debt losses for the program.\n  Let me say that again: The new student loans, including direct loans \nat 6.8 percent, will make $184 billion in profits for the government \nover the next 10 years--and the Republican solution is to increase \nthose profits for the U.S. Government. In other words, their solution \nto the rising interest rate problem is to make students pay even more.\n  Some of my colleagues are telling students the plan they have is a \ngreat deal. But their argument is the same argument that was used by \nthe slick operators who sold teaser rate mortgages and the ones who \nsold zero interest rate credit cards. Sure, the first couple of years \nwill be cheaper, but they don't want anyone to look at what happens \nafter that.\n  Fortunately, our students are smarter than that. They read the fine \nprint. They know in the end this debate boils down to simple math--math \nthat our students understand, even if some people in Congress wish they \ndidn't.\n  Our students sent a letter to Majority Leader Reid and Minority \nLeader McConnell with a clear message: A bad deal is worse than no deal \nat all. Our students need a plan that costs them less money, not a plan \nthat costs them more.\n  I talk a lot about math, but the Senate's decision about student \nloans is a decision about our values and a decision about how we build \na future. Investing in our students will allow them to get good jobs \nand give them a shot to make it in America, but that same investment \nwill also create new industries and grow the economy for everyone.\n  We shouldn't treat our students like a profit center. We shouldn't \nask them to pay an extra tax to go to school. And we shouldn't try to \ntrick them by shuffling numbers around, hitting them with teaser rates, \nand declaring a problem is solved while the students just keep paying \nmore and more.\n  There are real problems in higher education today: Skyrocketing \ncollege costs, historic levels of student debt, and high borrowing \nrates. It is going to take time to develop a solution that works, and \nthere is no magic math that will make student loan profits disappear or \nmake college tuition shrink without some sacrifice. But right now, \nstudents are the only ones who are sacrificing. They are giving up the \ndream of owning a home or being able to retire just so they can keep \npaying for college.\n  Congress can ease the burden on our students, and we should be \ncommitted to doing just that because this is how\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\nwe build a stronger middle class. This is how we build a better future \nfor our entire country. It is a first step, but it is a good one.\n  Congress can pass the Keep Student Loans Affordable Act. It is a \nshort-term patch to keep interest rates on new loans from doubling for \n1 year while Congress develops a plan to reform student loans and to \nmake college more affordable. I support the measure, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I don't wish to in any way cut into the \ntime of the senior Senator from Wyoming, but I hope once he and Senator \nBarrasso have finished speaking--once their time is consumed--we might \nagree that the vote will still be at 5:30, if possible, or as close to \nthat time as possible.\n  Our Constitution provides the Senate an important role to play in \nproviding advice to the President and in voting on whether to confirm \nnominees for our third branch of government. Last month, we were \nreminded of the importance of these confirmation votes when the Supreme \nCourt handed down several narrowly-decided opinions that are already \nimpacting millions of Americans. As a senior member of this chamber, I \nhave voted on the confirmation of every one of the nine justices \ncurrently serving. Since only a tiny percentage of cases brought in \nFederal court ever end up at the Supreme Court, the Federal courts of \nappeal are often the courts of last resort for most disputes. I am glad \nthat today we are finally voting to confirm another appellate nominee.\n  Before the Memorial Day recess, the minority leader asked during a \nfloor debate when Gregory Phillips, the Wyoming nominee to the Tenth \nCircuit, would receive a vote. When the majority leader immediately \noffered a vote on that nominee, the minority leader demurred without \ngiving any reason. Senate Republicans have now finally decided to allow \nthe vote on Gregory Phillips to move forward, but there was no reason \nfor this delay in his confirmation vote.\n  Gregory Phillips is currently the attorney general of Wyoming, a \nposition to which he was appointed by Wyoming's Republican Governor. \nFrom 2010 to 2011 he worked in the Wyoming attorney general's office as \nthe special assistant to the Governor for legislative affairs. Prior to \nworking in the Wyoming attorney general's office, he was an assistant \nU.S. attorney in Wyoming, and spent 14 years in private practice. \nAttorney general Phillips has also served as a part-time deputy county \nattorney, an assistant municipal judge and as a state senator. \nFollowing law school, he served as a law clerk to the Honorable Alan B. \nJohnson of the U.S. district court for the District of Wyoming. The ABA \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Mr. \nPhillips ``well qualified,'' its highest rating.\n  At his Judiciary Committee hearing, Attorney General Phillips was \nintroduced by his two Republican home State Senators, Senator Enzi and \nSenator Barrasso, both of whom strongly support his nomination. He was \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee nearly 3 months ago. \nWhile his confirmation vote has not been delayed quite as long as votes \non most of President Obama's nominees, he could and should have been \nconfirmed last May when the majority leader offered.\n  With the confirmation of Attorney General Phillips, there will be 10 \nactive judges on the Tenth Circuit. According to the most recent data, \nthis means that the number of pending appeals per active judge on that \ncourt will drop from 150 to 135. I mention this because another \nappellate court, the DC Circuit, currently has 177 pending appeals per \nactive judge. Despite that higher caseload, some Senate Republicans \nargue that the DC Circuit's caseload is too low, and that three of its \njudgeships should be eliminated. I suspect that many, if not all, of \nthese Senators will vote to confirm Attorney General Phillips, even \nthough his confirmation means that the Tenth Circuit will now have the \nlowest caseload in the country, just as earlier this year they \nsupported the confirmation of Jane Kelly to the Eighth Circuit, which \ngave that court the lowest caseload in the country, and just as they \nsupported the confirmation of Robert Bacharach to the Tenth Circuit, \nwhich gave that court the lowest caseload in the country. I hope those \nSenators will reconsider their double standard and not play politics \nwith an independent branch of government.\n  Some of the same Senate Republicans who are opposing President \nObama's three nominees to the DC Circuit are also criticizing him for \nmaking too few nominations and somehow claiming that many vacancies \nwithout a nominee cannot possibly be the fault of Senate Republicans. I \nrecall that before President Obama made a single judicial nomination, \nall Senate Republicans sent him a letter threatening to filibuster his \nnominees if he did not consult Republican home State Senators. They \ncannot have it both ways.\n  I take very seriously my responsibility to make recommendations when \nwe have vacancies in Vermont, whether the President is a Democrat or a \nRepublican, and other Senators should do the same. After all, if there \nare not enough judges in our home States, it is our own constituents \nwho suffer. It should be only a matter of weeks or months, not years, \nfor Senators to make recommendations.\n  Unfortunately, in some States it appears as if there is no effort \nbeing made to recommend qualified nominees to the administration. There \nare three district vacancies in Georgia without nominees, and the \noldest is over 4 years old. There are three district vacancies in \nKentucky without nominees, and the oldest is over a year and a half \nold. There are seven district vacancies in Texas without nominees, and \nthe oldest is over 4\\1/2\\ years old. Three months ago the Senators from \nTexas announced a nominations commission, but it is my understanding \nthat it is still not accepting applications. If Senators want new \njudgeships in their States, they should be working especially hard to \nensure that all existing ones are filled. Republican Senators who \ndemanded to be consulted on nominations should live up to their \nresponsibilities and fulfill their constitutional obligation to advise \nthe President on nominations. They should follow the example of \nDemocratic Senators: the administration has received recommendations \nfor all current district vacancies in States represented by two \nDemocratic Senators.\n  Moreover, the failure of some Republican Senators to help fill \nvacancies in their own States does not excuse their unwillingness to \ncomplete action on the nominations the President has made. I regret \nthat I must correct the record, again, on how Senate Republicans have \nobstructed judicial nominees over the past 4 years. The continued \nassertion by Senate Republicans that 99 percent of President Obama's \nnominees have been confirmed is not accurate. President Obama has \nnominated 243 individuals to be circuit or district judges, and 197 \nhave been confirmed by the Senate. That is 81 percent, not 99 percent. \nBy way of comparison, at the same point in President Bush's second \nterm, July 8 of his fifth year in office, President Bush had nominated \n10 fewer people to be circuit or district judges, but had seen 215 of \nthem confirmed, which is 18 more confirmations. The truth is that 92 \npercent\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\nof President Bush's judicial nominees had been confirmed at the same \npoint, 11 percentage points more than have been allowed for President \nObama. That is an apples-to-apples comparison, and it demonstrates the \nundeniable fact that the Senate has confirmed a lower number and a \nlower percentage of President Obama's nominees than President Bush's \nnominees at the same time in their Presidencies.\n  I noted at the end of last year, while Senate Republicans were \ninsisting on delaying confirmations of 15 judicial nominees that should \nhave taken place in wrap up, we would not likely be allowed to complete \nwork on them until May. That was precisely the Republican plan. So when \nSenate Republicans now seek to claim credit for their confirmations in \nPresident Obama's second term, they are inflating the confirmation \nstatistics. The truth is that only 11 circuit and district \nconfirmations have taken place this year that are not attributable to \nthose nominations Senate Republicans needlessly held over from last \nyear. To use a baseball analogy, if a baseball player goes 0 for 9, and \nthen gets a hit, we do not say he is an all star because he is batting \n1.000 in his last at bat. We recognize that he is just 1 for 10, and \nnot a very good hitter, nor would a fair calculation of hits or home \nruns allow a player to credit those that occurred in one game to the \nnext because it would make his stats look better.\n  If President Obama's nominees were receiving the same treatment as \nPresident Bush's, today's vote would bring us to 215 confirmations, not \n198, and vacancies would be far lower. The nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service has noted that it will require 29 more district and \ncircuit confirmations this year to match President Bush's 5-year total. \nEven with the confirmations finally concluded during the first 6 months \nof this year, Senate Republicans have still not allowed President Obama \nto match even the record of President Bush's first term. Even with an \nextra 6 months, we are still eight confirmations behind where we were \nat the end of 2004.\n  The assertion by some Senate Republicans that ``there is no \ndifference in how this President's nominees are being treated versus \nhow President Bush's nominees were treated'' is simply not supported by \nthe facts. Compared to the same point in the Bush administration, there \nhave been more nominees filibustered, fewer confirmations, and longer \nwait times for nominees, even though President Obama has nominated more \npeople and there are more vacancies. And while Senate Republicans have \ntaken to comparing President Obama's fifth year to President Bush's \nfifth year, the fact is that there were fewer confirmations then \nbecause we had done such good work in President Bush's first term, in \nparticular the 100 confirmations we achieved during the 17 months in \n2001 and 2002 when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In fact, \nfrom June 9, 2005, until October 20, 2005, there were no consensus \njudicial nominees on the Executive Calendar. So the only reason there \nhave been more votes this year than in 2005 is that, contrary to \nRepublicans' assertions, we have had more nominees this year, mostly \nbecause they were held over from last year by Senate Republicans.\n  While the routine and sustained delays over the past 4 years are \nwithout precedent, Republicans point to June 2004 as the one time that \nthere were a number of President Bush's nominees pending on the floor. \nI recall that in early 2004, President Bush had bypassed the Senate and \nrecess appointed two controversial nominees to be circuit judges and \nthat around that time we learned that Republican committee staff hacked \ninto a shared server to pilfer Democratic files. Still, we were able to \nclear nominations by confirming more than 20 consensus nominees in just \n1 month. There is nothing like that to explain the years of backlogged \njudicial nominees during this administration.\n  Context matters. Anyone can point to this example or that example, \nbut when you look at the whole picture, it is clear that President \nObama's nominees have faced unprecedented delays on the Senate floor \nand that his nominees have been less likely to be confirmed than \nPresident Bush's at the same point.\n  But the context of these statistics also matters. Judicial \nnominations should not be about partisan tit for tat. Judicial \nvacancies impact millions of people, all across America, who depend on \nour Federal courts for justice. When you compare the Senate's record \nfrom 2001 to 2005, and from 2009 to 2013, it is clear that we are not \nmeeting the standard we set for how quickly the Senate can act to fill \njudicial vacancies. Throughout my career, whether as a prosecutor or as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have fought for justice, and to \nensure that people have access to justice and can have their day in \ncourt. That is why my recent statements have discussed not only the \ndelays in the nominations process, but also the impact of sequestration \ncuts on our legal system. I continue to hear from judges and other \nlegal professionals about the serious problems sequestration either has \ncaused or will cause if we do not fix it.\n  Chief Justice John Roberts recently noted that sequestration ``hit \n[the judiciary] particularly hard. . . . When we have sustained cuts \nthat means people have to be furloughed or worse and that has a more \ndirect impact on the services that we can provide.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent that this article titled ``Chief Justice Roberts: Sequester \ncuts hitting federal judiciary `hard' '' be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my statement. We should all be doing everything we \ncan to help our coequal branch meet the Constitution's promise of \njustice for all Americans.\n  The impact of sequestration on the third branch is compounded by the \nhigh level of judicial vacancies. I know we can do better because we \nhave done better. Each day that Senate Republicans refuse to confirm \nthe qualified judicial nominees who have been reviewed and voted on by \nthe Judiciary Committee is another day that a judge could have been \nworking to resolve disputes. Hard-working Americans should not have to \nwait years to have their cases decided.\n  Even if it were true, it is not good enough to say that the Senate is \ntreating President Obama's nominees the same as it treated President \nBush's. The real question is whether the Senate is meeting its duty to \ndo everything it reasonably can to ensure the American people have \naccess to justice. When Senate Republicans refuse to make \nrecommendations for nominees, and then delay votes on consensus \nnominees, they are not somehow hurting the President, they are hurting \nthe American people and our justice system.\n  Today, Attorney General Phillips will finally be confirmed by the \nSenate, and there are many more nominees the Senate should consider in \nthe coming weeks. Tomorrow, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hear \nfrom James Comey, who President Obama has nominated to serve as FBI \nDirector. Later this week the committee will begin the process of \nconsidering the first of three current nominees to the DC Circuit. The \nJudiciary Committee is also scheduled this week to vote on the \nnomination of B. Todd Jones to serve as Director of the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. The ATF has been without a \nSenate-confirmed Director since 2006. Senate Republicans refused to \nallow a vote on President Bush's nominee to lead the ATF and I hope \nthey will not attempt to do the same again. Nominees to lead the Labor \nDepartment and the Environmental Protection Agency are also awaiting \nour consideration. I hope the Senate will be able to come together and \nconfirm these worthy nominees without the delay that has befallen so \nmany nominees in the past 4 years.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, June 29, 2013]\n\n    Chief Justice Roberts: Sequester Cuts Hitting Federal Judiciary \n                                ``Hard''\n\n                             (By Ben Geman)\n\n       Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Saturday said \n     the sequester is hurting the judicial branch and that he's \n     hopeful Congress will provide flexibility.\n       Roberts, speaking at a conference in West Virginia, noted \n     that the judicial branch of government overall is less than \n     one percent of the federal budget.\n       ``You get a whole branch of government under the \n     Constitution for relative pennies, and the idea that we have \n     to be swept along because it is good public policy to cut \n     everybody--I am not commenting on that policy at all--but the \n     notion that we should just be swept along with it I think is \n     really unfounded,'' Roberts said of the across-the-board \n     budget cuts.\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\n       ``The cuts hit us particularly hard because we are made up \n     of people. That is what the judicial branch is. It is not \n     like we are the Pentagon where you can slow up a particular \n     procurement program or a lot of the other agencies. When we \n     have sustained cuts that mean people have to be furloughed or \n     worse and that has a more direct impact on the services that \n     we can provide,'' he added, speaking at the Fourth Circuit \n     Judicial Conference.\n       Roberts said the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts \n     is working with congressional appropriators ``to get them to \n     go to bat for us,'' and that he's hopeful. ``I hope we are \n     able to make an effective case for why need a little bit more \n     flexibility than others,'' Roberts said.\n       And, in a bit of humor, he tried some obvious flattery.\n       ``I just want to say publicly, that I think our \n     appropriators in Congress are the best legislators since \n     Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, and you can quote me on that \n     if you'd like,'' Roberts said.\n       In other remarks, Roberts said the Supreme Court justices \n     are asking too many questions from the bench during oral \n     arguments.\n       ``We do overdo it,'' Roberts said. ``The bench has gotten \n     more and more aggressive.'' He noted that lawyers trying to \n     present their arguments ``feel cheated sometimes.''\n       He said that justices do not talk about cases before the \n     arguments. So they use questions as a way to ``bring out \n     points that we think our colleagues ought to know about,'' \n     and debate one another through questions to lawyers making \n     arguments.\n       But he said, ``That is an explanation. It is not meant as \n     an excuse.''\n       ``I do think we have gone too far,'' Roberts said. ``It is \n     too much and I think we do need to address it a little bit.''\n       Roberts comments came after a busy week for the court, with \n     justices handing down rulings striking down a key portion of \n     the Voting Rights Act and ruling the Defense of Marriage Act \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Gregory Alan \nPhillips to be United States Circuit Judge for the Tenth Circuit. This \nis the 27th judicial confirmation this year. With today's confirmation, \nthe Senate will have confirmed 198 lower court nominees; we have \ndefeated two. That is 198-2, which is an outstanding record. That is a \nsuccess rate of 99 percent.\n  We have been doing these at a fast pace. During the last Congress, we \nconfirmed more judges than any Congress since the 103rd Congress, which \nwas 1993-1994.\n  This year, the beginning of President Obama's second term, we have \nalready confirmed more judges than were confirmed in the entire first \nyear of President Bush's second term. Let me emphasize that again--\nwe've already confirmed more nominees this year than we did during the \nentirety of 2005, the first year of President Bush's second term.\n  After today, only four article III judges remain on the executive \ncalendar--three district nominees and one circuit nominee. Yet somehow \nSenate Democrats cite this as evidence of obstructionism.\n  Compare that to the calendar of June 2004, when 30 judicial \nnominations were on the calendar--10 circuit and 20 district. I don't \nrecall any Senate Democrats complaining about how many nominations were \npiling up on the calendar.\n  Nor do I remember protestations from my colleagues on the other side \nthat judicial nominees were moving too slowly. Some of those nominees \nhad been reported out more than a year earlier and most were pending \nfor months. Some of them never got an up or down vote.\n  The bottom line is that the Senate is processing the President's \nnominees exceptionally fairly. President Obama certainly is being \ntreated more fairly in the beginning of his second term than Senate \nDemocrats treated President Bush in 2005. It is not clear to me how \nallowing more votes so far this year than President Bush got in an \nentire year amounts to ``unprecedented delays and obstruction.'' Yet \nthat is the complaint we hear over and over from the other side.\n  After today's votes, there will be 84 vacancies in the Federal \njudiciary. But 53 of those spots are without a nominee. How is it \nRepublicans' fault that the President has not sent 53 nominees to the \ncommittee? Obviously, common sense ought to tell you that we can't act \non nominees who are not presented to the Senate.\n  I just wanted to set the record straight--again--before we vote on \nthis nomination.\n  Mr. Phillips received his B.S. in 1983 and his J.D. in 1987, both \nfrom the University of Wyoming. Upon graduation, he served as a law \nclerk from 1987 to 1989 to the Honorable Alan B. Johnson, U.S. district \njudge for the District of Wyoming. After completion of his clerkship, \nhe worked in private practice in the town of Evanston. There he \npracticed a wide variety of civil law, including personal injury, wills \nand estates, real property, contracts, worker's compensation, \nemployment, domestic relations, and bankruptcy. For a few months during \nthis time, Mr. Phillips served as a part-time deputy county attorney, \nmostly prosecuting misdemeanor crimes until a new county attorney could \nbe elected.\n  In 1998, Mr. Phillips and Matthew H. Mead, presently serving as \nGovernor of Wyoming, opened a law practice in Cheyenne, focusing on \nMedicaid, insurance, banking, and Federal tort claims law. Mr. Phillips \nserved as a special attorney general during this period, handling a \nMedicaid third-party and estate reimbursement for Wyoming.\n  Mr. Phillips joined the U.S. Attorney's office in 2003 as an \nassistant U.S. attorney, where he first worked on both civil and \ncriminal issues before shifting to exclusively criminal work. In 2011, \nMr. Phillips was appointed by Governor Mead to be attorney general of \nthe State of Wyoming. As attorney general, he manages five law \ndivisions, overseeing arguments before the Wyoming Supreme Court and \nthe Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. LEAHY. So I can help speed up things, I yield back all time on \nthe Democratic side and yield to the senior Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for expediting the confirmation of Greg Phillips.\n  I rise this afternoon to add strong support for the confirmation of \nGregory Alan Phillips to serve as a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I believe Mr. Phillips has all the characteristics necessary \nto serve as a Federal appellate judge. I worked with Mr. Phillips in \nthe Wyoming Legislature and can say with confidence that he is \nrecognized throughout the Wyoming legal community as a talented, \nrespected, and thoughtful attorney.\n  This vote is also important because the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals has experienced a number of judicial vacancies recently. In \nFebruary the Senate confirmed Judge Bacharach of Oklahoma to the panel, \nand we now have the opportunity to fill another vacancy so the Tenth \nCircuit can continue its work.\n  Mr. Phillips has served as Wyoming's attorney general since 2011. The \nattorney general is not an elected position in Wyoming, and it is \nimportant to note that Mr. Phillips was appointed by Governor Mead, \nalthough they do not share the same party affiliation. This speaks \ntremendously to Mr. Phillips' talent and legal reputation. Governor \nMead and former U.S. attorney comments that Greg is a ``first-rate \nlegal thinker, a tireless worker and has an abiding sense of fair \nplay.'' Governor Mead goes on to say that if confirmed, all those who \nappear before Mr. Phillips will find ``a judge fully prepared, engaged, \nand respectful to all.''\n  Mr. Phillips was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with \na unanimous vote on April 18. The fact that he now stands for a vote \nafter only being nominated in January is a credit to his abilities and \nstrong bipartisan support. I thank Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member \nGrassley, and members of the Judiciary Committee for reviewing and \nmoving this nomination along so quickly.\n  It is no surprise that the American Bar Association unanimously gave \nMr. Phillips its highest rating. Greg has extensive experience \npracticing law as a deputy county attorney and in private practice. \nBefore becoming Wyoming's attorney general, Mr. Phillips served 7 years \nas an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Wyoming, handling \ncriminal prosecutions and appeals. Greg has extensive experience \narguing in Federal court, including taking nearly 20 cases before the \nTenth Circuit.\n  Mr. Phillips studied economics at the University of Wyoming and \ngraduated with honors from the Wyoming College of Law, where he was on \nthe Law Review. Immediately following law school\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\nMr. Phillips served as a clerk for U.S. district judge Alan Johnson of \nWyoming. Judge Johnson writes that Greg is ``devoted to the rule of law \nand will honor the remarkable judicial officers who preceded him.'' \nSpecifically, Judge Johnson notes that Mr. Phillips' thorough study of \nthe U.S. sentencing guidelines, experience as a Federal criminal \nprosecutor, and understanding of State and Federal legal issues will \nserve him well on the Tenth Circuit.\n  Mr. Phillips also has strong support from his colleagues from around \nthe Nation. Thirty-four attorneys general wrote the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in March expressing their support for the nomination. I am \ntold there would have been more signatures on that letter, but the \nnomination was advanced so diligently that some did not get a chance to \nsign the letter before Greg's hearing.\n  I would like to conclude by saying that I can personally attest to \nMr. Phillips' qualifications to serve as a Federal judge. Greg was on \nthe senate Judiciary Committee when we served together in the Wyoming \nLegislature. On the senate floor, we sat across the aisle from each \nother--and I do not mean just across the Republican-Democratic aisle, I \nmean right next to each other across the aisle--and got to visit a lot. \nHe was a part of formulating my 80 percent rule for legislating.\n  Greg and his family are highly respected in their Wyoming community, \nand Wyoming is proud to call Greg one of our own. He will be an \noutstanding judge to follow Terry O'Brien, another longtime friend of \nmine. Terry and I, when he was a Wyoming District Court judge and I was \nin the Wyoming State senate, used to have dinner together to solve the \nworld's problems. Then I became a U.S. Senator and he became a U.S. \ncircuit court judge. I know his successor will honorably fill that \nseat.\n  Mr. Phillips is highly qualified to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, and I call on my colleagues to also support his \nconfirmation. Let's get this man to work in his new job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I join Senator Enzi in strongly \nsupporting the nomination of Greg Phillips to a seat on the Tenth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Greg Phillips will be an outstanding judge. \nHe graduated with honors, as you heard from Senator Enzi, from the \nUniversity of Wyoming College of Law. He has worked in private \npractice, he has worked in the Office of the U.S. Attorney for Wyoming, \nand he currently serves as attorney general for the State of Wyoming. \nThe breadth of his experience, his understanding of the law and the \nrole of a judge, as well as the thoroughness with which he approaches \nhis responsibilities--well, they will serve him well.\n  The people who know him best--his peers--uniformly praise his \nintellect, his diligence, and his fairness. His former boss, U.S. \ndistrict judge Alan Johnson, said this in a recent letter to Senator \nEnzi:\n\n       Again and again, local defense attorneys have expressed \n     their appreciation for the fair handed, respectful, and even \n     tempered treatment they have received from Greg Phillips.\n\n  We are very fortunate in Wyoming to have Greg Phillips nominated for \nthe bench. I have no doubt that as his career continues, he will become \na successful and a respected member of the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I strongly encourage all Members of the Senate to join Senator \nEnzi and me in voting to confirm Greg Phillips.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield back the remainder of any of our time and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Gregory Alan Phillips, of Wyoming, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Tenth Circuit?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Washington (Ms. \nCantwell), the Senator from North Dakota (Ms. Heitkamp), and the \nSenator from Maine (Mr. King) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Indiana (Mr. Coats), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), \nthe Senator from Arizona (Mr. Flake), the Senator from South Carolina \n(Mr. Graham), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from \nArizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), the \nSenator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), and the Senator from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Toomey).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly).

The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the motion to \n     proceed to calendar No. 124, S. 1238, a bill to amend the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend the current reduced \n     interest rate for undergraduate Federal Direct Stafford Loans \n     for 1 year, to modify required distribution rules for pension \n     plans, and for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Tom Harkin, Jack Reed, Kirsten E. Gillibrand, \n           Patrick J. Leahy, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Udall, Sheldon \n           Whitehouse, Ron Wyden, Benjamin L. Cardin, Richard \n           Blumenthal, Christopher A. Coons, Sherrod Brown, Robert \n           P. Casey Jr., Elizabeth Warren, Al Franken, Richard J. \n           Durbin, Debbie Stabenow.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the mandatory quorum required under \nrule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as I understand it, the majority leader \nhas just filed cloture on a bill that would keep us at a 3.4-percent \nstudent loan rate for Stafford loans, which impact about 7 million \nAmericans, for a year. Am I correct on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion is on the motion to \nproceed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is a very important cloture motion. I hope we will \nmove forward on this bill in a bipartisan way. As of now, student loan \nrates have doubled on Stafford loans. In my State of California, \n550,000 Californians are facing a doubling of their student loans, from \n3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. I have asked my students to contact me and \ntalk to me about their real-world stories and what it means to them to \nsee a doubling of their student loan interest rate.\n  I will tell you they are more eloquent than I could ever be. They \ntalk about how they look at their dreams and maybe they will become \nfantasy dreams. They talk about what it would be to believe you are in \na ball and chain of student loan debt that is so large it overwhelms \nyou.\n  In the name of those students and all the students across the \ncountry, I hope the majority leader's move to resolve this for at least \na year and keep those loans at 3.4 percent--I hope that motion to \nproceed will go forward and that the bill itself will pass.\n  What are the alternatives? Every alternative I have heard from the \nRepublicans leads to higher interest rates with no cap. I don't know if \nyou remember the years that interest rates rose after a period of low \nrates, and they went up to 7, 8, 9, 10, double digits--12 percent. I \nremember those days. It is hard for our people to remember that, but \nthose were crushing interest rates.\n  If we do not have a cap on student loan interest rates, we are facing \na real problem in the future, a problem that is going to impact the \nquality of life of our families. We are already seeing the Fed put out \nstatements saying the crush of the burden of student loans without \nthese high interest rates is having an impact on our economic recovery. \nI have read stories of young people who were putting off marriage and \nhaving families because of the crush of student loan debt.\n  I am very pleased we are moving forward on this commonsense proposal \nto keep these rates at 3.4 percent. We offset the costs by closing tax \nloopholes that hardly affect anybody at all. It has to do with \ninheritance on a 401(k), and it will pay for this proposal.\n  I am very supportive of the immigration bill, but at the last minute \nmy Republican friends came forward with an enormous proposal to build \nan even bigger fence and wider fence and stronger fence. I guess the \nsong ``Don't Fence Me In''--it is an old song--doesn't apply anymore. \nWe are going to be fenced in. The cost of that is $20 billion, $30 \nbillion, $40 billion. Surely we can find $4 billion for a year to make \nsure our students do not have to face a doubling of these rates.\n\n\n                          McCarthy Nomination\n\n  I also come to the floor to speak about Gina McCarthy. For those \npeople who have not followed this debate, Gina McCarthy has been \nnominated by President Obama to lead the Environmental Protection \nAgency. To me she is the poster child of bipartisanship and one of the \nbest qualified candidates I have ever seen for this position.\n  She is experienced; she is smart; she understands the law; she \nunderstands energy; she understands everything she has to understand to \nundertake this job; she understands court decisions; she understands \nthe health impacts of dirty air; she also understands that without a \nclean environment and a healthy environment we cannot have economic \ngrowth.\n  I often retell the story that when the walls came down in Eastern \nEurope, the air was so thick you could not even see the people. One of \nthe first things they did is ask us how to clean up their air. We have \nmade great strides, and we will continue to do that.\n  Yes, we have to face carbon pollution and the President is taking a \nstand to say he wants to preserve this planet and he is going to follow \nthe signs. Some people have said: We do not like that. Therefore, maybe \nwe should not vote for Gina McCarthy.\n  Can I just say this? The President has his policies, and you do not \nhave to agree with them--or you can. I do. If you do not, that is fair. \nThat is fine. But somebody has to run the Environmental Protection \nAgency. If you have a problem with those policies, you are going to \nhave to go to someone who is intelligent and wise and bipartisan in \nnature to talk to, and Gina McCarthy is one of those people.\n  This is the second time Gina McCarthy has been nominated for a top \nposition at the EPA. She was confirmed by the Senate for her current \nposition, which is the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air \nand Radiation, without one ``no'' vote. Let me reiterate that. No one \nstood up and said no. Everyone supported her.\n  The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported out her \nnomination on May 16. It is July. This is the longest period that EPA \nhas ever gone without an Administrator, and the full Senate should \nconfirm this nominee as soon as possible.\n  When I say Gina McCarthy is the poster child for bipartisanship, I \nmean what I say. She has over three decades of public service at the \nlocal, State, and Federal levels. She has demonstrated a record of \nworking with Republicans and Democrats. Let me just run through the \nRepublicans: The Republican Governor of Connecticut Jodi Rell, four \nRepublican Governors of Massachusetts, William Weld, Paul Cellucci, \nJane Swift, and Mitt Romney; and then a Democratic President, Barack \nObama.\n  Let's look at what former Republican Governor Jane Swift said about \nGina McCarthy in an opinion piece that ran in the Boston Globe. \nRemember, this is a former Republican Governor. She said:\n\n       Gina McCarthy . . . would bring competence, fairness and \n     bipartisanship to Washington. . . .\n\n  And:\n\n       McCarthy's track record of accomplishment and her \n     collaborative, pragmatic approach to policymaking are the \n     reason she enjoys such [strong] support.\n\n  This former Republican Governor goes on to say:\n\n       [T]he Senate has an immediate opportunity to strike a blow \n     for good government and bureaucratic competence by swiftly \n     approving McCarthy's nomination.\n\n  The title of Governor Swift's article in support of Gina reads, ``A \nqualified nominee for the EPA.'' This was written on May 23, 2013.\n  Christine Todd Whitman--we all know her, she was the former EPA \nAdministrator, a Republican--called for a fair confirmation process.\n  You can look at 59 businesses, health officials, environmental \norganizations, scientists--they all support Gina McCarthy. For example, \nDr. Georges Benjamin, Executive Director of the American Public Health \nAssociation, said:\n\n       Ms. McCarthy has been a true champion for public health and \n     has consistently demonstrated her leadership in developing \n     sensible safeguards to protect the public's health from \n     pollution. . . . [She] is well respected by both the public \n     health community and industry and has a solid record of \n     working across the aisle with Democrats and Republicans. . . \n     .\n\n  That is a very strong statement. Then there is Gloria Bergquist, vice \npresident of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. Here is an EPA \nAdministrator nominee getting the support of the vice president of the \nAlliance of Automobile Manufacturers. That is a rarity. This is what \nshe said:\n\n       She's a pragmatic policymaker. She has aspirational \n     environmental goals, but she accepts real-world economics.\n\n  That is why this nominee should be embraced by everyone. Yes, she has \naspirational environmental goals for her grandchildren--someday when \nshe has them--she wants them to breathe clean air and so on, drink \nclean water, but she understands the pragmatics that go into making \npolicy. I believe Gina will lead the EPA to transparency, she will \nfollow the science and the law, and, yes, she will be straight from the \nshoulder and she will tell Republicans and Democrats alike how she sees \nthe issue; when we do not agree, how we can reach agreement. By the \nway, Gina has answered more than 1,000 questions from Republicans on \nthe EPW employment.\n\n  The EPA has provided extensive information to Members of the Senate \nin connection with this nomination. This\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\nis the longest the EPA has gone without an Administrator. How is this \nthe right thing to do? This is the United States of America. This \nPresident deserves to have his people in place the same as a Republican \nPresident.\n  Gina McCarthy has a deep understanding that the health and safety of \nthe American people and a growing economy go hand in hand. She will \nlead the EPA in a manner consistent with her past track record of \nsuccess.\n  From my perspective, approving Gina McCarthy to head the EPA is a \nvery important step toward helping the health of our children as well \nas future generations, and that is our most sacred obligation. We need \nher strong bipartisan approach to lead the EPA.\n  It is no great secret that in this last election both parties were \nfighting for the votes of women. It was a knockdown, drag-out battle. \nThe Democrats won the women's vote, which helped to elect President \nObama--by a lot. The Republicans said: You know what, we have to \nchange, we have to reach out. This is their chance.\n  This woman deserves a promotion. There is nothing in her record that \nshould make anyone fear her. She is a good woman and a hard-working \nperson. She has won unanimous support from this body before, and there \nis no reason why we should not confirm her.\n  I am going to continue to speak out for Gina. I really do believe my \ncolleagues are hearing the truth about Gina. I think they are getting \nthe message that she is quite bipartisan. She has strong support in the \nbusiness community as well as among scientists and others in the health \ncommunity.\n  I am very hopeful, first of all, that there will not be a filibuster. \nThis woman deserves an up-or-down vote. Secondly, my colleagues will \nthink long and hard, and they will agree with so many Republican \nlawmakers and former Governors who served with Gina and will stand up \nand say: She is a good woman and deserves this promotion.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from \nCalifornia Senator Boxer for her very eloquent and powerful words on \nbehalf of my client and friend Gina McCarthy and her appointment as \nAdministrator of the EPA. I don't make any pretense of matching the \npersuasiveness of her statement on behalf of Gina McCarthy, but I am \ngoing to be speaking throughout this week and for as long as it takes \nabout Gina McCarthy because she is not only a client and friend, she is \na consummate public servant and environmental protector.\n  I have known Gina McCarthy for many years. In fact, I was her lawyer, \nwhich is why I say she was a client. As her lawyer, as attorney general \nof the State, she became a friend, not just because of her personal \nqualities of integrity and intelligence but because of her \nprofessionalism as an environmental protector who has sought always to \nrecognize the need for a balance between environmental activism and \neconomic growth. She recognizes a balance involving ardent and \npassionate protection of environmental values as much as anyone could \npossibly bring to this task. She also brings a willingness to listen, a \nwillingness to hear all sides and consider all facts and, in fact, act \nas a passionate fact finder and lawyer as well as someone who respects \nthe letter and spirit of the law.\n  I wish to speak to my colleagues about her respect for the law. It \nisn't just the letter of the law she follows; it is the spirit and \nintent of the legislature. I think that is important and should be \nimportant to this body because she has reflected throughout her career, \nworking for two Republican Governors in Massachusetts and Connecticut, \nher dedication to public interests and to the legislative intent of the \nlaws she fulfills.\n  She is truly an environmental protector for all seasons. She is a \nwoman for all seasons and a public servant for all seasons. Over the \nyears we worked together she was consistently tough, fair, and smart as \nan environmental law enforcer. She recognized the need to balance \nenvironmental activism with economic growth, and she also understood \nthat the two are almost always mutually supportive.\n  I am proud and delighted she has demonstrated her willingness to \nassume this critical position and to face the kind of difficult path \nthis confirmation process has imposed. Achieving confirmation, which I \nactively support, should be truly bipartisan. Blocking a vote on her \nnomination is disappointing and destructive. It is paralyzing partisan \ngamesmanship at its worst.\n  My former colleague is well respected in the environmental and \nbusiness community in my State of Connecticut and around the country \nfor her dedication to listening and developing public leadership and \npractical solutions to environmental challenges. She protects \nenvironmental values and policies while enhancing economic opportunity. \nShe is no foe of the business community or economic progress and job \ncreation. In fact, she sees how protecting economic values is \ncomplementary and supportive to environmental activism.\n  The President couldn't have picked a more qualified person to lead \nthe EPA at this critical time. The combination of her experience, \nintelligence, energy, and unquestioned expertise will make Gina \nMcCarthy an effective EPA Administrator. She has a deep understanding \nthat the health and safety of the American people depends on clean air \nand clean water. The American people, more than ever, understand that \nfact. She is the right person for this job at this time.\n  I urge my colleagues to move forward with her confirmation, to avoid \nobstructionist tactics, and to embrace this nomination as good for all \nof the American people, for all of the interests she has sought to \nrepresent. I urge us to move forward as quickly as possible so this \ncritical agency will have the kind of leadership that is so important \nat this point in our history.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my friend and the President's choice \nto lead the EPA. I assure my colleagues they will not be disappointed.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Fann, who will be retiring August 1, 2013, after 42 years \nof dedicated service to the Federal Government. Mr. Fann demonstrated \ngreat dedication to enhancing the safety and security of the U.S. \nSenate, its staff, and visitors.\n  Mr. Fann began his career in 1969, as a military intelligence officer \nin the U.S. Army, where he performed counterintelligence operations \nagainst East Germany and the Soviet Union. He continued his \nintelligence work in Germany as a U.S. Army civilian, protecting our \nNation during the height of the Cold War, serving in Bremerhaven and \nFrankfurt. Mr. Fann went on to work at the Pentagon for the U.S. Army \nAssistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, supervising intelligence \noperations worldwide.\n  In 1986 Mr. Fann was assigned to an important classified program that \nsupported the Nation's national security and emergency preparedness \noperations. During his 27-year assignment to this project, he was \nappointed to the National Security Agency's Senior Cryptologic \nExecutive Service in 1991, serving as its deputy and later as program \ndirector.\n  Mr. Fann is a proud Texas A Aggie alumnus and a graduate of the \nNational War College.\n  I commend Mr. Fann's contributions and longstanding career in public \nservice. I, along with my colleagues from\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\nboth sides of the aisle, congratulate him on his well-earned retirement \nand wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/08/senate-section/article/S5525-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WASHAKIE COUNTY, WYOMING\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to honor the residents \nof Washakie County, WY as they celebrate their Centennial.\n  Located in northern Wyoming, and nestled in the Big Horn Basin, \nWashakie County is a great place to live and work. Nearly 8,500 \nresidents call Ten Sleep and Worland and the surrounding rural areas \nhome. This unique county offers a glimpse into Wyoming's traditions and \nproud culture.\n  Washakie County got its start when Wyoming Gov. Joseph M. Carey \nsigned the enabling act on April 19, 1911. Worland was chosen over Ten \nSleep in the election for county seat in November 1912 by a vote of 582 \nto 245. County officers took their positions to launch the county in \nJanuary 1913.\n  Washakie County was named for the head chief of the Shoshone people, \nChief Washakie. He was so important to our State and Nation that \nWyoming chose to commemorate his leadership by placing a sculpture of \nhim by Dave McGary in the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center's Emancipation \nHall.\n  World-class archaeological sites are plentiful throughout the Big \nHorn Basin. Worland boasts one of the finest interpretive centers for \ngeology, archaeology, and paleontology at the Washakie Museum and \nCultural Center. Exhibits portray the historical people first \ninhabiting Wyoming's northern area. The Colby Mammoth Site near the Big \nHorn River contained some of the earliest known evidence of human \nactivity in the Cowboy State. One of Washakie County's most famous \ncitizens is George Frison. This world-renowned archeologist began a \nlifelong love of archeology when he found stone tools, rock shelters, \nand rock art on his family ranch near Ten Sleep. His study of the \nprehistoric hunters of the high plains earned him a place on the \nNational Academy of Sciences.\n  In the past 100 years, Washakie County has seen a variety of \nindustries thrive and evolve. Agriculture has long been the backbone of \nthe area. Pioneering irrigation districts made it possible for hard-\nworking operations to survive off the Big Horn River, fed by Wyoming's \nsteep mountain snow runoff. Farmers spend their summer tending to the \nfields for a variety of crops, including barley for the hops component \nin MillerCoors and Budweiser products. A number of farms produce sugar \nbeets that are processed by Wyoming Sugar Company LLC, which is owned \nby producer-investors. Other crops grown in the area include alfalfa, \nbeans, beets, and corn.\n  Residents of Washakie County have worked hard to ensure a healthy \nrelationship between energy, natural resources, and agriculture. Oil \nreserves were discovered as far back as 1914. Coal bed methane has also \nboomed over the years, helping the United States move toward our goal \nof energy independence. Bentonite is abundant throughout the Basin, \nhelping make Wyoming the leading bentonite supplier in the world.\n  Ten Sleep currently holds the honor of Wyoming's ``Best Tasting \nDrinking Water'' proclaimed by the Wyoming Association of Rural Water \nSystems. Water from the Madison Aquifer is not only bragged about, it \nalso provides the opportunity for a niche industry. Relied upon for \ndecades by local farmers and ranchers, Aquavista 100% Pure Artesian \nDrinking Water is bottled locally. Admiral Beverage Corporation also \nutilizes the water source. Operations began in Worland in 1945 and they \nhave become the primary supplier of carbonated soft drinks throughout \nthe region.\n  Washakie County welcomes all adventure seekers, young and old. In the \nwinter, the Meadowlark Ski Lodge hosts skiers and snowboards within the \nboundaries of the Big Horn National Forest. Endless recreation \nopportunities can be found on over 900,000 acres of Bureau of Land \nManagement public land access, including hunting, fishing, hiking, \nhorseback riding, rock climbing, photography, and wildlife watching. In \nfact, you can still observe horses roaming the rolling hills and rugged \ncanyons and badlands within the Fifteenmile Herd Management Area, \nestablished in 1985. US highway 16's Scenic Byway is an ideal route for \ntravelers headed to Yellowstone. The majestic vistas, seen while \ndriving though Ten Sleep Canyon, are unparalleled.\n  It is an honor to recognize the residents of Washakie County as they \ncelebrate their 100th anniversary. This year, the Washakie County \nCentennial Committee has planned a countywide celebration on July 12 \nand 13 to commemorate this milestone. A committee of dedicated citizens \nspearheaded this celebration and deserves recognition. A big thank you \ngoes to Cheri Shelp, Dustin Fuller, Lauree Schmeltzer, Phyllis Lewis, \nBert Bresach, Linda Abell, and Sherryl Ferguson. I invite my colleagues \nto visit the communities of Washakie County. The county's rich \nheritage, geological wonders, and genuine cowboy hospitality provide a \ntruly wonderful experience to visitors from all over the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/08/senate-section/article/S5525-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO KRYS BART\n\n Mr. HELLER.

After 14 \nyears as president and CEO of the Reno-Tahoe Airport Authority and \ndirecting operations at Reno-Tahoe International Airport, RNO, Krys is \nretiring. She has demonstrated commendable leadership during her tenure \nand service to the people of the State of Nevada.\n  As the principal director of Reno-Tahoe International Airport, Krys \nhas established a reputation for efficiency and excellence. Her role \nrequired her to manage a multi-million dollar budget, and under her \nleadership, Reno-Tahoe International Airport has twice been recognized \nby the Air Transport Research Society as one of the five most efficient \nairports in North America. She was named the 2007 Airport Director of \nthe Year by the Airport Revenue News Magazine, and her dedication to \nthe aviation industry has earned her the Distinguished Service Award \nfrom the American Association of Airport Executives, AAAE.\n  Her dedication as a business executive is no less impressive. In \n2004, Krys was named one of the seven most respected CEOs in Nevada by \nthe Nevada Business Journal, and was inducted into the Reno Business \nLeaders Hall of Fame the following year. Krys is also heavily involved \nin her local community, serving on the board of directors for the \nEconomic Development Authority of Western Nevada, as well as on the \nNevada Humane Society Board.\n  I want to thank Krys for her many lasting contributions to aviation \nand air travel in the State of Nevada, as well as for her dedicated \nefforts in business and community development. I congratulate her on \nthe special occasion of her retirement, and join with all Nevadans in \nwishing her many successful and fulfilling years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/08/senate-section/article/S5525-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5525-S5526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on June 28, 2013, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has agreed to the following concurrent \nresolution, without amendment;\n\n       S.

A bill to amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to \nsupport community college and industry partnerships, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation that I \nam introducing called the Community College to Career Fund Act. This \nlegislation is aimed at closing what is called the skills gap--the gap \nbetween the skills that businesses need to fill open positions, and the \nskills that workers have. Closing the skills gap will mean more \nAmericans get jobs and businesses get the workforce they need. It is \nkey to the future prosperity and economic competitiveness of our \nNation.\n  When I travel around Minnesota and talk to employers, the single \nbiggest thing they tell me they need is a workforce capable of handling \nthe jobs of the 21st century. Finding qualified employees is \nparticularly a problem for our manufacturers. Recent surveys in \nMinnesota show that \\1/3\\ to \\1/2\\ of manufacturers have job openings \nthat they can't fill. They want to hire people, but they can't, because \nthey can't find employees with the skills they need.\n  Meanwhile, unemployment continues to be far too high. With so many \nAmericans still looking for jobs, and employers seeking to fill open \npositions, this is a problem that we have to solve.\n  Minnesota and many other States are working to address this problem \nby bringing businesses and community colleges together. There is a lot \nwe can learn from these efforts, and my legislation supports and builds \non what has been working in Minnesota.\n  Take, for example, Hennepin Technical College in Minnesota. Local \nmanufacturers have joined with Hennepin Tech to form the M-Powered \nProgram, which trains students in manufacturing skills so they can fill \nopen jobs. When I met with them recently, they told me that 93 percent \nof the program's nearly 300 graduates have permanent jobs. That is a \nprogram that's working.\n  In Alexandria, MN, businesses and community colleges have been \nworking together for years and offer another powerful example of \nsuccess. Douglas County is like the Silicon Valley of packaging \nmachines, and businesses there work with Alexandria Technical and \nCommunity College, which is ranked one of the best in the country. The \nmanufacturers have donated machinery to train the students so that they \ncan gain the skills needed for jobs at those businesses. When they \ngraduate, students get snapped up by one of the companies. In fact, at \nthe height of the recession in 2009-2010, Douglas County's unemployment \nrate was a good 3 points lower than the rest of the State.\n  There is the Right Skills Now program, which is a partnership between \nthe Manufacturing Institute, ACT, the National Institute of \nMetalworking Skills and the President's Job council. This program \nstarted as a pilot program in Minnesota, and has since expanded to \nNevada and Michigan. I visited the program at South Central College in \nFaribault, MN, and held a roundtable with participating businesses. I \nasked each of them how many jobs they were ready to hire for, and \nbetween them, there were 40 or 50 jobs that needed to be filled. There \nwere only 17 students in the first term that this program was offered, \nand the numbers are obviously in those students' favor to find a job.\n  There are many other examples of this approach working in Minnesota, \nas well as across the country. It is happening in Rochester, Brainerd, \nand Duluth, Minnesota. The Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee \nof the HELP Committee held a hearing last year where we heard about \nfour great examples of these partnerships from all over the country. \nThis approach is putting Americans back to work and helping businesses \ngrow nationwide, and we need to support those efforts.\n  That is exactly what my bill would do. It would create a Community \nCollege to Career Fund, which would offer competitive grants for \npartnerships between businesses and community colleges aimed at closing \nthe skills gap. The partnerships would compete by demonstrating how \nthey would fill in-demand jobs.\n  This bill rewards what works, giving flexibility for the partnerships \nto determine the strategy that best fits their needs, including \napprenticeships, paid internships, partnerships with high schools, or \nupdating training equipment. My bill also leverages private \ninvestments, rewarding those partnerships that bring outside resources \nto the table.\n  I hear all the time from businesses that are desperate to hire \npeople, if only they could find the right talent. This is a tremendous \nopportunity to get Americans back to work by helping them get the \nskills that they need. The Community College to Career Fund Act would \nseize that opportunity, allow our businesses to grow and expand, and \nposition our workforce, and our country, for prosperity into the \nfuture. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/08/senate-section/article/S5528-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5528-S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n          COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to promote democracy and the rule of law throughout the \n     Western Hemisphere;\n       (2) to promote and protect human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms in the Western Hemisphere; and\n       (3) to support the practices, purposes, and principles \n     expressed in the Charter of the Organization of American \n     States, the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of \n     Man, the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and other \n     fundamental instruments of democracy.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Organization of American States (OAS) should be the \n     primary multi-lateral diplomatic entity for regional dispute \n     resolution and promotion of democratic governance and \n     institutions;\n       (2) the OAS is a valuable platform from which to launch \n     initiatives aimed to benefit the countries of the Western \n     Hemisphere;\n       (3) the Summit of the Americas institution and process \n     embodies a valuable complement to regional dialogue and \n     cooperation;\n       (4) the Summit of the Americas process should be formally \n     and more effectively integrated into the work of the OAS, the \n     Inter-American Development Bank, and other Members of the \n     Joint Summit Working Group, and the OAS should play a central \n     role in overseeing and managing the Summit process;\n       (5) the OAS General Assembly and the Summit of the Americas \n     events should be combined geographically and chronologically \n     in the years in which they coincide;\n       (6) to ensure an appropriate balance of priorities, the OAS \n     should review its core functions no less than annually and \n     seek opportunities to reduce the number of mandates not \n     directly related to its core functions;\n       (7) key OAS strengths lie in strengthening peace and \n     security, promoting and consolidating representative \n     democracy, regional dispute resolution, election assistance \n     and monitoring, fostering economic growth and development \n     cooperation, facilitating trade, addressing migration, \n     combating illicit drug trafficking and transnational crime, \n     and support for the Inter-American Human Rights System;\n       (8) the core competencies referred to in paragraph (7) \n     should remain central to the strategic planning process of \n     the OAS and the consideration of future mandates;\n       (9) any changes to OAS mandates should be accepted by the \n     member states only after an analysis is conducted and \n     formally presented consisting of a calculation of the \n     financial costs associated with the mandate, an assessment of \n     the comparative advantage of the OAS in the implementation of \n     the mandate, and a description of the ways in which the \n     mandate advances the organization's core mission;\n       (10) any new mandates should include, in addition to the \n     analysis described in paragraph (9), an identification of the \n     source of funding to be used to implement the mandate;\n       (11) the OAS would benefit from enhanced coordination \n     between the OAS and the Inter-American Development Bank on \n     issues that relate to economic development;\n       (12) the OAS would benefit from standard reporting \n     requirements for each project and grant agreement; and\n       (13) the OAS would benefit from effective implementation \n     of--\n       (A) transparent and merit-based human resource standards \n     and processes; and\n       (B) transparent hiring, firing, and promotion standards and \n     processes, including\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\n     with respect to factors such as gender and national origin.\n\n     SEC. 5.
