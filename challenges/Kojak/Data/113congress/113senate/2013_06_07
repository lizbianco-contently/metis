Mr. President, today Senators will have an opportunity to \ndebate the bipartisan immigration bill reported by the Chair's \ncommittee last month. As I have already done once today, I again \ncommend the chairman of that committee Senator Leahy for leading a \nthorough and transparent process in the committee.\n  I thank Senator Sessions for working with us yesterday to move \nforward on this measure as quickly as possible. As I have said before, \nSenator Sessions and I--once in a while--disagree on substance, but we \nhave always had a friendly relationship, which I appreciate.\n  I applaud the efforts of the Gang of 8--four Democrats and four \nRepublicans--to set aside partisanship to address a critical issue \nfacing our Nation. The system is broken and needs to be fixed.\n  It is gratifying to see the momentum behind this package of \ncommonsense reforms, which will make our country safer and help 11 \nmillion undocumented immigrants get right with the law.\n  I had a number of meetings over the last few days with pollsters who \nhave taken a look at this legislation, and they all acknowledge that \nthe vast majority of American people want us to move forward. \nDemocrats, Independents, and Republicans recognize the system is broken \nand needs to be fixed. They all agree on a pathway to citizenship.\n  I have been committed to a process that is as open as possible for \namendments. I don't want to say totally because sometimes with the \nprocedures we have here--as with the farm bill--people throw a monkey \nwrench into things, and we are not able to do things as we would wish \nto do them.\n  We will wrap up work on this legislation before the July 4 recess. I \nhope\n\n[[Page S3998]]\n\nSenators will take advantage of today's time for debate. I look forward \nto a thorough and thoughtful discussion of the deliberation in the days \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S3998-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his kind \ncomments. I also note that throughout the markup and debate on the \nimmigration bill, his advice and his counsel was always there. We \ndiscussed it many times, and I appreciate the fact he made it very \nclear the bill would come up at the time he said. We would not have it \nhere without his strong support, so I appreciate Senator Reid's very \nnice comments this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is important legislation, the \nimmigration bill. I was able to have a discussion with Senator Reid \nyesterday. He was moving forward on the motion to proceed to the bill \nwhich requires considerable debate. I asked for and insisted on the \nopportunity to have some time today to talk about it, and he agreed to \nthat. I think that was a good step, and I thank him for that agreement.\n  We have a lot to talk about. The matters are complex and important, \nand I urge my colleagues to pay real attention to the legislation. This \nis the bill, as printed, front and back of each page. It was reportedly \ngoing to be 1,000 pages, and our colleagues were proud to say it was \n800 pages. Since then, more has been added to it, and now it is over \n1,000 pages again.\n  It is very complex and there are certain key points with multiple \nreferences to other code sections that are in existing law; therefore, \nit is very difficult to read.\n  It takes a considerable amount of time, and I don't even suspect the \nGang of 8 has had the time to read, digest, and understand fully what \nis in the legislation.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. The people whom I know who are \nconcerned about this legislation in Congress are not against \nimmigration. I certainly am not. We admit about 1 million people a year \nlegally into our country, and that is a substantial number by any \nstandard. Indeed, it is the highest of any country in the world. It is \nimportant we execute that policy in an effective way as it impacts our \nwhole Nation.\n  Immigration has enriched our culture. It has boosted our economy, and \nwe have had tremendously wonderful people who have come here--people \nwho have contributed to our arts, our business and economy, science and \nsports. We have had a good run with immigration in a lot of ways, but \nwe need to ask ourselves at this point in time: Is it working within \nlimits? Are the American people happy with what we are doing? Are we \nmoving in the right direction?\n  We know our generous policies have resulted in a substantial flow of \npeople into the country, and our challenge today is to create a lawful \nsystem of immigration that serves the national interests and admits \nthose people into our country who are most likely to be successful, to \nprosper, and to flourish, therefore, most likely to be beneficial to \nAmerica. Surely we can agree that is a good policy, and it has not been \nour policy prior to this.\n  We have both the enormous illegal flow of people into the country as \nwell as a legal flow that is not evaluated in a way that other advanced \nnations do when they execute their policies of immigration, for \nexample, Canada. We should establish smart rules for admittance, rules \nthat benefit America, rules that must be enforced, and must be lawful. \nWe cannot reject a dutiful, good person to America and then turn around \nand allow someone else who came in illegally to benefit from breaking \nour laws to the disadvantage of the good person who, when told no, had \nto accept that answer. It is just the way we are.\n  So we must establish smart rules for admittance, rules that benefit \nAmerica, and these rules have to be enforced--and that is not happening \ntoday.\n  The current policies we have are not serving our country well; \ntherefore, a reformed immigration system should spend some time in \ndepth in public analysis of how and what we should consider as we \ndecide who should be admitted, because we cannot admit everybody. When \nthat is done, we need to create a system we can expect to actually work \nto enforce the standards we have. I believe we can make tremendous \nprogress, and we can fix this system. It needs to be fixed.\n  The legislation that has been offered by the Gang of 8 says they \nfixed it. Don't worry; we have taken care of all that is needed; we \nhave a plan that will be compassionate to people who have been here and \nwe have a plan which will work in the future and end illegality. Well, \nit won't do that, and that is the problem.\n  It will definitely give amnesty today. It will definitely give \nimmediate legal status to some 11 million people today, but the \npromises of enforcement in the future, the promises that the \nlegislation will focus on a way that enhances the success rate of \npeople who come to America is not fulfilled in the legislation.\n  Read the bill and see what is in it. I wish it were different. We \nwill talk about in the days and weeks to come what is in the bill and \nwhy it fails. I can share with everyone how it is we came to have such \na flawed bill before us. We need to understand that as we go forward.\n  I am amazed the Gang of 8 has sent such legislation forward, and how \naggressively they defended it in the Judiciary Committee. We did have a \nmarkup in the Judiciary Committee. We were allowed to offer amendments \nand had some debate there, but it was an odd thing. Repeatedly members \nwho were not even in the Gang of 8 said: I like this amendment, but I \ncannot vote for it because I understand it upsets the deal. We need to \nask ourselves: Who made the deal? Whose deal is this? How is it that \nthe deal is such that Members of the Senate who agreed to an amendment \nsay they must vote against the amendment because it upsets some deal? \nWho was in this room? Who was in the deal-making process? So I think \nthat was a revealing time in the committee. They had agreed and stated \nopenly there would be no substantial changes in the agreements the Gang \nof 8 made, and they would stick together and vote against any changes \nexcept for minor changes. There were a number of amendments accepted, a \nnumber of Republican amendments accepted. Many of those were second \ndegree or altered by the majority in the committee, but none of those \nfundamentally altered the framework and the substance of this \nlegislation. I don't think that is disputable, and we will talk about \nthat. So this is the problem we are working with.\n\n  So how did the legislation become as ineffective as it is? I \ncontend--I think it is quite plain--it is because it was not written by \nindependent Members of the Senate in a more open process but was \nwritten by special interests. I wish to share some thoughts on that \nsubject right now because I think it goes to the heart of the \ndifficulties we have.\n  There were continual meetings over a period of quite a number of \nmonths that got this bill off on the wrong track in the beginning. \nPowerful groups met, excluding the interests of the American people, \nexcluding the law enforcement community. Throughout the bill we can see \nthe influence these groups had on the drafting of it. Some of the \ngroups actually did the drafting.\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\nA lot of the language clearly came from the special interest groups \nengaged in these secret negotiations.\n  What is a special interest group? A special interest group is a group \nof people who have a commitment, an interest they want to advance, but \nthey don't pretend to share the national interest. So maybe it is a \nlegitimate special interest, maybe it is not a legitimate special \ninterest, but they have a special interest, a particular interest they \nwant to advance.\n  So this is what happened: Big labor and big business were active in \ndrafting this legislation, with the entire deal obviously hanging on, \nit was reported, their negotiations. For example, the Wall Street \nJournal, March 10:\n\n       Competing interests abound. The Chamber of Commerce and \n     businesses it represents are locked into negotiations with \n     the AFL-CIO about workers in industries like hospitality and \n     landscaping. Meanwhile, farm-worker unions have been quietly \n     negotiating with growers associations about how to revamp \n     short-term visas for agricultural workers. And senators on \n     both sides of the aisle are weighing in to ensure their state \n     industries are protected.\n\n  The Washington Post, March 10: ``Hush-hush Meetings for Gang of 8 \nsenators as they work on sweeping immigration bill.'' The article \nreads:\n\n       They are struggling on the question of legal immigration \n     and future workers, and are trading proposals with leaders of \n     the AFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce to try to get a deal.\n\n  ``Try to get a deal,'' they are working on a deal.\n  How about this: Roll Call, March 21:\n\n       Talks led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO over \n     a new guest-worker program for lower-skilled immigrants are \n     stalled, prompting members of the bipartisan group of eight \n     senators to get personally involved to try to nudge the \n     negotiations on to resolution.\n\n  So the Senators were not in those discussions. The Senators, when it \ngot to be tough and things weren't moving along, they came in to try to \negg it on, to get the agreement. Who is the agreement between? It is \nbetween the unions and big business, which are representing the \nAmerican worker, effectively.\n  New York Times, March 30:\n\n       The nation's top businesses and labor groups have reached \n     an agreement on a guest worker program for low-skilled \n     immigrants, a person with knowledge of the negotiations said \n     . . . Senator Schumer convened a conference call on Friday \n     night with Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, and Richard L. Trumka, the president of \n     the AFL-CIO, the nation's main federation of labor unions, in \n     which they agreed in principle on a guest worker program for \n     low-skilled, year-round, temporary workers.\n\n  We know there is one group not included in these talks, and that is \nthe group given the duty to enforce the immigration laws. The national \nICE union, the customs and enforcement organization, pleaded with the \nGang of 8 to consult them. They urged the Gang of 8, they wrote letters \nto the Gang of 8, and I sent information to the Gang of 8 asking them \nto consult with the officers who have the duty to enforce this law, but \nto no avail. They were shut out of every meeting and never have been \nconsulted.\n  It is interesting to note, however, that others weren't shut out of \nthe meeting. They weren't left out of the room.\n  The Washington Post, April 13:\n\n       While Obama has allowed Senate negotiators to work on a \n     compromise that can win approval, a White House staff member \n     attends each staff-level meeting to monitor progress and \n     assist with the technical aspects of writing the bill.\n\n  So there has been an attempt to suggest that this is truly a \ncongressional action, that the White House is just sort of hands off. \nBut we know the White House is deeply involved in this and approving \nevery aspect or disapproving aspects they don't like. The question is, \nWho is influencing this? Who is influencing the White House, President \nObama?\n  The Daily Caller, on February 6, notes this:\n\n       On February 5th, Obama held a White House meeting with a \n     series of industry leaders, progressive advocates and ethnic \n     lobbies, including La Raza, to boost support for his plan \n     that would provide a conditional amnesty to 11 million \n     illegal aliens, allow new immigrants to get residency for \n     their relatives and elderly parents, and also establish rules \n     for a ``Future Flow'' of skilled and unskilled workers. The \n     invitees included the CEO of Goldman-Sachs, Motorola, \n     Marriott, and DeLoitte.\n\n  So they are in the meeting, apparently.\n  Also, we know participating in a lot of these discussions was the \nAmerican Immigration Lawyers Association. This group obviously was \ninvolved in writing the bill, and I have to tell my colleagues that \nthey will be the biggest winners of this legislation.\n  Time and again, rules that were fairly clear--and probably should \nhave been made clearer--are muddled, provisions were placed in that \nwill create litigation and encourage lawsuits, delays, and will \nincrease costs. For example, ``hardship'' is the new standard for many \nwaivers and exemptions in this bill, in many cases the exemptions are \nfor family problems and other things of that nature. Well, when ICE \nsays a person should be deported, then the deportee has the ability to \nsay: Well, I have a hardship. My mother is here, I have a brother who \nis sick, or I need this or that.\n\n  What does ``hardship'' mean? It means a trial. That is what it means. \nSo the Immigration Lawyers Association was substantially involved in \nthe meetings.\n  Politico, on March 9, said:\n\n       In a bid to capitalize on the shared interest in \n     immigration reform, a budget deal and new trade pacts, the \n     White House has launched a charm offensive toward corporate \n     America since the November election, hosting more than a \n     dozen conference calls with top industry officials--which \n     have not previously been disclosed--along with a flurry of \n     meetings at the White House.\n\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       Participants on the recent calls include the heads of \n     Goldman Sachs, the Business Roundtable, Evercore, Silver \n     Lake, Centerbridge Partners, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as \n     well as the heads of Washington trade groups representing the \n     banking industry, such as the Financial Services Roundtable.\n\n  So they have been involved in these discussions. Even foreign \ncountries have had a say in drafting our law.\n  The Hill, on February 7, reported:\n\n       Mexico's new Ambassador to the U.S., Eduardo Medina-Mora, \n     has had a ``number of meetings with the administration'' \n     where the issue of immigration has come up since he took \n     office last month, said a Mexican official familiar with the \n     process. He is expected to meet with lawmakers shortly as \n     legislation begins to take form. ``Probably like no other \n     country, we are a player in this particular issue,'' the \n     source said.\n\n  Well, the law officers weren't in the room, we know that. People who \nquestion economically the size and scope and nature of our immigration \nsystem weren't in the room.\n  So in case anyone doubts the role of special interests in drafting \nthe legislation, pay attention to this quote by Frank Sharry, executive \ndirector of the liberal pro-amnesty group, America's Voice, in the Wall \nStreet Journal, April 17:\n\n       The triggers are based on developing plans and spending \n     money, not on reaching that effectiveness, which is really \n     quite clever.\n\n  In other words, the sponsors of the bill were telling everyone they \nhad triggers in the bill that would guarantee enforcement of laws in \nthe future about immigration flow into America, and that if enforcement \ndidn't occur, the triggers would stop people from being legalized and \nend the process. That is not so. We have studied the language and we \nknow the triggers are ineffectual and are not significant and won't \nwork. That will be explained in the days to come.\n  Mr. Sharry acknowledges it. He said it was clever to have these faux \ntriggers--these triggers that will not work--because we can tell \neverybody: Don't worry, the legality will not occur if the enforcement \ndoesn't occur. But in clever ways they drafted a bill that will not \nwork. They will say it works, but it will not work.\n  Again, with all of the slush funds in this bill, there are a number \nof them that go to private activist groups, community action groups. It \nis easy to see that special interests had a seat at the negotiation \ntable.\n  The National Review, on May 29, reported:\n\n       A number of immigration-activist groups, such as the \n     National Council of La Raza, would be eligible to receive \n     millions in taxpayer funding to ``advise'' illegal immigrants \n     applying for legal status under the bill.\n\n  So money will go to these activist groups, such as La Raza. La Raza \nis responsible for advocating, not enforcing, our laws. So La Raza is \nin the meetings. La Raza is an open advocate for not enforcing laws \ninvolving illegal immigration. They are active participants in \nadvocating for amnesty. They\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\nare going to get money out of the deal with some of the grant programs, \nwhile the law officers who have the ability to tell the committee, the \nGang of 8, how to make the system work are shut out of the process.\n  Were prosecutors involved in the process? No, they have not been.\n  The National Immigration Forum, a pro-immigrant group, has been \ninvolved in some of these discussions.\n  So some people have said the bill had to be drafted in secret, but \nthat the markup process in the Judiciary Committee would be open and \ntransparent. But that is only partially so. We did have a markup. We \nwere allowed, those who had objections to the bill, to offer \namendments, as did those who support the bill. We had the opportunity \nto talk and offer amendments. But at every turn in the committee the \nmembers of the Gang of 8 expressed support on occasions for certain \namendments, only to vote against the amendment. Due, they said, to the \nagreement, they had to vote together and against significant \namendments, regardless of their personal feelings.\n  The gang influenced other members on the committee to do the same. \nThe Huffington Post, April 16, headline: ``Senate Immigration Group \nTurns to Keeping Fragile Agreement Intact.''\n  It goes on to quote Senator McCain as saying:\n\n       We will pledge to oppose, all eight of us, provisions that \n     would destroy the fragile agreement we have.\n\n  So they have an agreement. They have an agreement with the unions and \nbig business and the agribusinesses and the food processors and La Raza \nand the immigration lawyers. They have an agreement with them, and they \nare going to defend it, even though they acknowledge amendments that \nwere offered would improve the bill. This is no way to serve the \nnational interest, in my view.\n\n  In discussing an amendment that would require workers to make a good-\nfaith effort to hire American workers first, Senator Whitehouse said \nthis--this is what happened in the committee--\n\n       I'm in a position which I'm being informed that this would \n     be a deal breaker to the deal. I, frankly, don't see how that \n     could be the case, but I'm not privy to that understanding, \n     and so I'm going to vote in support of the agreement that has \n     been reached.\n\n  In other words, Senator Whitehouse says: Well, I do not understand \nthis. I would like to vote the other way, but I am told you have a deal \nand this would damage the deal and so I cannot vote for it. He was not \neven in the Gang of 8 but went along with that.\n  Related to that same amendment, Senator Franken echoed the remarks, \nsaying:\n\n       I really just want to associate myself with Senator \n     Whitehouse's remarks.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I don't want to be a deal breaker.\n\n  In discussing an amendment that would increase family-based \nimmigration, Senator Feinstein noted:\n\n       I think it's been a unique process because those people who \n     are members of a group that put this together have stood \n     together and have voted against amendments that they felt \n     would be a violation of the bipartisan agreement that brought \n     both sides together.\n\n  I am not sure that is always good. I am not sure that is the right \nthing to do to set public policy in America: to have some secret \nagreement, reached with a group of people we hardly know who they are, \ntrump the ability to do the right thing for the American people.\n  I want to say that is what has happened here. And the point to make \nis, and what I think our colleagues need to understand and the American \npeople need to understand: In reality, the special interests--La Raza, \nthe unions, the corporate world, the big agriculture businesses, the \nfood processors--they are the ones that made the agreement in this \nprocess, and the Senators merely ratified it, and they cannot agree to \na change because they promised these special interest groups things. So \nif La Raza would accept point A that somebody wanted accepted, and the \nunions would accept point B, then they would both agree: I will do A if \nyou will do B.\n  Then the bill gets to the floor and somebody says: A is wrong and we \nshould not put that in the bill. Let's change that. Oh, no, we cannot \nchange that. We have an agreement. The agreement with who? La Raza, the \nagribusinesses, the Chamber of Commerce, Microsoft, Zuckerberg. That is \nwhat happened here. I am just telling you. And the people who drafted \nthis bill, the people who have advocated these special interests--we \nshould not be surprised at their influence. Businesses, groups, \norganizations have special interests. There is nothing inherently wrong \nwith that. What is wrong is that Members of Congress--Members of the \nSenate--need to be representing the national interests, the people's \ninterests, the workers' interests in America. That is what we need to \nbe doing--not representing the special interests.\n  I have to tell you, the openness of this is sort of breathtaking to \nme. Who is protecting the national interests? Did they have any of the \ntop-ranked economists in this country being asked what would be the \nright number of low-skilled workers to bring into America? Did they \nhave any of the top experts say how many advanced science degrees can \nwe have? How many of our college graduates are unemployed? What is the \nright number? None of this was apparently discussed by our colleagues \nwho allowed this process to go forward.\n  I would say, finally, with regard to the special interests, they have \nno interest--virtually none of them that were involved in this \nprocess--of guaranteeing in the future that we do not have more \nillegally immigration. That is the failure here. They do not have any \ninterest in that and, therefore, there was no intensity of interest in \nthat aspect of the legislation.\n  Oh, there was a lot of interest in how many computer programmers \ncould be admitted or how many agriculture workers or how many low-\nskilled factory workers or construction workers or other workers. They \nall worried about that. They fought over that. That is what these \nnegotiations were about. There were internal discussions and \ndisagreements.\n  But nobody was investing any time or interest in the second phase of \nthis. If you have an amnesty, if you have a legality of millions of \npeople who came here illegally, what are we going to do to ensure it \ndoes not happen in the future?\n  I was a Federal prosecutor. I personally tried an immigration case \nmyself. I bet nobody else here can say that. So I am aware you have to \nhave certain legal processes and certain investments in investigative \nand enforcement mechanisms to make the system work in the future.\n  As we go forward with this debate, we are going to show--and it is \ngoing to be clear--that this has not been fixed and, in fact, the \nstandards of current law with regard to what ought to be done--\nrequirements in current Federal law--are being weakened, some of them \neviscerated by this bill.\n  This bill is far weaker than the 2007 legislation. I do not think \nthere is any doubt about that. It will be clear when we get through it. \nIt was rejected by the American people--the 2007 agreement--and it \nactually weakens current law in quite a number of significant areas--\nweakens current law--while we are being told: Do not worry, this is the \ntoughest bill ever.\n  If I am mistaken, I am sure we will hear about that as we discuss it. \nThis is a great democracy we are part of and I am expressing my view. \nBut I have spent some time on these issues. I was involved with it in \n2006 and 2007. I was a Federal prosecutor. I have done this over the \nyears. I know how our ICE agents work, our Border Patrol agents work, \nour customs and immigration service people work. I have worked with \nthem. I have tried cases for them. I know them personally. They have \nbeen left out of this process.\n  The ICE union has voted no confidence in John Morton, their \nsupervisor. What a dramatic event. I am not aware of that ever \nhappening in my 14 years-plus as a Federal prosecutor--the actual \nemployment union declaring that they have no confidence in their \nsupervisor. And what did they say? They said he spends all his time \nadvocating for amnesty and not enforcing the laws. He is directing us \nto not follow legal requirements we took an oath to follow.\n  And get this: The ICE officers have filed a lawsuit in Federal court \nattacking Secretary Napolitano, or at least the conduct of her office. \nThey have asserted she is not above the law, she is not authorized to \ndirect them not to follow plain requirements of Federal law. The \nFederal judge initially seemed to accept the validity of the lawsuit.\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\n  I have never heard of that before. This is an incredible event. \nNobody is even talking about it. It has been the position of this \nadministration, everybody has to know, to see that the law is not being \neffectively enforced, particularly in the interior of America.\n\n  That has basically been--some even acknowledge--a de facto amnesty \nbecause you are directing your law officers not to do their duty. You \nbasically eliminated the law. The administration should not be doing \nthat. Congress has refused to change these laws time and again. If \nanything, they have sometimes increased them, strengthened them. And \nnow we have our agents blocked from enforcing them.\n  The U.S. customs and immigration service that deals with the visas, \ndeals with the applications for citizenship--CIS, the Citizenship and \nImmigration Service, they deal with the citizenship processes and the \npaperwork and all of that. They have written in opposition to this \nlegislation.\n  So first, the ICE officers--Chris Crane, the head of that group, has \nwritten a powerful letter in detail condemning this legislation, saying \nit will not work, it will make matters worse, and it will endanger \nnational security.\n  The Citizenship and Immigration Service group that deals with the \npaperwork and the citizenship processing and the visa work--and a lot \nof that--has likewise written saying this bill will not work and they \noppose it.\n  Well, I have to say, somebody needs to be thinking about what is \ngoing on here. Right. Amnesty--done. The promise of enforcement, the \ntoughest bill ever in the future--no, sir, not there, not close. That \nis why we have a problem. I cannot understand why people would not want \nthe legal system to be complete, to be effective, and would be followed \nso we as Americans could be proud of it.\n  There is a lot of power behind this legislation. I can feel it. When \nI raise questions, push-back comes. You are not politically correct; \nyou are unkind; you do not like immigrants. That is offensive to me. I \nbelieve in immigration. We have a million people who come in here every \nyear legally. I do not oppose that. I do not oppose doing something \nresponsible and compassionate for the people who have been here a long \ntime illegally. But we have to be careful about it.\n  But the American people are so right on their basic instinct about \nthis matter. I have to say how I believe the American people's hearts \nand souls are good about immigration. A lot of people think: Well, we \nhave to meet in secret and we have to run this bill through as fast as \npossible because we do not want the American people to find out about \nit because they do not like immigrants. Not so. A recent poll revealed \nsomething very important, and our Members of this body and the House \nneed to know it. It said: If you are angry about the way things are \ngoing with regard to immigration, are you angry at the people who came \ninto the country illegally or are you angry at the government officials \nfor allowing it to happen? Mr. President, 12 percent said they were \nangry at the people who entered illegally. Mr. President, 88 percent \nsaid they were angry at public officials for not creating a legal \nsystem that will work.\n  Doesn't that speak well of the American people? You could be angry \nabout somebody who came into our country in violation of the law. But I \nthink the American people understand that people want to come here, and \nit is our duty to stop it. They have been pleading with Congress for \nover 30 years to do something about it, to create a lawful system, to \nend the lawlessness, to do the right thing, to create immigration \nprocesses that we can be proud of, such as Canada has and other \ncountries around the world have.\n  We believe in immigration. We want to do the right thing, but it \nneeds to be lawful. We have more applicants for admission into America \nthan we can possibly accept. I was in, I believe, Peru with Senator \nSpecter a number of years ago, and a poll was called to our attention \nfrom Nicaragua that said 60 percent of the people in Nicaragua said \nthey would come to America if they could--60 percent. Then the \nAmbassador in Peru told us they had a poll around there that said 70 \npercent.\n  Well, everybody cannot come to America.\n  We are not able to assimilate or absorb that. We all know that. We \nall agree with that. So therefore you set rules and processes that we \ncan be proud of, that are fair and objective, and that people who want \nto come meet those standards and they wait their turn and they come \nlawfully.\n  We have had from this administration and prior administrations--\nPresident Bush also--too little interest in seeing that the law is \nenforced. We have loopholes in our laws and processes that need to be \nfixed. We can do that with a good immigration bill, but this one does \nnot get it done.\n  I noticed that my friend did an op-ed yesterday--Karl Rove, who was \nPresident Bush's political adviser, a man of great talent back in the \nday that we were in college together. He quotes a lot of polls that say \nthe American people are willing to accept legal processes and status \nfor people in this country. I acknowledge that. They are. But he does \nnot quote the polls that say overwhelmingly that they want the \nillegality ended. They want border security first because they are \nsmart enough to know that if we do not get border security now, we may \nnever get it. In fact, they want to get it. History tells us so.\n  He did not quote a recent Rasmussen poll. This is what was in the \nRasmussen polling report. The so-called Gang of 8 proposal in the \nSenate legalizes the status of immigrants first and promises to secure \nthe border later. By a 4-to-1 margin, people want that process \nreversed. My good friend Karl Rove did not quote that.\n  Additionally, while voters think highly of immigrants, which speaks \nwell of us as American people, they do not trust the government. That \nskepticism is growing. In January 45 percent thought it was at least \nsomewhat likely that the Federal Government would work to secure the \nborder and prevent future illegal immigration. Today only 30 percent \nhas that confidence. Why? Because they are beginning to learn that this \nbill does not do what they were told it was going to do.\n  The growing awareness of the border control issue has led to other \nshifts in public opinion as well. Early in the year Democrats were \ntrusted more than Republicans on the issue of immigration. Now that has \nswitched. Well, we are not interested in politics, we are interested in \ndoing the right thing. When we do the right thing, the people will \naffirm it.\n  So Mr. Rove goes on to say: Now, do not say amnesty.\n  My friend Karl: Do not say amnesty. That is a bad thing for you to \nsay.\n  Well, let me just say that under the legislation that is before us \nnow, we would have a circumstance immediately where people will be \ngiven legal status. They will be able to get any job and they are here \nsafe and sound. Unless they get arrested for a felony or something very \nserious like that, they are put on a path that guarantees them the \nability to go all the way to citizenship.\n  Mr. Rove says they have to pay a $1,000 fine over 6 years. What is \nthat--$170 dollars a year, $15, $12 a month? So this is the punishment? \nYou pay $12 a month worth of fines, which allows you not to have to go \nhome even though you entered the country illegally, did not wait your \nturn, and you are guaranteed a path to citizenship. Then at the end you \nhave to pay another $1,000 some 10, 13 years later. So this is the \npunishment in the legislation. But the people who came illegally get \nexactly what they wanted immediately, which is to stay here, have the \nability to work here. They will get a Social Security card. They will \nget the ability to go to any job in the country. They will have an ID \nthat would allow them to do that. So they will be able to compete for \nany job in America. They will be able to compete for jobs that our \nhusbands and sons and daughters and grandchildren might be competing \nfor out there. There will be 11 million in that position.\n  So I do not think my friend Karl is making a very strong point there \nthat this is some sort of punishment. He says: They must pay taxes. \nWell, hallelujah. Should you not pay taxes? They are ``barred from \nreceiving any Federal benefits, including welfare and ObamaCare.'' That \nis a flat statement, and it is flat wrong. The first group, the DREAM \nAct group, which will be some 2, 2\\1/2\\ million, maybe 3 million, they \nwill be citizens in 5 years and will\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\nbe able to get any of the Federal welfare programs in 5 years. Many of \nthe ag workers will be in that position in 10 years. Any workers who \nqualify for the earned-income tax credit can get that immediately--now.\n  Other provisions are put off for 10, 13 years, and that makes the \ncost score look better. But over the long term, once the group is given \nlegal status and citizenship, they will then qualify for every program. \nSince overwhelmingly the number of the workers here today are lower \nskilled who are illegal--they are lower skilled, and you can expect \ntheir incomes to be low--they will qualify for the earned-income tax \ncredit, for Medicaid and program after program, food stamps and others.\n  The score goes up tremendously in the outyears. The Heritage \nFoundation is the only group who has done an in-depth analysis. They \nsay that over the lifetime of the program, the people who are here \nillegally--if they are legalized under this bill, it would add $6.3 \ntrillion to the debt and deficit of the United States. That is a lot of \nmoney. That is almost as much as the unfunded liability of Social \nSecurity, which is about $7 trillion. So this will be $6 trillion. Some \nsay that number is too high, but I have not seen anybody say that \nnumber is not in the ball park. Nobody else has done a study to refute \nit. It is going to be trillions of dollars in the outyears.\n  It is not true that there will be no government benefits going to \npeople who are in the country who get legalized under this. It is just \nnot so. Well, this is another point. To me, this is sort of a \nfundamental point. It sounds so good when you have a political guru \nlike my friend Carl. He says: To renew their temporary status after 6 \nyears, those waiting to become citizens must prove they have been \nsteadily employed, paid all taxes, and are not on welfare.\n  So let's take what has happened. So we have an individual who has \nbeen in the country 3 years. They get the provisional legal status \nimmediately when the bill passes. In 6 years they have to, we are told, \nshow they are steadily employed, paying taxes, and are not on welfare. \nWell, who is going to investigate that, first? No one.\n  So they have already been here 3 years. As long as they came before \nDecember 31, 2011, they are given legal status. Whether they have a job \nor not, they are given this legal status. Without a family, without \nroots in America other than having been here, they claim, before \nDecember 31, 2011. But we are not willing to deport them. So now 6 \nyears later, they work intermittently, they are unemployed, and we have \na recession, and we do not have enough jobs for people, and we are \ngoing to send out the feds and uproot them--their children are now in \njunior high and high school--and send them back home? Give me a break. \nThat is one of the most bogus claims ever. That will not be enforced. \nThere are waiver authorities in the bill, so waivers will be issued. \nNobody is going out to enforce this. I am just tired of them saying \nthis. They should not even say it to try to get the American people to \nbelieve that we are going to actually go out and deport what could be \nmillions of people who are out of work in the 5- or 6-year period when \nthey have to reestablish themselves. That just bothers me.\n\n  These individuals, Karl Rove said, ``must stand at the back of the \nline behind everyone who is waiting patiently and legally to immigrate \nhere.'' That is not so. Give me a break. Those people are here \nillegally now. They do not want to be deported, which is \nunderstandable. They are going to be given permanent status, a Social \nSecurity number, and a right to work anywhere in America. They are not \nahead of somebody from Honduras waiting in line to come here, or not \nahead of somebody in China or Italy or Spain? Of course they are ahead \nof them. They are not waiting. I am without words to express my concern \nabout that. We need to be accurate about what the legislation says.\n  What about this amnesty? Well, people say: You should not call it \namnesty.\n  Well, I think that is a legitimate word. The legislation before us \nwould immediately give legal status, allow people to move to legal \npermanent residency and citizenship later. You have to pay a few \nthousand dollars in fines. Well, I think that is amnesty.\n  Someone said: Well, they pay a $1,000 fine. They paid a penalty; \ntherefore, you can't call it amnesty.\n  No, I do not agree. This legislation basically says that everybody \nhere is given legal status and put on a guaranteed path to citizenship; \njust do not get convicted of a felony. So I really do not think that is \na good argument. So that will continue for a bit. But I think the \nsponsors kind of gave up objecting back in 2007 when the legislation \nwas before us at that time. But I would note that in 2007 the initial \nfine that people paid had to be paid up front--$3,000. Under this bill \nyou pay a $1,000 fine over 6 years. Then to get a green card, the legal \npermanent residency, you had to pay an additional $4,000, and an \ninterim review period called for a fine or payment of $1,500. In total, \n$8,500. So in 2007 the payment required for somebody to move forward to \ncitizenship was up to $8,500. This bill is $2,000--really $1,000 to be \nable to stay here and work here, and that is a payment which is \nstretched out over time. The bill allows the fine to be paid in \ninstallments. So I would have to say it is difficult for me to accept \nthat these people are earning their citizenship and that they are \npaying a price for it.\n  Then Mr. Rove mentions they have to pay their taxes. But one of our \nwatchful publications, Politico, did an article about that on June 3. \nThey said with regard to tax payments:\n\n       After all, it was one of the Gang of Eight's main talking \n     points when it unveiled the immigration blueprint in January. \n     Sponsors vowed that their proposal would include a back tax \n     requirement to ward off critics' claims that their bill would \n     be amnesty. Citizenship would come at a price, they said.\n       But the gang has all but dropped that talking point. The \n     immigration legislation currently moving through the Senate \n     includes a scaled-back provision that relies almost entirely \n     on immigrants coming forward to the Internal Revenue Service \n     voluntarily. Critics call it ``toothless.''\n\n  It is toothless. There is no back tax. My friend, Karl Rove, is still \nout here spinning, claiming you have some great advantage. We are going \nto collect all these back taxes.\n  Nobody is going to investigate these cases, even if the law is clear. \nWe don't have the money and the ability to do so, and it is not going \nto happen. That is just a fact.\n  Let's talk about in general some of the other issues that will come \nbefore us. I know my colleague, Senator Lee, will be joining us on the \nfloor in a little bit, and I will yield to him if and when he comes, \nbut I wanted to talk about these promises we were given by the people \nwho wrote the bill, a promise that the path to citizenship would be \n``contingent upon securing our border and tracking whether legal \nimmigrants have left the country when required.''\n  Now, that is fundamentally correct. That was the promise. That is one \nof the Gang of 8 principles they published. Our bill, they say, does \nthat. I wish that were so. A path to citizenship would be ``contingent \nupon securing our borders and tracking whether legal immigrants have \nleft the country when required.'' But in truth, the bill is amnesty \nfirst and a promise of enforcement later.\n  With regard to tracking immigrants who leave the country when they \nare required to, it devastates and weakens current law, so that can \nnever happen, effectively. It is unbelievable to me they would directly \npass a bill that directly contradicts current law.\n  On ``Meet the Press'' not too long ago, Senator Schumer--and one of \nthe Gang of 8--said it flatout. He acknowledged that promise of \nenforcement first is not going to happen. He said, ``First, people will \nbe legalized. . . . Then we will make sure the border is secure.''\n  Instead of enforcement first, it is legalization first. That is as \nplain as day. It is not even disputed in any law. The illegal \nimmigrants would be legalized immediately, and not a single border or \ninterior enforcement measure has to be in place then or ever.\n  All Secretary Napolitano needs to do is submit two reports to \nCongress. Illegal immigrants will then begin receiving legal status, \nwork permits, Social Security accounts, driver's licenses, travel \ndocuments, and other State benefits, financial benefits, that come from \nthe States. Nothing requires that any border security be in place, any \nfence be built, before this amnesty is ever accomplished.\n\n[[Page S4003]]\n\n  We were told we were going to have a trigger. Until the fences were \nbuilt, until other enforcement mechanisms were undertaken, until that \nhappened, you weren't going to have amnesty. But it is not so. All the \nSecretary needs to do is submit a report. She has already said we have \nbetter enforcement than ever before in history and indicated she does \nnot believe we need more fencing. The contention from the Gang of 8 \nthat we are going to have major fencing at the border has not been \nproven.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security is merely supposed to develop a \nplan. Frank Sharry, the head of the pro-amnesty group, as I noted, said \nthe following:\n\n       The triggers are based on developing plans and spending \n     money, not on reaching that effectiveness, which is really \n     quite clever.\n\n  Mr. Sharry let the cat out of the bag. He said it is a faux trigger, \nan apparent trigger that is not real. He said it was ``quite clever''--\nand indeed it is--but it is now becoming clear that what has been \npromised is not happening. You could say to the American people: Don't \nbe taken in on this. We can see it now, make your voices heard, follow \nthis debate. If the promises for this bill are not followed, then let \nyour voice be heard in Congress. Tell your Congressmen you are not \nhappy. Tell your Senator you have to do better.\n  The whole crux of it is that if we have an amnesty, if we have a very \ngenerous, compassionate treatment of people who violated our laws and \ncome here, shouldn't we have a policy that ends the illegality in the \nfuture?\n  That is what the American people have demanded for 30 years. They are \ngood and decent people. That is an absolutely proper thing for them to \ndemand of Congress, and we are not doing it. It is heartbreaking to me \nthat we are here going through this process with a bill as flawed as \nthis one. As times goes by we will talk more about it.\n  I see my friend, the Senator from Utah, Mr. Lee, who is a fabulous \nnew addition to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where this legislation \nmoved. He contributed in many able ways to the discussion, offering \nexcellent amendments. He is a skilled lawyer and a man who is deeply \ncommitted to the principles of law that made our country great.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I rise in favor of immigration reform. \nThe current immigration system is a travesty. It is inefficient, it is \nuncompassionate, and it is dangerous. It doesn't serve America's \neconomic or social interests, and it undermines respect for the rule of \nlaw while simultaneously undermining respect for our democratic \ninstitutions. Comprehensive reform is both badly needed and long \noverdue.\n  The comprehensive immigration reform I envision includes real border \nsecurity, visa modernization, employment verification, robust programs \nfor both high- and low-skilled workers, and a compassionate approach to \naddressing the needs of those currently in the country illegally. But I \nbelieve each of these vital components must be addressed incrementally \nand sequentially in order to ensure meaningful results. I understand \nour reluctance to admit it, but Congress is simply very bad at \noverhauling and creating massive bureaucratic systems all at once.\n  Every new law, no matter how big, carries with it some unintended \nconsequences. The bigger the law, the more accidental problems we tend \nto create. History teaches us that trying to fix lots of problems all \nat once is the surest way to avoid fixing any of them very well. \nObamaCare is and will continue to make our health care system worse, \nnot better. It promised to lower health insurance premiums. Yet they \nare exploding all across the country. The Dodd-Frank financial reform \nmeasure was supposed to end too-big-to-fail and prevent another \nfinancial meltdown. Yet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are still on the \ntaxpayers' books, and today the very biggest banks on Wall Street are \nbigger than ever.\n  Do the American people have any idea that the PATRIOT Act would \nempower the National Security Agency to spy on all Americans through \ntheir cell phones and their computers? What makes any of us, least of \nall any conservative, believe this immigration bill is going to work \nout any better?\n  The lesson we should be taking from our recent mistakes is not that \nwe need to pass better, huge, sweeping new laws, but that we should, \ninstead, undertake major necessary reforms incrementally, one step at a \ntime, and in the proper sequence. We need to face the fact that 1,000-\npage bureaucratic overhauls simply do not achieve their desired goals, \nand they create far more problems than they tend to solve. We can \nachieve comprehensive immigration reform without having to pass another \n1,000-page bill full of loopholes, carveouts, and unintended \nconsequences.\n  Therefore, from my perspective there is no one amendment that can fix \nthis bill. Indeed, there is no series of tinkering changes that will \nturn this mess of a bill into the reform the country needs and that \nAmericans deserve.\n  The only way to guarantee successful reform of the entire system is \nthrough a series of incremental reforms that ensure the foundational \npieces, like the border security pieces and an effective entry and exit \nsystem, are done first and done directly. Such a commonsense process \nwill allow Congress--and, more importantly, will allow the American \npeople--to monitor policy changes as they are implemented with each \nstep. That way we can isolate and fix unintended consequences before \nthey grow out of control and before we move on to the next phase.\n  A step-by-step approach would also allow Congress to move quickly on \nthose measures on which Republicans and Democrats both tend to agree. \nWe ought not hold commonsense and essential measures hostage to \nunavoidably contentious ones, and that is what this bill does. Both \nsides largely agree on many essential elements. These measures are \nrelatively uncontroversial and could pass incrementally with broad \nbipartisan support in Congress.\n  Indeed, the only reason immigration reform is controversial is that \nCongress refuses to adopt the incremental approach. That is why true \nimmigration reform must be pursued step by step, with individual reform \nmeasures implemented and verified in the proper sequence.\n  Happily for immigration reformers like me, this appears to be the \napproach being pursued by the House of Representatives. It is the only \none that makes sense.\n  First of all, let's secure the border. Let's set up a workable entry-\nexit system and create a reliable employment verification system that \nprotects immigrants, protects citizens, and protects businesses from \nbureaucratic mistakes. Then let's fix our legal immigration system to \nmake sure we are letting in the immigrants our economy needs in numbers \nthat make sense for our country. There is no good reason why we must, \nor even why we should, try to do it all at once, all in one bill, all \nin the same legislative package.\n  Once these and other tasks, which are plenty big in and of \nthemselves, are completed to the American people's satisfaction, then \nwe can address the needs of current undocumented workers with justice, \ncompassion, and sensitivity. Since the beginning of this year, more \nthan 40 immigration-related bills have been introduced in the House and \nthe Senate. By a rough count, I could support more than half of them. \nEight of them have Republican and Democratic cosponsors.\n  We should not risk progress on these and other bipartisan reforms \nsimply because we are unable to iron out each and every one of the more \ncontentious issues. This is not the bill to fix our immigration system.\n  I want to pass immigration reform. I want to debate immigration \nreform. That is exactly why we should not proceed to the Gang of 8 \nbill. We are being presented with a choice between the Gang of 8 bill \nor nothing. Common sense, recent history, and the ongoing legislative \nprocess of the House of Representatives confirmed that is a false \nchoice. There is another way. It is a more sensible and a more \nsuccessful way.\n  We can do better than another 1,000-page mistake. Haven't we learned \nour lesson in this regard? Isn't it time that we try?\n  Rather than fix our current immigration problems, the Gang of 8 bill \nwill make many of them worse. It is not immigration reform, it is big \ngovernment dysfunction. All advocates of\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\ntrue immigration reform on the left and on the right should oppose it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to engage in a colloquy with Senator Lee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments and \ninsight and contribution to the debate, as well as his clear mind and \nthinking that causes us to analyze how to handle things.\n  The problem we have today, at the most fundamental level, is that in \n1987, as Senator Grassley has been so passionate and so clear about, we \nvoted for the 1987 amnesty, and amnesty occurred immediately with the \npromise of enforcement in the future. So in the view of Senator \nGrassley, and the view of the American people by a 4-to-1 margin in a \nrecent poll, we should have the enforcement first and then we will talk \nabout amnesty. All right?\n  Senator Lee offered an amendment that dealt with this process. Under \nthe legislation we have here, the question of enforcement is almost \nentirely given to the Secretary of Homeland Security, who has basically \nsaid enforcement is good now and we don't need any more enforcement and \nthat she would basically certify or establish whether we have an \neffective border and enforcement system, and if not she would issue a \nreport and would turn it over to a commission that had no power and \nthey could review it. But that absolves Congress of their \nresponsibility.\n  With that as background, the Senator offered a very interesting \namendment that I think places the responsibility for enforcement where \nit should be. Would the Senator explain his thinking on that?\n  Mr. LEE. I certainly would. I would be happy to.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, on which the Senator from Alabama and I \nboth sit, during the markup session on this bill we were able to \npropose a number of amendments. One of the amendments I proposed--Lee \namendment No. 4--addressed this very problem, the problem inherent in \nthe fact that much of what this bill accomplishes is to outsource and \ndelegate many of the delicate tasks. Many of the delicate decisions \nthat have to be made along the way in the implementation of this bill \nare outsourced to the Secretary of Homeland Security--the task of \ncoming up with a border security plan and a border fencing plan. Once \nthose plans are in place, and once the Secretary makes the necessary \nfindings under the bill, which she has basically complete discretion to \ndo, then the RPI status begins--the pathway to citizenship commences. \nAnd citizenship from that moment forward, for those who meet the basic \neligibility standards, becomes more or less a virtual certainty or \nbecomes, at the very least, very likely.\n  So my concern was Congress would have no subsequent input in this \ndecision. Each of us has been elected to this body, and each of our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives has been elected to that \nbody, to make decisions, to make law, and not simply to make outside \nlawmakers who will make incremental pieces of law on the outside. Each \nof us will stand accountable at regular 6-year intervals in this body \nand 2-year incremental periods in the other body to the voters who \nplaced us here. Each of us should have the opportunity to decide \nwhether and to what extent the border has adequately been secured and \nwhether and to what extent we have enough fencing along the border in \norder for us to begin this legalization process and the pathway to \ncitizenship.\n  So Lee amendment No. 4 to this bill would have said simply the RPI \nstatus, this pathway, would not have commenced until such time as \nCongress had the chance to vote on whether we had made sufficient \nprogress toward securing the border and fencing the border before the \nperiod of legalization started.\n  It is a very simple question, and it is the question that lies at the \nheart of the concerns surrounding this very bill. It is the question \nthat lies at the heart of the lingering concerns regarding what we did \nback in 1986. I was only 14 years old at the time that debate \ncommenced, so it was not at the forefront of my mind, although perhaps \nit should have been. But the lingering concerns surrounding what \nhappened in 1986 relate to the fact that Congress said, in effect, we \nare going to go ahead and legalize the several million people who are \nhere illegally right now, and then, once and for all, we are going to \nsecure the border. We are going to stop the flow of illegal immigration \nonce and for all. Well, that didn't happen because they sort of put it \noff and said at some unknown point in the future the border will in \nfact be secured. That would have solved that problem. At the very least \nit would have kept Members of Congress on the hook for finding the \nborder was adequately secured by a subsequent vote before a pathway to \nlegalization commenced.\n  To my surprise, to my dismay, and to my frustration my amendment was \nrejected, and it was rejected along the lines of a particularly odd \nargument. The argument went something like this, from those who \nprofessed their undying loyalty to the Gang of 8 bill as it was \noriginally drafted. The argument said, in essence: We cannot adopt Lee \namendment No. 4 because we can't trust Congress to do the right thing. \nWe can't trust Congress to do what we want Congress to do. In \nparticular, the argument was made that we can't be certain the House of \nRepresentatives, currently under the control of the Republican Party, \nwill in fact vote to commence the legalization process.\n  Well, if that is the case, aren't we saying we can't trust the \ndemocratic process? If that is the case, aren't we saying the American \npeople aren't yet comfortable with that?\n  So I would ask my colleague from Alabama, why should we not trust the \nelected representatives of the American people to make critical \ndecisions such as these? And why should we, instead, outsource them to \nsomeone having been appointed by the President and confirmed by the \nPresident, who doesn't respond, at least not directly, to the people at \nregular intervals in elections?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would say this is a very important amendment and I \nthink it reveals a lot, as the Senator indicated. When we vote on an \namnesty bill, and if that were to pass, the Senators voting for it are \nbasically promising the American people, giving assurances to the \nAmerican people they will end the illegality in the future. Because as \nI noted, the polls are 4 to 1 that we should have the enforcement \nbefore we give amnesty. And the reason is due to a lack of confidence.\n\n  So I think if the Senator's amendment had been passed, it would have \nplaced some burden on us, a moral obligation to stand before the world \nat a point in time in the future and declare whether we have \naccomplished what we promised the American people we would do. Is that \npart of the Senator's thinking?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes, that is exactly why I introduced Lee amendment No. 4 in \nthe committee and why I think it should have been passed. Because the \nwhole reason we entrust the legislative power only to people who are \nelected at regular intervals and stand accountable to their electors at \nregular intervals is because of the fact it is perhaps the most \ndangerous power of government. We can do a lot of damage when we make \nlaw. And as a result of that potential for damage, that potential for \nharm we can inflict on the people, we have to stand accountable in \nincremental time periods of either 6 or 2 years to make sure we don't \nabuse that power. That is why it is so harmful when we take that very \ndangerous, potentially destructive power and we outsource it.\n  To some extent, in different ways, this has been going on for many \ndecades. It started more or less during the New Deal era, when Congress \ndiscovered as the Federal Government was dramatically expanding \nCongress physically couldn't come up with the immense and steadily \nbuilding task of legislating--of doing all the lawmaking and all the \nrulemaking it needed to do. So it started passing broader pieces of \nlegislation, setting out very broad objectives, and then outsourcing to \nsome\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\noutside body--sometimes a Cabinet-level official, other times a so-\ncalled independent commission to do the real lawmaking.\n  During this time period, Congress discovered an interesting and \nimportant tool. During this time period it discovered sometimes we, as \nMembers of Congress, are not going to like the way the outside body or \nthe outside official within the executive branch might exercise this \ndelegated lawmaking authority. So they reserved to themselves, they \nreserved for Congress an out--a legislative veto, as it became known. \nIn some instances, this legislative veto allowed Congress, either the \nHouse or the Senate, to undo a rulemaking or an important decision made \nby an executive branch official or entity. In other cases it required \nboth Houses to act in unison. But these legislative veto provisions did \nnot require subsequent presentment to the President who could then sign \nor veto that legislative veto.\n  This went on for several decades. It went on until the mid-1980s when \nthe Supreme Court intervened in a case called INS v. Chada, occurring, \ninterestingly enough, in the immigration context; occurring, \ninterestingly enough, in the specific context of a decision by the \nAttorney General to exercise delegated authority from Congress to issue \na discretionary waiver of deportability to an otherwise removable \nalien.\n  The Supreme Court said this legislative veto was itself \nunconstitutional because it amounted, in essence, to a subsequent \nenactment by Congress that was not subject to the presentment \nrequirement of article I, section 7 of the Constitution. Thus, the \nSupreme Court concluded in INS v. Chada the legislative veto provision, \nas it had been used for many decades, was itself unconstitutional, it \nwas invalid, and was stricken.\n  Some might have predicted that, as of the moment of the issuance of \nthis decision in INS v. Chada, Congress would say: That is it, we are \nnot going to delegate this much authority anymore because we can't \ntrust these outside officials, these outside entities within the \nexecutive branch of government to do the lawmaking. That is our job.\n  But that is not what happened. Shockingly, in the eyes of some, \nCongress continued to delegate its lawmaking authority left and right. \nIf anything, it has accelerated its delegation of lawmaking authority. \nIn part because Members of Congress, first and foremost, like to wash \ntheir hands of things, in the grand tradition of Pontius Pilate we are \nsometimes inclined to wash our hands of things and push important \ndecisions off to someone else to make them, someone else who can take \naccountability for those decisions. It makes it easier for us. And in \nsome ways that is what is happening here. In some ways that is what we \nare doing here by pushing off to the Secretary of Homeland Security the \ndecision to make a decision we ourselves ought to be making. That \ndecision ought to rest here so we ourselves can be held accountable. We \nare not sovereigns unto ourselves. We certainly ought not be making \nsovereigns out of others who do not stand accountable to the people.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I think that is very wise insight.\n  On the question of immigration, Congress has been irresponsible. The \nAmerican people have pleaded with us to end the illegality and create a \nlawful system that serves the national interest--a system we can be \nproud of. And for 30 years Congress has failed.\n  The Senator's amendment requiring that vote by Congress to assure we \ndo what we have promised to do reminds me of what happened in 2007--\nanother bill that was a comprehensive immigration bill on the floor. I \nopposed that bill. It was stronger than this bill, considerably, in a \nlot of different ways, but it failed because we didn't have confidence \nabout the future.\n  In the course of that debate, I think maybe shortly after the bill \nfailed, we had an amendment to build a certain amount of fencing on the \nborder. I offered that amendment, and it passed overwhelmingly.\n  Republicans and Democrats, virtually everybody, voted to build more \nfencing at the border--700 miles out of about a 1,700-mile border. \nEverybody was for that. But that was just the first vote, as our \ncolleagues know. The second vote was whether anybody would appropriate \nany money to build the fence. So not long afterwards up comes an \nappropriations bill for homeland security and it had no money for the \nfence in it. Our colleagues, going back home: I voted to build a fence. \nBut here we have a bill on the floor that doesn't have any money to \nbuild a fence. The fence wasn't going to get built.\n\n  I raised Cain about it and fussed and fussed and sort of mocked the \nCongress for one moment, saying: You are going to do something and not \nstep up to the plate a little later. And they put money in for the \nfence. But you know what happened. Of the double-layered fencing that \nwas required, 700 miles of it, only 36 were built. They came up with \nthis idea of a virtual fence--airplanes and computers and radar, I \nguess. It was a total failure. We spent $1 billion. It was abandoned. \nThere are only 36 miles of double-fencing and 100 or so miles of \nautomobile barriers. It was never built.\n  If we had to vote again to affirm what we did in the year, I think \nthat would make it more likely--from my experience here about how this \nbody works--that what we promised would get done. Does the Senator \nagree?\n  Mr. LEE. I certainly do. I think that would make a big difference. If \nwe had to vote on it, it would have a couple of effects. First of all, \nthe fact that we would have to vote on it would have an impact on the \nexecutive branch of government whose job it is to implement laws that \nwe pass. The executive branch of government would normally have a \nduty--a duty that we would be following up on not just in some \namorphous oversight committee hearing context, but we would be \nexercising oversight in a very real way in the sense that we would have \nto vote on whether they had done something adequately within a \nspecified period of time. There would be consequences, real \nconsequences, if we were to refuse to exercise that vote.\n  This vote would go through the normal process. It would be debated, \ndiscussed, and acted upon in both Houses of Congress and then submitted \nto the President for signature or veto and would therefore be wholly \nconsistent with the presentment clause of the Constitution.\n  Some have suggested this might be a bad idea because it would perhaps \nget held up through some procedural mechanism or another, but the way \nthe amendment was written, that would not, in fact, be the effect. This \nwould be a privileged motion through which it could come on the floor. \nIt would go through the Senate on a 51-vote threshold and would \ntherefore be able to move through quite quickly. That is why it is \nimportant for this kind of mechanism to be in a bill such as this.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleague because the dangerous problem is \nso very real. As Senator Grassley has so eloquently discussed, it is \none thing to grant amnesty today, it is another to see in the future \nthat we follow through on a system that will end illegality in America.\n  Senator Lee, you are a good lawyer. You have been involved in a \nnumber of these issues. It is very clear that the American Immigration \nLawyers Association was involved in the drafting of this legislation. I \ndo not say it was all done just for their personal gain, but did the \nSenator notice quite a number of alterations in current law that gave \nmore flexibility, and resulted in more uncertainty; where the law says \nthus and so, but it can be waived for hardship or family problems or \nother matters?\n  As a lawyer, consider what at first glance would be an open-and-shut \ncase where your client is in the country illegally and due to be \ndeported, but now under the bill, the client can demand a trial and \nperhaps overload the system. Everybody claims hardship; everybody \nclaims some other exception to the rule. Is there a danger that our \nwhole enforcement system would be bogged down in litigation we never \nhad before?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes, it certainly could be and it certainly would be if at \nthe end of the day you have literally hundreds of instances of \nSecretarial discretion built into the bill. If every one of these \nimportant decisions that have to be made along the way, or through the \nprocess, on legal immigration--if any of the critical decisions that \nhave to be made along the way are subject to certain rules but those \nrules can be\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\nwaived by the Secretary at the Secretary's unfettered discretion, it is \nnot much of a law. It becomes something else. It becomes a set of \nguidelines with ultimate discretionary decisionmaking vested in the \nSecretary. That is something very different than a law.\n  I do not doubt that there were lots of people who had input on this \nbill, nor do I necessarily blame any one group for being involved. They \nhave every right to give their input into a law. But at the end of the \nday we have to ask the question: Whose job is it to legislate? It is \nnot their decision to legislate. The accountability to legislate or the \naccountability for flaws in this bill therefore must not rest with any \noutside group, any group of lawyers or activists of any stripe or at \neither end of the political spectrum. The accountability for the \nlegislation that moves through this body must rest ultimately with us, \nand that includes legislation that gives someone else the effective \npower to legislate, as this one does, in literally hundreds of \ninstances.\n  If at the end of the day this bill--assuming it is passed out of this \nbody and passed by the House of Representatives and signed into law by \nthe President--if this bill at the end of the day says, for instance, \nthat the Secretary may at her discretion waive certain exclusions, \nwaive exclusions that would otherwise prevent somebody from entering \nonto the pathway to citizenship on grounds that they had reentered the \ncountry after previously being deported, that is a pretty big issue. At \nthat moment somebody who has reentered the country after previously \nbeing deported has committed a felony.\n  The point has been made many times that it is not necessarily a crime \nto enter this country illegally. It is considered by most to be a civil \nviolation. But that changes when you have been previously deported. A \npreviously deported illegal alien who reenters following deportation \nhas committed a felony offense. So if the legislation we are \nconsidering now becomes law and if at the end of the day it is enacted, \nit allows for those people to enter onto a pathway to citizenship, and \nI think that is cause for concern. It is one of many areas in which we \nneed to be very cautious in granting this much discretion to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security.\n  I got a letter from a woman in my home State of Utah, a woman who is \na schoolteacher in American Fork, UT. She is an immigrant to this \ncountry. She is here on a nonimmigrant visa. She sent me a letter \nsaying: I spent years of my life and thousands of dollars immigrating \nto this country legally, the right way. I have a job. It is a good job, \na job that I love, a job teaching school. But I am here on a visa, and \nthat visa expires in a few years. I know when that visa expires unless \nsomehow I am able to get that visa extended or able to get another \nvisa, I will be sent home. I will have to leave this country. And it \nbreaks my heart, she wrote, that at the same time that I am going to \nhave to leave this country, there will be lots of people--in fact, 11 \nmillion or more--who are currently here illegally, who have broken the \nlaw coming here, many of whom have been working here illegally, who \nwill not only be allowed to stay, not only allowed to stay in their \ncurrent job, but put on a pathway to citizenship.\n  She said: This seems like a profound unfairness, that we are \nrewarding those who have broken the law while we are punishing people \nwho, like me, a schoolteacher, came here on a nonimmigrant visa and \nhave spent years of their lives and thousands of dollars trying to do \nit the right way.\n  Does the Senator think that is cause for concern that relates to this \nexcessive granting of discretion?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I couldn't agree more. When you, as I had the honor to \ndo, prosecute violations of Federal law for over 14 years, you feel a \ndeep, abiding sense that fairness has to occur. You are putting \nsomebody in jail for a period of time. You are saying ``you don't get \nthis money'' if they submit a claim you cannot give them, even though \nthey might benefit but they do not qualify. When you do these things \nday after day, you have to believe that the system works.\n  With regard to immigration, it is so deeply important that people who \nwait in line and who do things the right way, believe others are not \ngetting away with it and are not beating the system. Otherwise, they \nfeel like chumps. They feel as though they have been had by the system.\n  It is such a deep moral responsibility, not just for the Federal \nprosecutors. The ones I know feel deeply about this. They really feel \nthat sense because you cannot do your job every day and go to bed and \nsleep if you do not believe that everybody is equal and the system \nworks.\n  You do a tough job one day: You don't qualify for disability; you \ndon't qualify for money; you have to go to jail. The guidelines say you \ngo. And then the next guy comes along and the guidelines don't apply to \nhim. The next guy files a claim and he gets some money and you didn't. \nIt is so critical for the magnificent legal heritage of our country \nthat the law be followed equally. Anybody who suggests that this \namnesty that will occur has no moral consequences does not understand \nthe depth of the question involved.\n  If we do it and if we do something very compassionate for people who \nare here illegally, the American people are correct to say: Do not let \nit happen again. Do not let this happen again. The way the law should \nwork in America: You come legally--OK. You don't come legally, you get \ndeported. That is what the law is. That is what it should be. Anything \nless than that cannot be defended morally. It cannot be defended \nconstitutionally. It cannot be defended legally. It cannot be defended \nas a matter of policy.\n  People blithely suggest we can just reward an American who came into \nthis country illegally, 18 months ago, and never had a job, but because \nthey were not caught and deported in the interim, they get to stay here \nlegally forever and be on a guaranteed path to citizenship. Whereas \nyour friend who came here legally and followed the rules, the lady who \nwrote you, has to go back home? We cannot treat this lightly.\n  If we do this--and I am prepared to work on it and try to do it in a \ngood way--we absolutely have to do it in a way that does not damage, \ntoo much, the rule of law. It will damage the rule of law because it is \na violation of the rule of law to reward somebody who came illegally by \ngiving them the benefit of their act. If people rob a bank and you \ncatch them, they have to give the money back. They don't get to keep \nthe money. They don't get to keep the benefits of their activity, \nnormally.\n  We are willing to reconsider that. We are willing, as a nation, to \ncompassionately reconsider that. I think the American people are \nwilling to do this. But I ask my colleague Senator Lee whether he \nbelieves people feel uneasy about this. They don't like it that this is \na thing they believe they must do, but they know it is not a good thing \nand should be avoided in the future?\n  Mr. LEE. The American people are a compassionate people. They are a \npeople who welcome immigrants because we are a nation of immigrants and \nwe always have been. I think most of us hope we always will be. We want \npeople to continue to come to this country. It is this sense of \ncompassion that causes many of us to have some sense of concern about \nthis particular legislation. This legislation goes far beyond simply \nshowing compassion. This legislation in some ways is the opposite of \ncompassion when you consider it from the perspective of those who, like \nthis woman who wrote this letter to me, have come here legally. And \nthose who, unlike her, have waited--in some cases for years outside the \nUnited States. There are many people who have spent a lot of money and \ntime hoping and praying that one day they too will get to immigrate to \nthis country legally. We do them a great disservice when we say the \neffort, time, blood, sweat, and tears they devoted to this process is \nall for naught, because all they had to do was come here illegally, and \nnot only were they put on a pathway to legalization but on a pathway to \ncitizenship.\n\n  One of the more enlightening moments in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee during the markup of this bill was when our friend and \ncolleague, the junior Senator from Texas, introduced an amendment which \nwould have done one simple thing to adjust that process. All hell broke \nloose.\n  Senator Cruz introduced an amendment which would have left everything\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\nelse about the bill intact and kept everything else in the bill \nidentical to what it says now with only one change. It would have said \nthose people who entered into RPI status--entered into the pathway of \nlegalization--would not ultimately become citizens. They could \nultimately become lawful, permanent residents or the functional \nequivalent thereof, but they would not become citizens under the bill. \nEverything else would be left intact. They still would be allowed to \ncome out of the shadows, stay here, work here, and we could have a \nseparate debate and discussion over whether that would be the right \napproach in and of itself.\n  This particular amendment focused simply on the citizenship aspect of \nit, and yet one would have thought by the reaction that it was offering \nup something horrible and Draconian. The proponents of this bill could \nnot even handle the change that would have said: Let's have there be \nsome consequence, at least, for the fact that this group of people \nentered here illegally. At least at this point let's not put them on a \npathway to citizenship so they can vote and all the other rights which \naccompany citizenship to this great country.\n  Yes, I do think this is strange. I do think the American people--not \nin spite of the fact they are compassionate, but because of the fact \nthey are compassionate--deserve more than to have the rule of law \nturned on its head and deserve more than to have those who have taken \nthe time and expended the energy and financial resources to immigrate \nhere legally, to have their sacrifice denigrated to the point that it \nmeans nothing or less than nothing.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is a very interesting insight the Senator made. I \nbelieve Senator Schumer was particularly hostile to that amendment and \nsaid: Without citizenship, there is no reform. In other words, we will \nnot agree to anything; that is absolutely nonnegotiable.\n  I thought about that bill a lot since 2007 and have been thinking \nabout it ever since. I believe after 1986 we gave amnesty and \ncitizenship with the promise of enforcement, and that didn't happen. We \npromised it wouldn't happen again and that we wouldn't do another \namnesty.\n  This was supposed to be a one-time amnesty which wouldn't happen \nagain. It was supposed to be the clear policy of the United States that \nif someone entered the country illegally, that person would not get \nevery single thing America could provide, and we would not provide such \nbenefits as would be provided to people who entered lawfully. I don't \nbelieve we should--and certainly are not required--to provide \ncitizenship to somebody who entered the country unlawfully. It is just \nnot required.\n  I thought attacking Senator Cruz's amendment was odd and revealing as \nthe junior Senator from Utah did. It was a surprise to me as far as the \nintensity of their pushback on that. I don't believe it should happen. \nI don't think it is the right thing.\n  So the person would be able to get permanent, legal, resident status; \nparticipate in America; and, of course, their children would be \ncitizens; but they can't get everything if they come illegally.\n  I read a brilliant piece recently by a Yale graduate lawyer, a \nmarine, and he talked about the military. We act as though, if somebody \ncomes into this country illegally, it would be unthinkable that they \nwould be required to move themselves back to where they came from. We \ntell our military guys all the time to move their families. They get \norders to go to west Texas, Alabama, Germany, Japan, and Korea. They \nspend 18 months in Iraq with their lives on the line. They have to \nleave their families, and they do it all the time.\n  So they come to this country under the lawful condition that they can \ncome for so many months--and they volunteer, they sign up. I come in, I \nget to stay so many years, and I am supposed to go home.\n  Is this somehow unkind? Is it immoral to expect those people--when \ntheir time is up--to go home?\n  Some of the thinking, which came up in the committee, seemed to be \ntotally oblivious to this fundamental concept. There are certain \nrequirements. They are not allowed to pay a guide to come across the \nborder illegally and 18 months later demand a pathway to citizenship in \nthe United States. It is just not law. I don't know what that is, but \nit is not law. It is not the way principled policies should be \nexecuted.\n  We are willing to consider and work through a process. For some time \nI have said we want to be compassionate to those people who have been \nhere a long time and have done well. We can work through it. But when \nthey come through this system, they need to have no doubt that in the \nfuture, if they overstay their visa or come into the country illegally, \nand they are apprehended, they will be deported. If we don't make that \ncommitment intellectually, morally, and legally, then we have \nguaranteed we will have another amnesty, or fight, and the integrity of \nour immigration law will be further degraded.\n  Mr. LEE. As surely as past is prologue, this will happen again if we \ndo it in the wrong sequence. Sequencing matters.\n  When I was 6 or 7 years old, my mother pointed out to me that you \ndon't try to butter the toast before you toast it. You toast it first \nand then put the butter on top.\n  There are all kinds of examples where we need to follow the right \nsequence. If they don't follow the right sequence, they don't get the \nresults they want. This is another area where sequence matters.\n  I am convinced we can treat those 11 million people who are currently \nhere illegally with the dignity, respect, and compassion we want to \ntreat them with as Americans. I am convinced we can find a way to do \nthat. I am convinced we can find a broad-based bipartisan solution to \ndo that. I am less convinced that it makes any sense to do that now \nbefore we fix the underlying problem.\n  Again, it is a matter of simple sequencing. We have to first stop the \nflow of illegal immigration. After that, we will be in a better \nposition to ascertain the needs of those who are currently here \nillegally. It is only in that circumstance that we will know best how \nto address that.\n  Along those lines, I would like to address an issue which sometimes \ncomes up. Sometimes arguments are made by the proponents of this bill \nthat if we don't support this bill--not just if we don't support \nimmigration reform generally, but if we don't support this particular \nbill--we are somehow anti-immigrant or uncategorically uncompassionate \npeople. If we don't support the bill, our hearts are made of stone, our \nribs are made of concrete, and we have no heart. I think that is a \nreckless argument and an argument beneath the dignity of this august \nbody.\n  During the markup, one of my colleagues--I think the junior Senator \nfrom Texas--introduced another amendment. It was an amendment which \nwould have in some way limited the ability of those currently illegally \nin the country to participate in certain entitlement benefits, certain \nantipoverty benefits that would otherwise be available to them. Perhaps \nit was the earned-income tax credit. I don't remember the exact \ninformation, but it would have had some broad application to make sure \nthat those who are currently here illegally would not--during this RPI \nperiod--be able to benefit from federally funded entitlements.\n  To my great dismay, one of our colleagues on that committee--who was \na devout supporter of this bill--personally attacked the junior Senator \nfrom Texas simply for having introduced that amendment. It wasn't \nenough for him to say: I disagree with this amendment or that this \namendment is bad policy. He attacked with something like this: You \ndon't care about these people. You don't care about their children. You \nare willing to let their children remain hungry and uneducated. You \ndon't care about them. You are not compassionate.\n  With respect, I think that kind of comment has no place here. It is \nnot helpful. It is not productive, and it is something that completely \nclouds the issue. It is because we are compassionate that we do need to \nask these questions.\n  Look, we are in a difficult spot as a country. We are trying to do \neverything we can to make those programs solvent which are designed \nspecifically to alleviate some of the needs of the most vulnerable in \nour society. Unless we make sure we are in a position economically to \nbe able to sustain those\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\nprograms, we are going to run out of money. And when we run out of \nmoney, it will be the poor and the vulnerable who suffer most as a \nresult of our inability to pay for those programs.\n  So with respect, I advise all of my colleagues--particularly those \nwho have made comments like that one--to resist the temptation that \nsome of them have succumbed to in recent weeks to say that anyone who \nopposes this bill is somehow uncompassionate. It is because we are \ncompassionate that we have to ask these difficult questions. It is \nbecause we are compassionate that we have to propose amendments we \nthink are necessary in order to make the programs upon which our \nsociety's most vulnerable have come to depend on more sustainable.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am glad Senator Lee mentioned that because we have to \nhave an honest debate. We have to have an honest discussion about what \nis in the national interest of the United States and how immigration \nfits into that. First and foremost, do we want to have a lawful system \nor not? Do we want to allow lawlessness to continue in the future? It \nis not unkind to talk about that.\n  Prime Minister Cameron, of the UK in London, recently made this \nremark--they are wrestling with immigration and how to do it the right \nway in the United Kingdom. He says:\n\n       There are those who say you can't have a sensible debate \n     because it is somehow wrong to express concerns about \n     immigration. Now I think that is nonsense.\n\n  I think we can have a sensible discussion about it when we ask about \nhow many people will come, what skills they should possess, and what \nAmerica would benefit from most with the immigrants we have coming to \nour country; what immigrants would be most likely to be successful, \nflourish, and do well.\n  We have had statistics established that people who come with about 2 \nyears of college and speak English almost always do very well, but \npeople who come without high school diplomas don't do as well. If we \ncannot accept everybody, we ought to think about and try to develop a \nsystem which allows people who can be the most successful to take \nadvantage of America. That would be helpful.\n  Prime Minister Cameron goes on to say:\n\n       While I've always believed in the benefits of migration and \n     immigration, I've also always believed that immigration has \n     to be properly controlled. Without proper controls, community \n     confidence is sapped, resources are stretched and the \n     benefits that immigration can bring are lost or forgotten.\n\n  I think that is somewhat in line with the points the Senator from \nUtah was making.\n  I see the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, who has \nwrestled with these issues longer than I have. He conducted a markup \nwhich allowed a large number of amendments. Unfortunately, some of the \nmembers, even though they liked their amendments, wouldn't agree to \nvote for them. We have a process that allowed some airing of the \ndetails of the bill, and a lot of amendments were offered.\n  I thank Senator Lee for participating in this discussion and coming \nto the Senate with fresh ideas, enthusiasm, and passion for America, \nthe rule of law, the proper functioning of our branches of government, \nand the classical constitutional heritage of this Nation. I am honored \nto serve with my distinguished colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is good to see the Presiding Officer \nhere as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the Senate Judiciary Committee held \nlengthy and extensive public markup sessions on the Border Security, \nEconomic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act, S. 744. We \nworked late into the evenings--we also started pretty early in the \nmorning--debating the bill. We considered hundreds of amendments.\n  The public saw our consideration firsthand. We streamed everything we \ndid on the Internet and it was broadcast on television. We took all the \nproposed amendments, Republican and Democratic alike, and put them on \nour Web site. We updated the Committee's Web site to include adopted \namendments in real time. I heard from people all over the country that \nthey felt they actually had involvement in what we were doing, which is \nwhat I want.\n  I appreciate the fact that members from both sides of the aisle, \nRepublicans and Democrats, praised the transparent process and also \npraised the significant improvements to the bill made by the Judiciary \nCommittee. In fact, the markup process followed three additional \nhearings on the bill--on top of all the others we had--with 26 \nwitnesses, and the bill, as amended, was supported by a bipartisan two-\nthirds majority of the committee.\n  I have sent that bill, S. 744, to the Senate on behalf of the \nJudiciary Committee and am filing an extensive committee report as \nwell. I hope the report is going to be a valuable resource for \nSenators. It explains not only the underlying provisions in the \nlegislation and its history, but it also summarizes all the amendments \nthat were adopted and also those that were rejected.\n  In order for all Senators to be able to file amendments and work on \nthis bill, of course the Senate first needs to proceed to the bill. I \nhad hoped that what has become all too typical obstruction would not \ninfect the proceedings. Senators from both sides of the aisle worked \ntogether to develop this legislation. Senators from both sides of the \naisle had amendments adopted by the Judiciary Committee. Almost none of \nthe more than 135 amendments adopted by the Judiciary Committee were \nadopted along party-line votes, unlike this week's vote in the House in \nwhich nearly every member of the Republican conference stood together \nto prevent DREAMers from being able to stay in our country. The one \nthing that ought to unite all of us is the DREAM Act.\n  These young people are here through no fault of their own. They have \nenriched our Nation. They have enriched this debate. I am proud that we \nin the Senate are considering inclusive legislation that supports them, \nand I hope a fair process in the Senate finally prompts action in the \nother Chamber.\n  I don't know how anybody who professes to care about family values, \nwho professes to care about other people, can sit down with these young \npeople--the DREAMers--and not be moved and not want them to have the \nsame advantages our children and our grandchildren have.\n  The dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us. \nIt is long past time for reform. As members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee from both parties said at the conclusion of our proceedings, \nthis is a matter of great significance to the American people, and the \nSenate should debate it. But the Senate is being delayed from doing so \nby a small minority of opponents. This is not the time to have a tiny \nhandful stop a debate.\n  There are only 99 Senators now, with the loss of our dear friend \nFrank Lautenberg. But take a Senate of 100 people, we represent over \n300 million Americans, and they are counting on us not to use stalling \ntactics, but to stand--vote for or vote against, but stand up and vote.\n  When one stalls and refuses to let votes come in, it is an easy way \nto say: I am voting maybe. Then you can go back home and you can be on \neverybody's side, for the people for it or people against it. ``I am on \nyour side,'' because nobody can point that you voted one way or the \nother. That is not what we were elected for. We were elected to stand \nand take a position, yes or no, not maybe.\n  The legislation we seek to bring before the Senate was the result of \nSenators from both sides of the aisle who came together and made an \nagreement. What was initially a proposal from the so-called Gang of 8 \nbecame, through the committee process, the product of a group of 18. \nNow let's have a product of a group of 100 representing all States in \nthis country.\n  Amendments offered by 17 of those 18 members were adopted into the \nbill. Seventeen of the eighteen members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee had amendments adopted into the bill. A bipartisan majority \nof more than two-thirds of the Senate Judiciary Committee voted for the \nbill the Senate is being called upon to consider.\n  I am honored to serve as both the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and the President pro tempore of the Senate, an office \nestablished in\n\n[[Page S4009]]\n\narticle 1, section 3 of the Constitution of the United States. I have \nbeen privileged to serve the people of Vermont for more than 45 years, \nthe last 38 as their Senator. But one thing I learned many years ago, \ntaught to me by the distinguished majority leader at that time when I \ncame to the Senate, Senator Mike Mansfield, is how important it is for \nSenators to keep their commitments, keep their word, to stay true to \ntheir agreements. If Senators who have come together to help develop \nthis bill do those things, I have no doubt we will be able to end this \nfilibuster, stop voting maybe, and actually vote up or down and pass \nthis fair but tough legislation on comprehensive immigration reform.\n  Our history, our values, and our decency can inspire us finally to \ntake action without the prolonged partisanship that often paralyzes \nthis Chamber. We need an immigration system that lives up to American \nvalues. This is a time when we are called upon to come together. Few \ntopics are more fundamental to who we are as a nation than immigration.\n  The Statue of Liberty has long proclaimed America's welcome:\n\n       Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning \n     to breathe free. . . . Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost \n     to me.\n\n  That is what America stood for. That is what we should continue to \nrepresent. That is the America that attracted my maternal grandparents \nfrom Italy to Vermont and my paternal great-grandparents from Ireland \nto Vermont. Immigration through our history has been an ongoing source \nof renewal of our spirit, our creativity, and our economic strength.\n  Our bipartisan legislation establishes a path to earned citizenship \nfor the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country. It \naddresses the lengthy backlogs in our current immigration system--\nbacklogs that have kept families apart sometimes for decades. It grants \na faster track to the DREAMers brought to this country as children \nthrough no fault of their own, and to agricultural workers who provide \nour Nation's critical food supply. It makes important changes to the \nvisas used by dairy farmers and the tourists and by immigrant investors \nwho are creating jobs in our communities.\n  It addresses the needs of law enforcement, which requires the help of \nimmigrants who witness crime or are victims of domestic violence and \nhuman trafficking. It improves the treatment of refugees and asylum \nseekers so the United States will remain the beacon of hope in the \nworld. This is going to make us all safer.\n  This is a measure the Senate should come together, consider, and \npass. We should do what is right, what is fair, and what is just. \nImmigration reform is an important economic issue, a civil rights \nissue, and a fairness issue. If a majority of us stand together and we \nstay true to our values and our agreements, I believe we can pass \nlegislation to write the next great chapter in the American history of \nimmigration.\n  Those of us serving in the Senate who are immigrants understand that. \nThose of us who are children or grandchildren of immigrants understand \nthat. Just as my wife's family came to this country and created a \nbetter State of Vermont, they understood it, similar to so many who \ncome.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer knows better than anybody in here \nwhat it is to come and become part of this great country. One can come \nas an immigrant and then become a Senator of the United States. As \nPresident pro tempore, I am delighted to see the Presiding Officer in \nthe chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I wish to address the issue being \ndebated in front of the Senate. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for the leadership he has offered. The chairman has a strong \nand firm but fair hand. He has allowed the bill to be here and has been \nassisted by very able lieutenants on the Judiciary Committee, not the \nleast of whom is Senator Schumer of New York who, as the subcommittee \nchairman, has been absolutely key.\n  I also wish to compliment our colleague from Florida Senator Rubio. \nPeople in this highly charged partisan atmosphere say, How can a \nDemocrat or a Republican, or vice versa, say good things about each \nother; and, of course, I am not only willing to do so but do so at the \ndrop of a hat, to give credit where credit is due. It is too bad so \nmuch of the discussion is based on ideological philosophies and is so \npartisan-charged and tinged. We seem to be looking for that slight \nlittle advantage in the next election so that we get to the point where \nwe can't come together.\n  I think what we are going to see on display in the Senate over the \ncourse of the next several weeks is that the Senate can function and it \ncan function in a bipartisan way. I give no small amount of credit to \nthe bipartisan group in the Gang of 8. They have arrived on the scene \nat the right place at the right time.\n  A number of us have been trying in this Chamber, and previously when \nI was a Member of the House of Representatives, going back to when I \nwas a young Congressman, to get comprehensive immigration reform. I \nvoted on it in the 1980s. We actually passed a bill. It is instructive \nto know at that time, in the 1980s, there were less than 3 million \nillegal aliens or undocumented individuals, however we wish to refer to \nthem, in the country. That attempt at immigration reform failed because \nthere were no safeguards to make sure the law was followed--especially \namong employers--to make sure the people they were hiring were legal. \nAs a result, over the ensuing decades, the law wasn't followed. So what \nhappened? The amount of undocumented individuals in the country rose \nfrom less than 3 million in the 1980s all the way to where it is now, \nwhich is about 11.5 million.\n  So the time and the place has arisen to do something about it. It is \ntoo bad it hasn't been done, but what is done is done. Now we have a \nchance to change that.\n  If one happens to come from a State such as my beloved State of \nFlorida that has such a rich mixture in the fabric of our society of so \nmany different peoples from so many different parts of the world, then, \nof course, a person ought to be a little more sensitive to the broken \nsystem we have. Thus, it was not unusual that when it came time that \nsuddenly a case exploded in the newspapers of a child, a DREAMer who \nhad come here as a child with parents who were undocumented, the child \nnever even knew he or she was not American and it gets down to the end \nof their graduation in high school and they want to go off to college \nor they want to go into the military and, lo and behold, they are now \nunder the order of deportation.\n\n  Of course, this Senator, similar to many other Senators, has had to \ntry to intervene in these very egregious cases. I wish to mention one, \nand it illustrates the ridiculousness of the present system that is so \nbroken.\n  A child brought at age 6 months from the Bahamas now grows up in \nAmerica thinking he is American. He is a Floridian. He goes into the \nArmy. How he missed the checks there that he was undocumented I do not \nknow. But he goes into the Army. He serves two tours in Iraq. He has a \ntop secret rating.\n  When he comes back, after the two tours, going into the private \nsector, he enlists in the Naval Reserves, and because of his top secret \nclearance, this particular now Navy reservist on Active Duty is sent to \nthe very sensitive position--because of his top secret clearance--of \nbeing a photographer at the Guantanamo detention facility for the \ndetainees, and he serves in that position admirably.\n  Somehow in the process after this, back in civilian life, this \nparticular former Army, now Navy, reservist, in applying for an \napplication for a passport, answers something incorrectly on the \npassport application--because he does not know he is not an American--\nand he gets arrested and he is thrown in jail and is in jail for 3 \ngoing on 4 months, until this Senator finds out\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\nabout this case--because I am reading it in the newspaper--and, of \ncourse, once we blew this up to the attention of the public at large, \neven the Federal judge asked the prosecutor: Why in the world are you \nprosecuting this case? That shows the ridiculousness of existing law \nbecause it is so broken.\n  That, of course, had a good outcome. It did not have a good outcome \nwhile somebody who had a top secret clearance is sitting in jail for \nover 3 months, but it is illustrative, again, that we have to do \nsomething about the existing system.\n  Thus, we have in front of us a compromise. Remember, the art of \nlegislating is respecting the other fellow's point of view, reaching \nout, trying to bridge the differences, with the goal that we want to \nachieve a result.\n  There are some here who do not want to achieve that result, and they \nare going to try to torpedo it. They are going to try to put poison \npills that are so seductive as amendments that will kill the bill. They \nare going to make a lot of the Senators on both sides of the aisle take \ntough votes on things they would ordinarily support, but they are going \nto have to reject them to keep the integrity of the compromise in \norder, at the end of the day, to pass an immigration reform bill and \nthen hope we get a big enough vote so that there is such a momentum--\nand with all the different advocacy groups, including businesses, \nfarmers, the immigration community, pro-immigration reform community, \nall of them--to start to lean heavily on the House of Representatives, \nand maybe at that point we can get the bill passed.\n  As we consider this bill to fix this broken immigration system, many \nof us are going to disagree about details, but we have to remember what \nis the goal at the end of the day. This bill includes important things \nto secure the borders. You think the borders are secure now? By the \nway, they are a lot more secure now than they were just a few years \nago. They are catching some 60 percent of all the people who are coming \nacross the border now, but that is not good enough. Forty percent is \nstill coming across. This bill is going to try to take it up to 90 \npercent.\n  They are going to reform the visa program. They are going to make it \neasier, at the end of the day, because of the technology we have, where \nyou can swipe the passport. Some countries desperately have wanted to \nget into a visa waiver instead of having families come hundreds of \nmiles to the consulate. Because of the information that is going to be \ncontained on that passport--biometric information--we are going to be \nable to streamline that process.\n  Certainly, at the end of the day, we are going to be able to supply \nthe workforce needs of the country if the employers will follow the \nlaw. So now this reform bill is going to make it mandatory upon those \nemployers to follow the law so they can have a legal workforce instead \nof what is the case now: Do not look. I have to have them for my \nbusiness or my farm, my agriculture--whatever the business is, I have \nto have them--but do not look because I know they are illegal. That is \ngoing to be changed.\n  Then there is another component. What about those people who came \nhere on a legal visa, but now they have overstayed the visa. We are \ngoing to be able to check because now, with that biometric information, \nthey are going to swipe as they leave the country that information so \nit matches with the information we got when they came into the country \non a legal visa. Now we are going to know who is staying behind.\n  By the way, those countries that want to be in the visa waiver \nprogram, such as Chile or Brazil, they have to keep those defaults \nunder 3 percent of the total visas. Lo and behold, now those countries \nthat want to keep the visa waiver to make it easier on their citizens \nto travel to the United States--how about all those Brazilians who want \nto come to Disney World--now they have an incentive to help their own \npeople by keeping those defaults under 3 percent of the total visas for \nthat country. This reform of the visa program is very important.\n  What about the people who are here? Does anybody think the solution \nto the problem is to deport 11 million people? We cannot do that. But \nif we could, what would happen to this national economy? It would \ncollapse. So we are going to make a very lengthy path to getting a \ngreen card, of which they are going to have to pay fines, they are \ngoing to have to pay the taxes, they are going to have to learn \nEnglish, and they are going to have to go to the end of the line, but \nthey are going to be here legally so they can be employed, and they \nhave to stay employed. If they do not stay employed, they are out.\n  Anybody who does not abide by all of that presently--we do not have a \nrequirement that they have to learn English. Now they are going to have \nto learn English. So anybody who does not make all of those \nrequirements is going to have to leave.\n  I have just scratched the surface of the bill. But I think we can see \nit is a good-faith attempt to bring together all of the interests, \nusing a little common sense to try to reform what is a broken system. I \nhope we will get a huge vote out of the Senate. I hope this vote \nexceeds three-quarters of the Senate. That will send a real message to \nthe House.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, as we begin to discuss this \nlegislation, the immigration bill that is before us, a lot of people \nhave not realized it is coming up. A lot of people do not realize the \nbreadth of it and a lot of people are concerned about it. We have \ngotten a lot of phone calls in my office. People are wondering who is \nspeaking up about the bill and they want to know what is in the bill. \nSo I think that is a big part of what we should be doing in the days to \ncome--going over the bill in a careful way concerning any progress the \nbill makes and any deficiencies the legislation has.\n  As I noted previously, the fundamental challenge we must recognize--\nbased on the way Congress works and the difficulty it has had with \nthese issues over the last number of years--is that we have to be sure \nthat once the amnesty is granted that there is enforcement in the \nfuture.\n  In 1986, that bill, as Senator Grassley has so passionately \ndelineated--he voted for it. Amnesty was given to 3 million people, but \nthe enforcement never occurred, and now we have 11 million people here \nillegally. This cannot happen again. If we allow this to happen again, \nwe will have eviscerated any ability we have to ask people to comply \nwith the law because people who do not comply with the law are not held \nto account.\n  There is nothing wrong with saying a person can come to America under \ncertain conditions for certain periods of time and then they must \nleave. If they do not leave, and they are apprehended, they should be \ndeported. We are in a condition today where nobody is being deported.\n  Ask your law officers in whatever city and county you are in--and \nthis has been going on since before President Obama took office--if \nthey catch somebody who was speeding in their town in Alabama or \nIndiana or Colorado and they discover they are here illegally what \nhappens. Isn't this a fundamental question?\n  What happens is they turn them loose--you ask them, your law \nofficers--because nobody will come and get them. The Federal Government \nhas reached a point now where virtually no one is being deported except \nthose convicted of serious crimes.\n  It has led to the ICE union--the Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nofficers who deal with deportations and arrests--these officers voting \nno confidence in the head of the ICE Department, John Morton--the head \nman, John Morton, no confidence.\n  I never heard of it. Then, in addition, they have opposed the bill. \nThey said it makes things worse. It will diminish America's national \nsecurity. And it will not make the law better. So we have the \nassociation, the union for customs--Citizenship and Immigration \nServices, which deals with the citizenship processing--they have \nopposed the bill. They say it will make the situation worse than \npresent law, which is not being enforced today.\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\n  That is what we are wrestling with here overall. I know the American \npeople need to get alerted to this.\n  We have been told by the supporters of the legislation: Do not \nworry--we are going to have the toughest enforcement legislation in \nhistory. Senator Schumer said: ``Tough as nails.'' ``The toughest \never.'' Well, this is not in the bill.\n  So what happened in 1987 was that once the amnesty was given, \neverybody forgot in the future to worry about enforcement. Enforcement \njust did not happen. It is going to happen again. That is exactly what \nis going to happen again.\n  The people who are concerned about the legislation and are objecting \nto this legislation are not against immigration. We allow 1 million \npeople to come into the country legally every year--more than any other \ncountry in the world. We are not trying to stop that. What we are \ntrying to say is that you need a good future now for immigration, and \nyou need to be sure it is enforceable.\n  More people want to come to this great land than can come here. I do \nnot blame them for wanting to come here. If somebody convinces them \nthat the American people or the American Government does not care if \nthey come illegally and stay here and eventually they will be given \ncitizenship, why should they not come illegally?\n  So we have to have a national consensus that as we treat \ncompassionately people who have been here a long time and have been \ngood people and we try be generous there, that we do not create a \nfurther flow of illegal immigration. We have been warned of what will \nhappen by governmental experts. We have to have a national consensus \nthat we tighten up the enforcement mechanisms that are so clearly \nbroken today. So that is the fundamental principle of what we are \nabout. I am going to mention some of that now. We will talk about more \nof those problems in the future.\n  The whole fundamental principle is that we need to create a lawful \nsystem of immigration that works in the future as well as today. Our \nsponsors, the Gang of 8, have said that is what they have. They have \ntold us their bill does that. They say: Our bill will end the \nillegality at the border. They say they are going to have strong \nenforcement on visa violations, which is really not true. They say they \nhave guaranteed enforcement at the workplace. That one has some \nbenefits, but the way they have done it, it delays it longer than it \nshould be. It creates some changes there. But good workforce \nenforcement would be a step forward. Then they claim they have \nmechanisms that lead to removal of dangerous people from the country--\nall of which I have to say is fundamentally not accurate. So they \nacknowledge what needs to be done.\n  So the Members of the Senate and the Members of Congress and the \nAmerican people need to be asking: Does this bill do what has been \npromised? If it does, we may be on the track to doing something good. \nBut if it does not, it needs to be rejected.\n  We cannot go down the path of amnesty now and another massive \nillegality in the future. We cannot do that. We have to do the right \nthing. Isn't that the right thing? Our sponsors of the bill say it. \nThey promised this is going to be ``as tough as nails,'' ``the toughest \nbill ever.''\n  Well, I can tell you with absolute confidence that it is not as \nstrong as the bill in 2007 that was voted down and rejected. It is \nweaker than that was. It is weaker than current law in so many \nimportant areas.\n  You say: Well, you can say that, Jeff. It is not true.\n  It is true. Fundamentally, we will show that the legislation is not \nwhere it needs to be. Even Senator Rubio is saying he will not vote for \nthe bill itself. He is one of the Gang of 8 who wrote it, but he says \nthere are enough loopholes that he would not vote for it now. It has to \nbe reformed. It absolutely has to be reformed, there is no doubt about \nthat. But the problem is, except for Senator Rubio, I guess the Gang of \n8 agreed to stick together and had no real amendments passed. They did \nthat in the committee. We had a committee process. We had a lot of \namendments offered. They stuck together and voted down all of the \namendments that were significant. A lot of smaller amendments were \npassed. But, you know, Senator Schumer apparently said: Well, the \nRepublicans have a pass on this vote. That means, did the Republicans \non the Gang of 8, those Members--were they allowed to vote their \nconscience or were they still expected to be voting like the Gang of 8, \nwho signed in blood to vote? They gave them a pass on a few votes. So \nthis is not a way to do the public's business. It is just not.\n  One thing I think I do believe is important for us to understand--and \nI have been wrestling with this for a long time. I have been a Federal \nprosecutor. I will tell you that we can make the system work. A lot of \npeople think it is just hopeless, that we cannot make the system work. \nNot so. We have made some progress at the border. If we had really \nstrong leadership, were really effective in identifying where the gaps \nare, in moving resources and stepping up our fencing and our equipment, \nwe could see real progress at the border--real progress.\n  A lot of it is math, I would say from my law enforcement experience. \nIf you add more police officers and crime rates are going down, then \nyou have more police officers per criminal, per crime. You have more \nability to drive down crime in a virtual cycle. So we added, after \n2007, a number of Border Patrol officers. President Obama claims credit \nfor it, but he did not have credit. It happened before he took office. \nThey were hiring into his term, I am sure, but it was passed before he \ntook office. So we have more people there. We have fewer illegal \nimmigrants for a whole lot of reasons. And then if you have more \nofficers per illegal immigrant, you can do better at the border.\n\n  Secondly, biometrics. Entry-exit visas have been required by six \ndifferent pieces of congressional legislation. It was recommended by \nthe 9/11 Commission.\n  When people come into the country, they have a fingerprint taken and \nthey are admitted into the country. What we are not doing is verifying \nthat they ever leave the country. We know that most of the 9/11 \nattackers came on a visa. People do not know if they are legal or \noverstaying or have ever left.\n  It is easy. They said it is going to cost billions of dollars--$25 \nbillion to do this. One of our Gang of 8 said that in the committee. It \nis not going to cost $25 billion. We discovered, I believe, a 2009 \nreport issued by the Department of Homeland Security. That report \ndiscovered that you could easily identify people when they depart the \ncountry. One of the complaints is that we have to build all of these \nnew buildings and structures and so forth. But when you leave, all you \nhave to do is put your finger on a fingerprint-recording machine and it \nleaves your fingerprint. It identifies you. What they found was that in \nAtlanta when they were doing this, like 20,000 or 25,000, I believe, \nwere exiting, and over 100 were hits from the watch list. Some of them \nhad felony warrants out. Some of them were on the terrorist list. That \nis a large number. It did not cost much money and was not hard to do. \nSo that could be done.\n  We can absolutely make the workplace secure by using an E-Verify \nsystem at all employment places. That is the key.\n  So there are things we do. Fundamentally, we can make the system \nwork. Unfortunately, the promises made in this legislation do not do \nit. What would happen under this bill is that Secretary Napolitano, \nafter the enforcement officially stopped, must give two reports to \nCongress within 6 months--two reports. Not do anything--two reports. \nThen all the people here illegally will be given provisional status, be \nlegal, get a Social Security card, and have the ability to work. So \nthere are no real actions that have to occur at the border or anyplace \nelse. That is the fundamental flaw we have to deal with. But the \nAmerican people are saying it: First deal with the illegality and then \nlet's talk about how to be compassionate for people who have been here \nfor a long time. But the more troubling issue that has not been fully \ndiscussed, the other half of the immigration equation, is interior \nenforcement. The bill further weakens an already decimated interior \nenforcement system.\n  Immigration reform will never work. This bill will never work unless \nthe\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\nU.S. immigration and customs officers are given the resources and the \nauthority they need to do their job. It will not work. Their morale has \nplummeted because their leadership has blocked them from enforcing \nplain law. They have virtually the lowest morale rating of any agency \nin government. Over a year ago, I asked Secretary Napolitano was she \nnot concerned about it and would she meet with the ICE agents and \ndetermine what the problem was? So she came back. I asked her had she \nmet with them. No. They voted no confidence in their supervisor, John \nMorton. They have written us a long letter detailing the failures in \nthis bill, saying it will make it worse than current law and will leave \nthis country more insecure than we are.\n  It is really remarkable. But they have to be allowed to be a part of \nthe game. It cannot be the policy of the United States of America that \nif someone gets into the country illegally, they are home free; if they \nget past the Border Patrol at the border, nobody will ever deport them. \nThat is what we are doing now unless they are convicted of a serious \nfelony. Nobody is being deported.\n  So you say: Well, people have been here a long time. We do not want \nto start deporting people. We are about to give them amnesty. But the \nbill, if passed, assumes everybody has been given amnesty. The bill \nassumes that everybody has been given permanent legal status or legal \nstatus, which is basically a guaranteed permanent status in the \ncountry. They will be given a Social Security card, identification, and \nthe right to work anywhere.\n  So what about people who come illegally after that? Are we never \ngoing to enforce the law again if other people come illegally, overstay \nvisas, come through the border, stow away on ships? We have to know \nthat it is going to be fixed.\n  It cannot be that if somebody gets past the border, nobody will ever \napprehend them and make them be deported because they shouldn't be \nhere. You are not entitled to come to America illegally and then \nprotest when you are apprehended: Oh, no, I have a right to be here. I \nhave been here for 18 months. You cannot deport me.\n  Once this amnesty occurs, we have to know that we have the mechanism \nin place to do the job that immigration enforcement at a minimum \nrequires. I think that is so important.\n  Chris Crane, the president of the ICE officers union, an ICE officer \nhimself, and a former marine, explained the situation in his testimony \nbefore the House of Representatives recently.\n\n       Agents report that if they encounter suspected illegal \n     aliens in public--\n\n  I am talking about Federal agents, ICE agents, immigration agents--\n\n     they cannot arrest them.\n\n  They cannot arrest them.\n\n       The day-to-day duties of ICE agents and officers often seem \n     in conflict with the law as ICE officers are prohibited from \n     enforcing many laws enacted by Congress; laws they took an \n     oath to enforce. . . . ICE is now guided in large part by \n     influences of powerful special interest groups that advocate \n     on behalf of illegal aliens.\n\n  Does that not cause any concern? We have to deal with this. We have \nto get our ICE people off the mat and into the game.\n  He also testified:\n\n       Morale is at an all-time low as criminal aliens are \n     released to the streets.\n\n  Criminal aliens. He is not talking about people who violate the \nimmigration law; he is talking about aliens who committed crimes such \nas drug offenses and assault.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Criminal aliens are released to the streets and ICE instead \n     takes disciplinary--\n\n  He is talking about his supervisors--\n\n     actions against its own officers for making lawful arrests. . \n     . . It appears clear that Federal law enforcement officers \n     are the enemy and not those who break our Nation's laws.\n\n  He is saying that the supervisors are punishing the ICE officers who \nactually go out and arrest people because they have set a policy not to \nenforce the law of the United States. People may not think that is \ntrue, but it is absolutely a fact that we have basically made it \nimpossible to enforce the law, and that has come from Secretary \nNapolitano right on down. That is why she doesn't want to meet with \nthem--because she doesn't have an answer. She is telling them and her \ndeputy is telling them not to enforce the law.\n  Mr. Crane further testified:\n\n       If an alien is arrested by local police and placed in jail, \n     again, ICE agents may not arrest them for illegal entry or \n     VISA overstay . . . New policies require that illegal aliens \n     have a felony arrest or conviction or be convicted of three \n     or more misdemeanors . . . So, many illegal aliens with \n     criminal convictions are also now untouchable.\n\n  That is the reality of law enforcement in this country. It is very, \nvery serious. This is a sad state of affairs, no doubt about it.\n  Were these officers consulted when the Gang of 8 wrote the bill? They \ntell us they have a bill that is going to work to end the lawlessness \nin America in the future, but did they ever consult with the people who \nare out there trying to enforce the law now to get their ideas about \nhow to make the system work better in the future? Do they have new \nprovisions in the bill that give our ICE agents, Border Patrol agents, \nand citizen immigration officers more authority to do their job? No.\n  The bill actually gives more discretion to the Secretary to \neviscerate enforcement by not having to enforce plain law. There are a \nnumber of provisions in the Code that say that if somebody is arrested \nand they are due to be deported, they shall be deported. That is the \nlaw. Well, they are not doing that.\n  I don't think this is, frankly, just loophole or failure of \nattention. I don't think the Gang of 8 was really on top of all of the \ndetails of the legislation. I think they spent most of their time \nconsulting with Mr. Trumka at the AFL-CIO, Mr. Donohue at the chamber \nof commerce, La Raza, the immigration lawyers association, the meat \npackers, and the grocery folks or the big agribusinesses. That is whom \nthey have been talking with, the computer gurus demanding more and \nmore. They didn't focus on this.\n  The people who are actually in there writing it--the immigration \nlawyers, the chamber of commerce, the union lawyers, and all who have \nbeen working on this bill--they knew what they were doing. These \nscribes, these drafters of the legislation I believe fully understood \nwhat it meant. Under this bill, amnesty will occur at once, just as it \ndid in 1987, and like then, we get a mere promise of enforcement in the \nfuture--a mere promise. Far from making our laws tougher, as the Gang \nof 8 has promised and as we need to do, the enforcement of laws is \ngreatly weakened in a whole number of significant areas.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, the drafters of the bill will have received \nwhat they want. They will have received amnesty for the 11 million. \nThey will get a dramatic increase in the flow of workers and low-\nskilled workers into America. That is what they want. They are not \ninterested in future enforcement. In fact, many of them felt as though \nthe big increases in immigration in the future aren't enough, so they \nhave no objection to illegal immigration, it seems, or they would have \nput a lot more intention in drafting a legislation that would have \nimproved the illegal system.\n  This bill fails. We will go into more detail about it as time goes \nby. This bill still fails as a matter of law enforcement. That is going \nto be clear.\n  I am looking at a new piece of legislation introduced by Trey Gowdy, \nwho is the chairman of the House subcommittee. He is a former \nprosecutor, a Federal prosecutor, 6 years as assistant U.S. attorney. \nHe is a real prosecutor who understands how the system works. Mr. Gowdy \nhas put together a good bill. He says this: ``robust internal \nimmigration enforcement.'' That is what the ICE agents do in Denver, in \nMemphis, and in Indianapolis.\n\n       Robust internal immigration enforcement, paired with border \n     security, is our safeguard against repeating the mistakes of \n     1986. The SAFE Act is a critical step in our efforts to fix \n     our broken immigration system and ensures we will not be \n     having this conversation again in 10, 20, or 30 years.\n\n  It ensures we won't be back here with another amnesty demand because \nwe have enforced the law.\n  He has put together some good principles that are not in this bill. \nFirst, it grants states and localities the authority to enforce \nimmigration laws. The Supreme Court says: You can't do that, it is \nunconstitutional. Not so. The Supreme Court says the U.S. Congress, by\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\nthe way it passed this legislation, preempted local enforcement in a \nlot of areas. They couldn't participate because when Attorney General \nHolder tells the Federal agents not to enforce the laws, State people \ncan't enforce them either, basically. Attorney General Holder says we \nare not enforcing these laws. Secretary Napolitano: We are not \nenforcing these laws. Then the State can't do it because it is totally \npreempted, essentially, by the Federal Government, except for \nperipheral areas, like a business can't get a business license if it \nknowingly hires illegal workers. That is probably a State issue.\n  Well, it is just a matter of Congress's actions. Mr. Gowdy would \nexplicitly allow help from State and local officers.\n  Now, let's get this straight. If a police officer in Alabama arrests \nsomebody who is in the country illegally, they cannot prosecute them. \nThey can only hold them for a short period of time. All they can do is \nturn them over to Federal officials. That is clear. Mr. Gowdy doesn't \nchange that, really. The fundamental thing is that they could do that. \nThat is the way the system works.\n  What we need to be thinking about is, don't we have to have local law \nenforcement to be participants in any system that guarantees legality? \nThere are 600,000 State and local law enforcement officers. There are \n5,000 interior Federal immigration officers, 5,000 ICE officers, and \nmany of them have other duties. It is our local police and sheriffs who \nare out on the highways and State troopers who are out there every day \ncoming in touch with thousands of people, and they are the ones who \nidentify people here illegally.\n  When the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security \nrejected agreements for State and Federal officers to have their \nassistance in identifying people here, they knew what they were doing. \nThey were effectively eliminating the identification of many of the \npeople here illegally. That was a deliberate, calculated act. People \nneed to know it, and it was wrong.\n  For a good system of immigration for America in the future--remember \nnow, we are talking about after people have been given the amnesty \nunder the bill--the bill should welcome the assistance of State and \nFederal officers and make up policies that will help with that.\n  The Gowdy bill would protect American communities from dangerous \ncriminals by facilitating and expediting the removal of criminal \naliens. This has been delayed. It is not working effectively. It is \ncosting us a lot of money. If someone is here illegally and has been \nconvicted a felony, they ought to be removed and there ought not to be \na big deal about it. How much trouble is that? His bill would speed \nthat up and make the system work better.\n  It improves visa security.\n  It helps the ICE agents do a better job. It assists the ICE officers \nin carrying out their jobs by enforcing Federal immigration laws, by \nallowing them to make arrests. They basically are being prohibited from \nmaking arrests today--can you believe it--for Federal felonies, for \nFederal criminal offenses, for bringing in and harboring unlawful \naliens. The officers need to be able to enforce those laws.\n  It strengthens border security in a number of ways.\n  It reviews the prosecutorial authority that basically is a directive \nnot to follow the law, not to enforce the law that is out there.\n  It strengthens national security in quite a number of ways.\n  This is a good piece of legislation. He knew what he was doing. He \ndrafted something that will make a difference. It will make the law \nstronger. I would ask my colleagues, why wouldn't you put something \nlike that in the legislation? You say want to have a tough bill. You \nsay your bill is tough.\n  This will be called to the attention of the bill's sponsors. We will \nask for legislation like this to be passed as an amendment to the bill, \nand we will see if it passes. If it doesn't pass, then we can draw a \nconclusion that the sponsors of the bill and the people who are \npromoting the bill don't really want to see the law enforced better in \nthe future than it is today. That would be a sad admission, it seems to \nme.\n  To wrap up, this is a great institution, the Senate. I am glad \nSenator Reid acquiesced to my insistence to at least have the \nopportunity to begin our discussion today. It is just the beginning. We \nwill begin to talk about the legislation, talk about how to make our \nsystem work better, talk about the American people's desire--good and \ndecent people that they are--to be compassionate to the people who have \nbeen here for a long time but their insistence that in the process we \ncreate a system of lawful immigration in the future so we are not back \nhere.\n  Again, as I indicated earlier, a poll shows 88 percent of the people \nsaid they are angry with their elected officials about failure to \nenforce the law, whereas only 12 percent said they were angry at people \nwho entered the country illegally. The American people are willing to \ncreate a legal status for people who come here illegally. But we need \nto do it in a way that works. They are demanding we create a system of \nlawfulness that will work, and we can do it. It is absolutely possible, \nand that will be demonstrated as we go forward.\n\n  We are going to have to change this bill, however, and put some teeth \nin it and give some real power to our dedicated law officers whose \nlives are at risk every day out there on the streets. We must give them \nthe backing and the mechanisms in law that allow them to be effective. \nIf we do it right, the whole world will say: Uh-oh, the United States \nhas gotten their act together. The United States is serious about their \nimmigration system being lawful. If you try to enter, they are liable \nto catch you. If you try to enter, you won't be able to get a job \nlegally. And if you enter and get past the border and hide out in \nMinneapolis and you get caught, you are going to be deported. So don't \ntry to go there illegally. Apply to go there legally.\n  We could see a rather dramatic drop in the attempts to enter \nillegally if we do that. That is what a system of integrity requires. \nFirst, people need to know they shouldn't do it, that the United States \nwill enforce this law. They need to know if they come into the country \nillegally, they will be deported.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I take the floor today in strong support \nof comprehensive immigration reform. The action that was taken \nyesterday by the House of Representatives underscores how critical the \nwork we will do in the next few weeks is to the future of our Nation.\n  What did the House Republicans do yesterday? They voted to deport \nhundreds of thousands of young people whom we refer to as DREAMers. \nThese young people were brought to this country through no fault of \ntheir own, and they are contributing greatly to our society and our \neconomy. Some of these young people were brought here at 2 years old, 4 \nyears old. They had no idea they were doing anything wrong.\n  Senator Durbin has been working for years to pass the DREAM Act. \nPresident Obama implemented the DREAM Act to put a stop to deporting \nthese people if they met certain requirements, and those requirements \nare pretty clear. They have to be truly good people, they have to be \npeople who are getting their education, serving in the military, and \nbeing responsible. But yesterday, the House Republicans said: No. They \nsaid: Deport these DREAMers.\n  That is not what the American people want. In poll after poll the \nAmerican people say: If someone is brought here through no fault of \ntheir own at a young age, this is their country. Yet the House \nRepublicans would say we should deport them.\n  Now, I never say I speak for the American people. I am just talking \nabout polls. And the polls I have seen--and, Madam President, the polls \nyou have seen--show the people know we need immigration reform, \ncomprehensive reform, that will take people out of the shadows, that \nwill make sure they are not afraid to be part of society. If we do \nthat, they will buy homes and start businesses. They will create jobs, \nthey will lift our economy, they\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\nwill lift their families out of poverty, and they will strengthen our \ncountry. The American people get this.\n  Like so many Americans, I am proud of my immigrant roots. My mother \ncame here from Austria as an infant. She never finished high school \nbecause she had to work to support her family. My dad was from an \nimmigrant family too, the only one of nine children to be born in \nAmerica and the only one to graduate from college. Then, when I was a \nlittle girl, he graduated from law school.\n  When my mother passed away, I remember going through her memorabilia \nand I discovered a certificate that was wrapped in plastic. She stored \nit with other valuables in her jewelry box. It was the only document \nshe protected in that fashion because it meant so much to my mother. It \nwas her certificate of citizenship. That is what the dream of \ncitizenship means to the millions of Californians and to the millions \nof Americans who are now forced to live in the shadows.\n  For immigration reform to be truly comprehensive it must include a \npath to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants in our \ncountry today, and it must include the DREAM Act. We can't have two \nclasses of citizens in America: one with full citizenship and one with \nhalf citizenship. That is not the promise of our Nation. The bill we \nwill debate next week addresses this problem, and it provides a tough \nbut fair path to citizenship.\n  It is also crucial we pass reforms that protect workers and their \nfamilies from exploitation and abuse. Too many immigrants, especially \nwomen, face sexual harassment in the workplace, violence and \ndiscrimination. The Judiciary Committee bill includes critical \nprotections for women, including U visas, to keep women safe from \ndomestic violence.\n  A strong reform bill must also include a fair and effective guest \nworker program which provides workers with livable wages and strong \nlabor protections, and this bill meets many of these tests. Would I \nhave made it even stronger? Yes. Would my friend in the Chair have made \nit even stronger in many ways? Absolutely. But the bill is a real step \nforward.\n  When we pass comprehensive immigration reform, we don't just help \nimmigrant families, we help all Americans. I would like to see family \nreunification be made stronger in this bill.\n  I commend those who worked on this bill. I know they had to hammer \nout these compromises. Having brought a successful highway bill to \npassage, a successful WRDA bill to passage on the Senate floor, I know \nI didn't get everything I wanted, so I am sympathetic to the fact this \nis not a perfect bill. But I know the Presiding Officer and I will \nsupport making this bill better, making this bill stronger, and maybe \nwe will persuade colleagues to go along with us. We have to remember \nthis bill isn't the be-all and end-all. We can make it stronger over \nthe coming months and years.\n  According to a 2010 USC study--University of Southern California--\nwhen we create a path to citizenship, it will result in 25,000 new jobs \nand $3 billion in direct and indirect spending in California alone \nevery single year. Nationwide, our immigration bill will increase our \nGDP, our gross domestic product, by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. It \nwill increase wages for workers.\n  That is what happens when workers come out of the shadows. It will \nlead to between 750,000 and 900,000 new jobs, according to the Center \nfor American Progress. When workers come out of the shadows their wages \nrise, they open bank accounts, they buy homes, they spend money in \ntheir communities, and they are known to find new businesses.\n  Businesses will benefit by having access to talented workers in \nfields ranging from manufacturing to health care to agriculture to high \ntech. And taxpayers are going to benefit. We will hear horror stories \nabout how expensive this is, but the fact is studies show--that is, \nstudies that don't have a bias--that taxpayers will benefit from an \nestimated $5 billion in new revenues in the first 3 years alone, \nincluding $310 million a year in State income taxes, which will help \nsupport education and other important services just in my home State of \nCalifornia.\n  So will we see workers benefiting? Yes, from higher wages, but also \nbetter working conditions. And they will get respect and they will get \ndignity. What that means is they will be proud members of our \ncommunities. Families and children will benefit when we lift the fear \nof being deported and separated from their loved ones. I know the DREAM \nAct that Senator Durbin has worked on for so many years does impact the \nfamilies of the DREAMers, and it will help them, because we don't want \nto separate families.\n  I am going to be working on many amendments and offering some to \nimprove this bill--amendments to provide a fair and reasonable path to \ncitizenship, amendments to ensure we treat immigrants with dignity and \nrespect, amendments that are friendly to family reunification, \namendments that are friendly to workers. Workers are the backbone of \nthis country.\n  I want to close with a quote from President John F. Kennedy. Back in \n1958, he wrote a book entitled, ``A Nation of Immigrants.'' In that \nbook he eloquently described how immigrants have strengthened our \nNation. I already talked about my own immigrant roots. This is what \nJohn Kennedy wrote:\n\n       This was the secret of America: a Nation of people with the \n     fresh memory of old traditions who dared to explore new \n     frontiers, people eager to build lives for themselves in a \n     spacious society that did not restrict their freedom of \n     choice and their action.\n\n  He added:\n\n       Every ethnic minority, in seeking its own freedom, helped \n     to strengthen the fabric of liberty in American life.\n\n  Those words were true back in 1958 and they are just as true today. \nAmericans are ready and they are waiting for comprehensive immigration \nreform.\n  I thank our colleagues who worked so hard on this bill, including my \nown colleague, Senator Feinstein, who worked so hard on the ag jobs \ntitle. We have to protect that title. There are those who would weaken \nit, and we can't weaken it. It is put together in such a way that we \nhave the growers and workers supporting it. That is pretty good when we \ncan get those two sides together.\n  The President has said the time is now. I agree. The time is past \nnow. We need to get this done. I think Senator Leahy has handled this \nbill beautifully. I believe 150 amendments were adopted in the \ncommittee, and also many others were offered. The system has been fair. \nSenator Reid has given us plenty of time to offer amendments, to debate \nthese issues.\n  I am excited about it. My State is waiting with bated breath for \nthis. It is so overdue. Let's get to work. Let's make comprehensive \nimmigration reform a reality. I am pleased to say to the President, I \nleave this floor with great hopes that we can get it done.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize Bob Conlon, a coowner of Leunig's Bistro, a fixture on \nBurlington's historic Church Street for decades. Bob was recently \nhonored by the Burlington Business Association, BBA, for his \ncontributions not only to the local economy through the success of \nLeunig's but also because of his commitment to community service.\n  Originally from Waterbury, CT, Bob has been a resident of Chittenden \nCounty for over 45 years, first arriving in the area to attend my own \nalma mater, St. Michael's College. Bob first came to Leunig's as a \nbartender, rose to the post of manager, and today is a coowner of one \nof Church Street's most successful restaurants. Marcelle and I enjoy \nseeing and talking with Bob when we are in Burlington.\n  Bob's contributions to the greater Burlington community are not \nlimited\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\nto providing great cuisine at Leunig's; he has been engaged in the \ncommunity for decades, hosting regular fundraisers that support a wide \nrange of services, from monthly dinners with proceeds that benefit \nvarious local support programs to hosting an annual fashion show to \nbenefit the Breast Care Center at Fletcher Allen Hospital. Bob has been \nan exemplary model of what good business really is: economically \nsuccessfully, and community-minded.\n  Bob's dedication to the Burlington community is well documented, and \nthe honor bestowed upon him by the BBA is wholly merited. In \nrecognition of his work, I ask that an article published in the \nBurlington Free Press on April 4, 2013, ``Leunig's co-owner honored,'' \nbe printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From The Burlington Free Press, Apr. 4, 2013]\n\n                       Leunig's Co-owner Honored\n\n       Bob Conlon has spent half his life at Leunig's Bistro--from \n     substitute bartender to co-owner. A certain sensibility, and \n     a couple of tasks, follow him through every position.\n       ``We're all in the service industry,'' Conlon, 63, said. \n     ``We feed people, we cheer them up. Plunge the toilets and \n     mop the floors.''\n       Conlon will be honored tonight by the Burlington Business \n     Association. The BBA's 35th dinner and annual meeting will be \n     held at the Hilton Burlington.\n       The honoree, a fixture on Church Street for more than 30 \n     years, will be attending his first BBA dinner, Conlon said \n     Monday morning over coffee in the bistro's dining room.\n       ``I always thought of that dinner as for the important \n     people,'' he said. ``My social life is working.''\n       Conlon's work at Leunig's includes a variety of community \n     service efforts, including an annual fashion show/fundraiser \n     for the Breast Care Center at Fletcher Allen Health Care, and \n     monthly dinners with a portion of proceeds to benefit local \n     social service groups.\n       ``They have long tradition of doing good for a broad range \n     of community groups,'' said Rita Markley, executive director \n     of COTS.\n       Tim Halvorson is a past recipient of the award Conlon will \n     receive; indeed, the award is named for Halvorson. He is a \n     board member of the Burlington Business Association who will \n     introduce Conlon at the dinner. Conlon follows in a line of \n     honorees who are committed to helping and enriching the \n     greater community, Halvorson said.\n       ``We thought that Bob represents, through the way they \n     handle things at Leunig's, a great example of a small \n     business that gives back,'' Halvorson said. ``Between breast \n     cancer and City Arts and COTS, they give tens of thousands of \n     dollars back to the community. It's a business that uses its \n     popularity and location as a vehicle for good.''\n       Conlon arrived in Chittenden County 45 years ago from \n     Waterbury, Conn., the son of a restaurant waiter who worked \n     as a busboy as a kid. He was a theater major at St. Michael's \n     College. These days, his acting takes place at the Leunig's \n     bar--his costume is well-dressed restauranteur--and on the \n     Church Street Marketplace.\n       Last summer, Conlon's costume came to include hard hats, \n     worn by him and his staff (and sometimes customers) as a nod \n     to marketplace construction.\n       ``You have a role to play,'' Conlon said, a part in which \n     his social life plays out at work. ``You have brief \n     conversations with people--cheerful and fun.''\n       He tries always to be in a good mood, Conlon said. If he's \n     feeling bad he steers away from the question, What do I want? \n     and asks instead, What does my wife want? What does my \n     daughter want? What do my staff and customers want? Conlon \n     said.\n       ``If you can make other people happy, you end up being \n     happy,'' he said.\n       Conlon started working at Leunig's when he was 32, after a \n     short stint as co-owner of a failed restaurant. The business, \n     Carburs Rib-it Room, was in the space now occupied by \n     Marilyn's, a clothing store.\n       ``If everything were perfect, it would've taken us 20 years \n     to get up to zero,'' Conlon said of the failed business.\n       He got out after two years and joined Leunig's as a \n     substitute bartender. ``I always liked waiting on \n     customers,'' he said. ``I got to hang out with a lot of good \n     people--artists, business people, college professors, \n     students, cops.''\n       He tended bar until about 10 years ago, when he became \n     manager. The move to manager from bartender came about, in \n     part, because managers came and went with frequency, Conlon \n     said.\n       ``Every time you get a new boss it's very insecure,'' \n     Conlon said. ``Your employment is dependent on the sanity of \n     your supervisor. So be the supervisor.''\n       He started as well to purchase ownership shares in the \n     business from Leunig's owner, Robert Fuller, intending with \n     his business partner, chef Donnell Collins, to become a 50-50 \n     owner of the restaurant. Conlon expects the deal will be \n     finalized May 1, he said.\n       ``Isn't that America?'' Conlon said. ``Isn't that what \n     everybody should do? Get a job, do your best at it, and don't \n     pass up opportunities. It's an honorable profession. If \n     you're good at it, you can live a good life.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4015-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4015-S4016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RICHMOND ROUND CHURCH 200TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Vermont boasts a number of historical \ntreasures, and among them is the Round Church in Richmond, which this \nyear celebrates its 200th anniversary.\n  The Old Round Church earned a national historic landmark distinction \nfrom the National Park Service in 1996. Because of the church's history \nand its long-held status as meeting place and community center, it has \ncome to be recognized as a symbol of the rich history woven through so \nmany Vermont towns.\n  This year the Richmond Round Church, known to many as the Old Round \nChurch, will celebrate its bicentennial with a series of concerts and \ncommunity events. The sense of community boasted by the Old Round \nChurch is rooted partially in the history of the church's \nestablishment. Initially conceived by settlers seeking a local meeting \nplace, their plan to erect the Round Church faltered with reluctance \nfrom the town of Richmond to supply the land need to construct the \nbuilding. Two local men, however, volunteered the land, and in 1813 \nconstruction of the church was completed. It has since grown to become \na renowned symbol for its historical significance but also for its \nrepresentation of the community values that are so cherished across \nVermont.\n  Over the past two centuries, it has served as a meeting place, a \nvenue for local activities, and even a popular location for weddings. \nGenerations of Vermonters have visited the Old Round Church, and as a \nyoung boy growing up in Montpelier, I remember visiting the church with \nmy parents, and brother and sister. Today, volunteers routinely help \npreserve the church's history by volunteering to help clean, maintain, \nand repair its structure. It remains as central to the community as it \never has in its 200 year history.\n  In honor of the 200th anniversary of the Richmond Round Church, I ask \nthat an article published in the Burlington Free Press on May 26, 2013, \n``Richmond Round Church Turns 200, Celebrations Abound,'' be printed \ninto the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From The Burlington Free Press, May 26, 2013]\n\n          Richmond Round Church Turns 200, Celebrations Abound\n\n       Richmond--It started with an argument.\n       In 1796 settlers of this small town in the foothills of the \n     Green Mountains wanted to build a local meeting house, or at \n     least some of them did. Then as now, democracy did not always \n     come easily. The committees tasked with finding a location \n     found it difficult to agree and fickle townspeople voted down \n     the whole idea in 1811.\n       Absent the good will of two local men who offered to donate \n     land to the cause, free and clear, the foundation for \n     Richmond's iconic Round Church might never have been laid.\n       But donate they did, and this year the white clapboard \n     building that sits serenely in the heart of Richmond turns \n     200. The birthday is being celebrated all summer with \n     concerts and special events culminating the weekend of Aug. \n     9, 10 and 11.\n       Fans of the church say it symbolizes the spirit of the \n     town.\n       ``Well, I think this represents what's best about \n     Richmond,'' said Fran Thomas, president of the Richmond \n     Historical Society. ``It was built as a community church and \n     meeting house. To me it's what's best about Richmond, that \n     community aspect.''\n       The shape of the 16-sided church and meeting house is \n     believed to be unique in the United States. It has survived \n     floods, blizzards and other onslaughts--attacks by powder \n     post beetles, dry rot and restless youths who carved their \n     initials into the wooden box pews as early as 1912.\n\n\n                             Built to last\n\n       According to ``The Richmond Round Church, 1813-2013,'' a \n     history written by Harriet W. Riggs and Martha Turner and \n     published by the Richmond Historical Society, the box pews \n     were designed to help retain heat. Families brought heated \n     soap stones or small metal boxes of burning coals to help \n     stay warm inside. A stone and box are on display at the back \n     of the church, along with other artifacts.\n       Miraculously, the church never burned down despite \n     considerable threat from wood stoves that were added to the \n     building at some point and according to local lore stuffed \n     full starting several days before gatherings and then left \n     unattended as the structure heated up. Pipes from the stoves \n     snaked\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\n     precariously aloft the pews, posing another hazard.\n       The stoves are idle now and the piping was pulled down \n     decades ago. These days the Richmond Historical Society \n     manages and maintains the town-owned structure under a 40-\n     year agreement that expires in 2016.\n       Town meeting ceased to be held at the church in 1974 on the \n     advice of the fire marshal and structural engineers who \n     advised the roof could cave under a heavy snow storm. (Town \n     meeting now takes place at Camels Hump Middle School.) The \n     five Protestant denominations that sold pew space to fund the \n     construction 200 years ago no longer hold Sunday services at \n     the church.\n       But the structure and its surrounding green continue to \n     serve as a visual centerpiece and active venue for weddings, \n     tours, concerts and other events.\n\n\n                          Maintaining history\n\n       Volunteers do everything from washing the 12-over-12 \n     mullioned windows to writing grants to booking weddings to \n     monitoring the steady stream of repairs needed to keep the \n     church upright. Major structural work took place in the late \n     1970s and early 1980s, with the historical society leading \n     the charge. More recently, workers have restored the \n     foundation and replaced rotting beams and clapboard at the \n     back of the church. Some day friends of the church would like \n     to build in a bathroom, but for now a lilac-landscaped port-\n     o-let out back serves the purpose.\n       Repairing broken panes of glass is a regular task and in \n     this as in other work, effort is made to stay historically \n     accurate. Glass from old windows donated to the church is \n     used whenever possible.\n       ``We have a stockpile of wavy glass to repair the broken \n     windows,'' Thomas explained.\n       All the effort to maintain the church is well worth it, \n     said Thomas as she showed a reporter around the space \n     recently.\n       The building today is unheated and there are no plans to \n     add a modern heat source. That means use of the Round Church \n     is seasonal, with events taking place from April to October, \n     with a few exceptions such as an annual December carol sing.\n       Occasionally a wedding is scheduled in November or \n     December. ``But we have to make sure the bride and groom \n     realize how cold it's going to be,'' said Thomas.\n       One couple literally got cold feet and moved their wedding \n     on a few days notice after visiting the church and realizing \n     how chilly their vows would be.\n       The shape of the church has long been a subject of \n     speculation. Some say the circular shape was chosen to ward \n     off the devil because he could not hide in the corners of the \n     church.\n       Thomas doubts the devil drove the architectural plans. The \n     more likely story is that head carpenter William Rhodes \n     appreciated the circular design of an addition to the meeting \n     house in his hometown of Claremont, N.H. and wanted to copy \n     the idea.\n       ``To me, that makes the most sense,'' Thomas said. ``It's \n     not the most interesting, but it makes the most sense.''\n       Snatches of the surrounding scenery can be viewed from \n     inside the church--green mountainside, sloping lawn, flood \n     plain field and the red metal truss bridge spanning the \n     Winooski River. The church sits slightly uphill, which saved \n     it from the great flood of 1927 and Tropical Storm Irene, \n     although the latter turned the lower green into a lake.\n       Taking care of the building is much more involved than some \n     people might guess, said Thomas. But Richmond would not be \n     Richmond without it, she said.\n       ``It's our claim to fame, I guess.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4016-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RANDALL H. WALKER\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Randy Walker for \nhis leadership as Director of Aviation for Clark County. Randy is the \nconsummate public servant, having served the people of Nevada in \nvarious positions since 1979, culminating in his appointment as \nDirector of Aviation for Clark County in May 1997. For the past 16 \nyears, Randy has transformed McCarran International Airport into one of \nthe premier airports in the world, and he has greatly expanded the \nairport's reach to all corners of the globe.\n  Randy became Director of Aviation at an exciting time in southern \nNevada. Clark County was the fastest growing county in the Nation, with \ntens of thousands of new people moving to Las Vegas each year. Tourist \nnumbers hit record levels and new resorts were changing the face of the \nworld famous Strip. Las Vegas was becoming a global destination with \nnew markets in Europe, South America, and Asia fueling southern \nNevada's economy. Randy recognized this potential for growth and he \nplayed a key role in expanding the airport.\n  During Randy's first year on the job, McCarran International Airport \nadded 26 new gates; more were added in 2005 and again in 2008, which \nincreased the D Concourse's size to 45 gates today. Randy oversaw the \nconstruction of a new rental car terminal, which improved the visitor \nexperience for tourists. He also kept airport operations running \nsmoothly at the airport during the construction of a tunnel for \nInterstate 215 under the runways.\n  Randy has also made McCarran International Airport one of the most \ntechnically advanced airports in the Nation. It is the only major \nairport in the U.S. to use Common Use Terminal Equipment, allowing for \nseamless integration of airlines' computer systems. In addition, he \ninstalled SpeedCheck kiosks, allowing customers to get their boarding \npasses without having to go to a specific airline counter. The airport \nalso implemented a baggage-tracking system that uses radio-frequency \nidentification so that baggage can be accurately tracked.\n  In 2010, McCarran opened a USO Lounge to serve servicemembers from \nNevada and those flying through Nevada. The rest and relaxation lounge \nserves tens of thousands of our military personnel each year as they \ntravel to Nevada and through Nevada. I worked with Randy, Wayne Newton, \nand the USO since 2007 to create this lounge.\n  Randy has changed the face of aviation in southern Nevada, but the \nmost important project during Randy's tenure was the opening of \nTerminal 3, or T3. Building a new $2.4 billion terminal was the largest \nexpansion project in McCarran's history, and one of the largest public \nworks projects in Nevada history. McCarran began this ambitious \nexpansion project before the recession hit my State. When the economy \nworsened, I worked with Randy to keep T3 on track by having Congress \nprovide tax relief to local governments and their bondholders in the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Randy's steady leadership \nduring the challenging economy was critical to the completion of the \nproject.\n  Last year, McCarran International Airport was ranked 24th in the \nworld for passenger traffic, hosting nearly 41.7 million passengers. \nUnder Randy's tenure, the airport saw a 33 percent increase in Las \nVegas visitor volume that resulted in a 50 percent increase in revenues \nfor Clark County. This has been extremely beneficial to the economy of \nsouthern Nevada.\n  After playing an important role in shaping the future of Las Vegas \nand southern Nevada for decades, Randy recently stepped down as the \nDirector of Aviation to enter a well-deserved retirement. I am pleased \nto recognize Randy's extraordinary service to the people of Clark \nCounty before the Senate today and I wish him all the best in his \nretirement or, knowing Randy, in his next phase of remarkable \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4016-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4016-S4017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DR. AL BOWMAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to take a few moments to \nthank Dr. Al Bowman for all he has done to keep the doors of \neducational opportunity open for young people in my State of Illinois.\n  After nearly 10 years as President of Illinois State University, and \na total of 35 years of service to ISU, Dr. Bowman is retiring. But the \nmark he leaves will continue to benefit ISU and the people of Illinois \nfor years to come.\n  The ISU Dr. Bowman is leaving is more financially stable and more \nattractive to top talent. Its student body is more diverse.\n  Under Dr. Bowman's leadership, Illinois State University has ranked \nas one of America's top 100 public universities for 7 straight years.\n  A hallmark of Dr. Bowman's presidency at ISU has been his \ndetermination to make sure that students graduate with the best \npossible education and the lowest possible debt.\n  Illinois State University has done much more than any school I know \nof to make sure its students are able to make informed choices about \nstudent loans. The university asks each student to meet with financial \ncounselors. Those counselors push students to borrow the minimum they \nneed--not the most they can get. As a result, ISU's students graduate \nwith an average student debt of $22,720--a sizable debt, to be sure, \nbut well below the national average for 4-year, public institutions.\n  And the quality of education is unquestioned. ISU's graduates are \nfinding work in their field and paying down\n\n[[Page S4017]]\n\ntheir loans. The university's student loan default rate is only 3 \npercent--again, well below the national average.\n  Dr. Bowman's first career was working as a speech pathologist at the \nVeterans Administration Hospital in Danville, IL.\n  He joined the ISU faculty in 1978 as a professor in the Department of \nSpeech Pathology and Audiology. He was appointed department chairperson \nin 1994 and served in that position for 8 years. Even as department \nchair, Dr. Bowman continued to teach and to serve as director of ISU's \nDown Syndrome Speech-Language Clinic.\n  During Dr. Bowman's tenure as director, the department flourished. He \ndoubled the faculty and the scholarly production of the staff. The \ndepartment won accreditation by the Council on Academic Accreditation \nof the American Speech-Language Hearing Association and its master's \nprogram was ranked for the first time as the top speech and audiology \nmaster's program in Illinois.\n  In 2002, Dr. Bowman was promoted to Illinois State's interim provost \nwhere he served until he was named president in 2004.\n  As president, Dr. Bowman was a driving force behind Illinois State \nUniversity's first comprehensive campaign, which raised more than $96 \nmillion. He also helped secure $49 million for a new student fitness \nand recreation center and $17.5 million for the renovation of Schroeder \nHall, the university's home to the Criminal Justice Sciences, History, \nPolitics and Government, Social Work and Sociology-Anthropology \ndepartments.\n  I congratulate Dr. Al Bowman on his many accomplishments throughout \nhis long and distinguished career.\n  I thank him for his service and wish him all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4017-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING FRANK R. LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I was greatly saddened to learn about \nthe passing of Senator Lautenberg on Monday. I was fortunate to serve \nwith Senator Lautenberg on the Commerce Committee. His life was about \npublic service, plain and simple.\n  Frank was a great example of the American Dream. Over the past few \ndays we have all heard Frank's story of being born into a Russian and \nPolish immigrant family, and working his way from humble beginnings to \na prosperous career as a chief executive in the private sector. But \nFrank's true calling was public service and giving back to his \ncommunity, his State, and our Nation throughout his life. As a young \nman, he served our country in the U.S. Army in WWII and went to \nColumbia University on the GI bill.\n  In Congress, Frank fought to create economic opportunity for all \nAmericans by supporting our public infrastructure. He was a staunch \nadvocate for passenger rail and Amtrak. Frank's achievements on \ntransportation issues were not only concerned with promoting commerce, \nbut also public safety. His work to ban smoking on domestic flights and \ncombat drunk driving has saved countless lives.\n  Frank also fought side-by-side with me on the Aviation Operations, \nSafety, and Security Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee to \nmake sure that critical NASA safety research was being shared with the \ncommercial aviation industry to help protect members of the flying \npublic.\n  Florida and New Jersey are very different States, but they share a \ncoastline. After the Deepwater Horizon spill devastated the Gulf, I \nworked with him to stop offshore drilling until more was known about \nwhat caused that tragedy. Frank was also a trusted ally in securing \nessential funding to keep our beaches clean and water safe for people \nto enjoy.\n  Frank was a crucial supporter of many other important environmental \ncauses. He fought to keep our oceans clean by pushing for a ``double-\nhull'' standard for oil tankers, banning ocean dumping, and taking \nother steps to promote better water quality. He also sponsored \nlegislation to crackdown on companies that release dangerous toxins \ninto the air and water, and make polluters pay for their toxic mess. \nFrank was a great champion for the environment.\n  As the last WW II veteran in the Senate, we lost a true hero on \nMonday and one of this body's last members of the Greatest Generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4017-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONFIRMATION OF WILLIAM H. PRYOR, JR.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to take a brief moment to \ncommend the Senate on the confirmation of Judge William H. Pryor, Jr., \nto the United States Sentencing Commission. Judge Pryor is superbly \nqualified and has the requisite background and experience to serve and \ncontribute greatly to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. I am grateful to \nthe President for acknowledging Judge Pryor's qualifications and \nnominating him to this important position.\n  Judge Pryor succeeded me as Attorney General of Alabama. I was proud \nof him then and I was also proud when he was confirmed to serve on the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Pryor is a man of character \nand his actions both on and off the bench reflect that. He is committed \nto equal justice, without prejudice. As Bill Baxley, a mutual friend, a \nDemocrat, and another former attorney general of Alabama said, ``In \nevery difficult decision he has made, Judge Pryor's actions were \nsupported by his interpretation of the law, without race, gender, age, \npolitical power, wealth, community standing, or any other competing \ninterest affecting his judgment.''\n  That was certainly the case when he carried the banner for sentencing \nreform in Alabama. Judge Pryor insisted that the legislature address \ncritical problems in Alabama's system of sentencing. He has always been \nin favor of ``truth in sentencing.'' Advocates of sentencing reform \nhave applauded Judge Pryor's efforts in Alabama, as before we had a \nsentencing commission and sentencing guidelines, criminal defendants \noften received different sentences for the same crime based on their \nrace, their sex, or where they lived. Judge Pryor was instrumental in \nchanging that.\n  Advocates of stricter law enforcement also supported Judge Pryor in \nhis efforts to effect reform in Alabama, because ``truth in \nsentencing'' also meant that a convicted criminal would be more likely \nto serve the sentence imposed by the judge rather than just a fraction \nof the sentence based on the discretion of a parole officer. He has \nstated that when a court enters a sentence of imprisonment, there \nshould be a reliable expectation that the offender will serve a \nsubstantial majority of that term of imprisonment. Judge Pryor is \nreasonable and rational, acknowledging the Nation's overburdened and \novercrowded correctional facilities and the need for more community-\nbased programs for first-time or non-violent offenders.\n  Although the Federal guidelines themselves have been completed for \nmany years now, the members of the commission are tasked with ensuring \nthat the guidelines do not result in the same disparity or injustice \nthat they were designed to prevent. The guidelines perform an \ninvaluable function, one which I think Judge Pryor's background and \nexperience have made him uniquely well-suited to oversee.\n  Judge Pryor is a life-long public servant who will certainly be an \nasset to the U.S. Sentencing Commission as he represents the highest \nquality of leadership. I appreciate the support of my colleagues in \nJudge Pryor's confirmation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4017-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4017-S4018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EQUAL PAY ACT ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I come to the floor today to recognize \nan important anniversary. Fifty years ago Congress passed the Equal Pay \nAct, a law that was to ensure pay equity for women in the workplace. \nThis landmark legislation was signed into law by President Kennedy on \nJune 10, 1963, and prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in the \npayment of wages by employers. The goals of the legislation were \ngroundbreaking. It was the first time Congress acted on this issue, \naddressing a real and growing problem as more women entered the \nworkforce. Congress stepped up to the plate and took the first attempt \nat fixing outright discrimination that was bound to have an impact on \nworking families across America.\n  Today we find ourselves in a similar place, in need of a solution \nbecause the Equal Pay Act is in need of fixing. It\n\n[[Page S4018]]\n\nrecently made big headlines when a Pew research study was released \nsaying that women are the primary earner in 4 of 10 households today, \nmany of these women being the sole earners. But what was missed in this \ndiscussion is the impact that the pay gap is continuing to have on \nthese households who are dependent on the salaries of women.\n  The pay gap results in $4,000 less per year for working families and \n$434,000 less over a lifetime. Think of what these families could \naccomplish if they got simply what they were owed. With rising costs \nfor childcare, medical care, and filling up the family car, these \nfamilies are held down by unfair and unjust pay policies.\n  While these are the day to day impacts, there are also real \nconsequences to the pay gap over a lifetime. The pay gap affects your \nincome, affects your pension, and affects your Social Security. Women's \nSocial Security benefits are 71 percent of men's benefits. The average \nincome from private pension based on women's earnings was only 48 \npercent of men's earnings. The consequences of our inaction on pay \nequity are following women out of the workplace, further impacting \ntheir lives down the line. For years I have fought a solution to this.\n  Under the Paycheck Fairness Act, no longer will employers be able to \nretaliate against workers for sharing information about wages. Right \nnow, if you ask someone what they get paid you can get fired. For \nyears, Lilly Ledbetter was humiliated and harassed because she tried to \nfind out what she was making.\n  No longer will women be able to seek only back pay when they are \ndiscriminated against. Under this pay they can seek punitive damages. \nNo longer will employers be able to use almost any reason to justify \npaying a woman less than a man. Excuses such as ``oh, they do harder \njobs,'' ``oh, they do dangerous jobs,'' or ``oh, they have a better \neducation than you'' will no longer be tolerated. Women do hard and \ndangerous jobs. Ask anyone who runs a daycare center or is a \nfirefighter. No longer will women be on their own in fighting for equal \npay for equal work or education and training.\n  In this country, they say work hard, play by the rules, and you will \nget ahead. We work hard every day, but we find the rules are different \nfor women and men. In 1963 women made 59 cents for every dollar made by \nmen. Almost 49 years later we have made an 18-cent gain. Women now make \n77 cents for every dollar earned by men. Forty-nine years and 18 cents. \nThat is not rewarding hard work, and it is certainly not playing by the \nrules.\n  In March, during the Budget debate, the Senate agreed with us and \nunanimously voted that it was time to do something about the pay gap. \nWell, now it is time to step up to the plate on this 50th anniversary. \nLet's end pay inequity and end the policies that keep women uneducated \nand unequipped to fight for their fair share. It is not just for our \npocketbooks. It is about the family checkbooks and getting it right in \nthe law books. And it is also about the generations of women to come. \nLet's not make it another 50 years without giving the Equal Pay Act the \ntools it needs to finally fulfill its promise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4018-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Medic Specialist Cody Towse\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to one of \nUtah's great soldiers, Army Medic Cody Towse who was killed by an \nimprovised explosive device in Afghanistan on May 14, 2013. He was \ncoming to the aid of a fellow soldier when he was hit by one of four \nblasts that day.\n  Specialist Towse was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 41st Infantry \nRegiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division from Fort \nBliss, TX. He was deployed to the Kandahar region of Afghanistan in \nDecember 2012 and has served courageously there. While in Afghanistan, \nTowse was instrumental in training Afghan medics in emergency \nprocedures; and became known as the candy doctor because he loved to \ngive candy to the Afghan children. In fact, I think it speaks volumes \nabout the character and love of this young man when, for his 21st \nbirthday, he asked his parents to send him candy that he could give the \nchildren.\n  Specialist Towse's love for service began at an early age as he \ntrained and worked as a volunteer firefighter and EMT for Elk Ridge \nCity. He took great pride in his work and in helping others.\n  Sadly Specialist Towse's body returned home to Elk Ridge, UT last \nweek encased in a silver, flag-draped coffin met by family and hundreds \nof admirers and friends wanting to pay tribute to this fallen soldier. \nNeighbors and friends lined the streets and quietly waved flags of \nrespect, giving a special tribute to one of Utah's own.\n  Our Founding Fathers declared the United States a freedom-loving \npeople--a declaration on which they risked everything--their lives, \ntheir fortunes and their sacred honor. Throughout our Nation's history, \nour liberty and our freedoms have been protected and cherished by our \nmilitary. And so as we lay to rest this courageous hero, I pay tribute \nto Specialist Towse who has helped pave the road to freedom.\n  I love the following passage that so poignantly describes the peace \nand comfort I take from the examples and lives of our nation's \nsoldiers. It states:\n\n       They died for liberty--they died for us. They are at rest. \n     They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag they \n     rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, \n     the tearful willows, the embracing vines. They sleep beneath \n     the shadow of the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or \n     storm, each in the windowless palace of rest . . . they are \n     at peace.\n\n  I am humbled by this young man's life and sacrifice. May God bless \nhis family and all those he left behind with peace and comfort from \ntheir memories of this wonderful man and soldier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4018-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4018-S4019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING BEVERLEY TAYLOR SORENSON\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \nwonderful woman, generous philanthropist, and tireless advocate for \narts and education--Beverley Taylor Sorenson. Sadly, Utah and our \nNation lost a truly delightful and influential woman this past week as \nshe quietly passed away at the age of 89 surrounded by her loved ones.\n  I have known and worked closely with Beverley and her late husband \nJames ``Jim'' Sorenson for many years and have always admired her work \nethic, her commitment to serving others, and of course her love for and \nappreciation of the arts and the influence it can have in the lives of \nmany.\n  Her love of the arts began at an early age as she fondly remembers \nmusic always playing in her childhood home. She grew into an \naccomplished dancer and pianist; in fact she would later earn money \naccompanying dance classes in Salt Lake City to help put herself \nthrough college.\n  Perhaps it was her own childhood experiences of personal arts \neducation that later led to her passion for providing generations of \nchildren with the opportunity to learn and grow through the study of \nart and the many disciplines it entails. She witnessed firsthand the \npositive effects of arts education in many young lives and schools \nthroughout the valley and set about trying to bring it to every corner \nof our State.\n  She was the driving impetus in the creation of Art Works for Kids, a \nprogram integrating arts based concepts into traditional core education \nsubjects with wonderful results. She believed in this program greatly \nand felt that children would learn and retain more knowledge when \ncoupled with art activities.\n  Because of her tireless efforts, the Beverley Taylor Sorenson Arts \nLearning Program, BTS Program, will serve tens of thousands of students \nduring the upcoming school year at approximately 130 Utah elementary \nschools.\n  Beverley and Jim also created the Sorenson Legacy Foundation to \nsupport programs and projects that would benefit the lives of people \nthroughout the world, giving generously and supporting vigorously. \nTogether they built a lasting legacy of humanitarian service and \nphilanthropy that has benefitted thousands and will continue to help \ngenerations to come.\n  Not only did Beverley dedicate herself to community efforts, she was \na wonderful wife and mother, raising 2 sons, 6 daughters, and loving \nand mentoring 49 grandchildren and 65 great-grandchildren. She truly \nleaves behind a wonderful posterity who can build upon their mother and \ngrandmother's example of a life well lived.\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\n  The impact and contributions Beverley Taylor Sorenson made to her \nfamily, our State, and our Nation will be felt for years to come. She \nwas truly a magnificent lady who deeply cared about others and set \nabout to do good throughout her life. Elaine and I send our deepest \nsympathies to her family and hope that they will find peace and comfort \nin the memories they share of this remarkable person.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4019-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TERRY SCHOW\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary man, dedicated public servant and tireless advocate for \nour Nation's veterans--Mr. Terry Schow. Terry will be retiring after \nmore than 25 years of service to Utah's veterans.\n  Terry has been a long-time advocate, tireless worker, and public face \nfor veterans causes in our State for almost three decades, and has \nserved in top-level positions under three Utah Governors. I have had \nthe pleasure of working with Terry for many years as Utah's Senator and \nI can attest to this man's dedication and love for our Nation's \nveterans and their needs. No one has worked harder, or cared more about \nthe issues affecting veteran's lives and futures than Terry. He has \napproached so many important issues with dogged determination and \nnever, ever let up until problems have been solved.\n  Through Terry's tireless leadership three veterans homes were opened, \nand medical services in our State for veterans have greatly expanded \nand improved. He has written articles in newspapers throughout our \nState to bring attention to the issues he has worked on daily for \nveterans, and has attended literally hundreds if not thousands of \nevents in support of veterans and their sacrifices.\n  Terry has first hand knowledge of the service and sacrifices veterans \nmake for our country. He is a U.S. Army veteran who volunteered to \nserve in 1967, and served in the 5th and 10th Special Forces Groups and \nthe 25th Infantry Division in Southeast Asia. He has walked the path of \nsoldiers and has been able to personally relate to the many men and \nwomen he has served.\n  His accomplishments in Utah have not gone unnoticed. He was tapped to \nserve as the president of the National Association of State Directors \nof Veterans Affairs for a time and was able to share his wealth of \nknowledge in this prestigious position with people throughout America \nall working to help our Nation's veterans. In addition he has served on \ndozens of boards and organizations committed to veterans issues.\n  Terry was born and raised in Ogden, UT and is the proud father of two \nchildren, and grandfather to three.\n  Utah's veterans have been well served by this man. He has truly been \nan extraordinary leader of veterans affairs and I know that many will \ngreatly miss his advocacy and leadership on issues of great importance \nto this population. However, I am certain that retirement will not stop \nTerry's work and advocacy on behalf of veterans. He truly respects, and \nloves the men and women in uniform who have sacrificed so greatly for \nthe freedoms we enjoy. I want to sincerely thank Terry for his \ndedication, his commitment and his tireless service to veterans. He has \naccomplished great things and paved the way for continued success and \nassistance for Utah's beloved veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4019-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT PAUL MICHEL DEMEO\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I rise to honor the life and service \nof 1LT Paul Michel DeMeo, who died on May 14 while stationed at Fort \nBragg in North Carolina. Lieutenant DeMeo was a rifle platoon leader \nassigned to Company B, 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry \nRegiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division.\n  Born at the U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands on \nOctober 1, 1989, the son of an American physicist at the base, Paul \ngrew up around service members and knew that he wanted to join the \nmilitary from a very young age. After his family moved to Derry, NH, \nwhen he was 13 years old, Paul attended high school at Pinkerton \nAcademy, where he eventually became the school's first Air Force Junior \nReserve Officer Training Corps participant to attend a military \nacademy.\n  Paul completed his undergraduate education at West Point in 2011 and \nwent on to graduate from the infantry officer leadership basic course, \nthe U.S. Army Ranger School, and the U.S. Army Airborne School. As a \nrifle platoon leader, Paul was responsible for training, material \nsupport, and readiness of 38 paratroopers. He was awarded a number of \nhonors for his service, including the Army Commendation Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Air Assault Badge, the Parachutist \nBadge, and the Ranger Tab.\n  Paul was an avid swimmer who joined the swim team in Kwajalein at the \nage of 4. He also showed tremendous promise on the tennis court at a \nvery early age. In fact, when he was only 8 years old, the Government \nof the Republic of the Marshall Islands invited him to represent the \ncountry in tennis at the 2000 Olympic games. However, Paul wisely \ndeclined the offer, considering himself just a bit too young for the \ncompetition.\n  Paul will be remembered for his exceptional leadership ability, his \nconfident smile, and his strong loyalty to his fellow soldiers, \nespecially paratroopers under his command. Paul dedicated his life to \nthe service and protection of our country. He worked to make himself \nthe best he could be and to answer the call of duty to defend our way \nof life. For this, we are forever grateful.\n  Paul is survived by his parents, Paul and Lucienne DeMeo; his \nbrothers, Nathen A. and Pascal J. DeMeo; his sister, Danya Aleesa \nDeMeo; and his maternal grandmother, Amonia Valbrun. He also leaves \nbehind his girlfriend, Hannah Farmer of Charlotte, NC and his paternal \ngrandfather, Paul J. DeMeo. I ask my colleagues and all Americans to \njoin me in honoring the life and service of Lieutenant Paul Michel \nDeMeo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4019-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4019-S4020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, on Thursday morning, the \nSenate took cloture votes in relation to motions to proceed to S. 953 \nand S. 1003, which represent a Democratic and Republican proposal, \nrespectively, to address the interest rate offered on subsidized \nFederal Stafford loans, a form of Federal student loan available to \nmany who are pursuing a postsecondary education. I was unable to be \npresent for these votes, due to a prescheduled commitment; before the \ntiming of these votes was envisioned, my attendance was confirmed at a \nwomen's conference. Because my presence would not have changed the \noutcome of either vote, I honored my previous commitment. Had I been \npresent I would have voted in support of S. 953 and opposed S. 1003.\n  In my State, over 150,000 students will borrow subsidized Stafford \nloans next school year. These are need-based loans given to kids who \nhave studied hard and families who have made financial sacrifices and \nplan to borrow what they need to cover the rising costs of higher \neducation. Rather than reward their efforts, the government plans to \nadd to their burden unless action is taken. On July 1, the interest \nrate on new subsidized Stafford student loans is scheduled to double \nfrom 3.4 to 6.8 percent.\n  We are facing a crisis. Already, officials at the Federal Reserve, \nthe Department of the Treasury, and the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau have all warned that student borrowing threatens to dampen \nconsumption, depress the economy, limit credit creation, and pose a \nthreat to our Nation's financial stability. Students and graduates in \nmy State are already heavily in student loan debt. Two out of every \nthree Missouri students will leave college with student loan debt. If \nwe fail to take action, students with subsidized Stafford loans will \nhave to pay over $1,000 more than they would under current interest \nrates on their loans. At a time when a higher education is vital to \nexpanded opportunity for so many young people and with a 21st century \neconomy that increasingly demands workers with the skills learned as \npart of a college education, we cannot be making it even more difficult \nfor young people to financially achieve a college education. We need to \nact.\n  There are several proposals to address this impending crisis. I am a\n\n[[Page S4020]]\n\nproud cosponsor of two bills that would provide needed relief and give \nCongress the opportunity to address a long-term solution to exploding \nstudent loan debt when it reauthorizes the Higher Education Act.\n  The first, S. 953, the Student Loan Affordability Act, introduced by \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island, would lock in the current 3.4% rate for \nsubsidized Stafford loans for 2 years while Congress works on a long-\nterm solution to slow the rapid accumulation of student loan debt. This \nbill would be fully paid for by closing tax loopholes enjoyed by \ncompanies that move American jobs offshore, big oil companies, and the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  I am also a cosponsor of Senator Warren's Bank on Students Loan \nFairness Act which would give students the same deal we give to the big \nbanks by allowing those who are eligible for subsidized Stafford loans \nto borrow at the same rate offered to banks through the Federal Reserve \ndiscount window. This is commonsense, and it is fair.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe \nthe solution to this current uncertainty is even more uncertainty. \nTheir solution, S. 1003, would produce variable, uncapped interest \nrates that would hit low-income students the hardest.\n  Today's votes leave us in the same situation we were in: we need to \nact to prevent student loan interest rate increases that would \nadditionally burden our students. I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve meaningful legislation \nthat preserves the availability of student loans and the economic \nopportunities they afford as an option for future generations of \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4020-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE CALENDAR OBJECTION\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I rise to express my intent \nto sustain my objection to the nomination of Lt. Gen. Susan Helms to be \ndeputy commander of U.S. Space Command, Calendar No. 70. I have met \nwith Lieutenant General Helms and discussed my objection with leaders \nin the Air Force and my colleagues here in the Senate.\n  Lieutenant General Helms has a record of more than 30 years of \ndistinguished military service, in which she became the first American \nmilitary woman in space, among other significant achievements. Her \ncareer is to be celebrated. However, I continue to have deep concerns \nwith Lieutenant General Helms' decision, while a commander and courts-\nmartial convening authority, to overturn the jury verdict of a military \ncourt-martial in which the jury found an Air Force officer guilty of \nsexual assault. She made this decision against the advice of her staff \njudge advocate.\n  With her action, Lieutenant General Helms sent a damaging message to \nsurvivors of sexual assault who are seeking justice in the military \njustice system: They can take the difficult and painful step of \nreporting the crime, they can endure the agony involved in being \nsubjected to intense questioning often aimed at putting the blame on \nthem, and they can experience a momentary sense of justice in knowing \nthat they were believed when their attacker is convicted and sentenced, \nonly to have that justice ripped away with the stroke of a pen by an \nindividual who was never in the courtroom for the trial and who never \nheard the testimony. In overturning the conviction in this case, \nLieutenant General Helms supplanted her opinion for that of a jury, the \nappropriate adjudicators of fact who observe an entire court-martial \nproceeding. And she did not take the advice of her staff judge \nadvocate, who recommended she affirm the conviction in this case. At a \ntime when the military is facing a crisis of sexual assault, making a \ndecision that sends a message which dissuades reporting of sexual \nassaults, supplants the finding of a jury, contradicts the advice of \ncounsel, and further victimizes a survivor of sexual assault is \nunacceptable.\n  Given these circumstances, I will continue to object to any unanimous \nconsent request to approve Lieutenant General Helms' nomination. I will \ncontinue to give great scrutiny to any future nomination of any member \nof the armed services who has, while serving in his or her capacity as \na convening authority of a military court-martial, overturned a jury \nconviction against the advice of legal counsel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4020-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALAN CAMERON\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding work of Alan Cameron, who is retiring from serving as \npresident and chief executive officer of the Idaho Credit Union League.\n  Alan has skillfully led the Idaho Credit Union League since 2000. \nPrior to serving as president and CEO for the Idaho Credit Union League \nand its wholly owned subsidiary League Services, Inc., he devoted more \nthan 20 years to serving as the league's retained legal counsel and \nlobbyist. Before joining the Idaho Credit Union League, he graduated \nfrom the University of Idaho's College of Law, served as deputy \nprosecuting attorney with the Ada County Prosecuting Attorney's Office, \nand had a private practice.\n  Alan has given considerable time as an indispensable part of the \ncommunity and represented the interests of Idahoans at the State and \nnational levels. This includes his service on committees and task \nforces for the Credit Union National Association and his service as a \nmember of the Federal Reserve Board's Consumer Advisory Council. He \nalso served as treasurer of the Hispanic Financial Education Coalition, \ntreasurer of the Consumer Information Council, and as a board member \nfor the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Idaho. We are fortunate \nto count Alan as a fellow Idahoan.\n  Throughout his career, Alan has been a widely respected and \nthoughtful leader. I have greatly valued his input and advocacy on \nbehalf of Idaho's credit unions as we have worked together over the \nyears. I especially appreciated the considerable amount of input and \nhard work that Alan invested into helping me craft and move my \nregulatory relief legislation. The Idaho Credit Union's release about \nhis retirement included a fitting recognition of Alan's exemplary work:\n\n       The League's Board and staff have thrived under Cameron's \n     leadership. His passion for credit unions and their members \n     have been a beacon during a time of increasing regulatory \n     burden and financial upheaval. He is a trusted friend and \n     voice of reason to state government, business owners, \n     regulators and credit union leaders.\n\n  Thank you, Alan, for your remarkable service to Idaho and our Nation. \nI hope that your retirement will provide you with well-earned time to \ntravel with your wife Janet and many good times with your family and \nfriends. Congratulations on your retirement.

The school--one of 12 \npublic universities in Florida--is second in size only to Arizona \nState.\n  It is educating nearly 60,000 undergraduate and graduate students \nthis year from all around the world at what is now a sprawling campus \nlocated in Orlando, FL. Throughout the years, UCF has increasingly \nbecome an integral part of the Sunshine State--and a nationally \nrecognized hub for research.\n  Located adjacent to the university is Central Florida's Research \nPark--a 1,000-acre, high-tech complex that fosters innovation through \nits collaboration of UCF students, private-sector researchers and \ngovernment agencies all working together in the same location. Together \nthese researchers and students are working on projects in the sciences, \nengineering, photonics and optics, as well as a variety of health-\nrelated fields.\n  The facilities they use also are home to some of the most state-of-\nthe-art modeling and simulation equipment in the country.\n  Just 2 months ago, NASA awarded UCF a $55 million grant to build a \nsatellite that will enhance our ability to study the Earth's \natmosphere.\n  Not only is this award the largest grant in UCF's history, it also \nmakes it\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\nthe first university in Florida to lead a NASA mission--which is a \nfitting honor for a university located in the shadow of Kennedy Space \nCenter.\n  It was President Kennedy's historic call for a manned mission to the \nmoon that prompted the Florida Legislature to authorize the creation of \nFlorida Technological University--the original name of UCF--in 1963. \nFive years later, NASA awarded UCF its first research grant. And, as \nevidenced by this most recent one, the partnership continues to this \nday.\n  So, I want to congratulate the University of Central Florida for the \ntremendous progress it has made in its first five decades.\n  I have no doubt the university will continue to build on its many \nsuccesses for many decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4021-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4021-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4021-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:50 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S4021, June 7, 2013, in the first column, under the \nheading MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE, the following appears: At 9:50 \na.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe House:\n  \n  The Record has been corrected to read: At 9:50 a.m., a message \nfrom the House of Representatives, delivered by Mrs. Cole, one of \nits reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the \nfollowing bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n       H.R. 2217.

A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to better enable State child welfare agencies to prevent sex \ntrafficking of children and serve the needs of children who are victims \nof sex trafficking, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senators \nPortman, Blumenthal, Cantwell, Brown, and Kirk to introduce the Child \nSex Trafficking Data and Response Act of 2013. This bipartisan \nlegislation will help us to better understand and combat the \nunforgivable and fast-growing criminal enterprise of trafficking \nchildren for sex right here in the U.S.\n  We cannot bury our heads in the sand and ignore this terrible \nproblem. Child victims of sex trafficking need and deserve the full \nrange of coordinated assistance and care required to help them recover \nfrom this trauma.\n  Unfortunately, some people still refuse to acknowledge that American \nchildren are being bought and sold for sex and they criticize the few \nestimates surrounding trafficking rates that do exist. As a \npolicymaker, it is hard to advance an issue when there are critics who \ndeny its very existence. For those of us who have spoken to law \nenforcement officers, child welfare workers\n\n[[Page S4023]]\n\nand judges who work with these victims every day, we know that denying \nthat the problem exists will not make it go away.\n  I became engaged in efforts to address child trafficking a few years \nago when I had the opportunity to accompany police officers along 82nd \nAvenue in my hometown of Portland. I will never forget a 15-year-old \ngirl working out there with the tools of the trade--a cell phone to \nstay in constant contact with her pimp and report how much money she \nhad made; a 15-inch butcher knife to try to protect herself; and, a \npurse full of condoms.\n  This problem does exist, but we still do not know its full scope--we \ndo not know how many children in the U.S. are victimized by pimps, \nJohns and traffickers every year. Quantifying the problem, as simple a \nstep as that may seem, is truly is the first step in bringing these \nchildren out of the shadows to help them progress from victims to \nsurvivors.\n  The Child Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act of 2013 provides a \nframework for systematically identifying and tracking the number of \nchild trafficking victims who are in our Nation's foster care system. \nIt would further require child welfare agencies to promptly report \ninformation on missing and abducted children to law enforcement and \nwould require law enforcement authorities to notify the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, when a child is missing from \nState care.\n  The bill would also take steps to ensure children who are sex \ntrafficked or exploited are treated as victims, not criminals. The \nprotections, services and protocols established for abused and \nneglected children within the child welfare system are rarely extended \nto trafficked children and youth, and in most States, such children \naren't even categorized as victims. Instead, they are often sent to the \njuvenile justice system and criminalized for being raped and \ntrafficked.\n  The Child Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act would amend Federal \nlaw to say all child victims of sex trafficking are victims of abuse \nand neglect. It would require state plans, under the Child Abuse \nPrevention and Treatment Act, designed to improve child protection \nservices contain: provisions and procedures requiring identification \nand assessment of all reports involving children known or suspected to \nbe victims of sex trafficking; provisions and procedures for training \nchild protective services workers to identify and provide comprehensive \nservices for children who are victims of sex trafficking; a description \nof efforts to coordinate with State law enforcement, juvenile justice, \nand social service agencies such as runaway and homeless youth shelters \nto serve these victims; and an annual State data report on the number \nof children identified as known or suspected to be victims of \ntrafficking.\n  These steps alone will not solve the problem before us. These are \nstill some very daunting problems that need to be overcome, and the \ncurrent fiscal climate alone presents a significant barrier to \nproviding resources needed by victims, child welfare workers, law \nenforcement and service providers. Still, this is an important step \ntoward making sure that vulnerable foster children are protected from \npimps, Johns and traffickers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 1119. A bill to amend the Public Health Services Act to provide \nfor integration of mental health services and mental health treatment \noutreach teams, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague \nfrom Maryland, Senator Mikulski, in introducing the Positive Aging Act \nof 2013, which will help to increase older Americans' access to quality \nmental health screening and treatment services in community-based \nsettings.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important \nfor States like Maine that have a disproportionate number of older \npersons. Sixteen percent of Maine's population is 65 or older, and, \nwith the highest median age, Maine is the ``oldest'' State in the \nNation. Moreover, our percentage of older adults is increasing; by \n2030, more than one in five Mainers will be over the age of 65.\n  One of the most daunting public health challenges facing our Nation \ntoday is how to increase access to quality mental health services for \nthe more than 46 million American adults living with severe, disabling \nmental disorders that can devastate their lives and the lives of the \npeople around them.\n  What is often overlooked is the prevalence of mental illness among \nour Nation's elderly. Nearly one in five older adults in America have \none or more mental health conditions. Moreover, older white males age \n85 and older have the highest rate of suicide of any group in the \ncountry. Particularly disturbing is the fact that the mental health \nneeds of older Americans are often overlooked or not recognized because \nof the mistaken belief that they are a normal part of aging and \ntherefore cannot be treated.\n  While effective treatments exist for mental health disorders, it is \nestimated that nearly two-thirds of older adults with a mental health \nproblem do not receive the services they need. Older adults with \nevidence of a mental disorder are generally less likely than younger \nand middle-aged adults to receive mental health services and, when they \ndo, they are less likely to receive care from a mental health \nspecialist. Failure to treat mental disorders leads to poorer health \noutcomes for other medical conditions, higher rates of \ninstitutionalization, and increased health care costs.\n  Fortunately, important research is being done that is developing \ninnovative approaches to improve the delivery of mental health care for \nolder adults by integrating it into primary care settings. This \nresearch demonstrates that older adults are more likely to receive \nappropriate mental health care if there is a mental health professional \non the primary care team, rather than simply referring them to a mental \nhealth specialist outside the primary care setting. Multiple \nappointments with multiple providers in multiple settings simply don't \nwork for older patients who must also cope with concurrent chronic \nillnesses, mobility problems, and limited transportation options. The \nresearch also shows that there is less stigma associated with \npsychiatric services when they are integrated into general medical \ncare.\n  The Positive Aging Act builds upon this research and authorizes \nfunding for projects that integrate mental health screening and \ntreatment services into community sites and primary care settings. \nSpecifically, the Positive Aging Act of 2013 would authorize the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to fund \ndemonstration projects to support integration of mental health services \nin primary care settings. It would also support grants for community-\nbased mental health treatment outreach teams to fund demonstration \nprojects to support integration of mental health services in primary \ncare settings. To ensure that these geriatric mental health programs \nhave proper attention and oversight, it would mandate the designation \nof a Deputy Director for Older Adult Mental Health Services in the \nCenter for Mental Health Services, and it would also include \nrepresentatives of older Americans or their families and geriatric \nmental health professionals on the Advisory Council for the Center for \nMental Health Services. Finally, it would require State plans under \nCommunity Mental Health Services Block Grants to include descriptions \nof the States' outreach to and services for older individuals.\n  We are fortunate today to have a variety of effective treatments to \naddress the mental health needs of American seniors. The Positive Aging \nAct will help to ensure that older Americans have access to these \nimportant services. I therefore urge my colleagues to sign on as \ncosponsors of the legislation, which has been endorsed by numerous \nmental health, aging, and health care organizations, including the \nAmerican Psychological Association, the American Association for \nGeriatric Psychiatry, the American Geriatrics Society, and the National \nAssociation of Social Workers.\n\n[[Page S4024]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4024-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 163--CALLING FOR MORE ACCOUNTABLE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE \n                              FOR CAMBODIA\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Rubio) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 163\n\n       Whereas, according to the United States Agency for \n     International Development, from 1993 to 2011 the United \n     States provided Cambodia with over $1,247,000,000 in economic \n     and military assistance;\n       Whereas Cambodia is ranked 138 (out of 187) in the United \n     Nations Development Program's Human Development Report 2013, \n     a rank shared by the Lao People's Democratic Republic;\n       Whereas Cambodia is ranked 157 (out of 174) in Transparency \n     International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2012, a rank \n     below Yemen and one shared with Angola and Tajikistan;\n       Whereas Cambodia is ranked ``Not Free'' in Freedom House's \n     Freedom in the World 2013 report, which further states, \n     ``Cambodia is not an electoral democracy. Elections are \n     conducted under often repressive conditions, and the \n     opposition is hampered by serious legal and physical \n     harassment.'';\n       Whereas the Department of State's Country Reports on Human \n     Rights Practices for 2011 notes that ``a leading human rights \n     problem'' in Cambodia is ``a weak judiciary. . .subject to \n     corruption and political influence'';\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch noted in a May 31, 2012, New \n     York Times op-ed that Prime Minister Hun Sen has remained in \n     power in Cambodia for 10,000 days ``through politically \n     motivated violence, control of the security forces, massive \n     corruption, and the tacit support of foreign powers'';\n       Whereas the July 16, 2012, Report of the United Nations \n     Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in \n     Cambodia (A/HRC/21/63) notes that ``there are major flaws in \n     the administration of elections in Cambodia and urgent and \n     long-term reforms are needed to give Cambodians confidence in \n     the electoral process and in the workings of the National \n     Election Committee'';\n       Whereas the July 16, 2012, report includes 18 specific \n     recommendations for improving the election framework and \n     environment in Cambodia to ensure greater transparency, \n     accountability, and political association and expression, \n     including the full participation of opposition leader Sam \n     Rainsy in upcoming parliamentary elections; and\n       Whereas Sam Rainsy and other opposition members and \n     activists continue to be the target of official harassment \n     through politically motivated accusations and charges, denied \n     due process of law, and excluded from participating in \n     upcoming national elections in Cambodia: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) in order to be considered credible and competitive, the \n     July 2013 parliamentary elections in Cambodia must implement \n     the recommendations contained in the July 16, 2012, Report of \n     the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of \n     human rights in Cambodia (A/HRC/21/63), and must include the \n     full and unfettered participation of all political parties \n     leaders, specifically Sam Rainsy;\n       (2) the United States Department of State and the United \n     States Agency for International Development should refrain \n     from supporting national or local elections in Cambodia, or \n     deploying election monitors to the July 2013 parliamentary \n     elections, if such United Nations recommendations are \n     ignored, and if political parties and opposition leaders are \n     excluded or otherwise hampered from fully and freely \n     participating in electoral processes, including during the \n     campaign period and on election day;\n       (3) any election in Cambodia that the Secretary of State \n     determines is not credible and competitive should be deemed \n     as an illegitimate expression of the Cambodian peoples' will, \n     and an impediment to the democratic development of Cambodia; \n     and\n       (4) a Cambodian government formed as a result of such \n     illegitimate elections should not be eligible for direct \n     United States Government assistance, including for the \n     military and police, and the Department of State and United \n     States Agency for International Development should jointly \n     reassess and reduce assistance for Cambodia in subsequent \n     fiscal years, and urge international financial institutions \n     to do the same.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the resolution I submit today with my \ncolleague from Florida is straight forward. Credible and competitive \nparliamentary elections in Cambodia next month will be the measure or \nU.S. foreign assistance provided to the central government of that \ncountry in the future.\n  According to the United States Agency for International Development, \nfrom 1993 to 2011 the United States provided Cambodia with over $1.2 \nbillion in economic and military assistance. The President's fiscal \nyear 2014 budget request to Congress includes a total of $73.5 million \nin aid for Cambodia. America's investment in that Southeast Asian \ncountry has been anything but insignificant.\n  Unfortunately, we are not getting a return on this investment when it \ncomes to the advancement of the rule of law, democracy, and human \nrights. A chorus of concern with the upcoming elections has been \nexpressed by the United Nations, Cambodian civil society, and \nopposition political party leaders, including Sam Rainsy who is \nprohibited from participating in the polls by the actions of courts \ncontrolled by the ruling Cambodian People's Party, CPP. Given recent \ncomments by CPP Prime Minister Hun Sen that he intends to remain in \npower until 2026, one wonders whether the CPP has already decided the \noutcome of the elections.\n  Less than credible and competitive polls subverts the will of the \nCambodian people and perpetuates a level of corruption that ranks that \ncountry below Yemen in Transparency International's Corruption \nPerception Index, 2012. Equally troubling, Hun Sen's close ties with \nBeijing may further draw Cambodia into the People's Republic of China's \nsphere of influence--to the determinant of security and stability in \nthe region.\n  I encourage the State Department to pay close attention to events in \nCambodia and embrace the actions called for by this resolution should \nillegitimate elections be held next month. For many Asia-watchers, the \nresponse of the administration to these elections will help define the \nproposed United States pivot toward Asia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/07/senate-section/article/S4024-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n          COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.
