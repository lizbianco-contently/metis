Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Noah Bryson Mamet, of \nCalifornia, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the \nUnited States of America to the Argentine Republic; and Colleen Bradley \nBell, of California, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary \nof the United States of America to Hungary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                            Bell Nomination\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I don't usually object to the appointments \nand nominations by the administration to various ambassadorial \npositions around the world. I also understand there are numbers of \npolitical supporters, financial supporters, and that this is \ncharacteristic of Republican and Democratic administrations alike. It \nhas never disturbed me when I have observed nominees to a Caribbean \ncountry or maybe to London or Paris or Berlin being rewarded for \nsupport both financial and otherwise. But now we are at a point where, \naccording to the Washington Post, modern Presidents have generally \nfollowed a 70-30 rule on ambassadorial appointments--where 70 percent \nare career foreign service and 30 percent are political appointees. \nPresident Obama has defied this historic bipartisan political practice, \nand in his second term a shocking 53 percent of ambassadorial nominees \nhave been political. This brings his 2-term average to 37--far more \nthan any administration in the past. What is very interesting is that \nsome of these nominees are in very sensitive positions around the \nworld. The nomination of Ms. Colleen Bell is probably the most \negregious example of that.\n  Hungary is a close ally--in many respects--but there is no doubt that \nsince taking office in 2010 the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr. Viktor \nOrban, has centralized power, has faced scrutiny due to actions that \ncritics charge are inconsistent with democratic principles and \npractices. His government has reduced the independence of Hungary's \ncourts, pushed through controversial changes to the constitution, and \nplaced acute restrictions on nongovernmental organizations. In other \nwords, this is a very important country. This is a very important \ncountry where bad things are going on.\n  Ms. Bell's experiences have been largely relegated to producing the \ntelevision soap opera ``The Bold and the Beautiful.'' Now, I am sure \ntelevision viewing is important in Hungary, but the fact is this \nnominee is totally unqualified for this position in this country.\n  Now, if it were, as I say, some Caribbean country or some other, I \nwould understand that. But here we are in a relationship with a country \nwhere, according to Bloomberg News, ``Orban says he seeks to end \nliberal democracy in Hungary. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban \nsaid he wants to abandon liberal democracy in favor of an `illiberal \nstate,' citing Russia and Turkey as examples.''\n  By the way, we have an excellent DCM there in Hungary who has been \ndoing a great job.\n  Ms. Bell has two qualifications. One is she is a producer of a \ntelevision soap opera. She has no experience in foreign policy or \nnational security, no familiarity with the language, country, or the \nregion, has never been there, and lacks meaningful knowledge of history \nor economics. Her only significant qualification is that she bundled, \nas the word is used, $800,000 to President Obama in the last election, \nand as part of the California delegation to the 2012 Democratic \nconvention, she bundled more than $2.1 million for President Obama's \nreelection effort.\n  I want to repeat again that I understand there are awards for \npolitical support and it has grown with ``bundling.'' But when we send \na person who doesn't know the language--has never been to the country, \nhas no familiarity in foreign policy or national security--to a nation \nof this importance, then, my friends, we are making a serious mistake.\n  The Hungarian Prime Minister is distancing himself from the values \nshared by most European Union nations. Orban said civil society \norganizers receiving funding from abroad needed to be ``monitored,'' as \nhe considered those to be agents of foreign powers. We are talking \nabout the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic \nInstitute, Freedom House, and others.\n  He said:\n\n       We're not dealing with civil society members but paid \n     political activists who are trying to help foreign interests \n     here.\n\n  Amazing. Orban, who has fueled employment with public works projects, \nsaid he wants to replace welfare societies with a workfare state. But \nthe main problem is that Mr. Orban is cozying up to Vladimir Putin. He \nhas now entered into a nuclear deal, and he is practicing the same \nkinds of antidemocratic practices as what seems to be his role model--\nVladimir Putin.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to Mr. Reid from \nthe 15 former presidents of the American Foreign Service Association be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 6, 2014.\n       Dear Senator Reid, Among the nominees for ambassadorships \n     currently under consideration by the Senate, three have \n     generated considerable public controversy: George Tsunis \n     (Norway), Colleen Bell (Hungary), and Noah Mamet (Argentina). \n     The nominations of Mr. Tsunis and Ms. Bell have been \n     forwarded to the full Senate by the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee.\n       As former presidents of the American Foreign Service \n     Association, the professional association and trade union of \n     career members of the Foreign Service, we urge you to oppose \n     granting Senate consent to these three candidates. Although \n     we have no reason to doubt that the nominees are \n     conscientious and worthy Americans, the fact that they appear \n     to have been chosen on the basis of their service in raising \n     money for electoral campaigns, with minimal demonstrated \n     qualifications for their posts, has subjected them to \n     widespread public ridicule, not only in the U.S. but also \n     abroad. As a result, their effectiveness as U.S. \n     representatives in their host countries would be severely \n     impaired from the start. Their nominations also convey a \n     disrespectful message, that relations with the host country \n     are not significant enough to demand a chief of mission with \n     relevant expertise.\n       These three nominations represent a continuation of an \n     increasingly unsavory and unwise practice by both parties. In \n     the words of President Theodore Roosevelt, ``The spoils or \n     patronage theory is that public office is primarily designed \n     for partisan plunder.'' Sadly it has persisted, even after \n     President Nixon's acknowledged rewarding of ambassadorial \n     nominations to major campaign donors was exposed. Recognizing \n     that the practice was inconsistent with democratic \n     principles, the U.S. Congress in the Foreign Service Act of \n     1980 set the following guidelines:\n\n\n             SEC. 304. APPOINTMENT OF CHIEFS OF MISSION.--\n\n       (a)(1)An individual appointed or assigned to be a chief of \n     mission should possess clearly demonstrated competence to \n     perform the duties of a chief of mission, including, to the \n     maximum extent practicable, a useful knowledge of the \n     principal language or dialect of the country in which the \n     individual is to serve, and knowledge and understanding of \n     the history, the culture, the economic and political \n     institutions, and the interests of that country and its \n     people.\n       (2) Given the qualifications specified in paragraph (1), \n     positions as chief of mission should normally be accorded to \n     career members of the Service, though circumstances will \n     warrant appointments from time to time of qualified \n     individuals who are not career members of the Service.\n\n[[Page S6241]]\n\n       (3) Contributions to political campaigns should not be a \n     factor in the appointment of an individual as a chief of \n     mission.\n       (4) The President shall provide the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate, with each nomination for an \n     appointment as a chief of mission, a report on the \n     demonstrated competence of that nominee to perform the duties \n     of the position in which he or she is to serve.\n       (b)( 1) In order to assist the President in selecting \n     qualified candidates for appointment or assignment as chiefs \n     of mission, the Secretary of State shall from time to time \n     furnish the President with the names of career members of the \n     Service who are qualified to serve as chiefs of mission, \n     together with pertinent information about such members.\n       (2) Each individual nominated by the President to be a \n     chief of mission, ambassador at large, or minister shall, at \n     the time of nomination, file with the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives a report of contributions made by such \n     individual and by members of his or her immediate family \n     during the period beginning on the first day of the fourth \n     calendar year preceding the calendar year of the nomination \n     and ending on the date of the nomination. The report shall be \n     verified by the oath of the nominee, taken before any \n     individual authorized to administer oaths. The chairman of \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate shall have \n     each such report printed in the Congressional Record. As used \n     in this paragraph, the term ``contribution'' has the same \n     meaning given such term by section 301(8) of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 431(8)), and the term \n     ``immediate family'' means the spouse of the nominee, and any \n     child, parent, grandparent, brother, or sister of the nominee \n     and the spouses of any of them.\n       During his 2008 election campaign, President Obama \n     recognized the appropriateness of these guidelines, and \n     promised to respect them. The time for the Senate to begin \n     enforcing its own guidelines set forth in law for U.S. \n     diplomatic chiefs of mission is now. The nation cannot afford \n     otherwise.\n           Sincerely,\n         Fifteen former presidents of the American Foreign Service \n           Association--Marshall Adair, Thomas Boyatt, Kenneth \n           Bleakley, Theodore Eliot, Franklyn A Harris, William \n           Harrop, Dennis Hays, J. Anthony Holmes, Lars Hydle, \n           Susan Johnson, Alphonse La Porta, John Limbert, John \n           Naland, Lannon Walker, Theodore Wilkinson.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. They say:\n\n       As former presidents of the American Foreign Service \n     Association, the professional association and trade union \n     career members of the Foreign Service, we urge you to oppose \n     granting Senate consent to these three candidates . . .\n\n  They mention George Tsunis to Norway, Colleen Bell to Hungary, and \nNoah Mamet to Argentina. I think we should pay attention to these \nformer distinguished members of the diplomatic corps.\n  I urge my colleagues for once to vote against a totally unsuitable \nnominee to be Ambassador to a very critical country in a struggle that \nis going to go on for a long time, as Colonel Vladimir Putin tries to \nextend the reach of Russia and restore the old Russian Empire. We will \nbe sending a message by this appointment that it really isn't that \nimportant. I urge my colleagues to cast a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Noah Bryson Mamet, of California, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and \nPlenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Argentine \nRepublic?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

We are about to vote on a totally unqualified individual \nto be Ambassador to a nation which is very important to our national \nsecurity interests. Her qualifications are as the producer of the \ntelevision soap opera ``The Bold and the Beautiful.'' She contributed \n$800,000 to Obama in the last election and bundled more than $2.1 \nmillion for President Obama's reelection effort.\n  I am not against political appointees. I understand how the game is \nplayed, but here we are, a nation that is on the verge of ceding its \nsovereignty to a neofacist dictator--getting in bed with Vladimir \nPutin--and we are going to send the producer of ``The Bold and the \nBeautiful'' as our Ambassador.\n  I urge my colleagues to put a stop to this foolishness. I urge a \n``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, one would think this is the first time any \nPresident ever nominated someone who is a political appointee. That is \nridiculous. Just because somebody is a producer of a very popular show \ndoesn't disqualify them. It is ridiculous. I could point out people who \nhad the support of the Senator from Arizona who perhaps didn't work at \nall.\n  So let's be clear. This nominee is an intelligent woman. She knows \nhow to be successful. She will do a good job. I think she will do very \nwell in this position because I know her well. She knows how to make \nfriends. She is not angry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 4 \np.m. will be equally divided in its usual form.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture on the Adler nomination.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Very good.\n  Madam President, I wish to speak today about some of what is \nhappening here with the agenda and where we might be headed. I think it \nis important to point out that the Democrats here, after this election, \nseem to be in disarray. We have fractures emerging on the left and the \nright.\n  Senate Democrats and the President are blaming each other for the \nDemocrats' devastating election loss. The President is threatening a \nveto on a bipartisan tax extenders package that was negotiated by the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee chairman and the Senate Democratic \nleader.\n  The senior Senator from New York told an audience last week that \npassing ObamaCare was a mistake. To quote the Senator:\n\n       But unfortunately, Democrats blew the opportunity the \n     American people gave them.\n       We took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong \n     problem--health-care reform.\n       . . . it wasn't the change we were hired to make.\n\n  I could not agree more, but it is quite an admission from the third-\nranking Democrat in the Senate.\n  Back in 2009, Republicans tried to tell Democrats we should focus on \nthe economy and that any health care reform should be targeted at \nhelping those struggling to afford health care rather than upsetting \nour entire system, but Democrats refused to listen. Now it appears at \nleast some of them are wishing they had.\n  The President tried to sell the health care law as a benefit for the \nmiddle class. At a 2010 tele-town hall, he told his listeners that \n``once this reform is fully in effect, middle-class families are going \nto pay less for their health care.''\n  Unfortunately, as far too many Americans have found, the President's \nhealth care law has actually forced them to pay more. I have lost count \nof the number of letters I have gotten from constituents in South \nDakota telling me how much their health insurance has gone up since the \nso-called Affordable Care Act passed.\n  One constituent emailed me in November to tell me:\n\n       Please do something about the Affordable Care Act. Health \n     insurance is no longer affordable. In March our family health \n     insurance policy went up $150.00/month. Now [we've] received \n     notice [of] another $112.00 increase effective January 1, \n     2015, for a total monthly premium of $857.00. This is more \n     than our mortgage and we cannot afford it!!\n\n  Let me just repeat part of that last line. ``This is more than our \nmortgage.'' How are middle-class families supposed to afford what \namounts to a second mortgage payment each month? The answer of course \nis they can't.\n  The President can talk all he wants about the supposed benefits of \nhis health care law, but the fact is ObamaCare has made life worse for \nthis South Dakota family and it has made things worse for millions of \nfamilies across the United States.\n  Since ObamaCare was signed into law, family health insurance premiums \nhave risen by about $3,000. That is a strain on any family budget just \nby itself, but it is even worse when we realize that the average \nfamily's income has dropped by nearly $3,000 over the course of the \nObama Presidency.\n  On top of this, ObamaCare has forced millions of Americans off health \ninsurance plans they had and they liked. Frequently, they have been \nforced to pay more for their new plans while getting less.\n  Thanks to ObamaCare, Americans have lost access to doctors they liked \nand trusted, they have lost access to convenient hospitals and they \nhave lost access to medications and that is just the damage ObamaCare \nis doing to Americans' health care. That is not to mention the damage \nit is doing to the economy at large.\n  As the Senator from New York made clear in his comments, he thinks \nthe Democratic Party erred in passing ObamaCare because what Americans \nwanted was not health care legislation but jobs legislation, and he is \nright. But Democrats went ahead with ObamaCare anyway, and not only has \nit not helped the economy, as the President said it would, it is \nactually hurting the economy.\n  Take one small part of ObamaCare, the tax on lifesaving medical \ndevices such as pacemakers and insulin pumps. This tax has already been \nresponsible for putting thousands of Americans out of work, and it is \non track to eliminate thousands more jobs if it isn't repealed.\n  Then there is the ObamaCare 30-hour workweek rule, which is \neliminating hours and reducing wages for thousands of American workers, \nand the numerous ObamaCare regulations that are making it difficult for \nsmall businesses to hire new workers.\n  As Democrats are now realizing, ObamaCare was a big mistake. What \nDemocrats should have done, as the senior Senator from New York admits, \nwas focus on creating jobs and opportunities for middle-class families.\n  The recent Gallup poll listing the overall health of the economy as \nAmericans' top economic concern was just the latest poll in which \nAmericans have listed jobs and the economy among their main worries. \nYet Democrats have spent years ignoring the need for jobs and focusing \non their own political priorities.\n  As the senior Senator from New York said:\n\n       When Democrats focused on health care, the average middle \n     class person thought, ``the Democrats aren't paying enough \n     attention to me.''\n\n  That average middle-class person is right.\n  In a few short weeks Republicans will take over the Senate, and we \nwill be running things very differently.\n  Our first priority will be passing legislation to create jobs and \nopportunities for American workers. A significant part of that will be \nworking to undo the damage ObamaCare has done to the economy. We will \nwork to repeal the medical device tax and restore the 40-hour workweek. \nI hope Democrats will join us. I have a feeling many of them will.\n  As we have seen, opposition to these damaging ObamaCare provisions is \nnot limited to Republicans. Democrats have joined us before to attempt \nto address these issues, and I look forward to working with these same \nDemocrats and others in the new Congress.\n  As for the President, I hope he will finally admit his law is hurting \nAmericans and join us in undoing the damage. Unfortunately, his actions \nso far have not demonstrated much openness to cooperation or any sign \nthat he understands the American people are calling for a new era in \nWashington.\n  Democrats have spent the past several years focusing on the \npriorities of the far leftwing of their party instead of the American \npeople's priorities--the economy and jobs. That is what the American \npeople have been saying over and over they want their elected leaders \nto be focused on.\n  I hope the new Congress will mark the start of a new era in which \nDemocrats join Republicans to help create\n\n[[Page S6244]]\n\njobs and opportunities for Americans and remove obstacles to success. \nThe American people have waited a long time for relief. It is time for \nCongress to give it to them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                      Economic Agenda for America\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, it seems to me the American people at \nthis particular moment in our history must make a very fundamental \ndecision, and that decision is do we continue the status quo--which \nincludes a 40-year decline of our middle class and a huge and growing \ngap between the very rich and everyone else--or do we fight for a bold \nand meaningful economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, \nprotects our environment, and provides health care for every American?\n  The question of our time is whether we are prepared to take on the \nenormous economic and political power of the billionaire class or do we \ncontinue to slide into economic and political oligarchy?\n  That is the question which the American people must answer. I hope \nand expect they are prepared to answer with a resounding yes and a \ndesire to move this country in a very different direction.\n  The long-term deterioration of the middle class, accelerated by the \nWall Street crash of 2008, has not been a pretty picture. Today we have \nmore wealth and income inequality than any other major country on \nEarth, with the top 1 percent owning more wealth than the bottom 90 \npercent, with one family, the Walton family of Walmart, owning more \nwealth itself than the bottom 40 percent.\n  Today in the United States we have the highest rate of childhood \npoverty of any major country on Earth, and we are the only major \ncountry on this planet that does not guarantee health care to all \npeople as a right.\n  The United States once led the world in terms of the percentage of \nour people who graduated college, and that in a global economy is an \nenormously important issue. We can't create jobs unless we have a well-\neducated workforce. We were once in first place in terms of percentage \nof our people who graduated college. Today we are in 12th place.\n  I think, as most Americans understand, we once were the envy of the \nworld in terms of the quality of our infrastructure--our roads, \nbridges, waste water plants, water system, rail--but today, as all \nAmericans know, our physical infrastructure is literally collapsing \nbefore our eyes.\n  Real unemployment today is not 5.8 percent. That is official \nunemployment. When we include those people who have given up looking \nfor work and those people who are working part time when they want to \nwork full time, real unemployment is 11.5 percent, youth unemployment \nis 18.6 percent, and African-American youth unemployment is over 30 \npercent.\n  Today millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages. \nWhen we try to understand why the American people are angry, it is \nimportant to understand that, in inflation adjusted for dollars, the \nmedian male worker--that male worker right in the middle of the \neconomy--earned $783 less last year than he made 41 years ago, despite \nall of the increases in productivity. The median woman worker made \n$1,300 less last year than she earned in 2007. Since 1999, the median \nmiddle-class family has seen its income go down by almost $5,000 after \nadjusting for inflation, now earning less than it did 25 years ago.\n  Why are the American people angry? That is why: a huge increase in \nproductivity, all of the global economy, and yet the median family \nincome in America is $5,000 less than it was in 1999.\n  It seems clear to me that the American people must demand that \nCongress and the White House start protecting the interests of working \nfamilies and not just wealthy campaign contributors. We need Federal \nlegislation to put millions of our unemployed workers back to work, to \nraise wages, and make certain that all Americans have the health care \nand education they need for healthy and productive lives.\n  In other words, we must have a vision for the future, which talks \nabout what this Nation can become in terms of jobs, in terms of income, \nin terms of education, and in terms of health care.\n  Let me very briefly describe some of the major initiatives that I \nintend to fight for in the new Congress. There are 12 major initiatives \nwhich, if enacted, will transform the middle class of this country.\n  No. 1, we need a major investment to rebuild our crumbling \ninfrastructure--our roads, bridges, water systems, waste water plants, \nairports, railroads, schools, et cetera.\n  It has been estimated that the cost of the Bush-Cheney war in Iraq, a \nwar we should never have gotten into in the first place, will end up \ncosting us some $3 trillion. If we invested $1 trillion in rebuilding \nour crumbling infrastructure, we could create 13 million decent-paying \njobs and make this country more efficient and more productive. We need \nto invest in infrastructure, not in war.\n  No. 2, the United States must lead the world in reversing climate \nchange and making certain this planet is habitable for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into \nenergy efficiency and sustainable energies. When we do that--make our \ntransportation system energy efficient, make our homes more energy \nefficient, move to wind, solar, geothermal biomass--we can also create \na significant number of good-paying jobs.\n  No. 3, we need to develop new economic models to increase job \ncreation and productivity. Instead of giving huge tax breaks to \ncorporations which ship our jobs to China and other low-wage countries, \nwe need to provide assistance to workers who want to purchase their own \nbusinesses by establishing worker-owned cooperatives.\n  Study after study shows that when workers have an ownership stake in \nthe businesses in which they work, productivity goes up, absenteeism \ngoes down, and employees are much more satisfied with their jobs.\n  No. 4, union workers who are able to collectively bargain for higher \nwages and benefits earn substantially more than nonunion workers.\n  Today, corporate opposition to union organizing makes it extremely \ndifficult for workers to join a union. We need legislation which makes \nit clear that when a majority of workers sign cards in support of a \nunion, they can form that union.\n  No. 5, the current Federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a \nstarvation wage. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. No \none in this country who works 40 hours a week should live in poverty.\n  No. 6, women workers today earn 78 percent of what their male \ncounterparts earn. We need pay equity in this country--equal pay for \nequal work.\n  No. 7, since 2001 we have lost more than 60,000 factories in this \ncountry and more than 4.9 million decent-paying manufacturing jobs. We \nonce led the world in terms of our manufacturing capability. Yet in \nState after State, we have seen significant losses in manufacturing \njobs. When people walk into a store, it is harder and harder for them \nto purchase products made in the United States of America.\n  The time is now for us to end our disastrous trade policies--NAFTA, \nCAFTA, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China--because these \npolicies simply enable corporate America to shut down plants in this \ncountry and move to China and other low-wage countries.\n  We need to end the race to the bottom and to develop trade policies \nwhich protect the interests of American workers and not just \nmultinational corporations. American companies should start investing \nin this country and not simply in China and other low-wage countries.\n  No. 8, in today's highly competitive global economy, millions of \nAmericans are unable to afford the higher education they need in order \nto get good-paying jobs. About 40 or 50 years ago we had a situation in \nthis country where some of the great public universities of our \nNation--the University of California, City University of New York, and \nState colleges all over America were virtually tuition free, and \nanybody could go to those schools regardless of the income of their \nfamilies.\n  Today, for many, many families and young people the cost of higher \neducation is simply unaffordable. Either\n\n[[Page S6245]]\n\nstudents choose not to go to college because they can't afford it or \nthey come out of school deeply in debt--a debt fastened on their \nshoulders for decades.\n  Quality education in America--from child care to higher education--\nmust be affordable for all. Without a high-quality and affordable \neducational system, we will be unable to compete globally in the \ninternational economy and our standard of living will continue to \ndecline. We have to invest in education. The idea that we are laying \noff teachers is completely absurd.\n  No. 9, the function of banking--the banking system--is to facilitate \nthe flow of capital into a productive and job-creating economy. That is \nwhat banking is supposed to be. People save, people put money in banks, \nand that money goes out into the economy so that people can buy homes \nand create businesses.\n  Financial institutions cannot be an island unto themselves, standing \nas huge profit centers outside of the real productive economy. In other \nwords, banking must be a means to an end by improving society, creating \njobs, providing people with decent housing, and not simply a means by \nwhich financial institutions make more and more profit.\n  Today, six huge Wall Street financial institutions have assets \nequivalent to 61 percent of our gross domestic product. There is close \nto $10 trillion in 6 financial institutions. These institutions \nunderwrite more than one-half of the mortgages in this country and more \nthan two-thirds of the credit cards. The greed, recklessness, and \nillegal behavior of major Wall Street firms plunged this country into \nthe worst financial crisis since the 1930s, and every day when we open \nup our newspapers, we see another major banking scandal.\n  The truth of the matter is that these financial institutions on Wall \nStreet are too powerful to be reformed. They have too much money, too \nmuch wealth, too many lobbyists, and make too much in campaign \ncontributions. Our goal must be to break them up. They have too much \npower and too much wealth. They must be broken up so that our financial \ninstitutions begin to serve the needs of the American people and not \nsimply the CEOs and the stockholders of Wall Street firms.\n\n  No. 10, the United States must join the rest of the industrialized \nworld and recognize that health care is a right of all and not a \nprivilege. I think many Americans don't know that we are the only major \ncountry on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a \nright. Yet, within this dysfunctional health care system, we have 40 \nmillion people who have no health insurance, more people who are \nunderinsured, millions of people with high premiums and high \ndeductibles, and at the end of all of that, we end up spending almost \ntwice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other \nmajor country on Earth.\n  The time is now for us to declare that health care is a right of all \npeople and not a privilege. We need to pass a Medicare-for-all, single-\npayer system.\n  No. 11, millions of senior citizens in this country live in poverty, \nand we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country \non Earth.\n  I hear a lot of discussion on the part of my Republican colleagues--\nand some Democrats--that we should be cutting Social Security. Well, I \nstrongly disagree. In my view, we must strengthen and expand Social \nSecurity--not cut it. That is terribly important, especially at a time \nwhen more and more seniors are slipping into poverty. We have millions \nof seniors who are trying to survive on $12,000, $13,000 and $14,000 a \nyear. They have to decide every single day whether they should buy the \nmedicine they need, heat their homes adequately or buy the food they \nneed. We should not be cutting these programs; we should be expanding \nthese programs.\n  No. 12--and the last point I will make as part of an agenda that \nrebuilds America and rebuilds our middle class--at a time of massive \nwealth and income inequality, we need a progressive tax system in this \ncountry which is based on ability to pay. It is not acceptable that \nevery single year we have major, profitable corporations which pay \nnothing in Federal income taxes. It is not acceptable that we have \ncorporate CEOs in this country who make millions of dollars every year \nand enjoy an effective tax rate which is lower than that of their \nsecretaries. That is grotesquely unfair, and it must be changed.\n  Further, we have to address the disgrace that every single year our \ncountry loses over $100 billion in revenue because corporations and the \nwealthy stash their money in offshore tax havens all over the world. \nThe time is long overdue for real tax reform which says to the wealthy \nand large, profitable corporations that they have to begin paying their \nfair share of taxes.\n  I will conclude by getting back to the point I made in the beginning \nof my remarks, and that is that we are in a pivotal moment in American \nhistory. The very, very rich are becoming richer, the middle class is \ndisappearing, and today we have more people living in poverty than at \nalmost any other time in American history. With the wealth of the \nbillionaire class, they are exercising their power politically because \nCitizens United--a disastrous Supreme Court decision--has given them \nthe power to buy elections and control, to a significant degree, our \npolitical process.\n  We, as a nation, have to ultimately make a decision about whether we \nare going to continue the process where the middle class continues to \ndecline and the very, very richest people become richer or whether we \nare prepared--and this is not easy stuff--to stand together to take on \nthe billionaire class and their greed and to say: Enough is enough. \nThis country does not just belong to the top 1 percent or the top one-\ntenth of 1 percent. It belongs to all of us.\n  I hope very much that the American people make the right choice, \nbecause if they do, we can bring about a transformation of this country \nso the government begins to work for all of the people and not just the \nbillionaires who are on top.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/02/senate-section/article/S6245-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ADLER TO BE A COMMISSIONER OF THE CONSUMER \n                  PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will take just about a minute. I know \nwe are waiting for others to come. I have heard some of the discussion \non the floor and in the hallways about Thanksgiving. On Thursday, when \nI sat down with my family over Thanksgiving dinner, I thought about our \nhistory and how my grandparents came to Vermont from Italy, my great-\ngrandparents from Ireland, and my wife's family from the Province of \nQuebec in Canada. We, similar to most Americans, are a family of \nimmigrants. It is that rich melting-pot history that makes our country \nso special, so strong. Thanksgiving is a good time to celebrate and \nhonor that strength.\n  Far too many immigrant families today, however, live in fear--fear of \nbeing torn apart, of losing a mother or father or sister or brother, to \ndeportation. Bringing peace to those families is one of the things that \nmost motivated me last year during the long debate on immigration \nreform. Both Democrats and Republicans in this Chamber praised the fair \nand thorough process that we had in the Judiciary Committee on the \nimmigration bill.\n  We had 6 hearings featuring 42 witnesses. We debated bipartisan \nlegislation a total of 37 hours over a 3-week period. We considered 212 \namendments, and we adopted 136 of them--all but 3 on a bipartisan \nbasis. The full Senate then debated the bill and approved it by an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority.\n  But that effort was not good enough for Republican leaders in the \nHouse. They would not even allow a vote on the bill. Today, they are \nbatting zero when it comes to addressing the broken immigration system.\n  They now complain that the President is acting alone, but he is not. \nThe American people support immigration\n\n[[Page S6246]]\n\nreform. That is why President Obama acted. His actions are legal, but \nthey are only a temporary fix. Congress must still act. The Republican \nHouse leadership has chosen to hold hearings attacking the President's \nactions, rather than simply stepping up and allowing a vote on a bill \nto solve the problem. Time is running out and they are wasting it on \npolitical antics. I hope that they use the remainder of this month to \ntake up and vote on the comprehensive bill we sent them more than a \nyear and a half ago.\n  I applaud the President's action to keep families together. That is \nwhy next week, the Senate Judiciary Committee will again turn to the \nissue of family unity. I have asked Astrid Silva, whose remarkable \nstory President Obama began to tell last week, to come and share the \nrest of her story and what the President's actions will mean to her \nfamily. The fact is we have done the work for an immigration bill. Why \nwon't the Republicans at least vote--vote yes or vote no. We did, and I \napplaud those Republicans and Democrats in the Senate who stood and \nvoted. Let the House act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                          Coloretti Nomination\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, I rise to urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of the nomination of Ms. Nani Coloretti to \nbe Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  The HUD Deputy Secretary is a critical component of the agency's \nmanagement team, overseeing HUD's programs that provide affordable \nrental housing, community and economic development opportunities, and \nan opportunity for creditworthy families to achieve the dream of home \nownership. I believe Ms. Coloretti has the skills and experience \nnecessary to take on this role. The full Senate Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs Committee also approved Ms. Coloretti's nomination for \nthe position on April 29, 2014, by voice vote.\n  Ms. Coloretti is currently the Assistant Secretary for Management at \nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury. During her tenure at Treasury, Ms. \nColoretti helped create a new Treasury Operations Excellence Team, \nwhich has applied lean principles developed in the private sector to \nimprove performance at Treasury. This work encompassed dozens of \nprocess improvement outcomes, saving the Department money and staff \ntime while engendering a culture of continual improvement.\n  Prior to joining the Treasury Department, Ms. Coloretti held \npositions in the San Francisco mayor's office, including budget \ndirector; the San Francisco Department of Children, Youth, and Their \nFamilies; the U.S. Office of Management and Budget; and the private \nsector. She is also a recipient of the National Public Service Award, \nthe Public Policy and International Affairs Achievement Award, and the \nFederal 100 Award.\n  In all, Ms. Coloretti would bring over 20 years of experience in \nbudget and program analysis, as well as more than 15 years of \nmanagement experience, to the position of Deputy Secretary of the \nDepartment of HUD.\n  At a time when millions of American families struggle to find \naffordable rental housing, the market continues to lock many \ncreditworthy potential borrowers out of homeownership, and HUD's State \nand local partners work to provide greater opportunities with limited \nresources, it is critical that HUD and the programs it oversees are run \nefficiently and effectively. As HUD's Deputy Secretary, Ms. Coloretti \nwould be a valuable addition to Secretary Castro's management team. I \nurge my fellow Senators to support her nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/02/senate-section/article/S6246-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6246-S6248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CHESAPEAKE BAY ACCOUNTABILITY AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2013\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     FEDERAL DUCK STAMP ACT OF 2014\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, in a moment I am going to be asking a \nunanimous consent request on some legislation that combines some work I \nhave been doing and work the ranking member of the EPW Committee, my \nfriend, the Senator from Alaska, has been doing. I want to make a brief \nstatement first and then I am going to turn the floor over to the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  I start by thanking Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member Vitter for \nworking with me on this important legislation. I also thank the \nbipartisan Virginia delegation on both sides of the Capitol, especially \nmy friend Congressman Rob Wittman. He and I have worked on this \ninitiative now for more than 4 years.\n  As we all know, the Chesapeake Bay, while located around Virginia and \nMaryland and Delaware, is actually a national treasure. It is the \ncenterpiece of the culture and economy of many coastal communities in \nVirginia and in several neighboring States.\n  Restoring the health of the Chesapeake Bay must be a national \npriority. Virginia and five other States, the District of Columbia, 10 \nFederal agencies, and more than 1,000 local governments have spent \ndecades on this shared priority.\n  We have joined together over the years in a shared commitment to the \nBay. We have worked across jurisdictional lines, across the political \naisle, across every level of government in partnership with the private \nsector and with nonprofit groups such as the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\n  This important bipartisan legislation that we are going to be moving \non shortly ensures that we maintain a Federal commitment to the \npartnership to restore the Chesapeake Bay. It also makes sure that \nduring these challenging fiscal times every dollar spent on improving \nthe health of the Bay produces real results.\n  The Chesapeake Bay accountability bill requires the U.S. Office of \nManagement and Budget to prepare a crosscut budget. That means we will \nactually track where and how Federal and State restoration dollars are \nbeing spent throughout the entire Chesapeake Bay Watershed.\n  This will allow us to track costs and match them to results. It means \nmore accountability and it means more transparency to our combined \nefforts to restore this national treasure.\n  This bipartisan legislation is an important step forward in ensuring \nthat the Chesapeake Bay restoration and preservation efforts remain \neffective, accountable, responsible, and transparent. In a moment I am \ngoing to urge all my colleagues to join us in approving it.\n  At this moment, I yield the floor to the ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I am truly honored to join my colleagues \non the floor, Senators Warner and Begich. I am pleased to support \nSenator Warner's bill that he just described and also a second bill \nSenator Begich and I have been working very diligently on that will be \npart of the unanimous consent request. That is H.R. 5069, the Federal \nDuck Stamp Act of 2014. This bipartisan legislation is a real victory \nfor sportsmen and for conservation. It is a straightforward bill that \nupdates the fee paid by duck hunters for a duck stamp for the first \ntime since 1991, and that is a big win for the hunters, it is a big win \nfor conservation because the cost of the duck stamp goes directly \ntoward conservation of waterfowl habitat. In fact, 98 cents on every $1 \ngenerated goes directly to purchase or lease wetland habitat for ducks, \nand where you have more habitat, you have more ducks and you have a \nhealthier environment. It is as simple as that.\n  I am very pleased to say our work on this bill is exactly how this \nplace and American democracy is supposed to work. I first heard about \nthis real need from duck hunters, from sportsmen who live this and \nbreathe this every day. I am an occasional hunter, but these folks \nabsolutely live it and breathe it every day and understand the critical \nneed.\n  I immediately got very involved. I reached out to allies such as \nSenator Begich, who had a great interest in it. I met with the House \nsponsor, Representative John Fleming, also from Louisiana. We met with \nthe House Natural Resources chairman, Doc Hastings. We got a strong \nversion of the\n\n[[Page S6247]]\n\nbill that passed through the House recently and that now comes to the \nSenate. Today, by this consent, we will pass that House bill through \nthe Senate and send it to the President.\n  As I said, that is the way the process is supposed to work, and this \nis a real win for hunters, for conservation, for the environment.\n  I thank my colleague and partner on this, Senator Begich, and yield \nthe floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I thank my colleague, Senator Vitter, \nfor this incredible work. For several years we have been focused on \nthis piece of legislation for two reasons; one, not only is it \nimportant for the hunters, the duck hunters, but a provision in there \nis also important for subsistence users in my State of Alaska.\n  This is an important bill. As has been mentioned, 98 cents of every \n$1 that goes into a duck stamp goes back into habitat protection for \nhunters currently and into the future.\n  Along with that, since 1934, almost $1 billion--three-quarters of a \nbillion dollars--has been spent in protecting wetland habitat, again \nfor the purpose of ensuring that we have this habitat protected not \nonly for hunters but in my case for subsistence users.\n  I agree with Senator Vitter, this is the kind of legislation we want \nto see done, where Democrats and Republicans, the House and the Senate, \nare working together. My colleague, Congressman Young, a Republican on \nthe House side from Alaska, worked on his side of the equation, working \nwith other House Members, to figure out how to move a bill. We had a \nSenate version over here we were working on. At the end of the day, it \nis not about whose name is on the bill; it is about getting the job \ndone.\n  Here we have a piece of legislation that will finally correct the \npricing on duck stamps to ensure that we keep up with inflation, to \nensure that the continued preservation of wetlands is done for our \nhunters and our sportsmen. But on top of that, for my State of Alaska, \nthis recognizes the needs of subsistence hunters. Millions of acres in \nAlaska are set aside as refuge and others are in protected status. Our \nsubsistence users live off the land--not for extra gain for their \nhousehold, but literally for food for the winter in order to survive. \nSo this allows a waiver to be put into place that will have minimal \nimpact on the duck stamp program, but will ensure that subsistence \nusers--people who live off the land in Alaska--can continue to do that \nwithout the threat of a Federal agency fining them or even dealing with \nthem in some way because they didn't have the stamp. This allows them \nto go for a waiver and ensure they will be able to do their subsistence \nhunting they have been doing for generations before the government came \nalong and locked up their land they have been hunting. And we will make \nsure this happens not only now but into the future.\n\n  Again, I wish to thank Senator Vitter for his work and his efforts \nnot only in this body but on the other side of the Capitol, working \nwith House Members to make sure we could all work together and do this \nby unanimous consent. Along with them, Senator Boxer and the EPW staff \ndid an incredible job. It is an honor to be here today.\n  The last thing I will say to Senator Warner is this: My son just had \nan opportunity to go to the bay. He did an incredible field study there \nwith some of his staff. It was a great experience. He was able to go \ninto the mud. I am not sure what that is exactly, but he was able to go \nchest deep, and then he decided not to do that, but to be there to help \npeople. But it was an incredible experience, to experience that bay, \nwhich is a national treasure. So having that bill at the same time as \nthis other one is not only good for Senator Warner's community but good \nfor this whole country. And for folks from my State who come to visit \nthis community, it is another opportunity for them to see a national \ntreasure. So it is an honor to have two pieces of legislation that will \npass by unanimous consent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his \ncomments and I will be happy to take the Senator and his whole family \nout to the bay again. I thank the Senator from Louisiana and the \nSenator from Alaska for working together. That is the way this is \nsupposed to work. There are duck hunters in Virginia as well and they \nfirmly support this legislation. I appreciate also the special \nconsiderations that need to be addressed in terms of the State of \nAlaska.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the EPW Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 1000, and the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration and the consideration of H.R. 5069, which is at \nthe desk, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bills, \nen bloc.\n  Mr. WARNER. I further ask unanimous consent that the Warner \nsubstitute amendment to S. 1000, which is at the desk, be agreed to; \nthe bills, as amended, if amended, be read a third time and passed en \nbloc; and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3965) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to, \nas follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to spend a few minutes today to \ndiscuss the ongoing saga of the 2014 tax extenders package.\n  Getting this legislation passed through the Senate has been quite an \nordeal from the outset. As my colleagues will recall, the Finance \nCommittee reported its tax extenders package in April and a few weeks \nlater progress stalled on the Senate floor when the Senate majority \nleadership refused to allow votes on any amendments.\n  After that time--which was in mid-May--the tax extenders sat somewhat \nin limbo, although both sides acknowledged the desire to get something \npassed during the lameduck session, if not before.\n  The Finance Committee extenders package, if my colleagues remember, \nextended 55 expired or expiring tax provisions for 2 years without \nmaking any of them permanent.\n  The House took a different approach which was to make certain \nimportant tax provisions, such as the R tax credit, for example, \npermanent, bringing more certainty to American businesses, families, \nand individuals.\n  Over the past several weeks, negotiations have been ongoing in the \nhopes of producing a bill that combined the Senate Finance Committee's \npackage with the approach taken by the House.\n  I am generally hesitant to publicly comment about what happens behind \nclosed doors in negotiations; but, on the other hand, much of what \nhappened next has already been printed in the media. That being the \ncase, I don't feel too awkward discussing the recent turn of events \nthat has brought us to where we are now with the tax extenders.\n  Last week, before the Thanksgiving holiday, the Speaker's office and \nthe Senate majority leader's office were very close to reaching a deal \non a tax extenders package--one that would have included all of the \nprovisions from the EXPIRE Act, which is the Senate Finance Committee-\nreported tax extenders bill, as well as a number of permanent tax \nextender provisions.\n  This emerging deal would have been a reasonable compromise between \nRepublicans and Democrats and between the House and Senate approaches \nto this matter. It was not the legislation I would have written, but as \na compromise taking place in a Congress that is, for the time being, \nstill divided, it was likely the best both parties could hope for.\n\n[[Page S6249]]\n\n  As I said, we were on the cusp of a deal last week, and then \nsomething strange happened. On Tuesday, the White House caught wind of \nthe potential deal--even though the terms had not yet been finalized--\nand issued a veto threat. How often does that happen? How often does \nthe President issue a veto threat on potential deals still under \nnegotiation? How often do we find that extraordinary threat ratified by \npeople who are involved in the negotiations? As I said, this was not a \nRepublican wish list being negotiated. House Republicans were willing \nto make a number of tough concessions in order to get a deal across the \nfinish line.\n  For example, the deal would have made permanent the American \nopportunity tax credit--a provision that first came into law in the \nDemocrats' partisan 2009 stimulus bill and has been a high priority \nitem for Democrats. It would have also made the State and local sales \ntax deduction--which is a high priority for a number of congressional \nDemocrats--permanent. And it would have rolled over the tax extenders \nthat expired during 2013--including many that most Republicans do not \nsupport--for another 2 years.\n  These were major concessions and, to its credit, the House was \nwilling to make them in the interests of a bipartisan agreement.\n  More importantly, the deal was supported by the Senate majority \nleader who, the last time I checked, was a Democrat. Yet the deal \nwasn't good enough for the President and for the more liberal Members \nof the Senate, or should I say the Senate Democratic Caucus. Apparently \nthey weren't willing to take yes for an answer. Instead of compromising \neven a little bit, President Obama issued his veto threat and has been \nrallying Democratic Senators against the proposed deal, or at least \nthat is what I have been told. As a result, it appears unlikely that a \ndeal on the tax extenders package will be reached in this Congress. \nInstead, the most likely scenario appears to be that the Congress will \npass a 1-year referendum of tax extenders that have already expired.\n\n  Short of not passing anything at all, this is surely the worst of all \npossible worlds. Rather than the certainty that would come with making \nsome of the more prominent individual tax extenders permanent, \nfamilies, individuals, and businesses will have to once again put long-\nterm plans on hold in hopes that Congress can get its act together the \nnext time around.\n  This is bad news for middle-class families. This is bad news for \nindividuals. This is bad news for job creators. And this is bad news \nfor those of us hoping the government will improve the way it does \nbusiness any time in the near future.\n  We all know the makeup of the next Congress will be different than it \nis now. I don't mean to be too presumptuous, but I think it is safe to \nsay the President and his liberal allies are unlikely to get a better \ntax deal in the next Congress than the one the Senate Democratic \nleadership had been negotiating up until the last week. I commend the \nSenate Democratic leadership for its work on that matter. I commend the \nHouse leadership and congratulate them for doing the same thing.\n  Do any of my Democratic colleagues who came out against the proposed \ndeal really think their prospects are likely to improve next year? I \nhave to ask because, quite frankly, this recent turn of events is mind-\nboggling to me.\n  In the end, I think the only conclusion that makes sense is that this \nline of attack--the President's veto threat--and liberal opposition to \nthe potential extenders deal is more about politics than about policy. \nIt is about the President's strategy of following an electoral rebuke \nof his policies by tacking even further to the left. And it is about \ncongressional Democrats' efforts to pander to their liberal base at the \nexpense of good government.\n  I hope I am wrong about this, but as I said, there is not another \nlogical explanation that I have heard. I hope the White House and its \nSenate allies will prove me wrong and come to the table with an offer \nthat reflects a genuine compromise with the House.\n  I think the events of this past week have demonstrated divisions in \nthe Democratic Party, and that those divisions are causing real \nproblems. Once again, we had the Senate majority leader in the room and \nready to make a deal, only to be undercut by the President and his \nliberal allies in the Senate. I find that very unfortunate. I commend \nthe Democratic majority leader for trying.\n  Of course, at the end of the day, I suppose none of us should be \nsurprised at what has happened. After all, President Obama is not \nparticularly known for being business friendly or placing his focus on \njob creation, which is sorely needed in this country. Whether it is \ncrippling environmental regulations--which we are now seeing come to \nthe forefront in dramatic terms--or whether it is labor policy or \nhealth care, the President has demonstrated that he is all too willing \nto put his political ideology above the needs of our economy.\n  Make no mistake, the proposed tax extenders deal--the one the \nPresident scuttled with his veto threat--was all about job creation. It \nwould have made the research and development tax credit, small business \nexpensing, and other provisions permanent, giving certainty to the \nbusiness community, paving the way for more investment, and paving the \nway for more jobs in our society.\n  The President's latest gambit on the tax extenders is just a series \nin a long line of instances where politics has trumped job creation. \nStill, as one who has been willing to work with my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, I can't help but be disappointed.\n  But make no mistake, things are about to change around here and we \nwill have an opportunity to right this ship. I just hope we will have a \nlot of Democrats who are willing to help us. We need to focus on an \nagenda that will actually grow our economy. We need to focus on an \nagenda that will actually create jobs. And we need to focus on an \nagenda that will empower the American people. That is going to be the \nfocus of this new Congress.\n  Once again, the President and his allies here in the Senate missed a \nbig opportunity to address some of their party's priorities with the \ntax extenders legislation. It is difficult to imagine that they will \nhave another bite at the same apple in the next Congress. Absent a \ndeal, we are now left with only one option: a 1-year extension that \nwill likely be passed by the House this week. Once again, a 1-year \nextension is not a great deal for families, individuals, and \nbusinesses, but it is far better than letting these provisions lapse \nentirely. Indeed, if we do nothing, we run into a series of problems, \nincluding a delayed filing season, which means millions of delayed \nrefunds for Americans who count on them. In addition, doing nothing \nwould essentially amount to a tax hike on millions of people and \nbusinesses.\n  Consequently, I plan to vote in favor of the 1-year extension, \nunless, of course, my colleagues on the other side finally come to \ntheir senses and allow a better deal to be had.\n  I don't understand this kind of leadership in this country. I don't \nunderstand why the President does some of these things. I don't \nunderstand why the left just can't take an offering to them that was \nmuch better than what we are going to get. The majority leader knew it.\n  Republicans have been tough on the majority leader. I have been here \nfor years. I care for him. I think it is a tough group of people to \nmanage, just as they are on our side as well. It is a tough job. \nFrankly, I think the deal he worked out should have been followed. It \nwould have given the President much of what he wanted initially, \nanyway. It would have brought us together one more time, and it would \nhave been a wonderful thing.\n  It would have made the end of the year--the work we are doing--much \nmore satisfying and acceptable. It would have been a good prelude to \nnext year of our working together--something that this body needs \nreally badly.\n  I want to commend the distinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, \nfor the work he tried to do. I want to congratulate him. I want to \ncongratulate the Speaker of the House for being willing to work on \nthis.\n  I think it is unfortunate we are at this point in these negotiations, \nwhere we are going to have a 1-year extension. It is not going to be \nanywhere near where we had negotiated with the majority leader and had \nnegotiated with the House. There are parts of the negotiated bill that \nI wish I could have changed. But, we had come a long way.\n\n[[Page S6250]]\n\n  I want to pay tribute to the distinguished chairman of our committee. \nI don't think he had much confidence at first that we would put our \noriginal extenders bill through the committee. At least he didn't \nexpress it to me.\n  I said: Let's do it, and we did. Even with the parts that I wish \nweren't in there and the parts he wished weren't in there, it was a \nclassic bipartisan compromise by two sides who feel very, very deeply \nabout all these issues--each and every one of them.\n  I think the work that Senator Reid, the distinguished majority \nleader, and the Speaker had done was not only a step in the right \ndirection but it would have been something most all of us would have \nbeen quite pleased with. I commend them for their work.\n  I am disappointed with where we are. I hope we can solve these \nproblems in the future. I will be working as hard as I can to bring \nabout bipartisan efforts in that regard.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             EPA Regulation\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Last Wednesday Americans all across the country were \npreparing for Thanksgiving. They were traveling. Many of them were \ngoing to visit friends and family and places around their communities, \ntheir State or the country.\n  What did the Obama administration do when it thought nobody was \nactually paying attention? It snuck out a huge new regulation that \nimposes job-crushing environmental restrictions.\n  Politico ran an article on it later that day. The headline was: ``The \nmost expensive regulation ever. Obama rolls out a major EPA rule.''\n  Why would the President do that? Why would he put out a major rule \nfrom the Environmental Protection Agency, affecting millions of \nAmericans, and do it right before a holiday?\n  If these regulations were such a good idea, we would think the \nadministration--as the administration claims it is a good idea--would \nput it out in a way that people would be paying attention.\n  I want to know why the administration did this in a way to hide the \nregulations from the American people. President Obama didn't say a word \nabout it that day. Instead, he pardoned a turkey. The turkey got a \nbetter deal than the American people did last week. They are the ones \nwho are going to be paying for the President's expensive and \ndestructive regulation.\n  Here is what is happening. The Environmental Protection Agency has \nproposed a new rule that would dramatically slash the limits of ground-\nlevel ozone. The rule runs 626 pages. Then we add on the appendix--over \n500 additional pages.\n  Here is what the Wall Street Journal had to say about the new rule. \nThey had an editorial on it Friday with this headline: ``Highway to the \nDanger Ozone.'' It says: ``Like so many other such rules, this one \ntwists decades-old air pollution laws to restructure the U.S. energy \nindustry and gradually ban fossil-fuel-fired power.''\n  We have fossil fuel-fired power gradually being banned as this \nadministration tries to restructure the U.S. energy industry.\n  It says: ``Coal is the first target.'' The article also adds: ``But \nnatural gas is next.''\n  The current limit on ozone is 75 parts per billion. The Environmental \nProtection Agency wants to cut that number down to as little as 70, 65, \neven 60 parts per billion.\n  The Agency estimates that the new rule could cost nearly $17 billion \nevery year--$17 billion a year in costs. Most of the country would fail \nto meet Washington's tough new standards if they were in place today. \nAs much as 95 percent of the country would be unable to comply with the \nnew regulations if they go down to 60 parts per billion.\n  States, counties, and cities would have to curb their energy \nproduction and limit manufacturing. That will mean far less economic \ngrowth and fewer people working. It will raise the cost of everyday \nliving, and it will destroy middle-class jobs. There is no question \nabout it.\n  This rule will undermine energy reliability. It will stall \nmanufacturing investment, and it will smother economic opportunity for \nmiddle-class families.\n  It costs too much, and there is very little benefit. It doesn't \nmatter to the extreme environmentalist wing of the Democratic Party who \nsupport it.\n  The Obama administration is once again turning a deaf ear to \nAmericans--the people who want Washington to focus on jobs. That is \nwhat we saw in the election earlier this month. The people of this \ncountry want the administration to focus on jobs.\n  The administration claims its tough new rule will lead to new health \nbenefits. What about the health damage done to people who lose their \njobs because of the rule?\n  In March 2012 the Committee on Environment and Public Works \nSubcommittee on Clear Air and Nuclear Safety issued a report titled \n``Red Tape Making Americans Sick.'' It is a new report on the health \nimpacts of high unemployment.\n  According to the testimony and scientific research that was reviewed \nby the subcommittee, unemployment caused by excessive regulation--such \nas the new ozone rule--increases the likelihood of hospital visits, \nillnesses, and premature deaths. That raises health care costs. It \nhurts the health of children and the well-being of families. The Obama \nadministration doesn't want to hear it and certainly doesn't want to \ntalk about it.\n  Bipartisan majorities in Congress have rejected the President's \nenergy policies. Senate Democrats wouldn't even bring up his cap and \ntrade plan for a vote in this body.\n  What does the President do? Does he learn the lesson that the \nAmerican people don't want his enormously expensive, job-crushing \npolicies?\n  Does he listen to the voters in the most recent elections--people who \nsent a clear message they weren't happy with the direction the country \nis headed? No, not President Obama--he goes ahead and does it anyway.\n  People are concerned about jobs. They are concerned about the \neconomy. The President is focused, though, on making it tougher for the \nprivate sector to create jobs and tougher for the economy to grow. He \npurposely is going around the American people and their representatives \nin Congress and taking this drastic step on his own. Why? Because he \nknows even Democrats in Congress do not support him.\n  So what are the Democrats who control the Senate right now going to \ndo about it? If history is any indication, they are not going to do \nanything. Democrats in Congress are going to just roll over and accept \nanother destructive policy by President Obama. That is what they did \nwith the health care law--a terrible law. Democrats in Congress pushed \nit through anyway because President Obama told them to do it. Nancy \nPelosi was the Speaker of the House at the time. She said: First you \nhave to pass the bill before you get to find out what is in it. Well, \nnow even Democrats are admitting it was a bad idea as they are learning \nmore and more what is in this bill for which they voted. The senior \nSenator from New York said the other day that the health care law \n``wasn't the change we were hired to make.'' He said, with the economy \nin bad shape, it was a focus on ``the wrong problem.'' That is from a \nSenator who voted for the health care law. Well, today the Senator is \nright when he says it was a focus on the wrong problem.\n  With this new ozone regulation, the President is still focused on the \nwrong problem. He should still be looking for ways to grow America's \neconomy, not ways to tie it up with more redtape.\n  President Obama has made the wrong choice time and time again, adding \nmore regulations, more rules, more bureaucracy. He continues to push \nextreme policies he knows the American people reject. The President is \nusing unelected and unaccountable czars to go around Congress and the \npublic. His latest Executive action shows his Presidency is failing and \nfloundering.\n  President Obama is not even waiting to try to work with a Republican \nCongress or when Republicans take the majority in January. He is acting \non his own right now. Well, in January Republicans in Congress will \nlisten to\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\nAmericans and focus on the priorities of the American people. We will \nhold the Obama administration accountable for its destructive \noverreach. We will listen to people who are struggling under Obama's \nredtape and suffering because of it. We will do everything possible to \nstop this legislation and help Americans have better job opportunities \nin the future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nPresident's Executive order on immigration. I have been listening to my \ncolleagues, both here and on the other side of the Capitol, and I rise \nin amazement. It is almost incredulous that our Republican friends are \nagainst the President taking the same action Presidents Reagan and \nGeorge H.W. Bush took to defer deportation to solve a critical problem \nthat we all know exists in the country--a problem that impacts \nmillions. When President Obama exercises the same Executive authority--\nthe same--they are on the air, on television, on talk shows, on \nTwitter, fear-mongering, calling it illegal, calling it amnesty, a \nconstitutional crisis. Where was all of that when Presidents Reagan and \nBush did it?\n  They hold hearings in the House titled ``Open Border: The Impact of \nPresidential Amnesty on Border Security,'' which is a little ridiculous \nbecause we have more border security under this administration than we \nhave had in the history of the United States. As a matter of fact, we \nspend more on border enforcement and immigration enforcement than we do \nin all of the other Federal law enforcement entities combined--\ncombined.\n  The Republicans threaten to sue the government or even shut it down. \nThe irony of that is laughable because a shutdown over conducting \nbackground checks and collecting taxes from undocumented immigrants \nwould only cost current taxpayers billions of dollars.\n  Certainly it would cost them billions of dollars if it is anything \nlike the last shutdown that Republicans forced. So double standard? \nAbsolutely. It is the very definition of ``double standard.''\n  On immigration reform, our Republican friends--particularly on the \nother side of the Capitol--have become the poster children for double \nstandards. On the one hand, they know the political ramifications of \nthe demographic reality. On the other, they refuse to catch up with \nhistory and fix our broken immigration system. They are sailing against \nthe headwinds of history, and now they want to prevent the President \nfrom pulling them to shore, saving them from their own immobility, \ntheir own inaction. They are also sailing against the headwinds of what \nthe American people want. In poll after poll we have seen that the \nAmerican people want to fix our broken immigration system, and that \nwhich the Senate passed--and I was honored to be one of the Group of 8 \nwho put it together 1\\1/2\\ years ago--and passed with an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote, still has the highest rating among the American \npeople. It has been sitting in the House of Representatives for the \nlast 1\\1/2\\ years.\n  A new Gallup poll shows that the President's approval rating among \nall voters has not gone down since the Executive action announcement \nwas made, as some predicted it would, but, rather, it has increased 5 \npercentage points among all voters since early November. In my view, \nany action--Executive or otherwise--is movement in the right direction \nand it is what America expects of its leaders.\n  Americans are expecting someone to act, someone to tackle the \ndifficult issues, and immigration, particularly for our House \ncolleagues, seems to be a very difficult issue they can't tackle. It is \nnot difficult for me, and it is not really difficult for most Americans \nwho believe in the power of common sense, not for those who believe in \nthe need to secure our borders, to secure the country, to promote \neconomic opportunity, and preserve our history as a nation of \nimmigrants and that core value of family values.\n  I cannot recall anyone coming to this floor and praising inaction, \npraising the President for not having done enough on a matter of \nconsequence, but that is exactly what our Republican colleagues are \ndoing, once again standing squarely on the wrong side of history--in \nfact, on the wrong side of their own history--invoking the double \nstandard and claiming what is right for their party's Presidents is \nwrong for this President. History, however, is a funny thing. You can \nchoose to ignore it, but eventually it catches up with you, and it has \nfinally caught up with my Republican colleagues.\n  I repeat what I have said all along: The antidote to Executive action \nis passing immigration reform. Let's be clear. Regardless of how big or \nhow bold the President's announcement may be, a permanent legislative \nsolution continues to be our ultimate objective. Administrative relief \nwill not grant anyone legal status or citizenship, but it will clear \nthe way for many to come out of the shadows, register with the \ngovernment, pass a criminal background check, get a work permit, and \npay taxes as the rest of us do.\n  Because of the President's Executive action, the nature of who is \neligible is really people who have U.S. citizen families here. It will \nprevent needless deportations and give a chance at a better life to \nthose who want nothing more than to keep their families together. We \nare talking about millions of hard-working people who--right now many \nare exploited, creating downward pressure on the salaries and wages of \nall Americans by virtue of that exploitation. We have an opportunity to \nchange that. I would rather know who is here to pursue the American \ndream versus who is here to do us harm, but I can't know that unless I \nget people to come forward and go through a criminal background check.\n  If our Republican colleagues are so concerned about getting \nimmigration policy right, if they are so concerned about the President \noverstepping his authority, which is the same authority Republican \nPresidents have used, they can exert their own authority and push our \nbipartisan bill over the finish line with one vote--one vote in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The President himself has said he acted because there is a cost to \nwaiting--a cost measured in the thousands of parents of U.S. citizen \nchildren who are deported, husband and wives who are separated from \ntheir U.S. citizen spouses, and the economic consequences.\n  I know there are some who suggest: Let's wait until the next \nCongress. Let's wait and see. Give them a little time. If not, we will \nact.\n  This is the same Republican Party--particularly in the House of \nRepresentatives--that blocked immigration reform in 2006, 2007, 2010, \n2013, and 2014 despite a strong bipartisan bill here. So if they wish, \nthey can join us at the negotiating table with their own proposals and \ntheir own solutions because doing nothing and maintaining the status \nquo is no longer an option. That is precisely why they didn't want the \nPresident to follow through on what he told them. He waited on \nExecutive action. He gave them advance notice. He said: I want you to \nact, but if you don't act, eventually I will have to act.\n  Now let's look at what my Republican friends find so objectionable. \nTo put it simply, the administration is creating a new deferred action \nfor parental accountability, a program that provides deferred action on \na case-by-case basis to undocumented parents of U.S. citizens or lawful \npermanent residents--those who were present in the United States on \nNovember 20 of this year, those who have continuously lived in the \nUnited States for 5 years, since January 2010, and are not an \nenforcement priority--and also is expanding the program that already \nexists for DREAMers by expanding the age content.\n  This isn't amnesty because amnesty means you did something wrong and \nyou are forgiven and get whatever you want. Amnesty means you get \nsomething for nothing. First of all, these people have no pathway to \nbecoming a permanent resident or citizen under the President's \nExecutive order. Secondly, their only opportunity is not to be \ndeported, assuming they can pass a background check and pay their \ntaxes.\n\n[[Page S6252]]\n\n  As a result of the President's order, more people will go to the \nsouthern border to protect it, more people will pay taxes who may not \nbe paying them now, more families will stay reunited, and more people \nwho are in the shadows will come forward and go through a criminal \nbackground check. I would like to know who those people are, and I \nwould like to make sure they don't have a criminal background. More \ncriminals and felons will be deported because now it will be a priority \nto deport those individuals. What is wrong with that set of \ncircumstances?\n  So this is temporary relief as the Congress hopefully comes together \non a more permanent basis.\n  In my State of New Jersey, approximately 137,000 parents of U.S. \ncitizens and legal permanent residents will benefit from the new \naction. About 67,000 will benefit from the new program on children. \nThat is an estimated 204,000 people in New Jersey who can come out of \nthe shadows and contribute to the community and the economy. These are \nmoms and dads, good people, hardworking people who can register with \nthe government, pass a background check, get a work permit, pay taxes, \ntake care of their families, and no longer fear deportation.\n  The fact is, because of the President's Executive action, more felons \nwill be deported, more resources will go to our border, more families \nwill stay together, and more people will pay taxes. These are all good \nthings.\n  The Council of Economic Advisers has found that over the next decade \nthe range of Executive actions announced by the President will increase \nour gross domestic product by up to 0.9 percent, it will reduce the \nFederal deficit by $25 billion through increased economic growth, and \nit will raise the average wages for U.S. workers by 0.3 percent.\n  The Executive action the President has taken and the Republicans have \ncriticized will increase the productivity of our workforce. How? By \nallowing those--from undocumented immigrants to spouses of highly \nskilled H-1B visa holders--to be part of the formal economy and match \nthe skills they have with the skills needed by entrepreneurial startups \nthat they often create.\n  By the way, that is a fraction of the economic benefits of what we \ndid here on a bipartisan basis that has been sitting in the House of \nRepresentatives for the last 1\\1/2\\ years. The Senate bill we passed, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office--the nonpartisan scoring \ndivision of everything we do here--will increase the gross domestic \nproduct of the United States by over 3 percent in 2023--less than 9 \nyears--and 5.4 percent in 2033, which is an increase of roughly $700 \nbillion in 2023 and $1.4 trillion in 2033. It will reduce the Federal \ndeficit by $197 billion over the next decade and another $700 billion \nbetween 2024 and 2033. That is almost $1 trillion in deficit spending \nwhich can be lifted from the backs of the next generation of Americans \nby giving 11 million people a pathway to citizenship. What do we ever \ndo that we pass that grows the economy, reduces the deficit, and \ncreates more jobs for all Americans? Very little. The immigration bill \nwhich the Senate passed and which has been pending in the House does \nall of that in addition to securing our border.\n  So let's be clear. The President's Executive actions are only \ntemporary steps. Only Congress can finish the job. Deferred action is \nan act of prosecutorial discretion, but it is not a path to citizenship \nor a permanent solution. The fact is that we have waited and waited. In \nthe absence of any Republican action in the House on immigration \nreform, the President has used the power he has available, which other \nPresidents have used as well. If the Republicans are concerned about an \nExecutive action, they should use their own power to pass immigration \nreform--either the Senate bill or their own vision of what \ncomprehensive reform is.\n  For those who question the legality of this, I would simply say there \nare three letters--one before the Executive action and two after--from \nlaw professors and former general counsels of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service and chief counsels of USCIS. They say the \nPresident has the authority. He is on sound legal footing.\n  So we are tired of waiting for Republicans to say yes to something--\nyes to taking action that is in the interest of millions in this \ncountry who expect leadership, expect action, expect progress, expect \ncooperation, not confrontation and obstruction. Millions of families \nare tired of waiting. The Nation is tired of waiting for Republicans to \ncatch up with history--in this case, with the lessons of their own \nhistory.\n  Let's invite our Republican friends to invoke the memory of Ronald \nReagan and George H.W. Bush and for once commend this President for \nfollowing their lead in this, doing what is right by the Nation and \ndoing what is right by our taxpayers, doing what is right for our \nsecurity and doing what is right by our families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to express my support for \nthe consideration of the nomination of Nani Coloretti to be the Deputy \nSecretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD.\n  Ms. Coloretti has a distinguished history of public service; she \ncurrently is the Assistant Secretary for Management at the U.S. \nDepartment of Treasury, a position she has served in since 2012. Prior \nto joining the U.S. Treasury, Ms. Coloretti assisted setting up \noperations at the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nserving as the Acting Chief Operating Officer. Additionally, from 1999 \nto 2005, Ms. Coloretti served as director of policy, planning and \nbudget for the San Francisco Department of Children, Youth, and their \nFamilies, as well as budget director to San Francisco Mayor Gavin \nNewsom, where she managed the implementation of San Francisco's $6.2 \nbillion annual budget.\n  Ms. Coloretti received a B.A. in economics and communications from \nthe\n\n[[Page S6253]]\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and a master's in public policy from the \nGoldman School of Public Policy at the University of California at \nBerkeley.

For the information of the Senate, with \nrespect to the votes to confirm the Coloretti and Adler nominations, \nthe motions to reconsider are considered made and laid upon the table, \nand the President will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last week, before the Thanksgiving \nholiday, our colleague from across the aisle, the senior Senator from \nNew York, gave a very significant speech at the National Press Club. \nSenator Schumer is not just a senior Senator from New York; he is an \nimportant Member of the Democratic leadership here in the Senate.\n  While giving the speech about the midterm elections, he said what \nmany Members on this side of the aisle have been saying for the last 4 \nyears, and that is that the Democratic party, by making the passage of \nObamaCare their top priority after they won the election of 2008, \n``blew the opportunity the American people gave them.'' He said they \ndid so by focusing ``on the wrong problem.''\n  What I think he meant and went on to say is that they should have \nfocused on the lack of jobs and the wage stagnation for hardworking, \nmiddleclass families in America.\n  As he pointed out, that broader group of the middle class represented \na much larger segment of the electorate than just a small percentage of \nthe electorate represented by the uninsured. I would add, \nparenthetically, that we know that even the best laid plans with the \nAffordable Care Act has proven to be a terrible failure.\n  Today the Wall Street Journal reported that between 2007 and 2013 \nhealth insurance premiums for an average middleclass American family \nhave gone up by 24 percent. As we know, when the President said if you \nlike your doctor, you can keep him, that proved not to be true. When he \nsaid the family of four would see their premiums go down by $2,500, \nthat ended up not to be true either.\n  Two weeks ago, despite the overwhelming rejection the President's \npolicies received at the polls, the President then decided to \ncircumvent Congress and take Executive action on immigration, far \nexceeding any arguable authority that I believe most lawyers would \nthink he has. Certainly, while we recognize it is within the \nPresident's discretion to prioritize the people against whom \nenforcement action will be taken, there is no legal authorization for \ndoing other things he purports to have the authority to do, such as \nissuing work permits.\n  Then there is this. Just when it seemed that the Senate was beginning \nto work on avoiding a retroactive tax increase for millions of \nAmericans, the President threatened to veto an important tax relief \npackage, which, as I said, had bipartisan support, including the \nsupport of the majority leader, Senator Reid, and Senator Schumer, the \nsenior Senator from New York. He did so because it did not include \nevery single provision he thought it should include.\n  If we have not learned before, we should now know that if you insist \non absolute perfection--in other words, you want everything you want, \nand the alternative is nothing--then most of the time you are going to \nget nothing. That is what taxpayers are getting when it comes to \naborting this retroactive tax provision in the so-called tax extenders \nbill.\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\n  To again quote our good friend from New York, by threatening to veto \nthis job-creating tax relief, it appears that the President has once \nagain focused on the wrong problem and is certainly going about this in \na nonproductive and unconstructive way. It is unfortunate because the \nPresident seems to be positively allergic to good-faith negotiations \nand genuine compromise. Again, if your attitude is ``my way or the \nhighway,'' you are going to get the highway all the time because that \nis not how our democratic institutions work. The only way things work \nis for us to find common ground and to compromise. Yet the President's \nattitude seems, unfortunately, out of touch. He seems more interested \nin getting his way by any means necessary--hence, the Executive action \non immigration.\n  We increasingly know that actions are dividing the country and \nhurting hard-working Texans and American families across the Nation--\nand not just by not contributing to the solution but by being a \npositive obstacle to bipartisan resolutions of so many of these \nproblems. I realize the President must think that it is much easier to \nissue Executive orders and threaten to veto legislation from the White \nHouse, but it was not helping to solve problems we were sent here by \nour constituents to solve.\n  There is no real reason preventing us from getting to the tax relief \nI mentioned earlier that the President said he would veto. For years \nHouse and Senate Republicans--often with significant bipartisan \nsupport--have focused on making progrowth provisions of the Tax Code \npermanent, such as the research and development tax credit, accelerated \ndepreciation, for example, and the section 179 provision.\n  To show how counterproductive it is for us to do these on a short-\nterm basis or to try to jam them through a lameduck session, I had a \nfarmer from Texas come and see me. He said: I am prepared to spend and \ninvest $200,000 on my farm if I know this tax provision is going to be \nthe law. If it is not, I won't. To me, that is just another example of \nhow what we do here--or what we don't do here--has a negative impact on \nour economy and on investment in job creation.\n\n  While I know the bipartisan package proposed last week was not \nperfect, it certainly would have moved us in the right direction. It \nwould have provided some certainty--indeed permanency--for some tax \nprovisions and would have provided some temporary relief on others. \nPerhaps most importantly, it would have sent a signal to our \nconstituents that we got the message that was delivered to us on \nNovember 4, and that we are going to commit ourselves anew to try to \nwork together to provide certainty and protect millions of Americans \nfrom tax hikes that are just right around the corner and work on other \nconstructive proposals to help solve problems that affect the middle \nclass.\n  Unfortunately, the President has persisted in his attitude of \nrefusing to negotiate with Congress, resulting in another missed \nopportunity, and ultimately another short-term fix that will provide no \nlong-term certainty to taxpayers struggling in the Obama economy.\n  Come January, there will be a new majority in the Senate that will \nmake the priorities of the American people the priorities of Congress. \nAs for President Obama, we can only hope he will somehow have an \nepiphany and decide to work with us to unite the country rather than \ncontinue to divide the country with more Executive actions and his \nharmful ``take it or leave it'' approach to governing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I was not intending to come down here. I \nwas getting ready to leave to see my 12-year-old son who just got home \nfrom school and make sure that he has dinner and do all the things that \na parent would do, but I heard a speech earlier today--and I just heard \nanother one--and it is like revisionist history. It is amazing to me to \nhear them talk about information that they claim is information--and \nreally when you listen carefully, it is really more of the same.\n  I agree with my colleague who was just here that people want \nsomething different as the new Congress comes in. I will not be here, \nas the Presiding Officer knows, but that does not mean I will not be a \nparticipant in my community and also making comments when I hear \nthings. But what I heard was they are going to finally get to economic \ndevelopment and improve the economy.\n  The two Members who spoke today whom I heard were here when I came to \nthe Senate in 2009, and a few years later the Presiding Officer came to \nthe Senate. People may have forgotten where this economy was in 2009. \nThe stock market was in dismal shape. I believe it was around 6,500 or \n6,800--somewhere in that range. Unemployment was at 10 percent, and the \npundits and economists all said it was growing. Approximately 700,000 \njobs were lost per month. Two of the three largest U.S. automobile \ncompanies were basically on their back and about to go bankrupt. New \nhousing starts didn't exist, and prices of homes across the country \nwere crashing. Consumer confidence was at the lowest point I have ever \nseen in I don't know how many years. The deficit was--annually--about \n$1.4 trillion.\n  I know what happens these days--because I have experienced it for the \nlast several years--is news by the minute. What happens today in this \nmoment of time are these one-liners and I can tell they are very \nsynchronized today. They said that the economy was bad, and is still \nbad, and the bright spot is around the corner.\n  Actually, you have to look at where we are today, 6 years later. The \nstock market is at 17,000-plus. What does that mean? It means that \npeople who have retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s or 529s--putting \nmoney aside for their kids' education--have had their value come back.\n  For my home State, which receives a benefit called the permanent fund \ncheck--we invest in the stock market with oil revenues we put aside \nconstitutionally, and it is put in the permanent fund and a check is \nissued once a year. Guess what? This year the check is double from what \nit was last year. Why is that? Because it works on a 5-year average. \nGoing backwards--I took the year 2009 off; it was a very bad year--what \nhappened to the permanent fund check? It doubled this year in Alaska, \nwhich meant that people got that money in their pocket and spent it on \nthe economy and helped to grow the economy.\n  Where is unemployment today? It is at 5.8 percent nationally--a 50-\npercent drop. GM, Ford, and Chrysler have added 500,000 jobs since mid-\n2009.\n  I know that today was like revisionist history. Amnesia has set into \nsome people over there. They want to recreate the news because the good \nnews is hard to talk about because it is reality.\n  Now, there is still a challenge. The Presiding Officer has talked \nabout this a great deal, and that is that people are still working \nharder and longer because the incomes have not gone up enough. They \nhave not seen it come down to them yet, but they have seen it in \ncertain elements. Housing prices are up. In the one single largest \ninvestment an individual makes in a lifetime--their housing prices are \nback up.\n  Gasoline prices--I have no idea if my colleagues fill up their cars \nwith gas. I do. I know what it costs to fill up my tank, and it costs \nless now. The average price across the country now is about $2.77. In \nmy State, it is about $3.35. But we were up to $5 in the urban areas--\nbut not anymore.\n  I saw the statistic today, and I wrote it down. I think I have this \nright. The price of oil has gone down and so has the price of gasoline. \nWhat does that save consumers every day? It saves consumers $630 \nmillion a day in current prices. It means that consumers are benefiting \nfrom that.\n  When you look at job growth--I believe we are in our 55th straight \nmonth of private-sector job growth. Again, we don't have it fully \ntrickling down to the wages yet, but first we have to right the \neconomy. I know the voters have made a decision. Before I came in, the \neconomy was a disaster. Before the Presiding Officer came in, the \neconomy was barely recovering. But I will not sit here and listen to \nrevisionist history.\n  As a matter of fact, the consumer confidence level is the highest \nthis month since 2007. That means consumers are finally feeling it a \nlittle bit. There is still more to go. But to pretend that nothing has \nhappened over\n\n[[Page S6256]]\n\nthe last 6 years--I can't use the words on the floor here because it \nwould be disrespectful--is just not true. It has changed. We still have \nmore work to do.\n  As a matter of fact, the tax extender bill--the items they didn't \nwant to support permanently would have brought it to every single \nfamily that is still struggling. But I know there are tax provisions \nthey want for the NASCAR owners, the horseracing owners. I get that. \nThose are their issues. I understand that. But we have to be realistic.\n\n  Also, the deficit. Think about this. When I came to the Senate in \n2009, the annual deficit in this country was $1.4 trillion. Today, it \nis $480 billion. It has dropped by $1 trillion per year. Now do we want \nit to be zero? Yes. Do we want to have a surplus so we can start paying \noff the debt? Absolutely. But we have to get recovery first--get some \ntreatment, which is what we have been doing--and then reinvest in the \nfuture. That means infrastructure, education, and objectives that \nmatter to everyday Americans and everyday Alaskans.\n  I sit here and listen to these comments. Today it happened a little \nbit before 12:30 p.m., before our caucus break, because we usually \nbreak at 12:30 p.m. and I was going to go home. I turned on--my \nmistake. I turned on the station and I heard the commentary and I \nthought, Jacob is going to have to wait a little bit for dinner and I \nam going to come to the floor, because it is amazing to me. Exports--\nbusinesses we create in this country we ship out, up 37 percent over \nthe last several years. I will give an example of a company in Alaska. \nWhen I was campaigning, I ran into this company in Fairbanks. They had \ntheir manufacturing plant in China. Do my colleagues know where they \nhave it now? It is in Fairbanks, AK. They moved it from China to \nFairbanks. I told them they should put a 4-by-8 sign out there and say, \nWe take jobs from China and bring them home. They are all good jobs. As \na matter of fact, they are union jobs. So when people talk about how \nunions are destroying the country--they actually brought jobs back that \nare union jobs, paying good wages, good benefits, and took it from \nChina and brought it to Fairbanks, AK. It is unbelievable what they do. \nThey do business not only in Alaska, but in Hawaii and other places.\n  I listened over and over again today, and I want to make sure \npeople--also I should mention housing prices are up, new housing starts \nare up, which is important for the construction industry. It creates \njobs and makes sure we have competition so prices are stabilized over \ntime. Retail sales are strong. I have no idea if my colleague who spoke \nearlier has ever been in business. He talked about the 179 \ndepreciation. I have actually used it because I have been in small \nbusiness. I have no idea if he understands how it works, but for small \nbusinesses, it is a big deal. It is why Democrats have supported that \ntime and time again.\n  As a matter of fact, we had it in the minimum wage bill we brought to \nthe floor, the 179 extension, which they voted against, they did not \nsupport--raising the minimum wage, bringing people out of poverty and, \nby the way, helping small businesses expand and invest so they can grow \nmore. As someone who used the 179 more than once--as a matter of fact, \nmy wife has small businesses and is now expanding and investing and is \nusing the 179 depreciation. I hear what they are saying, but I don't \nknow if they understand how it is used. When we had the minimum wage \nbill, coupled with 179, it seemed to make a lot of sense, but they \ndidn't like that, either.\n  So I wanted to come to the floor because I think it is important that \nwe, No. 1, don't take things out of context. They mentioned Senator \nSchumer's speech several times. They should read the whole speech, \nbecause I think they selected verbiage. I don't agree 100 percent with \nhis comments, but I agree with the concept. We actually did two things. \nWe worked on health care and we worked on the economy. I see people \nsometimes when they eat their food, they eat one piece at a time--their \ncarrots first, and then their potato, and then their steak. We actually \ndid a little bit of everything. We dealt with health care, because it \nwas crushing the economy, but we dealt with the economy overall. We had \nto take votes on a regular basis that the other side would never do, \nbecause we bet on America. And the result is 6 years later, here we \nare. The economy is better. It is stronger. It needs more work, there \nis no question about it. We need to get the deficit to zero and get a \nsurplus, and knock the debt down. That was driven up not just by this \nadministration but by past administrations as well. They forgot about \nthe two wars they didn't pay for. The extender bill is not paid for. We \ndidn't hear one word about how that tax extender bill is not going to \nbe paid for. It is going to be another part of the debt. But 4 or 5 \nmonths ago--my colleagues may remember this--we were on the floor \ndebating veterans care, and all they said is how are we going to pay \nfor it. Well, the veterans paid, but we had to find a way. But here we \nare going to give more corporate tax relief without paying for it--\nexcept actually we do pay for it. Everyday Americans will pay for it \nwith their taxes, and the debt, and interest on the debt. So we have to \nbe clear about that.\n\n  I think about where we were, what we did, and where we are. It is \nsignificantly different than 6 years ago. It is better. I agree there \nis more work to be done to make sure we get more of the revenue stream \nand opportunities in the hands of individuals--hard-working Alaskans, \nhard-working folks from Massachusetts, and hard-working folks across \nthis country. That is our next obligation. But to come to the floor and \nsay the economy is a disaster is irresponsible. It is not correct. The \nnumbers tell us differently. Actually, even the conservative Forbes, \nWall Street Journal, and all of these other magazines and newspapers \nthat I read are now talking about how the economy is moving because we \nhave had this consecutive pattern which really tells how the economy is \nimproving. That is important.\n  The last thing I will say from a purely Alaska perspective is not \nonly are exports important to us because we do a lot of business \noverseas--we have seen exports increase. Our unemployment in Anchorage, \nfor example, the city I am from, is 4.9 percent--a pretty good economy. \nOur fisheries industry, which I know the Presiding Officer and I \nshare--78,000 jobs are connected to that--a $5 billion, almost $6 \nbillion industry. Our tourism industry is up, with 2 million overall \nvisitors to our State, again, generating income. There is more activity \nhappening around the country than ever before, and my State is seeing \nit every single day.\n  But to come to the floor and continue to be naysayers and talk about \nhow bad things are is really not responsible. We have done a great job. \nCan we do better? Absolutely. That is what we strive for every single \nday. And I hope--and I say this to the Presiding Officer because I will \nnot be here after January--that they don't take the position where they \nare mad at immigration so now they are not going to do these economic \ndevelopment issues, or they are mad at something else and they take it \nout on some other program. We are going to have--the Presiding Officer \nwill have differences with her colleagues, on immigration, maybe, on \nhealth care, on the economy, but we have to find common ground. The \neconomy is a constant issue, and where investments should happen if we \nreally want to have an impact down the road is investing in \ninfrastructure, education, relieving--as the Presiding Officer has \ntried to do--relieving debt from students and families. There is now a \n$1.4 trillion debt, I think, on families for student loans. It is \noutrageous. We should be lowering those rates.\n  Also, as tax reform issues come up, which they will next year, I hope \nthe Senate and the House look at objectives such as making a big impact \nfor individual families, lowering the rates for individual families, \nhard-working families, if we want to put cash in their pockets, if we \nwant to change the dynamics, give them more of their money back, not \nthe top 1 percent or even the top 10 percent, but I am talking about \nthe folks we see every day--I see every day--out there working hard. We \nneed to make sure they can start putting money aside for college \neducation for their kids, putting money aside for retirement, spending \nmore in the economy, because maybe that car that is 15 years old isn't \nrunning so well anymore. That is what I hope we do. Individual relief \nis more important than corporate relief or the top 1 percent.\n\n[[Page S6257]]\n\n  On top of that, when we talk about corporate tax relief, never forget \nwho really is driving the economy. It is the small business owners, \nincluding the limited liability corporations, the subchapter S \ncorporations, the sole proprietor individuals. They all get taxed by \nindividual rates. We will hear about corporate rate relief, which is \nimportant to be competitive, but that is for the big guys. But the guys \nwe see every day--when we go to the cleaners, a sole proprietor; go to \na restaurant, sole proprietor, maybe it is an LLC--they are not going \nto see that benefit unless we lower the rates for them. That is what we \nshould be doing if we want to make a difference for them. Because they \nwill use the 179 depreciation. The 179 has a limit. The big boys use it \na little bit, but the limit is really designed for small businesses to \nreinvest. But if their tax rates are still too high, they won't be able \nto take advantage of that as much as they can. We want them to take \nadvantage.\n  I didn't mean to take time here at the end of the evening. I know \nlots of times people want to get out. But, honestly, I couldn't sit \nthere and listen to the revisionist history that continues to go on. \nThe elections are over. I know now it is called the Obama economy. That \nis a new phrase. It is really collectively all of our economy, because \nwe participated in trying to save it. They have objected to it for the \nlast 6 years, so by their objection, they get to be a part of not \nhaving the result that maybe they wanted, but the result is the economy \nis much better. We need to do more work to make sure it gets into the \nhands of the individual out there. I know that is a priority to the \nPresiding Officer. But if I continue to hear it, I will continue to \ncome to the floor and speak, because people can't get away with just \nsaying over and over again that they are stating the facts, because the \nfacts are very clear as I just stated. The stock market has gone up. \nUnemployment has dropped. Housing is up. Housing starts are up. The two \nlargest automobile companies, all three of them now, over a half a \nmillion new jobs. Fifty-five consecutive months of growth. That is all \ngood news and we should be proud of it. The Presiding Officer should be \nproud of it and the Senate should be proud of it. But there is no room \nfor revisionist history when we talk about the fact of where we were 6 \nyears ago and where we are today.\n  I appreciate the time and yield the floor and suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am here for my 81st ``Time To Wake \nUp'' speech and to ask this body to wake up to the effects of climate \nchange and to say this: Acting on this issue will accelerate economic \ngrowth, spur innovation, and create jobs.\n  We have settled any real argument about the leading cause of climate \nchange. It is carbon pollution. Measurements in the atmosphere and \noceans reveal dramatic, even unprecedented changes in the climate.\n  Our scientists know carbon pollution heats up the climate and \nacidifies the ocean. That is beyond debate. They know this is already a \nproblem for Americans and the world.\n  We had wonderful testimony from a NASA scientist today in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee who talked about what they \nactually see when they look down from the satellites.\n  They take measurements. They are not hypothesizing. They actually \nmeasure these things. The scientists know that continued, unchecked \nemissions of carbon dioxide will push the climate and the oceans into \ndangerous unchartered new territory.\n  In the face of overwhelming evidence of climate change, some of our \nRepublican colleagues--just a few--are beginning to move beyond denial \nof basic measurements and basic classroom science and beginning to talk \nabout the costs of action. That is progress. When he was asked recently \nabout climate change, the junior Senator from South Dakota acknowledged \nthere are a number of factors that contribute to that, including human \nactivity. The question is, he went on to say, what are we going to do \nabout it and at what cost?\n  Across the building, over on the House side, Congressman Paul Ryan of \nWisconsin has also been talking about the costs of action. In his most \nrecent campaign for reelection, he said that when it comes to action to \nreduce carbon emissions, ``the benefits don't outweigh the costs.''\n  Let's talk about that. When we get past the denial, which with a few \nof our colleagues it seems we have--not all, maybe not even many, but a \nfew--and we talk about balancing costs and benefits, if we look at the \nwhole ledger, there is no doubt about it that the balance favors \naction.\n  Climate change carries enormous costs to our economy and to our way \nof life. Acting now can accelerate economic growth and create new jobs. \nThe costs of climate change are huge. We even hear this from our own \nadvisers at the Government Accountability Office. In its 2013 high-risk \nlist, our Government Accountability Office said that climate change \nposes a significant risk to the U.S. Government and to our Nation's \nbudget. Why? The Federal Government owns and operates infrastructure \nand property that is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The \nFederal Government provides aid and disaster response when State \nagencies are overwhelmed. The Federal Government is an insurer of \nproperty and crops vulnerable to climate disruption. These are major \nline items in the Federal budget.\n\n  Our Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew, recently explained:\n\n       If the fiscal burden from climate change continues to rise, \n     it will create budgetary pressures that will force hard \n     trade-offs, larger deficits or higher taxes, and these \n     tradeoffs would make it more challenging to invest in growth.\n\n  One example--just one. Last month, in the GAO report on what climate \nchange means for private and Federal insurance for crops and for \nfloods, it warned of increased hurricane-related losses to the Federal \nprogram. They estimated between a 14- and 47-percent increase by 2040 \nand a 50- to 110-percent increase over the next century due to climate \nchange. Remember, when you are doubling a number like that, you are \nstarting with a pretty big baseline.\n  Superstorm Sandy wrought $66 billion in damage in 2012. If we are \nconstantly replacing damaged roads and bridges, always adapting farming \nand fishing practices to suit never-seen-before conditions, and \nfrequently paying out big disaster relief and flood insurance claims, \nthat will hit the Federal pocketbook hard.\n  We do not even have to look to the costs of the future to justify \nreducing carbon pollution today. Increasingly, green energy makes \neconomic sense for utilities, for business, and for consumers. Since \n2008, prices for solar photovoltaic have dropped 80 percent--80 \npercent. Austin Energy in Texas recently signed a power purchase \nagreement for a 150-megawatt solar plant at 5 cents per kilowatt hour--\nless expensive than comparable offers for natural gas at 7 cents, coal \nat 10 cents, or nuclear power at 13 cents. The story is similar for \nwind power. Since 2009, the cost of wind power has decreased by 64 \npercent. At the lowest end of the price range nationally, unsubsidized \nwind power prices are just below 4 cents per kilowatt hour. This \ncompares favorably to new coal generation, priced between 6 and 7 cents \nper kilowatt hour at the lowest end.\n  The World Resources Institute has just done a brief report called \n``Seeing is Believing: Status of renewable energy in the United \nStates.'' It is headlined ``Wind & solar are cheaper than coal & gas in \na growing number of markets.'' It lists sales in Utah, Colorado, Texas, \nGeorgia, and Minnesota--not States that have a lot in common except \nthat renewables are beginning to outcompete fossil fuels in those \nStates.\n  Similarly, the New York Times just last week in its business section \nhighlighted this shift in an article: ``Solar and Wind Energy Start to \nWin on Price vs. Conventional Fuels.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the World Resources Institute report and \nthe New York Times story be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  Green energy jobs--they are out there. They are helping communities.\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\nIndeed, they are helping communities recover from the great recession. \nLet me use a Rhode Island example--TPI Composites. TPI has a \ndevelopment and manufacturing facility in Warren, RI. It is also one of \nour leading manufacturers of wind turbine blades. They make them in \nIowa. When the Maytag plant closed in Newton IA, leaving as many as \n4,000 workers jobless, wind jobs helped the town get back on its feet. \nIn 10 years TPI has manufactured more than 10,000 wind turbine blades.\n  In Iowa, MidAmerican Energy pays farmers thousands of dollars each \nyear to site their turbines on their farms. The farmers love it. They \ncan farm right up to about 25 feet around the base of the turbine. \nThere is a little gravel road for the maintenance trucks, but they can \nfarm right up to that. They get paid for having the turbines on their \nfarms. So it is a win-win that has helped Iowa generate more than one-\nquarter of its electricity from wind.\n  They are investing more. They have been reducing emissions and moving \nthe State's economy forward--step by step reducing emissions and moving \nthe economy forward. More and more companies, in their own planning, \nare seeing the economic benefits from cleaning up their supply chains \nand reducing carbon pollution from their operations. They see green \ninvestments increasing profits. ``Too many people say it's this or \nthat,'' Apple CEO Tim Cook explained earlier this year. ``We've found \nthat if you set the bar high, then it's possible to do both.''\n  Outside these walls here in Congress, where the deniers rule and \npolluter money reigns, State and local political leaders also see that \nreducing carbon pollution and growing the economy go hand in hand. \nAlmost 10 years ago, the Presiding officer's State and my State and \nothers--bipartisan--nine northeastern Governors came together and \nformed the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, called RGGI, which caps \ncarbon emissions and sells permits to powerplants to emit greenhouse \ngasses. Since the program started, RGGI States that have cut emissions \nfrom the power sector have cut them by 40 percent.\n  Here is the blue line. That is the emission chart from 2005 through \n2012. Well, if cutting emissions was bad for the economy, you would \nthink that the State GDP would have followed downward in that curve, \nbut, in fact, you see that the regional economy across these States \nactually grew by 7 percent--grew by 7 percent. Bear in mind, this is \n2008, the great recession.\n  Here we are now. So you would think that during this period the GDP \nnumbers would have taken a pounding. The underlying numbers are \nactually better than this once you adjust for the recession.\n  Early estimates show that in its first decade, RGGI will have saved \nNew England families and businesses in the participating States nearly \n$1.3 billion on their electric bills. It will have added $1.6 billion \ninto local economies. Along the way, those RGGI States will have added \n16,000 job years. Additional investments are coming online because it \nis such a successful program. So those benefits also grow. Rhode Island \nhas put over 90 percent of the money generated through the RGGI \nauctions into energy efficiency improvements, helping residents save \nmoney on their utility bills and making small businesses more \ncompetitive. This success led Tom Wolf, the Governor-elect of \nPennsylvania--a coal mining and natural gas State--to campaign for \noffice successfully on joining RGGI.\n  RGGI shows that improving the environment boosts the economy. Look \nnorth to Canada. British Columbia has a revenue-neutral carbon fee that \nhas reduced the use of polluting fossil fuels by 16 percent. What has \nhappened to the economy? The BC economy has not missed a step. The \ncarbon fee revenue has been used to lower personal and corporate rate \nincome taxes. British Columbia now has the lowest personal tax rate in \nCanada.\n  If our Republican colleagues would like to lower our American \ncorporate and individual taxes, then I have a revenue-neutral carbon \nfee bill I am happy to discuss with them. Evidence from Rhode Island to \nBritish Columbia shows that action on carbon pollution spurs \ninnovation, creates jobs, and economically boosts families and \nbusinesses.\n  Today I discussed this larger report, again from the World Resources \nInstitute, which is a group that has, for instance, executives from \nAlcoa and Caterpillar on its board. This is not some fringe group; it \nis a very responsible organization with significant corporate and \ninternational leadership.\n  Here is the lead sentence:\n\n       A growing body of evidence shows that economic growth is \n     not in conflict with efforts to reduce emissions of \n     greenhouse gasses.\n\n  It continues:\n\n       Policies are often necessary to unlock these opportunities, \n     however, because market barriers hamper investment in what \n     are otherwise beneficial activities.\n\n  That is what we are about here. Unlock those opportunities for our \neconomy. On the downside--here is the first chapter heading: ``Delaying \naction will have significant economic impacts.''\n\n       Climate change itself constitutes a significant risk to the \n     nation's economy.\n\n  The downside is on doing nothing, according to this report. The \nupside is on changing our policies to seize those opportunities. Why \nare we here fighting about this? Well, again, to quote the report:\n\n       The persistence of pollution externalities--\n\n  ``Pollution externalities'' means when the cost of your product--you \ncan ship off to somebody else and make them have to take care of it.\n\n     The persistence of pollution externalities gives an unfair \n     advantage to polluting activities. Externalities occur when a \n     product or activity affects people in ways that are not fully \n     captured in its price, such as the full health effects of air \n     pollution not being factored into the cost of electricity \n     generation. Thus, society rather than the company pays the \n     cost.\n\n  Why are we in this fight? Because there are a lot of companies that \nfolks on the other side are supporting and representing here that have \nbeen the winners in that fight. They have had those polluting \nexternalities work in their favor. They have enjoying that unfair \nadvantage. They do not want to give it up. But as the report continues, \nthe well-designed policies can overcome those market barriers and \ndirect investment into beneficial technologies and practices. New \npolicies can enhance the transition to a low-carbon economy while \ndelivering net economic benefits and, in many cases, direct savings for \nconsumers and businesses. So that is pretty good news.\n  Equally important, taking action helps to reduce the worst effects of \nclimate change--what is coming at us. Do not just take my word for it. \nMany conservative economists, writers, and officials see the benefits \nof market-based climate action. ``A tax on carbon,'' wrote Hudson \nInstitute economist Irwin Stelzer, ``need not swell the government's \ncoffers--if we pursue a second, long-held conservative objective: \nReducing the tax on work.\n  He continues:\n\n       It would be a relatively simple matter to arrange a dollar-\n     for-dollar, simultaneous reduction in payroll taxes. . . . \n     Anyone interested in jobs, jobs, jobs should find this an \n     attractive proposition, with growth-minded conservatives \n     leading the applause.\n\n  That is the economics of it unless you are shilling for the folks who \nhave had the unfair advantage and want to keep it, but that is not \nmarket based, that is not economics, that is just taking care of \nspecial interests.\n  A recent joint report from economists at the Brookings Institution \nand the conservative American Enterprise Institute described human-\ninduced greenhouse gas emissions as a textbook example of a negative \nexternality. The report proposed--guess what--a revenue-neutral carbon \nfee program as the efficient and elegant approach to managing carbon \npollution.\n  According to the report's authors:\n\n       Taxing something we do not want (e.g. greenhouse gas \n     emissions) rather than something we want more of (e.g., \n     productive labor and investment) could help lower the \n     economy-wide cost of the program and may even have economic \n     benefits in addition to its environmental benefits.\n\n  Today, in the Environment and Public Works Committee, I had a \nconversation with a Heritage Foundation witness in which I read to the \nwitness a very similar quote from the economist Arthur Laffer, Reagan's \neconomist, saying: A carbon fee--where you tax the product in the \nground and relieve taxes on work and effort by people--is a net win for \nthe economy.\n  I asked the witness what he thought about that, and he couldn't \ndispute it.\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\nIn fact, he considers himself to be something of an acolyte of Arthur \nLaffer's, so there is actually a lot of economic support for it.\n  I will conclude by saying, if the topic is now not going to be denial \nbut it is going to be the cost and benefits of climate action, I am \nready to have that conversation all day long. Let's just make sure it \nis the whole conversation, not just the half of the conversation that \nlooks at what losing their subsidy means for the big oil companies, the \nbig coal companies, the Koch brothers and the rest of the polluters.\n  A lot of my colleagues only look at one side of the ledger, how this \naffects the fossil fuel lobby. If we look at the whole ledger, if we \nlook at both sides, when we look at all the evidence, it tells us one \nthing; that is, that the costs of climate change are already here. They \nare showing up in our lives in innumerable ways that carry real \neconomic costs and carry real costs in terms of quality of life and our \nidentity as a country, and in fact they may overwhelm us by century's \nend. Looking at all the evidence shows us that significant reductions \nin carbon pollution will actually support jobs and increase economic \ngrowth.\n  Finally, a revenue-neutral carbon fee would spur innovative business \nmodels and technological development in the United States. If we lose \nthis race to clean up our carbon mess, one of the collateral injuries \nwe will sustain is that we will not have developed a robust clean \nenergy economy and we will find ourselves buying products from the \nChinese, the Indians, the Europeans, and others.\n  We need to put our industry to the test. They will rise to it. They \nalways have. We can trust them. We can count on them, but giving them a \npass does not serve their interests or ours. This will drive market \nforces to decrease our emissions and grow our economy.\n  We have the tools to do something big. It has been proven in British \nColumbia. It has been proven with RGGI. All of the economists across \nthe economic spectrum seem to agree the time is right to put a national \nprice on carbon.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the World Resources Institute]\n\n  Seeing Is Believing: Status of Renewable Energy in the United States\n\n\nWIND & SOLAR ARE CHEAPER THAN COAL & GAS IN A GROWING NUMBER OF MARKETS\n\n       For each region, the average wind power purchase agreement \n     (PPA) is cheaper than new coal plants, new coal and natural \n     gas plants, and new coal and natural gas plants, even without \n     federal tax incentives. Wind PPA data is unavailable in the \n     Southeast region.\n\n\nWell Designed Policies & Technological improvements can continue these \n                                 trends\n\n       Prices for solar PV systems have dropped 80 percent since \n     2008; analysts expect a continued decline in the coming \n     years.\n       New, taller wind turbines with longer blades are able to \n     capture more energy and can open the U.S. up to new areas of \n     wind development.\n       Long-term regulatory certainty is needed through a price on \n     carbon (like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade), or greenhouse \n     gas standards for existing power plants.\n       Additional important policy signals include: States and \n     utilities should ensure that renewable energy providers have \n     access to long-term contracts, which could reduce the average \n     electricity costs of wind and solar projects by 10-15 \n     percent. Major corporations are already taking advantage of \n     electricity price savings from these long-term contracts, and \n     are asking for access in more states through the Corporate \n     Renewable Energy Buyers' Principles.\n       Congress should address the design flaw of renewable tax \n     incentives so that more of the value of the credit flows to \n     project developers (as opposed to third party investors) \n     without increasing the cost to taxpayers, for example by \n     making the tax incentive ``refundable''.\n       Renewable projects can face high financing costs, so \n     financial regulators and lending institutions should work \n     together to develop new investment models that lower these \n     costs.\n       Bringing more renewables online can be challenging because \n     the supply varies. States and utilities should update \n     regulations and business models to promote a flexible power \n     grid that uses more storage, distributed generation, and \n     demand response.\n       Federal spending on research and development in the power \n     sector has fallen 77 percent since 1980, while the power \n     industry itself spends only .05 percent of its earnings on \n     R (compared to 11 percent for the pharmaceutical industry \n     and 8 percent for computers and electronics). Congress should \n     therefore increase federal funding for research, development \n     and commercialization of low-carbon and energy-saving \n     technologies, especially for those that could generate \n     baseload electricity like geothermal and concentrating solar \n     power.\n       In the absence of other tools to provide long-term \n     regulatory certainty, EPA has used its existing legal \n     authority under the Clean Air Act to propose greenhouse gas \n     standards for existing power plants. EPA should finalize \n     these standards.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 23, 2014]\n\n   Solar and Wind Energy Start To Win on Price vs. Conventional Fuels\n\n                          (By Diane Cardwell)\n\n       For the solar and wind industries in the United States, it \n     has been a long-held dream: to produce energy at a cost equal \n     to conventional sources like coal and natural gas.\n       That day appears to be dawning.\n       The cost of providing electricity from wind and solar power \n     plants has plummeted over the last five years, so much so \n     that in some markets renewable generation is now cheaper than \n     coal or natural gas.\n       Utility executives say the trend has accelerated this year, \n     with several companies signing contracts, known as power \n     purchase agreements, for solar or wind at prices below that \n     of natural gas, especially in the Great Plains and Southwest, \n     where wind and sunlight are abundant.\n       Those prices were made possible by generous subsidies that \n     could soon diminish or expire, but recent analyses show that \n     even without those subsidies, alternative energies can often \n     compete with traditional sources.\n       In Texas, Austin Energy signed a deal this spring for 20 \n     years of output from a solar farm at less than 5 cents a \n     kilowatt-hour. In September, the Grand River Dam Authority in \n     Oklahoma announced its approval of a new agreement to buy \n     power from a new wind farm expected to be completed next \n     year. Grand River estimated the deal would save its customers \n     roughly $50 million from the project.\n       And, also in Oklahoma, American Electric Power ended up \n     tripling the amount of wind power it had originally sought \n     after seeing how low the bids came in last year.\n       ``Wind was on sale--it was a Blue Light Special,'' said Jay \n     Godfrey, managing director of renewable energy for the \n     company. He noted that Oklahoma, unlike many states, did not \n     require utilities to buy power from renewable sources.\n       ``We were doing it because it made sense for our \n     ratepayers,'' he said.\n       According to a study by the investment banking firm Lazard, \n     the cost of utility-scale solar energy is as low as 5.6 cents \n     a kilowatt-hour, and wind is as low as 1.4 cents. In \n     comparison, natural gas comes at 6.1 cents a kilowatt-hour on \n     the low end and coal at 6.6 cents. Without subsidies, the \n     firm's analysis shows, solar costs about 7.2 cents a \n     kilowatt-hour at the low end, with wind at 3.7 cents.\n       ``It is really quite notable, when compared to where we \n     were just five years ago, to see the decline in the cost of \n     these technologies,'' said Jonathan Mir, a managing director \n     at Lazard, which has been comparing the economics of power \n     generation technologies since 2008.\n       Mr. Mir noted there were hidden costs that needed to be \n     taken into account for both renewable energy and fossil \n     fuels. Solar and wind farms, for example, produce power \n     intermittently--when the sun is shining or the wind is \n     blowing--and that requires utilities to have power available \n     on call from other sources that can respond to fluctuations \n     in demand. Alternately, conventional power sources produce \n     pollution, like carbon emissions, which face increasing \n     restrictions and costs.\n       But in a straight comparison of the costs of generating \n     power, Mr. Mir said that the amount solar and wind developers \n     needed to earn from each kilowatt-hour they sell from new \n     projects was often ``essentially competitive with what would \n     otherwise be had from newly constructed conventional \n     generation.''\n       Experts and executives caution that the low prices do not \n     mean wind and solar farms can replace conventional power \n     plants anytime soon.\n       ``You can't dispatch it when you want to,'' said Khalil \n     Shalabi, vice president for energy market operations and \n     resource planning at Austin Energy, which is why the utility, \n     like others, still sees value in combined-cycle gas plants, \n     even though they may cost more. Nonetheless, he said, \n     executives were surprised to see how far solar prices had \n     fallen. ``Renewables had two issues: One, they were too \n     expensive, and they weren't dispatchable. They're not too \n     expensive anymore.''\n       According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the \n     main trade group, the price of electricity sold to utilities \n     under long-term contracts from large-scale solar projects has \n     fallen by more than 70 percent since 2008, especially in the \n     Southwest.\n       The average upfront price to install standard utility-scale \n     projects dropped by more than a third since 2009, with higher \n     levels of production.\n       The price drop extends to homeowners and small businesses \n     as well; last year, the prices for residential and commercial \n     projects fell by roughly 12 to 15 percent from the year \n     before.\n       The wind industry largely tells the same story, with prices \n     dropping by more than half in recent years. Emily Williams, \n     manager of industry data and analytics at the American Wind \n     Energy Association, a trade\n\n[[Page S6260]]\n\n     group, said that in 2013 utilities signed ``a record number \n     of power purchase agreements and what ended up being \n     historically low prices.''\n       Especially in the interior region of the country, from \n     North Dakota down to Texas, where wind energy is particularly \n     robust, utilities were able to lock in long contracts at 2.1 \n     cents a kilowatt-hour, on average, she said. That is down \n     from prices closer to 5 cents five years ago.\n       ``We're finding that in certain regions with certain wind \n     projects that these are competing or coming in below the cost \n     of even existing generation sources,'' she said.\n       Both industries have managed to bring down costs through a \n     combination of new technologies and approaches to financing \n     and operations. Still, the industries are not ready to give \n     up on their government supports just yet.\n       Already, solar executives are looking to extend a 30 \n     percent federal tax credit that is set to fall to 10 percent \n     at the end of 2016. Wind professionals are seeking renewal of \n     a production tax credit that Congress has allowed to lapse \n     and then reinstated several times over the last few decades.\n       Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, who for now leads \n     the Finance Committee, held a hearing in September over the \n     issue, hoping to push a process to make the tax treatment of \n     all energy forms more consistent.\n       ``Congress has developed a familiar pattern of passing \n     temporary extensions of those incentives, shaking hands and \n     heading home,'' he said at the hearing. ``But short-term \n     extensions cannot put renewables on the same footing as the \n     other energy sources in America's competitive marketplace.''\n       Where that effort will go now is anybody's guess, though, \n     with Republicans in control of both houses starting in \n     January.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

CAUDILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. \nJeff E. Caudill--a veteran and tireless public servant who passed away \nlast month at the age of 84.\n  Jeff was born in a log cabin in Viper, KY, on January 20, 1930. In \norder to help support himself and his family, he began work in the coal \nmines with his father and brothers at the age of 14.\n  Without a formal education past the seventh grade, Jeff decided to \njoin the U.S. Army, where he proudly served his country for 22 years \nthroughout both the Korean and Vietnam wars.\n  After his retirement from the military, Jeff moved back to Kentucky \nwhere he continued his service to the community in other ways. \nThroughout London, KY, he is known as ``Santa Jeff.'' Jeff was afforded \nthis nickname in part because his white beard gave him the ability to \nplay the part during the Christmas season, but also because he could be \ncounted on to serve his community in all seasons.\n  Jeff was known to organize clothing and food drives, make hospital \nvisits to the sick and elderly, and captain the Honor Guard at military \nfunerals. Whatever he could do to better the lives of others, you could \ncount on Jeff to deliver.\n  Jeff Caudill's life of service to his country, community, and family \nset a shining example for us all to follow. Therefore, I ask that my \nU.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring this exemplary citizen.\n  The London-area publication the Sentinel-Echo recently published an \narticle detailing the life of Mr. Caudill. I ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sentinel-Echo, Nov. 17, 2014]\n\n                            Remembering Jeff\n\n                           (By Nita Johnson)\n\n       One of the founding members of the Laurel-London Optimist \n     Club and ``Santa Jeff'' died suddenly at his home Friday \n     morning.\n       Jeff Caudill, best known for his efforts in founding the \n     local Optimist Club and for his many years of portraying \n     Santa Claus in the annual Christmas parade, had ongoing \n     health problems. In recent years, he had suffered two strokes \n     and a heart attack as well as kidney failure. His wife \n     Shirley said Caudill had breakfast Friday morning and was \n     planning his usual daily activities when he had ``a massive \n     heart attack'' that ended his life.\n       Caudill, 84, was instrumental in establishing the Laurel-\n     London Optimist Club. For many years, he hosted a Halloween \n     party at his home, giving away bicycles and cooking for \n     children of all ages--the predecessor of the current Optimist \n     Club Halloween party held each year. He served as president \n     of the local organization several times including twice as \n     the Honor Club and again as vice president. He served as Lt. \n     Governor for the Kentucky-West Virginia region and was named \n     Optimist of the Year both locally and throughout the \n     district. He was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award \n     in 2008 for his years of dedicated service to the Optimist \n     Club.\n       Caudill was also known throughout the community as ``Santa \n     Jeff'', posing with children at Walmart for yearly Christmas \n     pictures. He was hand-picked by former London-Laurel County \n     Chamber of Commerce executive director Randy Smith to portray \n     Santa Claus in the Christmas parade--a job that Caudill \n     thrived on each year. One year, however, Caudill was \n     hospitalized and was on life support and could not fulfill \n     his Santa duties.\n       ``The day of the parade, he had big tears running down his \n     face,'' his wife said. ``That's the only Christmas parade he \n     ever missed, once even putting on his Santa suit 10 days \n     after having surgery.''\n       In fact, Caudill had just had his Santa suit dry cleaned in \n     preparation for this year's Christmas parade. His bag was \n     already half-full of candy canes that he always gave out to \n     children.\n       ``He was one of 16 children. They didn't have Christmas,'' \n     Shirley said. ``He didn't get candy or clothes or toys. \n     That's why he worked so hard to make sure other children had \n     a Christmas.''\n       Caudill spent 22 years in the U.S. Army, 14 of which were \n     overseas. He served in Korea in 1947 before going to Japan a \n     year later. He was wounded during a battle but continued to \n     serve his country, moving his family to various military \n     posts across the world. After discharge, Caudill was \n     considered 100 percent disabled, but he continued to honor \n     military heroes through the Disabled American Veterans \n     organization where he served on the Color Guard and \n     participated in military funeral tributes.\n       Funeral arrangements for Jeff Caudill were pending at \n     London Funeral Home at press time Friday. Burial will be held \n     at Camp Nelson in Jessamine County. The family asks that in \n     lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Jeff Caudill \n     Optimist Scholarship fund to assist local students in their \n     college costs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/02/senate-section/article/S6260-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6260-S6261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING SALVATORE FERRARA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Its first candy \nwas\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\nconfetti, the candy-coated almonds served at Italian weddings, \nsymbolizing good luck. Nello Ferrara followed his dad into the \nbusiness.\n  It was Nello who invented the company's lip-puckering Lemonhead \ncandies. Little Sal was born with forceps, giving him a temporarily \nmisshapen head--``like a lemon,'' his dad said. And candy history was \nmade.\n  Nello Salvatore's military service in Japan after World War II \nprovided the inspiration for another company classic--Atomic Fireballs.\n  Sal II joined the family business in the mid seventies. Over the next \n40 years, the company would grow from 35 to more than 500 workers, and \nannual revenues soared from $3.5 million to $300 million. It also \nacquired another iconic candy: Gummy Bears.\n  Sal Ferrara died of esophageal cancer. His family said he hadn't \nsmoked since 1981. His doctor reportedly linked his cancer to acid \nreflux disease. He was too young--just 63 years old.\n  I want to offer my condolences to Mr. Ferrara's friends and family, \nespecially his wife Andrea, his children Alana, Lauren, Nello II, and \nErik, and his three grandchildren.\n  I join kids and former kids all over America in thanking Sal Ferrara \nand his family for so many sweet treats and happy memories.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/02/senate-section/article/S6261-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        RECOGNIZING DAVID GADIS\n\n Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today, I applaud David L. Gadis, \na lifelong Hoosier, for his induction into the Indiana Basketball Hall \nof Fame and for his civic leadership in the Indianapolis community.\n  Established in 1962, the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame is dedicated \nto recognizing Indiana's basketball legends and inspiring the future of \nbasketball in our State. Individuals are eligible for nomination 26 \nyears after playing high school basketball, and all nominees are \nevaluated by a statewide board of directors. In recognition of his \ncontributions to Indiana basketball, David Gadis was inducted into the \nIndiana Basketball Hall of Fame earlier this year.\n  Born and raised in northwest Indianapolis, David played in his first \ncompetitive basketball league at the age of 7 at Municipal Gardens, \nwhere he went on to win several AAU-level State championships and a few \nnational runner-up titles. While attending Pike High School, David \nbroke 15 school records, averaged 25 points per game during his senior \nyear, and scored 1,368 career points. David received a number of \nawards, including being named team MVP, Conference Player of the Year, \na Street & Smith Magazine All-American, and a 1980 Indiana All Star. \nHis success at Pike High School earned David a spot on the Southern \nMethodist University basketball team in Dallas, TX. As a senior and \nteam captain in 1984, David led his team in a successful 25 and 8 \nseason, earning a place in the NCAA Basketball Championship. More \nrecently, David was a member of the 2005 Indiana Basketball Hall of \nFame Silver Anniversary Team.\n  David's commitment to excellence extends beyond the court. After \ngraduating from Southern Methodist University with a degree in \nmarketing communication, David became vice president of shared services \nfor the Indianapolis Water Company, now Veolia Water Indianapolis, VWI. \nToday, David serves as executive vice president of sales, marketing and \ngovernment affairs for Veolia Water North America.\n  David has dedicated himself to positively impacting communities by \ncreating valuable relationships between public and private utility \nfirms, in order to ensure there are reliable and efficient utilities \nfor Hoosiers and our Nation. With David's leadership, VWI received the \nUnited States Conference of Mayors' 2006 Public/Private Partnership \nAward, as well as the mayor of Indianapolis' Celebration of Diversity \nAward and the Indiana Minority Supplier Development Council's Circle of \nExcellence Award a total of three times.\n  David has served on the boards of the Indianapolis Urban League, \nFifth Third Bank, Central Indiana Corporate Partnership, Indianapolis \nSports Corporation, Indiana Business Diversity Council, Greater \nIndianapolis Chamber of Commerce, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, the \nlocal Big Ten Basketball Tournament Committee, Indianapolis Downtown \nIncorporated, and is a member of the American Water Works Association.\n  David is a tireless advocate for Hoosiers and everyone he advises. \nWhether he is inspiring us with his skills on the basketball court or \ndeveloping better municipal infrastructure, David has demonstrated his \ndevotion to civic engagement, diversity, and making Indiana an even \nbetter place to live. I want to thank David Gadis for his commitment to \nthe city of Indianapolis and its surrounding communities and \ncongratulate him once again on his induction into the Indiana \nBasketball Hall of Fame and for all of his outstanding \nachievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/02/senate-section/article/S6261-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2455.
