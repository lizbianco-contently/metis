Well, Mr. President, Democratic leaders in Congress\n\n[[Page S7066]]\n\nfinally have their prize--a government shutdown that no one seems to \nwant but them. House Republicans worked late into the night this \nweekend to keep the government open, and Senate Democrats dragged their \nfeet literally for days. They refused to pass anything. News reports \nsuggest the majority leader was even working behind the scenes to block \nany bipartisan negotiations from taking place.\n  Then, after doing essentially nothing all weekend but obstruct, with \njust hours left to go, Democrats voted again and again to reject \nreasonable legislation. Every piece of legislation the House sent over \nwould have kept the government from shutting down--every single one of \nthem. Each one represented more of a compromise than the last. And get \nthis: Last night Senate Democrats went so far as to reject legislation \nthat would have kept the government running under just two conditions--\njust two--that families get the same 1-year relief as employers and \nthat Congress has to follow the same rules on the ObamaCare exchanges \nas their constituents. That is how extreme the Democratic position is. \nThey won't even accept basic fairness as a principle under ObamaCare.\n  Today they have gone even further. They have now said they won't even \nagree to sit down and work out differences. They won't even talk about \nit. They literally just voted against working out a compromise. They \nseem completely opposed to negotiation or compromise on a law that is \nkilling jobs, driving up premiums, and driving people out of the health \ncare plans they already have and like, and they do not even want to \ntalk about it.\n  So we know the Democrats who have shut down the government will yell \nand point fingers. They have already started that particular routine. \nThey will say it was the mean old Republicans or the tea party or FOX \nNews or maybe even George W. Bush. They shut down the government, and \nnow they are praying the American people will think somebody else is \nresponsible. They are doing this because they would rather see the \ngovernment shut down than do anything to protect the American people \nfrom the consequences of ObamaCare despite the stories we see every \nsingle day about the pain this law is causing all of our constituents.\n  Now, I will say this: I appreciate yesterday's bipartisan action to \nensure that servicemembers currently defending us are going to be paid \non time. The brave men and women who defend our country deserve no \nless. But now we need to do the same for the rest of the American \npeople.\n  The House legislation has been perfectly reasonable. It didn't have \neverything Republicans wanted. It didn't have everything Democrats \nwanted. But it represented compromise, and it reflected the will of the \nAmerican people, who don't want a government shutdown and who want to \ntap the brakes on ObamaCare--good folks who just think the middle class \ndeserves a bit of a break. Senate Democrats could have passed any one \nof those compromises and averted this mess. Instead, they chose to shut \ndown the government.\n  Well, it is past time for Senate Democrats to listen to the American \npeople. The House has already done its job to fund the government again \nand again and again.\n  I know the Democrats who run Washington want to extract as many \npolitical points as they can from this manufactured shutdown, but they \nowe our country more than that. They need to understand that ObamaCare \nis not ready for prime time--not ready for prime time. Their stubborn \nrefusal to even discuss temporary relief for the middle class was a \nstaggering act of political arrogance. So this morning I am calling on \nthe Democrats who run the Senate to sit down with the House and \nnegotiate, to come to a reasonable solution that cancels their shutdown \nand pass it because no one wants a shutdown, it seems, but our friends \non the other side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend the Republican leader spoke as if \nGeorge Orwell wrote his speech. This is ``1984,'' where up is down, \ndown is up, east is west. All one needs to do is look at the press. We \nhave a situation where we have a good day for the anarchists. Why? \nBecause the government is closed. Speaker Boehner and his band of tea \nparty radicals have done the unthinkable: They have shut down the \nFederal Government. Now, for us, that is hard to comprehend as being \ngood. For them, they like it.\n  In Nevada today--7 o'clock in the morning out there--they are closing \nthe Great Basin National Park. There will be some security folks \naround, but the visitor center will be closed. The Lake Mead National \nRecreation Area in Las Vegas where we have 600,000 people a year \nvisit--not anymore--it will be closed. The Red Rock Canyon National \nConservation Area--over 1 million people go there every year. No, the \nvisitor center will be closed.\n  This situation involves people who work cleaning offices, people who \nare security folks for our Federal buildings--they will probably be \nable to hang around--people who really need a job. I talked last week a \nlittle on the floor about a woman who came to my event last Thursday. \nShe works for the National Park Service. She has worked there all of \nher adult life. She knows what it is like to have a government shutdown \nbecause she was there when the last one occurred. They never got that \nmoney back. She is struggling because she doesn't make that much money, \nand now her job is gone. It is that way all over America. And why? To \nextract political concessions through hostage-taking over one issue--\none issue--ObamaCare.\n  The exchanges in Nevada kick in today. Approximately 600,000 Nevadans \nwill be eligible for ObamaCare. These are 600,000 people who have no \nhealth insurance. Today they can search around on the exchanges that \nhave been developed there by a Republican Governor, and they can get a \npolicy for as little as $100 a month--$100 a month--and then if they \nget hurt they can go see a doctor or go to a hospital and not be \nembarrassed because they have no money.\n  What the American people must understand is that the House of \nRepresentatives did not close the government. It was the Republicans in \nthe House of Representatives who closed the government. The House of \nRepresentatives has 435 Members, but, no, they were not allowed to vote \non keeping the government open; they are so fixated on ObamaCare. But \nthat is happening all over America today, and that is one thing not \nbeing heard. The President has said it is going forward full bore, and \nthat is welcome news for as many as 30 million people in America who \nhave no health insurance. So Members of the House of Representatives \nwere unable to vote to keep the government open--only the Republicans.\n  Patty Murray, who is from the State of Washington and is chair of the \nBudget Committee, has worked hard, leading the Senate in passing a \nbudget. She did that 6 months ago. The budget she passed is different \nfrom the one that passed the House of Representatives.\n  For generations, for hundreds of years in the Congress of the United \nStates, when there have been two separate pieces of legislation, we \nhave gone to conference. This is something you learn about in \nelementary school. When the House has passed something and the Senate \nhas passed something, what do you do? You sit down together in an open \nforum and work out the differences. That is how we have always done \nit--until the tea party took over.\n  Senator Murray has asked to go to conference 18 times. The senior \nSenator from Arizona has asked eight times himself. By the way, the \nsenior Senator from Arizona is a Republican. But there has been an \nobjection. No conference. And this has gone on for 6 months. But as the \nclock ticked past midnight and the Federal Government officially barred \nthe doors and hung a ``closed for business'' sign out, Speaker Boehner \ndemanded the very conference they have shunned us on for 6 months. This \ndisplay, I would hope, would be embarrassing to House Republicans and \nSenate Republicans. What a deal.\n  So I say to the Speaker: We are happy to negotiate a budget. We have \nbeen trying to for months. And we have not only Senator Murray, who has \nbeen anxious to get to the budget, but we have had Senator Mikulski, a \npowerful chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who can't do \nanything until we get a budget. So if the House passes the piece of \nlegislation they have over there to keep the country\n\n[[Page S7067]]\n\nfunctioning again, to reopen government, we will be happy to go to \nconference. Why wouldn't we? We have been trying to do it for 6 months. \nHopefully that would lead to a long-term responsible budget agreement \nwith our Republican counterparts. That is what conferences are all \nabout. We have been asking to do that for months and months--but not \nwith the government closed.\n  Every day that the Speaker refuses to pass the bill they have over \nthere, the resolution they have over there, and reopen the government, \nthe American economy loses billions of dollars--billions of dollars.\n  The conservative business community has warned of the grave \nconsequence of this shutdown. This shutdown couldn't come at a worse \ntime, just as the economy is beginning to gain steam. The shutdown has \nfurloughed half of the civilian workforce. At Nellis Air Force Base, \none of the largest military installations in America, the civilian \nworkforce there is coming to work today to close their offices. There \nare some exceptions, but certainly three-quarters of them.\n  The Centers for Disease Control has basically ceased their functions \nas to what happens if there is a bad flu epidemic someplace or some \nkind of an outbreak that they control.\n  Checks will go out for Social Security and our disabled veterans will \nget their checks. But if you have just come back from Afghanistan or \nIraq, sorry, no new applications will be received. No passport \napplications will be processed. That is pretty important for tourist \neconomies such as Las Vegas. No small business loans will be issued. We \ntalked about the national parks. Millions of Federal workers will be \nsent home without pay. Thousands and thousands in Nevada are sitting \nhome today, waiting for Congress to act.\n  As this economic reality kicks in, we need the Republicans also to \nkick in as to what is reality. I have had a number of Republican \nSenators come to me and say, You have got to give them something on \nObamaCare. What is wrong with this picture? What is wrong with the \nfixation on a law of this country that has been a law for 4 years? I \nremind everyone again, the United States Supreme Court said it is \nconstitutional. What is wrong with this picture: We will be happy if \nyou give us something to hurt ObamaCare?\n  No matter how many times they try to extort the American people and \nthe Democrats here in the Senate, we are not going to relitigate the \nhealth care issue. We are not going to do that. If they have problems \nwith that bill, we will be happy to sit down and talk with them about a \nreasonable approach. But we are not going to do it with a gun to the \nheads of the American people.\n  Frankly, it is too late to avert the worst effects of the shutdown, \nbut it is not too late to send the Federal employees back to work. The \nsolution is as clear this morning as it was last night: Reopen the \ngovernment. Let all 435 Members of the House of Representatives vote on \nthe legislation they have from us. Then if they want to sit down in a \nsensible way and talk about Patty Murray's budget, we will do that; if \nthey want to talk about the appropriations bills of Senator Mikulski, \nwe will do that--as soon as the House takes a simple, reasonable \naction; that is, put the American Federal workers back on the job and \nwe can begin the process of negotiating a long-term budget deal. We \nhave been trying to do it for 6 months through the regular order of \nconference committee and continue to want to do that. But there is no \ntime to waste. Every minute the Federal Government is closed shuts down \nAmerican families, it costs jobs. Every week the Federal Government is \nshut down, the economy loses more than $30 billion. It is time for \nRepublicans to stop obsessing over old battles.\n  I say to my Republican friends, ObamaCare is over. It has passed. It \nis the law. And all over America today and for the next 3 months \nmillions of people will sign up. Remember what I said about Nevada: You \ncan buy a policy in Nevada for $100 a month. In the State of Alaska, I \nwas told there is no premium. It varies State to State. People who have \nnever had health insurance will be able to get it.\n  I talked here on the floor 1 or 2 days ago. I know what it is like \nnot to have the ability to go to a doctor or hospital. I know that. \nPeople have to understand that is not good. It is hard when you or a \nloved one is hurt or sick and you have nowhere to go. That is what this \nis all about.\n  I have respect and admiration for my Republican friends. Every one of \nthem is an accomplished person or they wouldn't be in the Senate. But \ndon't say to me that we are happy to open the government if you give us \nan arrow we can put in our quiver and say we hurt ObamaCare. It is the \nlaw.\n  I repeat what is a fact: The Republicans hated Social Security and \nthey hated Medicare. How do people feel about Social Security and \nMedicare today? They feel really good. And that is the same with \nObamaCare. People understand how good ObamaCare has been already if you \nare old and want to get a wellness check or if you have to buy \npharmaceuticals. In the sparsely populated State of Nevada they have \nsaved millions of dollars on drugs because of ObamaCare. You can stay \non your parents' health insurance until you are 26 years old. That is a \npretty good deal. You can finish college, maybe even start your life \nand not have to worry about that.\n  People got refunds in Nevada and around the country. Why? Because as \npart of ObamaCare, Al Franken from Minnesota stuck a provision in the \nbill--that at least most of us voted for--saying if an insurance \ncompany doesn't provide 80 percent of their premium for health care, to \nhaving people get better, then they have to refund that money. This \nyear, all over America hundreds of millions of dollars were refunded to \npeople because insurance companies didn't spend 80 percent toward \nhaving people get well. They gave bonuses and all kinds of overhead \nthat weren't fair. ObamaCare is so important.\n  I say to my friends here in Congress, how many people have come up to \nthem someplace and said, Thank goodness for ObamaCare. My daughter is a \ndiabetic, and now we don't have to worry about her. She is insured.\n  I have had someone tell me--and this is why I usually include this in \nmy remarks--I have a son who is an epileptic. Has anyone ever seen \nsomeone with an epileptic seizure, your little child, and you can't get \nhealth care because they have a preexisting disability? That is what \nObamaCare is all about. You can't be denied insurance if you have a \nchild who is an epileptic.\n  We will negotiate, as we have, on going to the budget and talking \nabout a long-term agreement here. We have tried. The President has \ntried. They are only concerned about ObamaCare--ObamaCare--because they \nknow that everything they do to try to throw monkey wrenches into the \nwheels of government as far as ObamaCare is good for the people who \ndon't believe in government. They want it to fail. That is why they are \ndoing all this. Each day that goes by--and now it is harder and harder, \nbecause on October 1 the exchanges are open. There will be a few \nglitches and there will be changes. That is the way it was with Social \nSecurity. That is the way it was with Medicare. But by the first of the \nyear when millions of people are signed up on health insurance, it is \ngood for everybody and it is good for America. And it is good for \nAmerica because our country--this great country--will no longer be the \nonly industrialized nation that doesn't have health care for everyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I won't be long, I say to my colleagues. I wish to thank \nour Leader Reid for bringing back a sense of history, for putting this \nfight over the new health care law into context.\n  I did some research on what Republicans said about Social Security \nwhen it came up before in the Senate and the House: This is the end of \nthe world. It was socialism. It was going to destroy mankind. I have \nthe quotes. They are in the Record.\n  No, Social Security proved to be the most successful antipoverty \nprogram in America. People love it. But they keep trying to take it \naway.\n  Under George W. Bush they tried to privatize it and we Democrats \nstopped it. Then you go look to the 1960s when Lyndon Johnson talked \nabout Medicare and the fact that our grandmas and grandpas at that time \nwere being supported by their children because there was no health \ninsurance available. This was the end of the world. Even Bob\n\n[[Page S7068]]\n\nDole in the 1990s said, I was there fighting against Medicare. Bob \nDole, a wonderful man, a Republican: I was fighting against socialism. \nAnd now even tea party members put signs up: Don't touch my Medicare.\n  So now we have the next reform, the Affordable Care Act. Republicans \nhave called it ObamaCare. The President embraces it. In California \ntoday people are so excited. Millions of Californians who are uninsured \nwill have the chance to get affordable health care. And, I might say, \nyou go to coveredca.com, and you see the platinum plans that are the \nmore expensive plans, you see the bronze plans, the least expensive, \nthe silver plan. Who is going up there? Not people who already have \ninsurance--it is about 80 percent--but those who don't. And in my \nState, the working poor will have a chance to get a Medicaid card.\n  Thank God we have a Governor and a legislature with compassion, \nunlike other States where the Governors are saying, No, we don't care; \nwe think it is going to cost too much. Well, the fact is we know, and \nthe reason the Affordable Care Act ObamaCare saves a lot of money over \ntime is because people get the health care they need and they get it \nearly.\n  We have a horrible day here today. I have 169,000 Federal employees, \nand about 80,000 of them are going to get furloughed. These are hard-\nworking, good people who work for the Border Patrol, who work for the \nFBI, who work for NASA, who work for the National Park Service, who \nkeep our Federal buildings clean and open, scientists, caseworkers who \ndo important Social Security cases, Medicare cases, food inspectors, \nsmall business loan officers so important to the small business \ncommunity--they are going to pack up and go home. To my Republican \nfriends who brought this Republican shutdown, these are hard-working \npeople.\n  I don't have one Republican on my bill who would take away our pay in \na shutdown. Not one Republican. But they are ready to take away \neverybody else's pay. As a matter of fact, yesterday--to a person--they \nvoted to take away the employer contribution from their own staff for \nthe health care. I couldn't believe it. By the way, they don't need a \nlaw to do it. Senator Vitter's bill: Take away your health care--you \ndon't need to take that employer's share. Give it back to the \ngovernment. Call in your staff if you think they deserve this treatment \nand tell them you are going to reduce their salaries, and send the \ncheck back to the government. You don't need legislation to do it. That \nis how mean-spirited it is around here. So we face a nonsensical \nshutdown.\n  I want to talk about exactly where we are. The House sent us a 6-week \nbill that keeps the government going at certain levels of spending. \nThen the Republicans say, well, the Democrats won't compromise. I have \nnews for the Republicans. We don't like those numbers in that \ncontinuing resolution. We think they are way too low. We think they are \nhurting the economic recovery. We see the deficit's down by 50 \npercent. We don't have to bring about this austerity. We think it is \nhurting jobs and the economy, but that is not enough for them.\n\n  They have a victory on the number, but they want to add other things \nto the budget that have nothing to do with the budget and have \neverything to do with their obsession with repealing health care \nreform, just like the Republican Party has had an obsession for years. \nI forgot to say, remember Newt Gingrich's famous line on Medicare, ``It \nis going to wither on the vine'' and Paul Ryan's budget, which \ndestroyed Medicare as we know it.\n  It is our main responsibility to keep the government going, to pay \nour bills. Instead of sending us a clean bill, they send us a bill with \nlower numbers than we want, we accept the numbers, and then they tack \non these mean-spirited amendments to hurt people--with the exception of \nthe repeal of the medical device tax, which would blow a $30 billion \nhole in our deficit. They repeal it. They have no way of making up for \nthat money that would be lost to the Treasury.\n  I could not believe it. Yesterday, their first take was to take away \nwomen's health care. Three of us went up to the gallery and we said: \nYou continue your war on women. They actually, in the House, repealed \nan existing law that gives women cancer screening, gestational diabetes \nscreening, and making sure they have the correct supplies and the \ncounseling to breast-feed their children, and birth control. They \nactually took that out, repealed it. We went up to the gallery. They \nleft that little thing alone. They gave up on that.\n  But what are they doing now? Now they are saying their own employees \nhave no right to an employer contribution. This is mean-spirited. This \nis hurtful. Send us a clean CR for 6 weeks and then vote to go to the \nbudget conference, as Senator Murray has asked. But Senator Cruz keeps \nappearing on the scene and objecting to appointing conferees to deal \nwith the yearly budget because he says he doesn't want to have them \ndiscuss the debt. Who is he to say what you can discuss or not discuss? \nThe last time I checked, there is free speech in this country, \nincluding in a conference committee.\n  That leads me to think they are going to play even worse games with \nthe debt ceiling, about which Ronald Reagan--who asked for it and got, \n18 times, an increase in the debt ceiling--said even thinking about \ndefaulting is a horrible and dangerous thing. No President has had this \nkind of difficulty. They are obsessed with the health care law and they \nare obsessed with hurting this President.\n  Let's face facts. I have served with five Presidents; three of them \nwere Republicans. Did I agree with everything Ronald Reagan believed \nin? The Presiding Officer and I served in those years together. \nRemember those days of the nuclear weapons proliferation? We had our \nbattles and, yes, we made a symbolic vote once in a while not to raise \nthe debt ceiling. That is fine. But we never purposely brought down the \ngovernment, ever--ever. The last time Newt Gingrich and the Republicans \ndid it, it was a disaster and they have done it again.\n  I listened to the majority leader. The majority leader said the \nRepublican leader's tale and his spin is similar to the book ``1984.'' \nLet me just say, it is ``Alice in Wonderland.'' It is not accurate.\n  Let's pass the bill we sent over, the clean CR for 6 weeks. Let's go \nto a budget conference. Let's resolve our problems. This is too great a \ncountry to have us suffer like this, a self-inflicted wound that does \nnot have to be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if we need evidence that there is a \nparallel universe in America today, on one hand is Washington, DC, and \nthe bubble that seems to occur around this place, and then the rest of \nAmerica. If we need evidence of that parallel universe, all we need to \ndo is listen to the comments of the majority leader this morning who \nsaid, in the presence of these folks in the gallery in the Senate, \n``The government is shut down. The government is shut down.''\n  That is clearly false. You know what. There are a lot of Americans \nwho think that Washington is a train hurtling down the track, out of \ncontrol. Who can blame them? When they look at our national debt, $17 \ntrillion, more than $50,000 for every man, woman, and child in America; \nwhen they see our unsustainable programs such as Medicare and Social \nSecurity, which the majority leader and the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia hold so dear--we do too. Those are important programs. So \nwhy would we not want to try to fix them?\n  The most amazing thing I heard today is the majority leader said that \nObamaCare is sacrosanct. It is the law of the land. You cannot touch \nit. Over the last 3 years the Obama administration has repeatedly and \nunilaterally issued waivers, granted exemptions, and announced delays \nrelating to this sacrosanct law known as ObamaCare. Since when is it \nbeyond the power of the Congress to change existing law by amending it \nor repealing it or defunding it? It is absolutely unprecedented to have \na majority leader of the Senate, someone who knows this institution as \nwell as anyone, say Congress is powerless to act when our constituents \ntell us they want us to act because they do not believe ObamaCare will \nperform as advertised.\n  The best evidence is the unilateral actions of the President of the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S7069]]\n\nStates, who granted waivers, exemptions, and delays for his preferred \nconstituents. Meanwhile, the rest of America has to live with this \nmonstrosity that will not work as advertised. Again, all we have to do \nis compare the President's promises to what has actually happened. He \nsaid if you like what you have you can keep it. That is not true. \nMillions of Americans are being dropped from their employer-provided \ncoverage into the exchanges they do not want to be on because they \nwould prefer to have their employer-provided coverage. When the \nPresident says the average family will see a reduction in their health \ncare premiums of $2,500, that is not true because they have actually \ngone up, on average, $2,400. For many young people, such as my \ndaughters, they are going to have to pay more so my generation will \nhave to pay less, even though they do not need the government-approved, \ngold-plated health care plan, nor want it, nor can afford it.\n  We know that ObamaCare is, in the words of some of the leaders of \norganized labor, doing permanent damage to full-time work because \npeople are being moved from full-time work to part-time work in order \nto avoid the employer sanctions, and it is doing damage to our broader \neconomy. All of us have listened to the small business men and women \nfor whom we work, who are our constituents, who say: We cannot afford \nObamaCare, so we are not going to hire more people. In fact, we are \ngoing to cut back in order to avoid some of the sanctions associated \nwith it or, you know what. At some point I am tired of working for the \ngovernment instead of working for myself, my family, so I am just going \nto close business and shut her down.\n  Despite all that, the majority leader has the temerity to come on the \nSenate floor and say this is the law of the land; we can't touch it; it \nis perfect, couldn't be better. That is like whistling past the \ngraveyard. Senate Democrats have refused to make any changes \nwhatsoever, even in those provisions they themselves believe are flawed \nor defective in ObamaCare. They are refusing to abolish the medical \ndevice tax, which is a job killer and kills medical innovation that \nsaves lives, even though 79 Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, \nvoted against the medical device tax on the budget resolution.\n  They are refusing to delay the individual mandate, even though the \nPresident of the United States has given businesses a 1-year delay in \nthe employer sanction. Yet Democrats voted against delaying the \nindividual mandate for average Americans. How can that be fair?\n  Most remarkably, when it comes to the ObamaCare exchanges, Senate \nDemocrats have toed the line--you might say walked the plank last \nnight, at the insistence of the majority leader--and they refused to \ntreat Members of Congress the same as all other Americans. That is what \none of the votes we had last night did.\n  If I were a Democrat running for reelection in red States in 2014, I \nwould be very worried about that. This is a toxic vote for them because \nAmericans, although they may not be able to quote Federalist 57, know \nwhat it says in their hearts and spirits because it is fundamental to \nour democracy; that is, that Members of Congress should be treated no \ndifferently, certainly no better, than the rest of America when it \ncomes to the law of the land. Those who cast that vote, who walked that \nplank last night, will be held accountable in the 2014 election.\n  You know what. I believe all of this points to the fact that the \nmajority leader and President Obama want a government shutdown because \nthey are reading some of the polls that say they think this will \nbenefit them politically. They are willing to risk a shutdown of the \nFederal Government in order to gain political advantage. I am not so \nsure about that. I certainly did not believe that a shutdown--it was \nnot my first choice. I thought surely cooler heads would prevail. When \nit came to the individual mandate, when it came to the medical device \ntax, when it came to eliminating the special carve-out for Congress, \nsurely we can find some common ground somewhere. When there is plenty \nof evidence that the President and his administration have acknowledged \nthe flaws and the defects and the unkept promises of ObamaCare, surely \nwe could find somewhere we could find common ground.\n  Our colleagues in the House have now passed multiple bills to keep \nthe government open and allow ObamaCare to remain funded, even though \nclearly our first choice is to repeal and replace this devastating \nlegislation which is killing jobs, running up costs, and falling out of \nfavor with even its most ardent advocates such as organized labor. \nUnfortunately, the Democratic Party, from the President of the United \nStates to the majority leader of the Senate, to all Democrats in this \nbody, have become the party of no: no compromise, no negotiations, no \nchanges. It is all perfect. We would not change a thing. Life is good.\n  But the Government shuts down and invariably some people get hurt. \nThe President of the United States was thinking about holding a meeting \nof congressional leaders at the White House. The report in one of the \nnewspapers in Washington is Senator Reid, the majority leader of the \nSenate, shut it down. The President wanted to demonstrate some \nleadership. He should demonstrate some leadership. People expect \nleadership out of the President of the United States, but Harry Reid \nshut it down. So Harry Reid shut down the Government and got what he \nwanted.\n  I think it is about time the President overrule Harry Reid. He was \nelected by the American people. For many of us he was our second \nchoice, but he is the President of the United States. He needs to \ndemonstrate some leadership. Instead, the Democrats have doubled down \non their strategy, hoping to gain political advantage at the expense of \nthe people hurt. The shutdown was not my first choice, but there are \nmany of my constituents who are calling me, telling me: Look, we are \nworried. We are scared about our future. We are scared not only about \nour ability to find jobs, we are scared about our children and their \nfuture. My generation was the beneficiary of the sacrifice and hard \nwork of the greatest generation, the World War II generation, people \nwho risked everything so we might have a better life.\n  I am hearing from a number of my constituents back home, and they are \nsaying, look, we are willing to risk some hardship if that is what it \ntakes to get the American people, the Democratic Party, and the \nPresident to wake up and say: We need to work together and fix these \nproblems that we all know exist, the national debt, lower median \nincome, unsustainable Medicare and Social Security, for which the \nDemocrats offer only higher taxes and more regulation. No wonder the \neconomy is growing so slowly. The triple whammy is ObamaCare, which is \nkilling jobs and hurting the economy.\n  We can do better than that, and we certainly can by working together. \nNow is the time for the President to call that meeting in the Oval \nOffice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the process has \nfailed us in the last week for my friends in the House and in the \nSenate who, as I did, when we ran for these jobs, said we would do \neverything we could possibly do to not go down this path where the \ngovernment gets between people and their doctor. Those are heartfelt \nand sincere views. If we were in the majority and had a President on \nour side, we would have already taken care of this issue.\n  For those who mistakenly thought if we didn't have any appropriations \nbill that somehow the President's health care plan wouldn't move \nforward, we now see today that was a mistaken view of what would \nhappen. Most of the President's health care spending is mandatory. It \nis something the Congress doesn't even vote on. The way not to move \nforward is to change the law, but we have not had any opportunity to \nchange this law. We didn't have an opportunity when the Presiding \nOfficer and I served in the House together to change the law. This is a \nlaw that never was amendable on the floor of the Senate or the House.\n  It is hard to imagine that we have decided to restructure 1/16th of \nthe whole economy and everybody's health care relationships without \never having a chance to amend the law. Surely my friends on the other \nside who have supported this bill, are supportive of this\n\n[[Page S7070]]\n\nlaw, understand the frustration we have when there has never been a \npossibility to bring an amendment to the law and say: Let's see if we \ncan't make this part of it work better.\n  What was the amendment yesterday? The amendment yesterday to the law \nthat the House offered the Senate--the principal amendment was: Let's \nnot have the individual penalty for a year. The President, on his own, \ndecided we won't have the corporate penalty for a year, that we \nwouldn't have the business penalty for a year. This is sort of a \nstrange place for us to wind up. On this side of the Senate we are \nsaying: Don't give job creators--we like to talk about job creators on \nthis side of the Senate aisle--a break and not give people working at \nthose jobs a break.\n  The President, on his own, can apparently amend the law without us. \nThis is also pretty unusual, that the President, on his own, without \nus, thinks he can amend the law, but we have no avenue to amend the \nlaw. The President, on his own, said: We are going to eliminate the \ncorporate penalty. We are going to say that for this first year, \nbusinesses that have more than 50 employees don't have to offer \ninsurance or pay a penalty; that is what the law says was supposed to \nhappen on January 1. But the President said: No, we are not going to do \nthat; that is too hard to do. We are going to take a $12 billion hit in \nfunding this program because that is what the estimated penalties might \nhave been. Frankly, that might have been low because a lot of \nbusinesses that were offering insurance I think will not offer \ninsurance when we get into the requirement to offer insurance.\n  I think that was probably a low number, but it was a number. It was \n$12 billion. Our friends in the House sent something over here that \nsaid: If we are going to waive $12 billion, let's waive $4 billion. \nLet's waive the penalty for individuals if they don't have insurance. \nBy the way, many of those individuals were led by this law to believe \nthey were going to get insurance at work. The President said there is \nno penalty for not offering insurance at work for this first year, but \nwe are still going to penalize individuals who don't have it. If you \nare an individual and for whatever reason you can't afford or don't \nhave insurance, you will have a $95 penalty the first year, and it goes \nup after that. That was a chance to amend the law in the right way. The \nHouse would have voted, the Senate would have voted, and the President \nwould have signed a bill. Imagine that. The House votes, the Senate \nvotes, and the President signs a bill. I think that is the way the \nprocess is supposed to work. How we could have a $12 billion waiver for \nthe employer and have a $4 billion penalty for the employee doesn't \nmake any sense to me.\n  This law was not amendable, so, sure, would it be better not to amend \nit on a resolution to support the government? Absolutely that would \nhave been better. Would it have been better for the Senate to pass a \nsingle appropriations bill of the 12 that were supposed to be passed \nbefore the spending year begins? Absolutely. That would have been a lot \nbetter. Would it have been better for the Senate to prioritize \nanything?\n  Senator Mikulski, the chairman of my committee, the Appropriations \nCommittee, as was mentioned earlier, voted out most of the bills. Some \nof them were voted out on a partisan vote, some of them were voted out \non a bipartisan vote, but only one got here, and it was one the leader \nknew couldn't possibly pass. So we haven't passed one bill. It would \nhave been better to do it that way. We wouldn't be at this moment if in \nfact we passed the appropriations bills and agreed with the Senate.\n  Then the majority leader talks about the hardworking chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and said we can't do our work because we don't have a \nbudget conference. Last year the majority leader said we don't even \nneed a budget. It is too late for the budget. The spending year has \nbegun. That was months ago when that should have happened. Why didn't \nthat happen? Because the House passed a budget that obeyed the law and \nthe law says we can't spend more than $967 billion. That is the law, \nlike it or not. Just like on my side of this discussion, ObamaCare is \nthe law, like it or not.\n  Apparently that is a law we have to enforce, but we don't have to \nenforce the Budget Control Act because the Senate budget was over $1 \ntrillion--$1.038 trillion was the Senate budget. Of course we are not \ngoing to have an agreement if we are $70 billion or $80 billion apart \nand one side obeys the law and the other doesn't.\n  Essentially for a week now Republicans in the House have been \nnegotiating with themselves because there is nobody who is willing to \nnegotiate. The President says negotiating on the debt ceiling is \nblackmail. It has never been blackmail before. In fact, we wouldn't \nhave the Budget Control Act if we hadn't negotiated on the debt \nceiling.\n  So it is blackmail to negotiate? This is a process where the House, \nthe Senate, and the President are supposed to work together to move \nforward. The debt ceiling has been used over and over to talk about \nspending. It has been used a number of times to talk about things that \nweren't spending. Usually Congress is controlled by Democrats with \nRepublican Presidents. And they said, ok, the President doesn't want to \ntalk about this issue without the debt ceiling, so we are going to add \nit to the debt ceiling discussion. But more often than that, it has \nbeen used to talk about spending.\n  If you go to the banker and say: I have spent all the money you have \ngiven me, used up my line of credit, so I would like to extend the line \nof credit, I guarantee your banker will say either no, you have already \nexceeded what we told you you could borrow from us to spend, or if we \nare going to do that, let's talk about your spending habits. Show me a \nplan that shows you will spend differently in the future than you spend \nnow. But the President says that is blackmail. More than anybody else \nin the United States of America, the President of the United States is \nin a position to figure out what he is for that the Congress would be \nwilling to do. That is not happening, and that has not happened.\n  There is plenty of blame for the fact that there is no funding today, \nbut there are also plenty of victims. Everybody who depends on the \ngovernment is a victim. Social Security checks are going to go out, but \nyou can't apply for Social Security if you don't have it. If your check \nis lost or didn't go out, you can't find out why that happened. People \nin harm's way: The border control agents, the Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement people are out there, but their paycheck for their family \nis not coming.\n  How could we have solved that yesterday? I am confident that one of \nthe ways we could have solved that is by saying, okay, we won't collect \nthis $4 billion from individuals just as we are not collecting the $12 \nbillion from companies.\n  The reason this health care law continues to be such a problem is it \nwas never amendable, and it was never discussed. Even the President \nsaid, as he does some of these unilateral things, if this were a normal \ncircumstance, I would go to Congress and ask them to change the law, \nbut it is not a normal circumstance. I can't find that anywhere in the \nConstitution where the President gets to decide if the Constitution \napplies or doesn't apply.\n  Everybody is to blame here because the Congress is not doing the work \nCongress is supposed to do and the President is not leading. Americans \nare going to suffer because the Congress and the President haven't done \ntheir job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, as my colleague from Missouri said, as \nwe are here on the floor today, much of the Federal Government has been \nshut down. It is shut down because of the Democrats' unwillingness to \ncompromise on keeping the government open and delivering fairness to \nall Americans.\n  While employers got a pass from the President on his health care law, \nthe American people still face a mandate that they start signing up for \nWashington-approved health insurance and the exchange is open today. \nThe House of Representatives took the reasonable and responsible step \nof keeping the government open while eliminating the health care law's \nunfairness.\n  It is unfair that the mandate for health care law will not be delayed \nfor individuals for a year but does delay the mandate for businesses. \nIt is also\n\n[[Page S7071]]\n\nunfair to refuse to eliminate special exemptions under the health care \nlaw for Members of Congress. That wasn't in the health care law at all. \nYet the President has granted special exemptions that I believe show \nthe unfairness of the approach by the Democrats.\n  President Obama saw that other parts of the health care law won't \nwork and weren't ready. He has currently signed seven different bills \nwhich will repeal and defund other parts of his law. In the interest of \nfairness, he should deal with these parts that are seen all across the \ncountry as very unfair.\n  The President has allowed exemptions and changed the laws for \nspecific groups. He has delayed the employer mandate for a year. The \nquestion is: Why does he oppose delaying the individual mandate for a \nyear as well? Why do the bosses get an exemption but not the workers? \nThat is what someone asked me at a health fair in Lovell, WY, over this \npast weekend.\n  The American people already know the health care law is unaffordable, \nunworkable, unpopular, and now families are also saying the health care \nlaw is unfair. The House has asked us to treat all Americans fairly, \nbut the President and the majority leader refuse to do that. If you \nlook at their rhetoric over the past week or so, Washington Democrats \nseemed eager for a government shutdown. Well, they got their wish. \nMeanwhile, the administration is still promising people great benefits \nfrom the new government-run health insurance exchanges. Today hard-\nworking Americans get to see which promises are kept and which have \nbeen broken. I think what people are going to learn today can be summed \nup in two words: Buyer beware.\n  Here is how the Wall Street Journal put it yesterday. This is their \nfront-page article: ``Late Snags on Eve of Health Rollout.''\n  The article says the Obama administration officials are scrambling to \nget the health law's insurance marketplaces ready to open on Tuesday \nbut keep hitting technical problems, while government-funded field \nworkers across the country say they are not fully prepared to help \nAmericans enroll in the program.\n  The reports in the news today show a system failure across the \ncountry as the exchange goes live. Remember what the President said in \nhis address to the Nation Saturday. He said they are opening on Tuesday \nno matter what--no matter what, they are opening today.\n  Well, I think the people across the country are going to have more \nthan just technical problems. First of all, people are going to see \nsignificantly higher costs. Last week, the President promised to give \nAmericans, and I quote, ``high-quality affordable health care for less \nthan their cell phone bill.''\n  Remember, the average monthly cell phone bill is $71. In Cheyenne, \nWY, the least expensive plan a 27-year-old man can buy will be \n$271. The President said less than $71. Why is it $271 a month in \nCheyenne, WY? And that is for a healthy 27-year-old. So before the \nhealth care law, before the exchanges, they could buy a plan such as \nthat for $82; now, $271--a lot more than a cell phone bill.\n\n  The White House isn't even disputing anymore that prices will be \nhigher for many people. Now the White House is arguing that consumers \nwill spend more, but they will get, as they say, better insurance.\n  The administration is also saying that prices are going up less than \nthey had previously estimated. They previously estimated they were \ngoing to go up a lot. Now they are estimating they are not going to go \nup quite as much as a lot, but they are still going to go up. A smaller \nincrease isn't what the President promised. He said families could pay \n$2,500 less a year. That is what the President promised. It is not what \nis happening.\n  Prices in the exchanges are up all across the country. In California, \nthe cheapest plan at the silver level will cost a 40-year-old in Los \nAngeles $242 a month. That same person, because of something in the law \ncalled community ratings, buying the same plan in Sacramento, CA, would \npay $330 a month. I see the astonishing looks on faces of folks in this \nChamber. They can't believe it. They say, How can it be true? Perhaps \nthey should have read the law, read the bill before they voted to pass \nit. The price is 38 percent more in Sacramento than in L.A. for the \nsame identical policy, for the same 40-year-old person.\n  In addition to the higher cost of insurance premiums, there are also \nhigher out-of-pocket costs, higher copayments, higher deductibles--all \nthings that are going to make people look at this and say, Cheaper than \nmy cell phone bill? Not a chance. All of that means more money out of \nthe wallets of hard-working Americans and more sticker shock.\n  The second thing people are learning today as they sign up in the \nexchanges is that many of them will actually lose their doctor. I \npracticed medicine for 25 years. I know how important it is for \npatients to have a long-term relationship with their caregivers. The \nexchanges--the mandates coming out of this President's health care \nlaw--break that bond. That is because insurance companies needed to \nfind ways to keep rates from going even higher. So what they have done \nis limited the doctors and limited the hospitals that patients can \nvisit.\n  In New Hampshire, Anthem BlueCross BlueShield is excluding 10 of the \n28 hospitals in the State from the exchange. A young mother may not be \nable to keep seeing the pediatrician whom she knows and trusts with her \nchildren's care. That wasn't supposed to happen. The President promised \nthat if you liked your doctor, you could keep your doctor. Today, many \nAmericans are finding out that is just not the case.\n  On Sunday, a few days ago, Howard Dean, the former head of the \nDemocratic National Committee, admitted that one of the unintended \nconsequences of the law is that small businesses are going to dump \ntheir employees into the exchange. The people who work at those small \nbusinesses don't get to keep the insurance they had, and they may not \nget to keep the doctor they had either.\n  A third thing people are going to start to see today as the exchanges \nopen for business is that there is a definite risk of fraud and \nidentity theft. How can that be? The administration has hired so-called \nnavigators--people to help enroll consumers in the exchanges. It turns \nout that these workers aren't well trained or even subject to \nconsistent background checks. Even the Obama administration has been \nwarning that con artists will take advantage of confusion over the law \nto steal people's identities. As I said earlier, buyer beware. Security \nmay also be inadequate in the giant government ``data hub.'' These are \nthe huge databases of detailed personal information about everyone in \nthe exchanges. The information will be available to people in many \ndifferent government agencies, in the whole chart of all the different \nplaces that this data is going to be sent all throughout government. \nThe administration promises that the data hub will work, but they will \nnot talk about what they have done to ensure that it is secure.\n  Finally, we know that today there are going to be a lot of customer \nservice system failures. President Obama said that buying insurance \nthrough the exchanges would be like shopping at Amazon.com. It is \nshaping up to be much less consistent than that. Instead of simply \nclicking a few buttons online, many people are spending hours following \nup with phone calls, e-mails, and faxes. Faxes?\n  As recently as two weeks ago, government software couldn't reliably \ntell people the correct price for their insurance. Late last week, the \nadministration delayed enrollment of some of its small business \nexchanges. Washington, DC, said last week that parts of its exchanges \nalso weren't ready. In the State of Oregon, State officials say the \nsoftware problems will force them to delay their Web site. People there \nwill have to find other ways to get help for signing up.\n  That is not how Amazon.com works. That is not what the President \npromised.\n  It didn't have to be this way. The American people knew what they \nwanted from health care reform. They wanted lower costs and more \naccessible, quality care. President Obama could have drafted a law that \nactually addressed Americans' concerns. Instead, he forced through a \nlaw making health care more complicated, more uncertain, and more \nexpensive.\n\n[[Page S7072]]\n\n  Now is the time for the American people to hold the President to his \npromises. Coverage in the exchanges, as he said, should cost less than \nyour cell phone bill, be as easy and secure as Amazon, and let people \nkeep their doctors. How well those promises hold up will be the real \nlegacy of the Obama health care law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, yesterday when the President of the United \nStates addressed the American people, he was very clear about what a \nshutdown would mean. He said:\n\n       Office buildings would close. Paychecks would be delayed. \n     Vital services that seniors and veterans, women and children, \n     businesses and our economy depend on would be hamstrung. \n     Business owners would see delays in raising capital, seeking \n     infrastructure permits or rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy.\n       Veterans, who have sacrificed for their country, will find \n     their support centers unstaffed. Tourists will find every one \n     of America's national parks and monuments, from Yosemite to \n     the Smithsonian to the Statue of Liberty, immediately closed. \n     And of course, the communities and small businesses that rely \n     on these national treasures for their livelihoods will be out \n     of customers and out of luck.\n\n  I share the President's concerns about what will happen to the \nAmerican people--about ``real people,'' as one of my colleagues put it \nyesterday--during and in connection with a government shutdown.\n  I wish to focus our attention in the coming hours and days on these \npeople. I think it is also important that we continue to focus as well \non those who are already hurting--hurting for reasons that don't have \nto do with the shutdown.\n  So I would like to turn for a moment to people who are and for a \nnumber of months have been already feeling the negative effects of \nanother government policy the President and his allies in Congress \nstaunchly defend.\n  ObamaCare happens to be the No. 1 job killer in the country. A recent \nanalysis documented hundreds of businesses that are cutting back hours \nto avoid the crushing cost of ObamaCare's severe mandates. As a result, \nmajor unions have said ObamaCare could destroy the 40-hour workweek--\nthe backbone of the American economy. People are losing their health \ninsurance. Just a week ago Friday, 20,000 people--employees of Home \nDepot--were informed they would be losing their health insurance. UPS \nis no longer going to provide health insurance for spouses of \nemployees. The grocery store chain Trader Joe's has dropped health care \ncoverage for part-time workers altogether.\n  For everyone who has been furloughed by the government shutdown, the \nchange hopefully will be temporary--perhaps lasting a few days, maybe \neven a few hours--if the Democrats decide to negotiate. For everyone \nwho has lost a job, had their hours cut, their wages reduced, or who no \nlonger receives health insurance, the change could well prove to be far \nmore permanent. Do we not have an obligation to do something for those \npeople? I think we do. So let's look for the path forward. Let's return \nto the President's concern about those who are hurt by a government \nshutdown.\n  One positive and encouraging step was taken yesterday in response to \naction taken by the House of Representatives late Saturday night. Late \nSaturday night, of course, the House of Representatives passed a bill \nto ensure that all Active-Duty military personnel--the brave men and \nwomen in uniform who serve us bravely--will continue to get paid. \nYesterday the Senate took up that measure and passed it unanimously. It \ndid so in a matter of minutes, in a seemingly effortless legislative \nact.\n  I think we can do the exact same thing with a number of \nnoncontroversial spending bills that fund aspects of government that \nAmericans overwhelmingly support, that Americans acknowledge we need, \nand that are completely unrelated to ObamaCare. My plan, in other \nwords, would involve setting up segmented continuing resolutions, \nappropriations measures that would keep the funding going at current \nlevels to various areas within government, including the Department of \nDefense, the Department of Homeland Security, military construction, \nCJS, which includes funding for the Department of Justice, the Federal \nCourt system, the FBI, NASA, the National Weather Service, for example, \nand also the U.S. Department of the Interior, which includes our \nnational parks.\n  I mention national parks with special interest because today is the \nfirst day of what we hope will be a short, quickly resolved government \nshutdown. We have at least two Honor Flights coming in from around the \ncountry bringing World War II veterans--members of the ``greatest \ngeneration''--to Washington, DC, who plan to visit the World War II \nveterans memorial, a memorial designed specifically for them. When they \narrive, if nothing changes between now and then, they will painfully \ndiscover what we have learned this morning, which is that those parts \nof the National Mall have been fenced off and barricaded. They will not \nbe able to get in. They will not even be able to get very close. This \nis unfortunate and, just as important, it is unnecessary. We can act. \nWe should act. We must act today to resolve this. There is absolutely \nno reason this noncontroversial aspect of our Federal Government's \noperations should continue 1 more day or even 1 more hour, for that \nmatter, without being funded.\n  This is an effort to compromise, an effort that is badly needed, an \neffort that comes in the wake of other efforts to compromise that have \nfor the most part failed. The House of Representatives has tried now \nthree different times to avoid a shutdown, passing three different \nmeasures to make sure our government would continue to be funded. \nSenator Reid and those Members of his conference who support him have \nrejected all three plans, rejected all three offers to keep the \ngovernment funded, accusing Republicans of playing games with \nObamaCare.\n  In light of that, let's leave ObamaCare for another day and not hold \nthe vast majority of government functions hostage when the vast \nmajority of government functions do not have anything to do with the \nimplementation and enforcement of ObamaCare. We did it yesterday. We \ndid it. It worked well. It was seamless. It was done with absolute \nunanimous consent. We did it with respect to Active-Duty military pay \nyesterday. We can do it for veterans benefits, for border security, for \nnational parks, and for many other government agencies. We can keep \ngovernment open. We can keep those aspects of our Federal Government \nfunded. We can do so. We should do so. Together, we will do so.\n  I look forward to having these discussions in the coming hours to \nmake sure we can continue to work together as colleagues. We may not \nagree on everything, but in those areas where we should agree and where \nwe in reality do agree, let's keep the government funded.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime during any quorum call be equally divided between the two parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today is a day of enormous promise and \nneedless tragedy. The promise is the\n\n[[Page S7073]]\n\nbeginning, another step forward, in America's progress toward providing \nall America with affordable health care. It is a welcome day because \nAmericans can now enroll in health insurance through the Affordable \nCare Act. But it is a needlessly tragic day because, in the midst of a \ntragic economic recovery, millions of Americans are out of work now--an \nextremist faction having sworn to its followers the Affordable Care Act \nwould never be allowed to stand have now shut down the government \nbecause they did not get their way.\n  I wish to begin by talking directly to the people of Connecticut. \nToday is an enormously frustrating one for me because in the years and \ndecades of public service I have sought to provide to people in \nConnecticut, never have I been barred, as we are today, each of us in \nthis Chamber, from serving those needs individually, from phoning them \nand proactively putting staff on issues that concern them.\n  Due to the shutdown of the Federal Government, our office operations \nin both Hartford and Bridgeport are severely reduced, as well as in \nWashington. If a constituent needs help, if there is an emergency, if \nthere is an issue that is time sensitive, you can reach our office and \nwe will provide help. We will endeavor to meet any issue that concerns \nthe health and safety and lives of the people of Connecticut and in no \nway is our commitment to you diminished.\n  I regret that our staff will be handicapped by the legal constraints. \nIndeed, we are, in many instances, not permitted to work in the ways \nthat we have. But I can assure you we are continuing to serve you.\n  Today, in Connecticut, enrollment in our health exchanges will ensure \naccess to more affordable quality health care for millions of middle-\nclass families. Access to affordable quality health coverage is a basic \nright. We cannot deny it and we cannot turn back the clock. We need to \nwork together--Republicans and Democrats--to improve and strengthen it \nand to bring down the cost of health care. The task ahead is to reform \nhealth care delivery to bring down the rising--in fact, the \nastronomically increasing--cost of health care, and to build on the \nwork that has already begun under the Affordable Care Act and before \nit.\n  There is a real difference between an America with affordable health \ncare and one that lacks it. It is an America where being a woman is no \nlonger a preexisting condition, where a family who is responsible and \npays for health insurance knows when they arrive at the delivery room \nthey will not be bankrupted by the bill, and where children are not \ndenied care because they happen to get sick.\n  We are at an impasse in Washington because of a matter of principle. \nThe kind of hostage-taking we see here cannot be allowed to take place. \nIt has no legitimate role in a spending bill. The bill before us would \nenable government to continue the people's work, to continue to do \nbusiness for the American people. That is our job, and the attempt has \nbeen to attach to that resolution a completely unrelated demand that \nthe Affordable Care Act be defunded or delayed or destroyed. To tie \nhealth care repeal to a funding bill is akin to tying immigration \nreform to the National Defense Authorization Act. It is a dangerous \nprecedent and it cannot be permitted. If we accept this take-or-leave-\nit approach that led to this shutdown, we will be forced to govern this \nway--or fail to govern this way--in the future.\n  In fact, the resolution before us already involves compromises--less \nmoney than is necessary, for example, to rebuild our roads and bridges, \nto engage in infrastructure, repair and rebuilding. Rather than nation-\nbuilding abroad, more nation-building here at home has to be done and \nmore investment is required. The compromises in this funding bill have \nbeen made in the amounts of money included in it.\n  The impacts of this shutdown will be felt throughout our economy, in \nall 50 States, and in thousands of jobs in Connecticut if the shutdown \ncontinues for weeks or months. There are millions of families \nnationally and thousands in Connecticut who will go without paychecks. \nThere are 9,000 Federal employees in Connecticut who will be affected. \nTheir work is important, but the ripple effect is equally important. \nThe losses of income and diminished consumer demand will further \ninhibit economic growth. Defense contractors will lose their contracts \nor possibly fail to receive checks when they need them.\n  A shutdown does nothing to address our need to agree on a responsible \nbudget and replace the slash-and-burn, across-the-board sequestration \ncuts that are continued in this resolution.\n  A shutdown undermines one of the key engines of economic growth in \nthis country, research and innovation, such as the research done at the \nCoast Guard's Research and Development Center in New London, CT. What \nif the studies in that facility led to better ways to secure our \nborders, to rescue people lost at sea. Who knows what future \ninnovations will be sacrificed at the National Institutes of Health \nacross the country and in companies around Connecticut.\n  The lifeblood of our economy--job creation, research and innovation, \ninvestment in the future--is undercut and undermined by this shutdown. \nIn fact, even as we go through this process in Washington, the \nNortheast region is seeking to recover from a shutdown in train service \nthat occurred just days ago. That shutdown has been remedied to some \nextent--an inadequate degree--so that half or slightly more of the \nservice has been restored. The failures in the feeder cable that led to \nthis shutdown are directly due to a failure of investment in \ninfrastructure, just as the derailment and collision that was caused \nmonths ago reflected a failure to invest in infrastructure. Right \nbefore our eyes, as we engage in this kind of conduct in Washington \nthat led to a shutdown, are the consequences of investment failure in \nour roads and bridges and train system.\n  With displaced workers struggling to get back into the labor market \nand businesses in need of specific skills, it is shocking we should cut \nback first on job training through these unresolved sequester cuts that \nare projected to force Connecticut's job training services to assist \n9,360 fewer job seekers than they otherwise would.\n  We need to come together now. The message to Speaker Boehner has to \nbe: Let the House vote. There are reasonable minds on both sides of the \naisle who say let's have a simple, straightforward spending bill \nwithout these unrelated demands, without the blackmail and hostage-\ntaking tactics. Let us come together on that kind of simple, \nstraightforward way of continuing the people's business and the \ngovernment's work for the people.\n  Many of my colleagues and I listened with great interest to the \nSenator from Alaska and others on the other side of the aisle saying we \nshould let common sense and compromise prevail and deal with the issues \nrelating to the Affordable Care Act, for immigration, separately and \ndistinctly. They are measures that deserve and need attention, and \nthere are ways to strengthen and improve many of our laws. But let's \ndeal with them on their merits, not as demands or conditions for \ncontinuing the people's work by their government.\n  I truly believe, as we look back on this day, it will be with pride \nin another step forward for health care reform in this country. A lot \nof work remains to be done. Bringing down the cost of health care is a \ntask, an unmet challenge that needs to be addressed, as well as other \nways to strengthen and improve our health care system and the law \nitself. Let the House vote on a measure that provides simple, \nstraightforward funding to continue the work of government for its \npeople and allows the economy to continue its recovery and growth, that \nallows job creators to do their work, and that allows our working \nfamilies--middle-class families--to have the benefits of education and \nSocial Security and the veterans' benefits they vitally need. These \nessential functions must continue.\n  Let the House vote. Let reason prevail, and we can return to the work \nthat government should be doing for its people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I think the American public \noverwhelmingly opposes ObamaCare. Every survey shows that, and all of \nus traveling back and forth to our States hear it. But they also \nsupport keeping the government open.\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\n  We have had an opportunity over the course of the last several days \nto deal with both of those issues. In fact, in order to avoid a \ngovernment shutdown, you have to have people who are willing to work \ntogether and come to a solution. The House of Representatives has not \nonce, not twice, but three times sent to the Senate proposals that \nwould fund the government and that would make some changes to ObamaCare \nthat would provide the same sort of relief to every American that big \nbusinesses have received from the President by virtue of some of his \nwaivers and exemptions. On all three occasions that was turned down--\ntabled--when it got to the Senate.\n  So what did the House of Representatives do? Their most recent \nproposal advanced to the Senate was to allow the House and the Senate \nto go to conference, to work out the differences. They asked the Senate \nto appoint conferees to a conference committee, where Senators and \nHouse Members might be able to sit down, Democrats and Republicans, and \nactually hammer out some sort of solution to the challenge we face in \nfront of us. That got tabled this morning. That is the first time I \nhave ever seen that happen in my time in the Congress--and maybe the \nfirst time it has ever happened--where one body has asked for a \nconference and asked for appointing of conferees and it was tabled.\n  It was not just turned down. We didn't say: No, we are not going to \ndo it now; we will do it another time. But we actually tabled the \nmotion--tabling a motion of the House of Representatives to have a \nconference on how to work out the situation and in a way that will \nallow us to keep the government open and hopefully provide middle-class \nAmericans some relief and the economy--the taxpayers and employers \nacross this country--some relief from ObamaCare.\n  So we are where we are now--with the House of Representatives having \nsuggested to the Senate that we sit down together in a conference \ncommittee and work out our differences--and the Senate having rejected \nthat.\n  We could all argue about how we initially got where we are. I think \nit all starts when we don't do things the way they are intended to be \ndone around here--in other words, taking the appropriations process and \nmoving those bills forward.\n  Here in the Senate we had an opportunity, as we do every year, to \nmove the individual appropriations bills. There are 12 separate \nappropriations bills that historically have been the way in which we \nhave funded the government. This year we didn't move a single \nappropriations bill through the Senate. The House of Representatives \nmoved four of the bills through the process. They didn't get through \nall of them, but at least they got some of the appropriations bills \ncompleted. But here in the Senate, we didn't do a single appropriations \nbill.\n  We all saw this coming. It is not as if there is any secret or \nsurprise. So what happens is there is a calendar, and when those \ndeadlines aren't met, we get up against the end of the fiscal year, the \nway we are right now, and we have this huge push to try to keep the \ngovernment from shutting down, and we generally do it in the form of a \ncontinuing resolution. But the fact is, if the Senate had done any of \nits work earlier this year, if we had taken up any of the \nappropriations bills and passed them, we wouldn't be in this crisis \nmoment we have in front of us now.\n  Why is it that so many Republicans in both the House and Senate--and, \nI would daresay, Democrats as well, although they haven't demonstrated \nit with their votes--are concerned about what is happening with \nObamaCare? Obviously, as more information becomes available about \nObamaCare, the more concerns, the more frustrations, the more questions \nthe American people have.\n  I mentioned this previously, but in my State of South Dakota, \naccording to the report put out last week by the Health and Human \nServices Department, if you compare the premiums that a 30-year-old \nmale and a 30-year-old female would pay in the State of South Dakota \nfor a bronze plan in the exchanges, the increase in premium for people \nin that age category would be for a man 393 percent and for a woman 223 \npercent. So for a 30-year-old female in the State of South Dakota, the \nannual increase in insurance premiums would be $1,500, and if you are a \nmale in the State of South Dakota, the annual increase would be $2,000. \nSo there is a real concern about the impact this will have, as these \nexchanges get up and running, on what people are currently paying for \nhealth care coverage.\n  There is also a lot of evidence and data out there now that suggests \nit doesn't apply just to a 30-year-old male or female in my State of \nSouth Dakota, but it also applies to families. There are many families \nacross this country who are obviously concerned about how this is going \nto impact the cost of health insurance for them. If we look at what \nhealth insurance costs have done for families since the President took \noffice, they have gone up on average about $3,000. Since ObamaCare \npassed, those premiums have gone up for families by about $2,500. So we \nhave seen premiums going up already.\n  We have a lot of concerns as these exchanges get up and running \nstarting today about what impact they will have on premiums for middle-\nclass Americans. That is why there is a lot of concern and anxiety \nacross the country today with regard to the impacts of ObamaCare.\n  We also have a lot of concerns about how this will impact jobs and \nthe economy. We have already seen that a majority of the jobs created \nthis year are part-time jobs. There are many reasons for that, but if \nwe talk to employers, one of the things they will point out is that the \nrequirements in the new health care law are that if they have 50 or \nmore employees, they have to offer government-approved health care or \npay a penalty. So a lot of employers are trying to stay under that 50-\nemployee minimum or threshold so they don't have to face that \nrequirement. So what happens? They either don't hire people they were \notherwise going to hire or they look at ways to reduce their workforce.\n  It applies in another way because the definition of ``full-time \nemployee'' in the law is 30 hours per week. Again, employers will be \nsubject to the same sorts of penalties, so what many are doing is \ninstead of hiring full-time workers, they are hiring part-time workers, \n29-hour-a-week workers. Obviously, 29 hours a week doesn't give you the \nkind of pay that would allow you to meet the needs your family has. So \nmore and more people are working two jobs, and we see the impact and \nthe distortion this new law is creating in the workplace and for a lot \nof employers.\n  There was a lot of anxiety and angst about that, which I think was \nvoiced to the President and to his administration. So what does the \nPresident do? The President decided to delay the employer mandate in \nthe law for 1 year. I think employers took great comfort at least in \nknowing it is not going to be there for this year, but they are also \nstill very worried about what will happen when it does kick in in the \nfollowing year.\n  But there are all these employers, and people may say: Who are these \npeople? I don't know how one can travel their State or anywhere else \noutside of their State and not hear from employers who are expressing \nconcerns and asking questions about what this is going to mean for them \nand expressing grave reservations about the impact it is going to have \non their ability to create jobs.\n  So as we speak with these various employers and get lots of anecdotal \nevidence--last week there was an interview done with employers in my \nState of South Dakota. A person was asked about how this would impact \nthem, and he said: I guess we are probably not going to hire as many \npeople as we otherwise would have hired. He said: I think that is going \nto be happening with businesses all over the country.\n  That is one example from my State of South Dakota, but if we look at \nsort of the aggregate, according to Investor's Business Daily there are \nsome 300 businesses that have said they are going to reduce the size of \ntheir workforce or not hire people they otherwise might hire as a \nresult of the impact of ObamaCare. So we see more and more of the \nexperience, the evidence that we get day to day speaking with employers \nin our individual States, but we also start seeing this cumulative \neffect and more and more businesses expressing those concerns.\n  When we look at the economy today and where we are, we find out very\n\n[[Page S7075]]\n\nquickly that the unemployment rate, which has been at north of 7 \npercent, 7.5 percent for a long time now--when we add back into that \nequation the number of people who have either stopped looking for work \nor who are working part time when they would rather be working full \ntime, the actual number is much higher. We have about 22 million \nAmericans, and the unemployment rate climbs quickly into the double-\ndigit territory when we add those people back. The labor participation \nrate--which is the number of people in the workforce relative to the \nnumber of people who could be--is at the lowest level literally in 35 \nyears.\n  So we have a historically low labor participation rate, fewer people \nactually looking for work, some just flat having given up on it. We \nhave a very soft economy. I don't think anybody would describe the \neconomy today as being robust. We have a chronically high unemployment \nrate, jobs that are being created being part-time jobs, and so we have \nthe overall average household income in this country actually going \ndown. In fact, if we look at the statistics since the President took \noffice, the average household income has gone down by about $3,700 per \nfamily--$3,700 less income for the average household--$3,000 higher in \nhealth care costs, and we can see how middle-class families are getting \nincreasingly squeezed by what is happening as a result of ObamaCare.\n  One of the more recent suggestions that came over from the House of \nRepresentatives last evening came back with a funding resolution to \nfund the government and there were a couple of provisions that dealt \nwith some of these more onerous provisions in the ObamaCare law. One \nhad to do with the individual mandate.\n  The whole theory behind giving people relief from that is to give \nthem the same treatment, to be fair, that employers get. If the \nPresident has chosen to waive the employer mandate for big businesses--\nwhich he has for 1 year--why then require individuals to have \ninsurance?\n  There is going to be a significant cost associated when everybody has \nto buy insurance. It is about a $12 billion cost to people across this \ncountry. The question then is, If you are going to give the temporary \nrelief to the business community, why would you not in a fair way at \nleast make sure individuals are treated the same way?\n  That seemed to be a pretty compelling argument. If you are going to \ndo something that actually does impact in a favorable way people across \nthis country who are going to be suffering even more from the harmful \neffects of ObamaCare, it would strike us as at least reasonable to \nsuggest giving a 1-year delay to people under the individual mandate--\nthe same delay the President has given big businesses under the \nemployer mandate.\n  The other provision attached to the continuing resolution proposal \nadvanced by the House last night had to do with treating Members of \nCongress, their staff, and people here in Washington, DC, the same as \neverybody else. It strikes me again, at least, that if we are going to \nhave these policies, everybody ought to be treated the same way.\n  Frankly, my hope would be that we could relieve everybody. I would \nlove to see us permanently delay this so that no American would be \nsubject to the harmful impacts and effects of ObamaCare. But for sure, \nfor certain, people here in Washington, DC, should not be exempt. There \nshould not be a separate carve-out or separate treatment for people \nhere in Washington, DC, compared to other people around the country.\n  So the legislation that came over from the House last night included \na 1-year delay in the individual mandate--trying to treat individuals \nand people across the country the same way as businesses are being \ntreated in terms of the way the law is being applied--and secondly, \nmake sure people here in Washington, DC, Members of Congress and their \nstaff and others, are treated the same way as everybody else around the \ncountry. In other words, there is no exemption, there is no carve-out, \nthere is no preferential treatment for people here in Washington, DC. \nThose were the two things that were attached to the funding resolution \nlast night. That got tabled here in the Senate.\n  So having sent now three different proposals over, I think the House \nof Representatives has decided, OK, clearly the Senate doesn't like any \nof our ideas. Let's get together and have a conference committee.\n  So that was proposed, and--again, something I have never seen done \nbefore--there was a motion to table a request to go to conference. We \nget a lot of requests to go to conference. Sometimes those are not \nadhered to, and you have a debate about various conference meetings on \nvarious pieces of legislation that we deal with here in Congress. But I \nhave never seen a tabling motion on a request to go to conference. It \nis a pretty clear indication that the Senate has no interest in \nresolving this matter; otherwise, they would at least sit down with our \ncounterparts in the House of Representatives and say: What can we do to \nfind that middle ground? What can we do to find that consensus? How can \nwe resolve the differences we have here in a way that will keep the \ngovernment up and functioning and hopefully provide some relief for \npeople who are struggling under the impacts of ObamaCare?\n  So that is where we are today. What is interesting about it is our \ncolleagues on the other side, the Democrats--not all of them because \nthey weren't all here at the time, but those who were all voted in \nfavor of ObamaCare. There isn't a single Republican who was here at \nthat time who did, nor are there any here today who would. In fact, \nevery time we have had an opportunity to vote to repeal all or parts of \nit, everybody on this side of the aisle has voted for that.\n  Now, our colleagues on the other side continually hold out this \nargument that, after all, this is the law of the land. Frankly, they \nare right. It is the law of the land. But it is pretty obvious that at \nleast in the President's view there are parts of the law that don't \nneed to be applied right away; otherwise, he wouldn't have extended a \n1-year delay or a 1-year waiver under the employer mandate.\n  So it is pretty clear that the President has a different view than \nperhaps his allies here in the Senate with regard to what that law \nactually means. He has been perfectly willing on not just that occasion \nbut on other occasions to take portions of a law and not apply them, to \nwaive them and provide exemptions for particular groups of people--\nnamely, those here on Capitol Hill and also big businesses around the \ncountry. So there is a very discriminate way in which the President is \napproaching this law. It seems to me, at least, that in fairness he \nwould give the same favorable treatment to individuals that he has \ngiven to big businesses.\n  The other thing that is really interesting about the folks on the \nother side of the aisle saying this is the law of the land is that \nthere are many things that are the law of the land. The Budget Act is \nthe law of the land. The Budget Act, which was passed back in the \n1970s--1973 or 1974--is the budget law that Congress has been under now \nfor the past almost 40 years. Yet for 3 consecutive years in a row the \nDemocratic majority didn't even pass a budget, didn't move it through \nthe committee, didn't bring it to the floor, just said: We don't need \nto do it. We will just ignore the law. That happened for 3 years in a \nrow.\n  So I would suggest that our colleagues on the other side who are \nquick to say that ObamaCare is the law of the land are very willing, \nwhen it serves their purposes or they find it convenient, to completely \nignore other laws that have been on the books for a much longer period \nof time. So that argument really misses the point.\n  I guess what I would say is that I hope this can be resolved. It \nneeds to be resolved. I think we need to provide some relief for the \nAmerican people from the impacts of ObamaCare. Clearly, our economy \nneeds a break. The American workers and middle-class families need a \nbreak. Employers have already been given a break--big businesses, by \nthe President, have been given a 1-year delay under the law.\n  Why not apply that to others who are going to be hurt in an equal \nfashion.\n  Just to put a fine point on why it is important, we think, to have \nsome delays--today is the day they roll out the exchanges. But if you \nlook at what the reports are about, whether or not those things are \nready, up and ready to go, it is pretty clear they are not ready for \nprime time. We hear about glitches,\n\n[[Page S7076]]\n\nwhich is the President's word--I think that is a kind word--\nmalfunctions, inaccuracies, bumps in the road. We have heard them \ndescribed all those different ways. But the clear reality is that this \nthing is not ready for prime time. Why would we not delay it?\n  There was a story yesterday in the Wall Street Journal and the \nheadline was ``Late Snags on Eve of Health Rollout.''\n\n       Nonprofit groups and brokers that will help enroll \n     consumers in the marketplaces, known as exchanges, say they \n     haven't yet had a chance to preview the systems. Technical \n     problems have limited certification for some nonprofit \n     workers involved. And some of these groups say they haven't \n     fully staffed up for the influx.\n       The exchange software that determines whether people get . \n     . . subsidies was returning accurate determinations about \n     two-thirds of the time late Friday, up from less than 50 \n     percent earlier in the week.\n\n  At least they are trending in the right direction.\n  Additionally, one Web broker agreement with CMS to sell Federal \nexchange health plans, announced that it will not be able to offer \nthose plans on October 1, blaming CMS delays.\n  The point is this is clearly not ready for prime time. Last week the \nDistrict of Columbia said they are experiencing a very high error rate. \nError rates, malfunctions, inaccuracies, bumps, glitches--these all \nseem to me to suggest that this is something that needs to be delayed. \nI think that would make the most sense, given the President has already \nacknowledged that for big businesses, for employers. It ought to be \ndelayed for a year.\n  I think there is bipartisan support for giving individuals and \nfamilies relief just like businesses have been granted. We have a \nDemocratic Senator, a colleague from West Virginia, who said last week \na delay for individuals would be very reasonable and sensible. But this \nweek Senate Democrats voted in lockstep with the President and refused \nto give low-income and middle-class families that same relief that has \nbeen provided to big businesses and to some of the President's allies.\n  We are now in a holding pattern. It seems to me at least that the \nball is in the Senate majority leader's court. The House of \nRepresentatives has asked for a conference, which has been rejected. \nThe response was we are not going to sit down, we are not going to \nnegotiate this. The President has said we are not going to negotiate. \nWe are not going to sit down. We do not believe there is any room here \nfor negotiation.\n  I think the American people are going to perceive that to be an \nunreasonable position because I think most people understand when we \ncome here we have differences of opinion. But the way you resolve those \nis you sit down and work out those differences. You try to come to some \nresolution that would allow everybody to move forward.\n  What we have seen here is that time after time, the House of \nRepresentatives has sent to the Senate proposals. Those have been \ntabled here, and the House has sent back another one. I said three \ntimes now that has happened. Finally, the House of Representatives \nsaid: OK, we get it. You do not like what we are sending you. Let's sit \ndown and see if we can work this out. Let's have a conference and see \nif we can work out our differences. That was tabled by the majority \nleader earlier today.\n  What is coming out of the White House, what is coming out of the \nDemocrat majority is: Sorry, we don't negotiate. We are not going to \nsit down. We are not going to try to find common ground. We are not \ngoing to try to find a bipartisan solution to this. We are going to \nhave it our way, and you can take it or leave it.\n  I don't think that is what the American people sent us here to do. I \nthink they sent us here to do the people's business. I said before, \nwhen I started my remarks, I believe the American people overwhelmingly \ndislike ObamaCare and the effect it is having. I think they \noverwhelmingly believe the government should stay open. I think we can \naccomplish both of those objectives, hopefully sooner rather than \nlater, if both sides will sit down in good faith and actually try to \nwork out a solution.\n  That is certainly not going to happen as long as the President \ncontinues to stay dug in. It appears he has drawn a line in the sand. \nThat seems to be the tactic and the approach that is being taken by the \nSenate majority, by the Democratic leader. That is not going to get us \nto an answer. That is not going to get us to a solution. All that is \ngoing to do is to provide even more frustration, even greater disdain \nand cynicism from the American people when they see the in-fighting \nthat is going on here and a lack of a willingness on the part of the \nDemocratic majority to sit down with House Republicans and figure out \nwhat is in the best interests of the American people as we move \nforward.\n  I hope we can do better. The American people deserve better. Future \ngenerations deserve better from us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, this government shutdown is \ndisappointing to me. It's disappointing to those who are affected by \nit, and I'm sure it's disappointing to the American people. Because \nthey're seeing their government not function in such a visible way.\n  What is especially disappointing to me is the unwillingness of the \nPresident and Senate Democrats to make a reasonable effort to resolve \nthe real differences of opinion that exist here.\n  It's not unusual, Madam President, that we have differences of \nopinion in Washington, DC. In fact, the Founders created a government \nhere with the expectation that it would kick up to the Nation's Capitol \nthe disputes we couldn't resolve in our own families, disputes we \ncouldn't resolve in our city councils, in county commissions, and our \nState legislatures and State government. And the Founders intended that \nthose disputes, which are in this body, not be resolved easily by \ncreating a system of checks and balances: A Supreme Court, a \nPresidency, and a Congress.\n  And by creating, in this body, the rules that make it very difficult \nto come to a result.\n  The idea was that we didn't want a king.\n  A king is efficient. Tyranny is efficient.\n  Our Founders didn't want that.\n  They didn't want a despot. They wanted a way to get, eventually, to a \nresult. They sought to avoid the tyranny of the majority by creating \nthese checks and balances and these rules in the Senate. They sought to \ncreate a situation where the majority couldn't ride roughshod over the \nminority.\n  But I do not think the Founders envisioned a system of checks and \nbalances that produced a permanent stalemate on issues that are \nimportant to the American people. Even in the most contentious of \nissues--and there have been many issues in our history much more \ncontentious than anything we are dealing with today.\n  They didn't envision that the government would simply shut down or \nstop operating or stop trying to come to a result. That is why I find \nthe attitude of the President and the Senate Democrats so \ndisappointing.\n  By any fair measure, the proposals by the Republican House of \nRepresentatives to bring this to a solution are reasonable proposals. \nLet's look at what they've proposed.\n  They proposed that we continue funding the government. Every single \nproposal the House has made to this body is that we continue funding \nthe government. And they've proposed that we also, at the same time, \nNo. 1, be fair to the middle class by delaying the individual mandate \nin the new health care law for a year.\n  Now, the President has already himself delayed seven major provisions \nin the new health care law that is supposed to take effect today. These \ninclude the employer mandate, which is $12 billion over 10 years for \ncorporations. Yet the President and Senate Democrats are saying we can \ngive the employers a $12 billion break by a 1-year delay, but we're \ngoing to stick it to the middle class of America by fining them $95 if \nthey do not buy health care and sending the IRS out to collect it next \nyear if they fail to do it.\n  What we suggested was, since the President himself has already \ndelayed seven major provisions, since the regulations aren't written, \nlet's also delay\n\n[[Page S7077]]\n\nthe individual mandate for a year. That would be fair to the middle \nclass.\n  No. 2, the House has suggested that we can continue funding the \ngovernment and be fair to those who are ill by repealing the medical \ndevice tax. Seventy-nine senators have voted for the medical device tax \nrepeal, including a large number of Democratic senators.\n  No. 3, the House Republicans have said, let's continue to fund the \ngovernment and be fair to the American people when it comes to health \ncare. Treat the American people the same way Congress is treated.\n  And finally, most recently, the House Republicans have said, let's \ncontinue to fund the government and can we not just sit down and talk \nabout it? Have a conference?\n  Which is the way, under our rules established by the Constitution, \nwe're always supposed to resolve disputes. And the answer has been no \nfrom the Senate Democrats.\n  No, to giving the same consideration to the middle class, the people \nwho are required to buy health insurance; no, to giving fairness to \nthose who are ill by repealing the medical device tax; no, to giving \nfairness to the American people by treating them the same way Congress \nis treated; and no, to giving fairness to the system in saying can we \nnot just sit down and talk in a conference, which is our way of \nresolving disputes.\n  And the answer by the President and the Senate Democrats is no, no, \nno.\n  The President's role is to bring us together. He said that during his \ncampaigns. He has a great capacity for persuading the American people \nthat he is right. He seems to be able to talk with the Iranian rulers, \nbut not to the congressional leaders.\n  Our goal is fairness for the middle class, fairness for the taxpayer.\n  Our latest offer from the House of Representatives was, let's keep \nthe government running and let's sit down according to our rules and \nhave a conference and talk about it.\n  This stubbornness in the face of reasonableness will not be good for \nour country, will not be good for either political party, it will not \nhelp us to achieve the kind of result on this and other issues that the \nFounders intended by creating a system of checks and balances in our \ndemocratic form of government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I yield first to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Speaker of the United States House of \nRepresentatives holds the key to reopen the Federal Government. It is \nan easy key to use. In fact, it is very simple. The key is to allow 435 \nMembers of the House of Representatives to vote to reopen the \nGovernment, and do it now. It is not too late to avert the worst \neconomic problems that this shutdown relates to. But you see, I am not \nthe only one calling for the Speaker to open the government. I am not \nthe only one calling on him to do the right thing.\n  This is what Republican Congressman Scott Rigell, from Virginia said. \nHe said it this morning. It is a direct quote:\n\n       We fought the good fight. It is time for a clean CR.\n\n  That is a Republican Congressman. If the House votes to reopen the \ngovernment, Democrats will gladly go to conference. Unfortunately, I \nread that Speaker Boehner and House Republicans are engaging in silly \npolitical stunts instead. What he is going to do is have some \nRepublicans, Members of the Congress, sit down for a photo op across \nfrom empty chairs. That is really unique. Has that ever been done \nbefore? Maybe only five or six thousand times since I have been in \nWashington. What they are really sitting down to instead of empty \nchairs is an empty stunt. I say to the House Republicans, it is time \nfor the photo ops and those silly stunts to end. Shutting down the \ngovernment is not kid stuff. That is kid stuff. Shutting down the \ngovernment is deadly serious.\n  The business community has warned of the economic consequences of the \nshutdown. It is now being proven. For every day the Speaker refuses to \nuse the key to reopen government, it costs the American economy \nbillions of dollars--every day. The solution is as clear this morning \nas it was last night: Reopen the government. He holds the key to \nputting millions of public servants back to work. Once that happens we \nare happy to go to conference. But only if the government is reopened.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/01/senate-section/article/S7077-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks \nof Senator Cardin, the Senate recess as provided under the previous \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I see my colleague from Tennessee just \nleft the floor, and I was listening to his comments. I know he is \nhaving a hard time--as many of our Senate colleagues are--understanding \nor justifying the actions of the Republicans in the House.\n  Make no mistake about it, this is a House Republican shutdown of the \ngovernment. The majority leader was talking about the consequences. The \nHouse Republicans have tried to hold all of us hostage, but it is not \ngoing to work.\n  When they talk about negotiating, the majority leader is absolutely \nright: We have tried on numerous occasions to get to a conference on \nthe budget only to find objections from the Republicans to sit around \nthe table to talk about the budget of the country. We are not going to \nyield to extreme measures. We should have the government open, and then \nwe should be negotiating the issues that are important.\n  I take this time to talk about our Federal workforce and to talk \nabout the impact this shutdown will have on Federal workers and the \npeople of Maryland and the people of our Nation. I am proud to \nrepresent Maryland in the Senate.\n  Once again Federal workers are going to be asked to make sacrifices \non behalf of their country, but this time they don't understand it. \nThis shutdown will have a negative impact on them and on our country. \nFor 3 years Federal workers have been working without a pay increase or \nan adjustment of salary. I had my staff check some of the statistics on \nthe number of Federal workers we have today compared to the historic \nnumbers. We actually have fewer workers per capita today than we did in \nthe 1950s. We are asking our Federal workforce to do more with less, \nand we are asking them to continue to work under sequestration when \nmany have been furloughed.\n  Now our Federal workforce has been furloughed in great numbers and \nare uncertain as to whether they will receive a paycheck. There are \nFederal workers who are working today and they don't know when they are \ngoing to get their paychecks. It is wrong, and it is going to hurt \nfamilies. They are going to have to try to figure out how to pay their \nbills without getting a paycheck.\n  This goes well beyond the Federal workers themselves. Look at the \nreductions we see in the Federal workforce here in the Washington area. \nWhat do you think is happening to the retail establishments, the small \nbusinesses, and our economy? We estimated in Maryland that we would \nlose $15 million a day for every day the Federal Government is closed.\n  Mark Zandi said the impact of a Federal shutdown will increase \nunemployment by half a percent. In 1995 to 1996, the last time we had a \nshutdown, OMB estimated it cost the taxpayers $1.4 billion. This is \nwasting taxpayers' money, and it is putting people under incredible \nstress as to how they are going to pay their bills. For what? To move \nan extreme agenda, to try to see if hostage-taking works in the \nCongress? This will have a major negative impact on our economy.\n  The private sector has recently created 7.5 million jobs over the \nlast 42 months. There are more people on private nonfarm payrolls than \nat any time since September 2008. Jobless claims are close to a 5-year \nlow. The second quarter of 2013 marked nine consecutive quarters of \neconomic\n\n[[Page S7078]]\n\ngrowth, the longest stretch since before 2008. And now because of the \nHouse Republican shutdown, we want to reverse that? Do we want to go \nback to a failing economy? That is what is at stake here. Do we want to \ncost our taxpayers money with the inconvenience we are causing the \npeople of this country by a government shutdown? Talk about life-\nthreatening delays. The researchers at NIH are being compromised. The \ninability of NIH to take on new patients as a result of a shutdown \nabsolutely affects the welfare of the people of our country. Small \nbusinesses are unable to get SBA loans. How do they run their \nbusinesses during this shutdown?\n  In my State of Maryland--and I know this is true around the country--\nthe backlog on veterans getting their disability claims heard is \ntremendous. That will now grow as a result of this government shutdown.\n  The FDA is responsible for food safety. I could talk about a lot of \ndifferent agencies. Forty-five percent of the FDA's workforce, or 6,620 \nemployees, will be furloughed. The FDA will be unable to support the \nmajority of its food safety nutrition and cosmetic activities. The FDA \nwill also have to cease safety activities such as routine establishment \ninspections, some compliance and enforcement activities, monitoring \nimports, notification programs, et cetera. That is what this shutdown \nwill cause. Do we want to make sure we have a safe food supply? Well, \ntoday it is not quite as clear as it was yesterday.\n  We know about the national parks and the zoo being closed. That makes \nno sense at all. People will be inconvenienced, but people's health \nwill be put in jeopardy because of this House Republican shutdown. It \nis totally illogical.\n  We have tried to go to conference on the budget. There are three \nproblems we have before we get a workable budget for this fiscal year. \nFirst, we have to keep government open; second, we have to make sure we \npay our bills; and third, we have to get rid of sequestration. That is \nwhat we have to get done. And, yes, we have to sit down, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to work out a budget for this fiscal year, but we can't do \nit while the government is closed.\n  When we fail to pass a budget--and quite frankly, it is the \nRepublicans who have been unwilling to sit at a table to come up with a \nbudget. The regular order is to pass a continuing resolution that \ncontinues the budget so the government can operate until we have a \nbudget. We have always done that at the current level.\n  Well, the Democrats are willing to go even further. We are willing to \ntake the Republicans' reduced budget number because of sequestration, \nand they can't even accept that because, quite frankly, there are too \nmany on the other side of the aisle in the House who want a government \nshutdown. That is not the way we should be operating.\n  I am proud to represent so many Federal workers. I am proud to \nrepresent the people of Maryland, and we are going to continue to fight \non behalf of the right policies. We are going to fight to make sure \nFederal workers are made whole when this is over, and that they are \nable to get their paychecks with full pay. It is going to be a struggle \nbecause of the attitude--particularly from the Republicans--in the \nHouse, but we are going to continue to fight for what is right for our \nFederal workforce and for the American people.\n  Let us pass a resolution to keep government open. Let us sit down and \nwork out a budget for this coming year. Let's do what is right for the \nAmerican people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/01/senate-section/article/S7078-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to continue the discussion on \nthe situation in which we find ourselves, which is that the entire \nGovernment of the United States of America has been shut down, and \nthose Federal employees who are working are working without pay.\n  This is a terrible situation. I implore the House to pass a clean \nshort-term continuing funding resolution that the Senate sent over to \nthem 4 days ago so we can reopen the government. Let's reopen the \ngovernment. Let's reopen the Government of the United States of \nAmerica. The way we reopen the government is to pass the Senate \ncontinuing funding resolution.\n  What would it do? It would fund the government at fiscal 2013 levels. \nThat doesn't mean it adds new money; so there is no new money. It is \nkeeping us at current spending levels. We would have a short-term \ncontinuing resolution until November 15 while we work out other issues, \nand then we can get over the speed bump of raising the debt ceiling. I \nbelieve that is the path forward.\n  Where we are now has terrible consequences. It has terrible \nconsequences for our economy. It has terrible consequences for our \nstanding in the world. It has terrible consequences for the functioning \nof our government.\n  We are speaking now about a shutdown of the government. Right now, \nthere are hundreds of thousands of men and women who work for the \nFederal Government who signed up to do a job in the service of their \nNation. They have literally, with the passing hours, had to either take \na furlough--and a furlough means we have essentially laid them off; we \nhave laid them off--or they are working because their work is \nessential, such as an FBI agent, but they are not getting paid. We are \npaying them with IOUs. This is not the United States of America.\n  I am thinking about those people who are working every single day. \nLet me paint a picture for my colleagues. In my own State, we are the \nheadquarters to the National Weather Agency. People who watch TV think \nthey get their weather news from either the Weather Channel or they get \nit from their local TV or radio station through doppler radar. It is \nterrific. But guess where they get their information. They get it from \ntheir Federal Government. They get it from the weather forecasters at \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who work hard every \nday predicting the weather and getting out the information that news \npeople can use in their own community. So if a person is a farmer, he \nis getting that information. If a person is a waterman who works on the \nChesapeake Bay and he has to make sure the storm is not coming while he \nis out there crabbing or oystering to keep his business going, he needs \nto know the weather. Whether a person is a county executive or a mayor, \npeople need to know what their weather is going to be. So they have \nbeen on the job, whether they have been predicting hurricanes or \ntornadoes or giving us the basic day-to-day information. The weather \nforecasters are at their duty station, but what are we saying to them \nnow? Guess what. Be there, but we are not going to pay you except \nthrough IOUs.\n\n[[Page S7079]]\n\n  Yesterday I spoke about the National Institutes of Health and the \nFood and Drug Administration in my State. There is another major agency \nwhich is not in my State but very important to the functioning of our \ncountry: the Centers for Disease Control. Right now, they are working \ndown there in Georgia. What is the Centers for Disease Control? What is \ntheir job? Their job is exactly that: disease control. When veterans \nand other people were ill and getting sick in a hospital in \nPhiladelphia, they were called in because they are our top biosleuths \nin America. They are our own bioforensic scientists, our own bio-CSI \nteam. They were the ones who found out about something called \nLegionnaires' Disease, and they helped those people who got sick in \nthat hotel, and were able to put out that information. They are the \nones who are standing sentry to make sure there is no emerging surprise \nor pandemic in the world. They are the ones who are gathering \ninformation now to know the latest threats to the health and safety of \nthe United States of America.\n  What is it they are doing? If a person is a pediatrician, they are \nwatching the CDC to see what are the latest causes of ear infections \nthat could be infecting children and the right treatment to help them, \nthe right treatment for their doctors to be able to know. That is what \nthey do. When their labs are being closed, it leaves States on their \nown--State health departments--to be able to look out for antibiotic-\nresistant viruses and other infectious diseases, and a variety of other \nkinds of things. We need the Centers for Disease Control. They employ \nthousands of people in Atlanta, GA. Yet we are telling them: Well, \nmaybe not the way we need you.\n  Yesterday, the President passed a bill to guarantee military \npersonnel be paid on time. We support that. But what is missing from \nthe bill is important. The intelligence community, made up mostly of \ncivilians, will not be covered. It means that over 72 percent who work \nin our intelligence agencies will either face furloughs or will be \nworking with IOUs.\n  Who else involved in our national security is not covered? We didn't \ncover border security. We didn't cover FBI. We didn't cover DEA. We \ndidn't cover the U.S. Marshals. What are the marshals doing? It is not \nlike Wyatt Earp. Marshals aren't just out there like cowboys in a Wild \nWest movie when we watch a miniseries. The Marshals Service is very \nimportant. Do my colleagues know what they are doing in Maryland right \nnow? First of all, they provide security in the courthouse. They do the \nsecurity to protect the judges. We have some of the most violent gangs \nand criminals coming in and the marshals need to protect those who are \nenforcing the law through the judicial system.\n  They are also going after the sexual predators. They are the ones who \ntrack all of the evidence and go after sexual predators to make sure \nthey are not loose in the neighborhoods, and they are working with \nlocal law enforcement.\n  They also go after missing fugitives. We know about the big signs \nthat say ``Ten Most Wanted.'' Well, guess who goes after them. The \nMarshals Service. That is one of their primary responsibilities. That \nis what Federal law enforcement is. These employees are also critical \nto national security.\n  Trying to do this piecemeal--oh, we have looked out for our troops. \nWe should look out for our troops. But while we look out for our \ntroops, we should look out for those who come back home.\n  I know the Presiding Officer and others have been strong supporters \nof our veterans. I am a strong supporter of our veterans. Many of the \nservices being performed by the VA are open, such as VA health care, \nbut there are other services where we have to delay the backlog on \nveterans' cases, veterans' disability benefits. Through appropriations, \nwe have actually put money in the Federal checkbook to deal with more \ntraining, more overtime to reduce this backlog.\n  When we speak about shutdowns, I want to take a moment to talk about \nmy own office in relationship to veterans. I am the longest serving \nwoman in Senate history. It is a great honor. In my 25 years as a \nSenator and after 25 years as the senior woman here, I have only closed \ndown my office twice: once in 1995 and this morning. I cannot express \nto my colleagues the heavy heart I had when I talked to my staff. My \nstaff is a great staff. Whether they are working in Maryland or whether \nthey are working here in Washington, we are a local phone call away to \n6 million Marylanders. Of those people who work for me, one is a young \nlady. I hope I don't embarrass her if she is watching TV. Her name is \nDenise. Denise has worked for me for 30 years, back when I was in the \nHouse of Representatives and now as a Senator. She is a caseworker, a \nconstituent service worker. For 30 years she has specialized in helping \nme respond to the needs of veterans. Veterans all over Maryland love \nher. They depend on her, and I depend on her so that I can help those \nveterans.\n  I know my time has expired, but Denise's time on the job shouldn't \nexpire. I want to make sure Denise is on her job. I want to reopen my \noffice. I want to make sure we reopen government. We can do that if we \npass the Senate continuing resolution.\n  Hello to the House. Don't send us piecemeal. Let the House vote on \nthe Senate bill. No gag rule in the House. Free the House, open the \nHouse, open government, and let's get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would like to quickly begin by saying \nthat last night at the stroke of midnight the government faced its \nfirst partial shutdown since 1996. There has been a lot of partisan \ntalk back and forth about who is to blame, but our constituents are \ndemanding action and rightfully expect us to resolve this situation. We \nneed to act swiftly to get the government up and running again.\n  Let me turn to another matter. Today's date is October 1, 2013. Since \nthe passage of the so-called Affordable Care Act in 2009, millions of \npeople have looked forward to this day, probably with more dread than \nanticipation. That is because today is the day the ObamaCare health \ninsurance exchanges--where millions of Americans will be required by \nlaw to purchase health insurance--are open for business.\n  Perhaps I should say they are supposed to be open for business. \nPresident Obama, in his futile effort to sell his health care law to \nthe American people, has been trying to paint a rosy picture about what \nwill happen starting today. He has claimed that today will mark the \nfirst step in a process that will provide health coverage for millions \nof Americans. Sadly, now that we are here, the picture is much cloudier \nthan the President would like to admit. Indeed, as the exchanges begin \nto go live, we have more questions than available answers. We know the \nexchanges have been met with significant delays--delays for large \nbusinesses, delays for small businesses, and even some delays for some \nof the State exchanges themselves. We know about other technical and \nlogistical problems facing the exchanges. I will talk more about those \nin a few minutes.\n  What we don't know is what will happen to the average American trying \nto sign up and navigate his or her way through the ObamaCare exchanges. \nI wish to take a few minutes to talk about that today and, in doing so, \nI wish to talk about someone we met during the 2012 election campaign. \nHer name is Julia. We all remember Julia. She was the faceless \ncharacter created by the Obama campaign to symbolize the cradle-to-the-\ngrave support women would receive under President Obama's \nadministration, including under ObamaCare. She was supposed to be the \nembodiment of President Obama's compassion for women and his opponent's \nlack thereof.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama's ``Life of Julia'' outline was short \non some details, particularly when it came to Julia's efforts to obtain \nand keep health insurance through the ObamaCare exchanges. Today I will \ntry to fill in some of those details. However, it will be difficult \nbecause, as I said, there is still much we don't know about how the \nexchanges are going to work.\n  As we follow Julia into the exchanges, the first question that comes \nto mind is: What brought Julia to the exchange in the first place? Is \nshe one of the millions of Americans who will\n\n[[Page S7080]]\n\nend up losing employer-provided health insurance as a result of \nObamaCare? Is she now a part-time worker after her employer had cut her \nhours to avoid the employer mandate? Perhaps she was laid off so her \nemployer could keep their number of employees below the threshold \nrequired to be considered small business under the law.\n  In any event, Julia has come to the exchange looking for health \ninsurance because that is what the law requires her to do. The next \nquestion is, Who will explain to Julia how she is to sign up for \ninsurance under the exchange? What we know is that she will be assigned \nto a navigator, a person employed by a private organization tasked with \nassisting the uninsured in determining what type of coverage they \nqualify for. This person, who is not a government employee, will have \naccess to her personal information, including her Social Security \nnumber and household income data.\n  Sadly, there is no telling whether this person will steal that \ninformation and use it for nefarious purposes. That is because the \nadministration, in the drafting of the rules for the certification of \nnavigators, cut corners on things such as training and background \nchecks, putting consumers and patients at increased risk for fraud and \nidentity theft.\n  I came to the floor to discuss this a couple of weeks ago. This was \nsomething that Members of Congress warned the administration about \nmonths ago. Sadly, our warnings have been ignored. So the bottom line \nfor Julia is that before she even enters the exchange, an unqualified \nnavigator or perhaps an imposter posing as a government counselor may \nhave easy access to her private personal information, allowing them to \nsteel her identify and create a nightmare for Julia to fix. Somehow, I \ndo not think the authors of ObamaCare had this in mind when they \ncreated the navigator program.\n  The next question Julia will face is whether the exchange in her \nState will be ready. This, of course, will depend on where Julia lives. \nNot all of the State exchanges will be ready to launch today. Idaho, \nMinnesota, Oregon, Colorado, and the District of Columbia have already \nannounced they will be delaying the launch of their exchanges.\n  The New York Times ran an article about the delays and glitches \nfacing the exchanges this past weekend. According to the article, \n``Many of the 16 directors of State-run exchanges are describing \nOctober as a soft launch period when Americans can start exploring \ntheir coverage options--but on Web sites that may be incomplete, \nvulnerable to glitches, and perhaps not ready for an onslaught of \ncustomers.''\n  In other words, Julia, depending on where she lives, may not even be \nable to sign up for insurance today because of the problems and \ndelays--problems and delays many of the exchanges are now facing. But \nfor the sake of discussion, let's assume Julia is able to sign on to \nthe exchange and select a health insurance plan. Now that she has \npicked a plan, the question is, Will her personal information be \nsecure?\n  In order to sign up and purchase an insurance plan, Julia will have \nto hand over a virtual mountain of personal information, including her \nSocial Security number, her tax return, and the like. All of this data \nwill be entered into the Federal services data hub, a new information-\nsharing network that allows State and Federal agencies to verify her \ninformation.\n  The problem with the data hub is that it has not gone under any \nindependent review to determine if the data that is entered is secure. \nThe administration announced that the data hub had passed internal \ntesting on September 10, a mere 3 weeks before it was set to go live. \nSure, they may claim the data hub is operational and ready to go, but \nno independent watchdog such as the Government Accountability Office, \nfor example, has had a chance to verify the security operations or make \nrecommendations to better safeguard the privacy of consumers.\n  Absent an independent review, there is simply no way of knowing \nwhether the exchanges have adequate safeguards in place to protect \nenrollee's personal information. For Julia, this means her personal and \nfinancial records may be at serious risk of becoming available to data \nthieves or just plain crooks. Obviously, this is not something the \nObama campaign mentioned about Julia when they planned out her life for \nher.\n  The next question for Julia is whether she will be eligible for \npremium or cost-sharing subsidies. Depending on her income, Julia may \nbe eligible for a tax credit designed to defray the cost of purchasing \nhealth insurance on the exchange. These credits are both advanceable \nand refundable, meaning that the IRS will pay them first and verify \nthem later.\n  My gosh, what a system. This is what some have referred to as ``pay \nand chase.'' The problem with this method of determining the \neligibility for the subsidies is that there is an increased likelihood \nthat applicants will receive larger subsidies than they actually \nqualify for. For Julia, that could mean, if she receives a subsidy, she \ncould end up owing the IRS money next tax season. That is not a highly \nadvertised element of the exchanges or the subsidy program, but that is \nthe reality people such as Julia will be facing.\n  Once Julia's plan and potential subsidies are in place, the question \nthen becomes will she have the same quality of health care she had \nbefore that she was promised by the President. The Obama administration \nhas made some misleading claims on this front. According to the White \nHouse, consumers and States with Federal exchanges will have an average \nof 53 plans to choose from. However, this number does not tell the full \npicture. According to an analysis undertaken by my staff on the Senate \nFinance Committee, 75 percent of States with Federal exchanges will \nhave fewer plans available than the average touted by the White House.\n  In addition, there will be fewer provider networks in the exchanges, \nbecause in an effort to keep the cost of premiums down, insurers are \nreducing the number of doctors and hospitals covered by the plans in \nthe exchanges. For example, there is only one insurer in the New \nHampshire exchange. Their plan will exclude--get that word \n``exclude''--10 of the 26 hospitals in the State.\n  Another example is Blue Cross Blue Shield of California. Their \nexchange plan also covers only 53 percent of the doctors and 74 percent \nof the hospitals that are included in their broadest nonexchange plan. \nAccording to the New York Times `` . . . many insurers are \nsignificantly limiting the choices of doctors and hospitals available \nto consumers. . . . from California to Illinois to New Hampshire and in \nmany states in between, insurers are driving down premiums by \nrestricting the number of providers who will treat patients in their \nnew health plans.''\n\n  In short, this means that on the exchanges, Julia may very well have \nfewer choices for health care providers, potentially leaving her with \nlimited access to quality care.\n  The final question Julia will face on the exchanges is perhaps the \nmost important. I call it the final question, but I am sure there are \nothers. Will Julia have to pay more for her health insurance under the \nexchanges than she did before this wonderful ``Affordable Care Act''?\n  This, once again, depends on the specifics of Julia's situation. If, \nlike most Americans, Julia previously had employer-provided health \ninsurance, she will likely be paying more for her insurance on the \nexchange than she did through her employer. While some enrollees may be \nable to find cheaper insurance through the exchanges, the majority of \nAmericans will pay more for health insurance under the exchanges than \nthey do now.\n  The Manhattan Institute found that individual market premiums will \nincrease 99 percent for men and 62 percent for women nationwide with \nthe exchanges in place. The bottom line for Julia is that depending on \nher plan, she may very well end up paying more out of pocket for her \nhealth care than she did before ObamaCare was in place.\n  As you can see, the reality of Julia's experience on the health \ninsurance exchanges does not resemble the pretty picture President \nObama painted for her during the campaign. She will almost certainly \nface a number of difficulties just navigating the process. I do not \nblame President Obama. He was just told what to say by so-called \nexperts on health care. Those experts have been wrong, wrong, wrong too \nmany times.\n\n[[Page S7081]]\n\n  In the end, it will likely end up costing Julia more to buy insurance \non her exchange. Of course, Julia is not a real person. Her problems \nare imaginary. However, the problems that real Americans, including \npeople from my State of Utah, will be facing as the exchanges open \ntoday are very real, as I have described them. Put simply, these \nexchanges are going live today with too many unanswered questions and \ntoo many unsolved problems.\n  We should have never gotten to this point. The Obama administration \nshould have acknowledged the ample warnings, signs and problems in the \nexchanges and heeded the many calls for delay. The administration was \nall too willing to delay the pain businesses will suffer under \nObamaCare. Sadly, the American people got no such special treatment.\n  All I can say is that those of us in Congress will be watching these \nexchanges closely. The American people will be watching them too. They \nwill be experiencing them, which may not be very pleasant, in light of \nthe promises that were made to them. If what we have discussed or \nwitnessed so far is any indication, I do not think we or they or Julia \nwill like what we see.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I come to the floor this afternoon as the chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee in order to speak about the effect the \ngovernment shutdown starting to have on the community and what effect \nit will have if the shutdown continues.\n  Let me give the most important figure up front. Across the \nintelligence communities, 72 percent of the civilian workforce is being \nfurloughed. This means that with the exception of a few intelligence \nagencies that have a significant number of military personnel, the \nlights are being turned off and the majority of the people who produce \nour intelligence, analyze that intelligence, and provide warning of \nterrorist attacks or advise policymakers of major national security \nevents will be prevented from doing their jobs. Simply stated, this is \nunacceptable. The failure of this Congress to perform its most basic \nfunctions means that our country is at heightened risk of terrorist \nattack.\n  Intelligence provides this Nation with its first line of defense \nbecause long before a threat makes it to our shores, the men and women \nin our intelligence community learn about it, sound the warnings, and \noften take the steps to neutralize that threat. Before the President or \nthe Secretary of State makes decisions on U.N. Security Council \nresolutions, such as a resolution to end Syria's chemical weapons \nprogram, they review the intelligence and they seek the advice of \nintelligence analysts.\n  Finding Osama bin Laden in a house in Abbottabad and removing a bomb \nfrom an Al Qaeda operative in Yemen aren't things that just happen. \nThey require the dedicated work of a huge array of professionals. Good \nintelligence requires the following: CIA officers on the ground and \naround the world meeting with sources; technical wizards who collect \nsignals and imagery information; engineers who put together the systems \nto bring the information back to Washington and who convert the ones \nand zeroes of computer code into meaningful, actionable intelligence. \nToday, 72 percent of the civilian workforce will not be doing these \njobs. Our shutdown is the biggest gift we could possibly give our \nenemies.\n  I understand and I support continuing to pay our military men and \nwomen, operating both at home and abroad, including tens of thousands \nstill deployed to Afghanistan. By furloughing our intelligence \nworkforce, we put our uniformed men and women at risk as they, too, \nrely on the intelligence agencies to tell them where the next assault \nmay take place or where the next IED is hidden.\n  We have Ambassadors in threatened capitals. I can guarantee that our \nAmbassadors in Kabul and Baghdad and Sanaa and Islamabad rely on their \nintelligence briefers and the tactical intelligence support to their \nsecurity teams as much as they rely on the marines who guard front \ngates.\n  I met earlier this spring with Ambassador Anne Patterson in Cairo. I \nsaw the gates and walls of our modern Embassy that had been overrun by \nthe same crowds protesting down the street in Tahrir Square. I met with \nthe CIA, NSA, and other intelligence officers who give the Ambassador \nand her team warning when the extremists are looking to try to attack \nour Embassy again.\n  Some of these intelligence professionals will obviously remain on \nduty and are absolutely essential, but by furloughing the majority of \nthe intelligence civilian workforce they rely on, we are preventing \nthem from effectively doing their job.\n  I spoke yesterday with Director James Clapper, the Director of \nNational Intelligence. At my request, he sent me a short report on how \nthe shutdown will affect the largest intelligence agencies. In addition \nto the 72 percent overall figure, his report lists how the shutdown \nwill cripple the CIA, the NSA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the \nNational Geospatial Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance \nOffice, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, to \ninclude the National Counterterrorism Center.\n  Every single agency I listed will lose the majority of its civilian \nworkforce. Many of them don't have a sizable military component that is \nexempt from the shutdown. The numbers are still classified, but any \nSenator who wants to see how our failure to fund the government is \nharming the intelligence community is welcome to find out and read this \nreport. It is in the intelligence office on the second floor of Hart. \nThe intelligence agencies at the Departments of State, Treasury, \nEnergy, and Homeland Security are hit even worse.\n  I wholly regret that we are in this situation. I regret that across \nthe country national parks are closed and Federal safety inspectors are \nsidelined. For 4 years we have squeezed the discretionary \nappropriations levels to the point that every part of the Federal \nGovernment has had to cut back and make do with less. What we are doing \nnow puts American lives at risk. It is an abdication of congressional \nresponsibility.\n  I wanted to come to this floor to make clear to every Member of this \nbody that what we have done directly damages our national security.\n  I also would like to take the opportunity to speak on some of the \ncutbacks that are in process in the area of energy and water.\n  Since 2001 I have served as chairman of three different \nAppropriations subcommittees: Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs, the Interior Department, and today the Subcommittee on Energy \nand Water Development. Over the years I helped make a lot of tough \nchoices on which programs to fund, which not to fund, et cetera, but \nnever have things been as bad as they are today. The cuts we are making \nto our appropriations bills under sequestration are strangling programs \nthat must be funded. These are programs that are vital to our country, \nvital to public safety, and programs that promise to deliver the next \nbreakthroughs in energy research.\n  I will speak about some of the negative effects a shutdown and \ncontinued sequester would have on my subcommittee.\n  The agency within my subcommittee that may have the most direct \nimpact on the public is the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps \nsafeguards our dams, our levees, and our drinking water. It keeps our \nharbors open for cargo ships, and it maintains more than 4,000 \nrecreation sites. Most people don't know that. Simply put, a government \nshutdown would mean the termination of a wide range of Army Corps of \nEngineers activities.\n  Let me mention flood control for a moment. Work is stopping on \nvirtually all construction projects, studies, and activities related to \nflood control and navigation across this country. These projects \nprotect tens of millions of Americans. A shutdown may mean the Corps \nstops work on improving dam safety projects, including the dam at \nCalifornia's Isabella Lake, which is the dam most at risk of failure in \nour State.\n\n[[Page S7082]]\n\n  Halting these projects endangers citizens and ultimately increases \nthe cost to complete this work. What is more, these projects actually \nreduce overall costs to the Federal Government. Damage prevented by the \nCorps' projects--this is only damage prevented--exceeds $25 billion a \nyear. It is indeed a big deal.\n\n  Other Corps projects interrupted by the shutdown includes the \nstrengthening of levees and flood walls to reduce the risk of loss of \nlife and economic loss from flooding and coastal storms.\n  Work could stop on improvements to flood protection levees along the \nMississippi River, levees that experienced record flood levels in 2011.\n  Projects in Boston, Kansas City, and Seattle could be suspended. Even \nworse, these construction delays would come at a time when severe \nstorms are causing damage with greater frequency.\n  Even dam safety projects could be affected by a shutdown.\n  One example is California's Folsom Dam, where the Corps and the \nBureau of Reclamation are working to increase dam safety. A shutdown \nwould likely cause the Corps and Reclamation to suspend contract \nactivities, delaying this vital project.\n  The Folsom Dam is a major component of the Central Valley Project, \nwhich provides clean water to more than 20 million Californians, and \nshould not be put at risk by a government shutdown.\n  A shutdown will also have dramatic impacts on water-borne commerce.\n  More than 2.3 billion tons of cargo moves through our marine \ntransportation system. Improvements to channels, harbors and waterways \nensure this vital traffic flows without pause.\n  Projects at Oakland Harbor in California, Savannah Harbor in Georgia, \nand Charleston Harbor in South Carolina could be impacted by the \nshutdown, meaning higher construction and transportation costs.\n  The country's vast system of inland waterways could also suffer from \nthe shutdown.\n  More than 600 million tons of cargo move through our inland waterways \non commercial ships. A shutdown means this cargo could be slowed, and \nthe use of locks would likely not be available at all to recreational \nboaters.\n  While facilities on lakes that combine flood control and hydropower \nshould continue to operate because of safety issues, hydropower \noperations will likely be curtailed.\n  This means 353 hydropower units operated by the Corps--which provide \nroughly one-quarter of the country's hydropower--would operate at \nreduced capacity. This would cut into the $1.5 billion in payments the \nunits generate each year.\n  There are also major permitting and operational impacts that will be \nimmediately noticeable.\n  Processing of regulatory permits under the Clean Water Act, which the \nCorps handles, will be suspended.\n  In a typical year, the Corps processes more than 80,000 permit \nactions. This means anyone from an individual building a dock to a \ncommunity planning a major development would not be able to move \nforward because they won't be able to secure a permit.\n  The Corps will also be unable to provide enforcement actions on \nexisting permitted activities, which could harm sensitive environmental \nor aquatic resources.\n  Another visible effect will be the shuttering of recreation areas.\n  The Corps of Engineers is the largest provider of outdoor recreation \namong all federal agencies. They maintain more than 4,200 recreation \nsites at 422 projects in 43 States, with more than 370 million visits \neach year.\n  Those visitors spend more than $18 billion annually and support \n350,000 full-time or part-time jobs. All this will be impacted by a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  The Department of Energy could also face severe limitations under a \nshutdown.\n  Research grants to national labs and universities could be suspended. \nThese grants fund important clean energy challenges related to \nbiofuels, supercomputing, and materials research.\n  The output of world-class science facilities on cutting edge research \nand product development may be significantly reduced. With U.S. \nleadership in science threatened by China, Japan and Europe, now is not \nthe time to suspend major scientific research.\n  Regarding the national security missions of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration, a government shutdown may delay important \nnuclear modernization activities.\n  A government shutdown may disrupt and delay efforts to replace aging \ncomponents in every single nuclear weapon in the stockpile. For \nexample, delays in replacing aging components in the W76 submarine--\nlaunched warhead--which makes up more than 50 percent of the Nation's \nnuclear deterrent--would have serious impacts to the Navy's nuclear \ndeterrence mission.\n  Upgrades to aging infrastructure related to uranium, plutonium and \nhigh explosives capabilities would also be delayed. Delays of just days \ncan add millions of dollars to a project's bottom line.\n  A government shutdown may also delay the design of a new nuclear \nreactor for the Ohio-class submarine. A shutdown may also delay \nrefueling one of only three training nuclear reactors for sailors, \nwhich is critical for supplying sufficient numbers of sailors to man \nthe U.S. submarine fleet.\n  Lastly, on this matter, the shutdown will delay and increase costs to \nclean up and remediate nuclear contamination at former nuclear weapons \nand nuclear energy research sites. These activities should be completed \nas quickly as possible to protect human health.\n  Finally, Madam President, I just wanted to say a couple of things \nabout the much-beleaguered health care plan and what is happening so \nfar.\n  During the first 3 hours today, the Federal health care Web site--\nhealthcare.gov--with information about exchanges across the country \nlogged 1 million visitors. As of 9:30 this morning, in Kentucky, the \nhealth exchange had 24,000 visitors and processed more than 1,000 \napplications.\n  I am anxious to provide the west coast numbers, although not able at \nthis time due to the 3-hour time delay.\n  There were 2 million visits to New York's health exchange during the \nfirst 2 hours of the launched site. Even at 11:30, Connecticut had \n10,000 visitors and 22 people enrolled.\n  Let me just end with this one story. Paula Thornhill, a mother of \nseven who lives in Virginia, was the first to apply for coverage today \nin her county, which is Prince William. She is quoted as saying: ``I am \nrelieved that they did come out with this affordable health care. I am \nrelieved.''\n  So far so good today, and I am hopeful that this tyranny of the \nminority will end shortly.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come back to the Chamber to urge the \nfollowing. I hope as we try to resolve this important spending bill \nthat a key part of that resolution is to live by existing law under \nObamaCare and make sure that Members of Congress and our staff aren't \ntreated far differently and far better than the American people.\n  That is what the congressional portion of my ``No Washington \nExemption'' bill and amendment is all about. It is a pure and simple \nprinciple. I think it is a first principle of democracy, and American \ndemocracy should work by that first principle: What is good for America \nis good for Washington. And what Washington imposes on America, it must \nlive with itself: No special exemptions, privileges, subsidies or \nrules. The same rules. I think that should be the rule across the board \nfor whatever part of law we are talking about. It should certainly be \nthe rule under ObamaCare.\n  Indeed, it is the rule under ObamaCare under the statute. What I have \nbeen fighting is an illegal regulation promulgated by the Obama \nadministration to get around the clear language and the clear intent of \nthe statute. As the Chair knows, during the ObamaCare debate this issue \ncame up, it was debated, and language was passed here in the Senate and \nput into the statute. That language says, pure and simple, every Member \nof Congress and all official congressional staff have to go to the \nObamaCare exchanges for their health care, the same as other Americans \nwho are going to the exchange. No special treatment, no special \nexemption or rules or subsidies. That is the clear language and that \nwas the clear intent.\n\n[[Page S7083]]\n\n  Amazingly--and I was happy to see it at the time--that language, \nwhich I fought hard for, along with many, many others, led on the \nSenate side by Senator Chuck Grassley--was adopted. That became part of \nthe statute that passed into law. But, apparently, it was an example of \nthat old Nancy Pelosi quote--we have to pass the law to figure out what \nis in it--because that language that did pass as part of the ObamaCare \nstatute, when lots of folks on Capitol Hill started reading the details \nand they got to that section, they said: Oh, you know what. We can't \nlive with this. We can't have this. This is a crisis. This would \nactually apply--the exchanges--to Members of Congress and our staffs, \njust as they are applied to millions and millions of other Americans--\n8-million plus who are losing their previous employer provided health \ncare, against their will, and being forced to go to the exchanges.\n  So when that happened, after the passage of ObamaCare, furious \nscheming and lobbying started going on behind the scenes. This included \nlobbying of the administration. Harry Reid and many others got involved \nin asking the President to get personally involved to bail Congress \nout, to prevent this clear statutory language from having its clear \nforce and effect. And sure enough, that worked. President Obama, \naccording to numerous press reports, got personally involved. He \nliterally picked up the phone, had conversations personally with folks \nin his administration about this rulemaking--pretty unprecedented--and, \nsure enough, a rule was issued conveniently right after Congress left \ntown at the beginning of the August recess to flee the scene of the \ncrime.\n  That rule, the so-called OPM rule--completely illegal, in my opinion, \nbecause it is contrary to the statute--does two things. First of all, \nthe rule says: Yes, the statute says all Members of Congress and all \nofficial congressional staff go to the ObamaCare exchanges for health \ncare, but we don't know who official staff is. We have no idea. We \ncan't figure that out, so we are going to leave it up to each \nindividual Member of Congress to figure out who among their employees \nis official staff for purposes of this section, and we are never going \nto second-guess any decision by any Member of Congress, even though \nthis could result in up to 535 different applications of the law.\n  I think we should all be able to agree that is flat-out ridiculous. \nThe law is written. It is written clearly. It uses the words: Official \ncongressional staff. For OPM to say, through this rule, we can't figure \nthat out, we will leave it up to each individual Member of Congress, is \nridiculous, particularly since that would allow a Member saying no one \nwho works for me is ``official staff'' for purposes of this section. \nWhat? They can completely get around the law with regard to staff that \nway. That is just flat-out ridiculous.\n  The second thing this illegal OPM rule does is to say that even for \nMembers of Congress and their staff who do go to the exchange for their \nhealth care, they get to take with them something that no other \nAmerican from a big employer in that sort of situation gets to take--\nthey get to take with them their previous Federal Employee Health \nBenefit Plan subsidy--a huge taxpayer funded subsidy that no other \nAmerican at that income level would get. That is completely separate \ntreatment not envisioned by the statute in any way, and not mentioned \nin the statute in any way. In fact, there are plenty of parts in the \nstatute contrary to that. But they get to take that with them to the \nexchange.\n  Is that available to any other American in that situation at that \nincome level? Absolutely not. So again, that is flat-out ridiculous and \nflat out at odds with the clear statutory language and intent of that \nprovision of ObamaCare.\n  Ever since we came back into session after the August recess and had \nthe opportunity to correct this egregious illegal OPM rule, I have been \nfighting alongside others to do just that. I have been fighting along \nwith a number of Senate colleagues, and I thank them all for their \nactive involvement. I have also been fighting alongside Congressman Ron \nDeSantis of Florida, who is leading the House effort, and many, many \nother House colleagues who are all for this measure.\n\n  I want to make clear and underscore, because this is important, that \nwith regard to Members of Congress and staff, this isn't demanding some \nnew law. This isn't demanding some change to ObamaCare. This is saying \nlet us simply live with what the law is. Let us simply live with the \nclear statutory language. That is what we need to do, and we need to do \nit because it is fair and right for the American people. We need to do \nit because Americans are sick and tired, quite frankly, of Washington \nelites treating themselves like a higher select ruling class.\n  That is exactly the concept the American revolution was founded on. \nThat is exactly the mindset that led to our breaking away from Britain, \nwhich was a monarchy and was governed by that mindset. Yet here we are, \nas in many other cases, Washington is reintroducing that principle. \nThat is a thoroughly un-American principle. And the first principle of \nAmerican democracy--and we should affirm it--is that what Washington \npasses onto America, it lives with itself. Same rules, no special \nexemptions, no carve-outs, subsidies, or bailouts. What is good for \nAmerica is good for Washington, and it should be applied equally across \nthe board. Simple concept. Basic concept.\n  As I said, I would call it the first rule of American democracy, but \nit is being trampled on in this instance. It is being trampled on as \nyet again Washington sets itself apart and above the American people as \na select elite ruling class. That is wrong, and it is as wrong as yet \nanother of a number of exemptions from ObamaCare; it is wrong as yet \nanother example of special treatment--a carve-out, waivers, or \nexemptions.\n  The President often says: This is the law of the land. He is right. \nSo why don't we apply the law of the land as it is written across the \nboard, no exemptions, no waivers, no illegal rules that are contrary to \nthe clear language and intent of ObamaCare. Why don't we start by \napplying ObamaCare just as it is being applied to America in \nWashington. Why don't we start by living by the letter and the spirit \nof the law in saying all Members of Congress and all congressional \nstaff go to the exchanges for their health care and do not take any \nspecial taxpayer funded subsidy with them that is unavailable to any \nother Americans at that income level.\n  That would be leadership, and that is what we need to do. That is not \nchanging the law. That is living by the law. We need to do that and we \nneed to do it now as part of any resolution to these spending bill \ndisagreements.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to gather around this principle. \nI urge my colleagues to vote right on this issue. I assure my \ncolleagues they are going to get the chance to vote one way or the \nother. I am going to continue to demand a clear, clean up-or-down vote \non the Senate floor on this issue. We have not had it. I have fought \nfor it for about 4 weeks now. But because of the extraordinary \nefforts--quite frankly, including threats and intimidation and \nbribery--of the majority leader, we have not been allowed that clear \nup-or-down vote. I will assure my colleagues we are going to get it.\n  I don't know when, I don't know how, because I don't control that, \nbut I am going to make darn sure we are going to get it. And not much, \nif anything, of substance is going to happen until we do. This is \noverdue because this goes into effect today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, what we have is the tea party Republicans' \nversion of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's five stages of grief. More than 40 \nyears ago, Dr. Kubler-Ross laid out the five different emotions \nexperienced by people when they faced what they considered to be an \nawful, unacceptable fate: Making affordable health care available for \nmillions of Americans is anathema to today's tea party Republicans. \nThey\n\n[[Page S7084]]\n\ncannot accept it. They shut down the government to try to stop it.\n  The tea party Republicans cannot handle the fact that the Affordable \nCare Act will guarantee that millions more Americans are going to have \naccess to quality, affordable health care coverage; that being a woman \nis no longer going to be a preexisting condition--women cannot be \ncharged higher insurance rates just because of their gender; no one is \ngoing to go bankrupt just because they get sick.\n  Before the Affordable Care Act, medical bills contributed to more \nthan 60 percent of all personal bankruptcies in the United States. That \nall ends with ObamaCare, which lifts lifetime caps on insurance \ncoverage. Mr. President, 6.6 million people on Medicare have already \nsaved more than $7 billion on their prescription medicines. The tea \nparty Republicans are in the grip of the political equivalent of the \nfive stages of grief. It is the American people who are getting \nsqueezed.\n  The first stage, denial. The tea party Republicans refuse to accept \nthe fact that the Affordable Care Act is the law. They have tried to \nrepeal it more than 50 times. It has been ruled constitutional by the \nSupreme Court. They ignored last year's Presidential election in which \nthe Republican candidate who promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act \nif he was elected was soundly defeated. The tea party Republicans deny \nthe decision by the Supreme Court that found the Affordable Care Act \nconstitutional.\n  The second stage, anger. The tea party Republicans are enraged that \nthe Affordable Care Act is going to work. We know it is going to work \nbecause we have 7 years of experience in Massachusetts, where now 97 \npercent of all adults and 99 percent of all children are covered. We \nhave a poll conducted in April of this year by the Massachusetts \nMedical Society. It indicates that 84 percent of Massachusetts \nresidents are satisfied with their health care. They like their health \ncoverage under the Massachusetts system, which is the very model of \nPresident Obama's plan.\n  The tea party Republicans cannot stand the fact that the Affordable \nCare Act will finally make health care a right and not a privilege in \nour country, in the words of the great Ted Kennedy. The tea party \nRepublicans are so angry about ObamaCare that they closed down the \nFederal Government today, sending hundreds of thousands of Federal \nworkers home without pay.\n  The third stage, bargaining. The tea party Republicans are doing a \nlot of bargaining these days. They are using the entire Federal budget \nand soon the full faith and credit of the United States as leverage in \ntheir negotiation to try to gut ObamaCare. Bargaining rarely provides a \nsustainable solution, especially in this case. That is because the tea \nparty Republicans do not want to negotiate. They want to eliminate the \nAffordable Care Act and the benefits it provides to millions of \nAmericans. They say they want to bargain, but they don't. They say they \nwant to negotiate, but they don't. They just want elimination of the \nhealth care program and that is not going to happen.\n  The fourth stage, depression. The tea party Republicans are clearly \ndepressed that they are getting blamed for shutting down the \ngovernment, that public opinion is sharply turning against them and \nthat many Republicans are repudiating their tactics and their \nextremism. Republicans are fighting amongst themselves, struggling to \nfind a way out of the mess they have made for themselves.\n  Finally, the fifth stage, acceptance. The tea party Republicans have \nnot yet reached this final stage of acceptance. They still do not fully \nunderstand the backlash that they are facing from the public, which \nwill justifiably blame them for the Republican tea party shutdown. The \ntea party Republicans do not yet regret their destructive ways. They \ncertainly are nowhere near acceptance.\n  So I say we are witnessing the tea party Republicans in the throes of \ntheir grief over losing the last election and losing the battle over \nhealth care reform, but it is the American people who are paying the \nprice for this political psychodrama that is tearing the Republican \nParty apart and hurting our country and hurting the health of millions \nof Americans in our country. Now is the time for them to get over it. \nNow is the time for ObamaCare to be the law of the land. It is not \ngoing away.\n  Now is the time to join together to ensure that it works for the \nAmerican people. Now is the time to move forward to pass a budget that \nfunds our government. Now is the time to get our economy back on track, \ncreate jobs, and build a bright future together for all Americans. Now \nis the time for the tea party Republicans to accept what the American \npeople have voted to make the law of our land and the person whom they \nvoted to make the President of our country.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the shutdown \nthat has now occurred.\n  To say I am outraged is an understatement. What we need is for the \nfolks down there at the other end of the U.S. Capitol Building to open \nthis government. The economy of this country is at risk and they have \ndone it to advance their own narrow extremist agenda.\n  All of this is due to a relatively small group of lawmakers down in \nthe House of Representatives--some 40, maybe 60--who are intent on \nhaving their own way on a personal agenda. They are refusing to work \nwith their fellow Republicans, as well as Democrats, down in the House \nof Representatives, and the result is a forced government shutdown that \nis doing a lot of damage to a lot of people. That is why it is \nimportant for the American people to say they have had enough and they \nwant these folks to stop this nonsense.\n  We ought to be keeping government open, but, we need to consider a \ncouple of things. For example, the National Institutes of Health are \nnow unable to bring in 800 patients they were going to start to give \nmedical treatment in breakthrough medical techniques and developments. \nAt the same time, the National Institutes of Health--one of the premier \nagencies in all of this alphabet soup of agencies that we talk about--\nthey have had to furlough 70 percent of their civilian workforce.\n  A few minutes ago, we heard the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, explaining that the Director of \nNational Intelligence has told her he has had to furlough 72 percent of \nthe civilians in the intelligence community. That is ridiculous. We \nhave terrorists who are trying to do us harm, and he has had to \nfurlough 72 percent.\n  Take, for example, NASA. NASA had to furlough 97 percent of its \ncivilian workers in the space program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend, the distinguished Senator from Florida, \nyield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. NELSON. Of course I will. I wish to thank the majority leader for \nhis leadership and for standing firm to stop this nonsense.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank my friend. We served together in the \nHouse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/01/senate-section/article/S7084-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7084-S7085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FEDERAL AGRICULTURE REFORM AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2013\n\n  Mr. REID.

As I understand what the majority leader has just done, \nthe Senate has appointed conferees on the farm bill. That is an example \nthat when there is a political will, we can get together and get things \naccomplished.\n  The National Institutes of Health, NASA, and all of the intelligence \nagencies--72 percent of all the civilians in the intelligence agencies, \nincluding the CIA, are furloughed. We are in a war with those people \nwho are trying to do harm to us. We are having these people furloughed \nall because of a small group, the tea party, in one House of one branch \nof government who are intent on their agenda. It is irresponsible and \nreckless.\n  The truth is, if the Speaker would just bring up what we call the \ncontinuing resolution, which is all of the appropriations bills put \ntogether up to a date certain, November 15, it would pass \noverwhelmingly with Democrats and Republicans both voting for it, not \nthe extremist small group down there, but the Speaker doesn't bring it \nup.\n  What I see happening--if this lasts for more than a day or two--is \nthat the American people will be so irritated and upset that their \nlives are disrupted because they can't get government services they are \ngoing to insist that their government open once again.\n  I have an example. The fine work the people I have the privilege of \nworking with and what they do for the people of my State never ceases \nto amaze me. It is not unusual when I am going into a meeting or \nairport or walking down the street when I am in the State of Florida, \nit is commonplace for people to come up and say to me: I want you to \nknow that I appreciate so much what you did to help me or my mother or \nmy son or my brother who is a veteran.\n  When they say those things, they are talking about all of these \ndedicated people whom I have the great privilege of working with to \nhelp the people of our State on the day-to-day necessities of their \ndaily lives, such as an emergency situation, they realize their \npassport has expired or they lost their passport or didn't get their \nveterans payment or need help getting their brother into a veterans \nhospital or something happened to their Social Security payment or they \nneed information about this particular piece of legislation or they are \nconcerned about somebody they saw whom they thought was doing things \nand they need them to be referenced to the correct agency on a security \nmatter. It goes on and on.\n  These wonderful people we have working with us--some young, some \nold--many of the ones who have been with me for years are so dedicated \nand work day and night. They work their fingers to the bone. They know \nexactly whom to call or to e-mail to get things done for people back \nhome in need. We know what is going to happen. When they call any one \nof our offices in Florida, they are going to get a recording of my \nvoice, telling them what has happened and how all of these folks have \nbeen furloughed and giving them an emergency contact as the one \nlifeline we can provide.\n\n  What happens next? If reasonable people were doing this, we would \nhave never shut down in the first place--people who are bipartisan, who \nhave some common sense, who recognize we can't have it our way all the \ntime but in the best of American tradition respect the other fellow's \npoint of view and then work out differences to achieve a consensus in \norder to gain a workable solution. If those kinds of reasonable folks \nhad been operating, then we would never have shut down in the first \nplace.\n  We have heard about this over and over in the speeches today: I voted \nfor, in the Budget Committee, a budget. It came out of committee and \ncame to the floor. We had over 100 amendments. It took hours and hours. \nWe finally passed a budget which was the outline for the appropriations \nfor the next fiscal year. We passed that in the Senate 6 months ago. \nThe House did the same. They passed out a budget. But when we asked to \ngo to a conference committee to get agreement for working out the \ndifferences between the two, that small group would not let the \nconference not only not convene but even be appointed.\n  I think the majority leader of the Senate will tell us we are ready \nto meet right now, but they have to open the government again. We have \nto put back to work these people who are trying to serve the American \npeople and to protect the American people. Hopefully, if the American \npeople hear these messages, they will get sufficiently agitated and \ninsist that, once again, the crowd that has shut us down instead should \nopen the government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to call for \nan end to the senseless government shutdown and urge Members of the \nHouse to set aside political games for the betterment of the country.\n  The American people are tired of our country being held hostage and \nour economic recovery threatened just to score political points, and \njustifiably so. There are real consequences for this irresponsibility.\n  Shutting down the government for 3 or 4 weeks would reduce real gross \ndomestic product by 1.4 percentage points in the fourth quarter alone, \nand a shutdown longer than 2 months would likely precipitate another \nrecession.\n  But my colleagues don't have to take my word for it. Here is what the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a letter on this very topic: . . . \n``it is not in the best interests of the U.S. business community or the \nAmerican people to risk even a brief government shutdown that might \ntrigger disruptive consequences or raise new policy uncertainties \nwashing over the U.S. economy.''\n  David Cote, the chief executive officer of Honeywell, stated that if \nyou want to create economic disruption and uncertainty for businesses, \nthen a government shutdown is a great way to do it.\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  The truth is we simply can't afford another self-inflicted wound to \nour economy, especially not at a time when things are finally turning \naround. We had big news in our State this month. The unemployment rate \nis down to 5.1 percent. National unemployment is at 7.3 percent. That \nis the lowest point since December of 2008. The housing market is \nbouncing back with existing home sales reaching a 6\\1/2\\ year high in \nAugust. Retail sales are up, and so far this year we have added 1.5 \nmillion private sector jobs. We are not where we need to be, but we are \nmoving in the right direction and it is clear that now is not the time \nto take a step back. Yet here we are again, right in the middle of \nanother manufactured crisis.\n  On Friday, the Senate passed a bill to keep the government running \nthat is free of any ideological policy provisions. The Senate bill \nwould fund the government at the same level as last year through \nNovember 15 and would give Congress and the President time to negotiate \na balanced deficit reduction plan.\n  The commonsense next step would be for the House to take up and pass \nthe Senate's bill. That is democracy. They should put the bill before \nthe House and, by most beliefs, it would pass and it would end the \nshutdown. Instead, the House has sent us four separate versions of the \nlegislation with full knowledge that the Senate would not agree to them \nand the President stating he would veto them. Each of the House \nproposals would have delayed\n\n[[Page S7086]]\n\nimplementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n  So here we stand with the Federal Government shut down just so the \nHouse Republicans could again attempt to relitigate a law that both the \nHouse and the Senate passed, the President signed, and the Supreme \nCourt upheld.\n  That doesn't mean there will be no changes to the law going forward. \nI know the Presiding Officer, the Senator from the great State of West \nVirginia, has some ideas and I have some ideas, but they must be made \nin a rational manner, not as part of poison pill partisanship.\n  House Republicans don't seem to understand or they choose not to care \nabout the negative impact on businesses and families that a government \nshutdown would have. Here are some examples of how my State will be \nimpacted, and I know the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Coons, is here, and \nI know he has some examples as well. This is the story in Minnesota: \nAccording to the Small Business Administration, in 2012 their loan \nprograms approved 53,847 applications and supported 571,383 jobs for an \naverage of just over 1,000 applications per week. What does this mean \nfor Minnesota? Well, my State is home to 115,000 small businesses, and \nI wish to ensure that the SBA loans keep coming through.\n  All lands managed by the National Park Service in Minnesota would be \nclosed. They are closed. These include Voyageurs National Park, the \nMississippi National River and Recreation Area, the North Country \nNational Scenic Trail, the Pipestone National Monument, and the Saint \nCroix National Scenic Riverway. Closure of the parks would result in \nthe loss of tourism revenue. Last year, more than 600,000 visitors \nenjoyed these parks, an average of more than 1,600 visitors per day. \nAccording to the National Park Service in 2011, visits to these parks \nin Minnesota contributed $37 million in economic benefits and generated \n665 jobs in my State.\n  In a State such as Minnesota, where tourism is our fifth largest \nindustry and the source of 11 percent of our private sector revenue, we \nsimply can't afford for this to happen. We simply cannot afford for \nthis critical industry to be hamstrung by political posturing.\n  In the shutdown, the Food and Drug Administration will furlough 7,000 \npeople, roughly 55 percent of the agency's workforce. That means the \nprocess for approving life-saving drugs and treatments and devices--\nsomething that matters a lot in my State--would grind to a halt, and \nshipments arriving at our ports from overseas will no longer be \nmonitored by the FDA.\n  The shutdown also has the potential to slow down research at the Mayo \nClinic. The bulk of Mayo's funding for research comes from the National \nInstitutes of Health grants.\n  In the government shutdown, 70 percent of NIH staff is shut out, as \nSenator Mikulski has said on this floor many times, 70 percent of the \nNational Institutes of Health staff. That represents about 19,000 \nAmerican scientists, researchers, and others who are working to develop \na cure for Alzheimer's, working to develop a cure for muscular \ndystrophy, working to develop a cure for autism.\n  Staff from the Mayo Clinic said if the government shuts down, the NIH \nwill not be reviewing new grant proposals, and that is starting today.\n  In addition, it means funding for recently approved grant projects \nwon't be released, and new patients will not be admitted to the NIH \nClinical Center or allowed to begin new clinical trials.\n  We must also be willing to do the right thing for the safety of our \npeople. That is, all in all, in my belief as a former prosecutor, the \nNo. 1 duty of government--to keep our people safe. When it comes to \nhomeland security, counterterrorism, and Federal law enforcement, rest \nassured those protections will continue, but in the event of a \nshutdown, the Federal officers who continue going to work protecting \nthe public from violent crimes, gangs, and terrorists won't be getting \na paycheck. Instead, they will be getting an IOU. So basically what we \nwill be saying to these people, and what we are saying as of midnight \nlast night, is: Thank you for putting your lives on the line but we \ncan't pay you right now because there are some people in the House who \nwant to delay the Affordable Health Care Act, and if you are lucky, \nmaybe you will get backpay when all this is sorted out.\n  My colleagues in the House like to talk a big game about how \nuncertainty is hindering real economic growth. I believe uncertainty \nhinders economic growth. So it is quite ironic that they are now \ncreating this economic uncertainty and are willing to threaten our \neconomy on a political gamble.\n  Shutting down the government is not a negotiating tactic. If the \nHouse were to take up the Senate bill to fund the government, it is \nexpected to pass and the shutdown would end. During that time, over the \nnext 6 weeks, it will give us that time to truly negotiate a long-term \ndebt deal done in a balanced way. Instead, critical services and the \neconomic recovery are being threatened with poison pill partisanship.\n  To my colleagues in the House and in the Senate, I say this: Let's \nget this done. We owe it to the people we were elected to serve. We owe \nit to the country. Let's end this government shutdown now.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today is October 1. Today is the day that \nhas long been known as the day when the Affordable Care Act will first \ncome into force and exchanges across the country will begin to be open \nto citizens of all different backgrounds and walks of life for them to \nseek affordable, accessible insurance on these exchanges, the next step \nin the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. On one level, it is a \ngood day, because tens of millions of Americans are today gaining \naccess to quality affordable care. I am told that since midnight, \nnearly 3 million people visited healthcare.gov, 80,000 or more have \ncalled a hotline, and 60,000 have requested live chats for \napplications, and enrollment in these marketplaces is moving forward at \na record pace. So, on some level, this is an important day, because \nmillions of Americans across dozens of States are getting access to \nquality affordable health care.\n  On the other hand, as the Presiding Officer well knows, this is an \nembarrassing, difficult, and disappointing day. The Federal Government \nof the United States is shut down. As of midnight last night, the \nPresident, the Office of Management and Budget, directed all the \ndifferent executive agencies and offices to begin shutting down. As a \nresult, 800,000 Federal employees are spending today at home--not \nhelping small businesses with loans from the SBA; not helping move \nforward grants that invest in improving our infrastructure; not moving \nforward federally funded research that might find a cure for cancer or \nfor MS or for autism; not helping applicants get college loans; not \nhelping disabled veterans get access to the benefits they earned \nthrough their service to our country. We could go on and on about all \nthe different ways these Federal employees--these public servants--are \ntoday not able to help our constituents, our fellow citizens.\n  I have gotten a fair number of contacts today--phone calls to my \noffice, e-mails to my office, folks connecting with me on Facebook or \nthrough Twitter, or directly or indirectly, to convey how frustrated \nand upset they are.\n  I want to try to put all of this in some context for the folks who \nmight be watching. What is it we are fighting over? As best I can \nunderstand, a few Members of this body and a few Members of the House \nof Representatives have shut this government down in an effort to try \nto stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. That is what \nthis is all about. They have refused to take up and pass a bill that \nwould fund the continuation of the U.S. Federal Government. In so \ndoing, they are doing about $10 billion a week in damage to our \neconomy. They are doing all of that damage I referred to in terms of \nhundreds of thousands of Federal employees not able to help improve our \ncommunities or keep us safe or move our country forward.\n  So why are we doing this? I think it has been said for many years \nthat the definition of ``insanity'' is doing the same thing over and \nover and expecting a different result. Well, the House of \nRepresentatives has tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act I think 42 \ntimes now.\n  As best I understand, this bill, which was passed by both Chambers \nand\n\n[[Page S7087]]\n\nsigned into law and then challenged at length in the Supreme Court and \nupheld and then was the central issue of the last Presidential \nelection, which was not particularly close, this law of the land, which \nis moving forward in its implementation today, will not be stopped by \nshutting down the Federal Government.\n  This is a strategy that never really had a serious chance of success. \nDespite very long, quasi-filibuster speeches on this floor, despite all \nsorts of public pronouncements, this strategy has no chance actually of \nworking. So what is the point? Why is this Federal Government shut \ndown? It seems to me that it is simply a demonstration of a temper \ntantrum, a fit by a small number of folks who promised people back home \nthat they will not allow this government to go forward with the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  I think what we should be doing instead is working together across \nthe aisle to improve the Affordable Care Act. It is not perfect. Of \ncourse it has blemishes. There will be hiccups and there will be \ninconsistencies and issues that need to be worked out as this law is \nimplemented. We ought to be working together across the aisle, the \nSenate and House together, to make sure it is done in an affordable, \nsustainable, and positive way rather than a small minority digging in \ntheir heels and imposing all of this wreckage for their own partisan \ngoal.\n  Let me share some of the thoughts I have gotten from folks at home \nwho are not exactly happy about our having a Federal Government \nshutdown today.\n  First, Ray White of Ellendale, DE, wrote:\n\n       I am a veteran and a US government employee. The furlough \n     and sequester we already went through back in August of this \n     year cost me 20 percent of my paycheck for over a month, \n     causing my bills to get out of control. I would like to know \n     how to make ends meet when I have no money to pay my bills, \n     and lawmakers in the Capitol want to put me out of work \n     again.\n\n  To Ray and your family, I am sorry. I am sorry for the fact that we \nhave a few folks in the House of Representatives who will not take up a \nbill to keep our government open. As the Senator from Minnesota \nrecently related, if the Speaker of the House would just let that bill \nget to the floor, it would pass. There are more than enough Democrats \nand Republicans in the House to pass that bill if the House would just \ntake it up. I don't think there is any question who caused this \nshutdown and why.\n  CWO2 Christopher Slicer of Newark wrote me to say:\n\n       As a federal technician and Army National Guardsman, I find \n     it ridiculous that those we have elected as our \n     representatives cannot do their jobs. If I wasn't doing my \n     job, I would be fired or reprimanded. There is no excuse. I \n     don't care which party it is for not passing whatever it is \n     that needs to be done to have a budget. For our government to \n     shut down shows how incompetent our government is to the \n     world and worse its own citizens. There are thousands of us \n     federal employees who have had to endure furloughs already, \n     and you are telling me that we may have more.\n\n  Well, to CWO Christopher Slicer, I apologize that this Congress is \nunable to come together across this partisan divide and that we have \nanother needless, manufactured crisis that just a few irresponsible \nMembers insisted on to make a partisan point.\n  I think CWO Christopher Slicer makes a particularly important point: \nthat this government shutdown shows our weaknesses in our inability to \nget together across this partisan divide not just to our citizens but \nto the world. At a time of real instability and real threat to our \nnational security around the world, I think this government shutdown is \nnot just harmful to our communities, our families, and our economy, but \nto our country and its standing in the world.\n  Last I will read, if I might, a note from Laurie Tonkay of Dover. \nLaurie wrote me to say:\n\n       It seems like we just got through the government furloughs \n     and now there is a good chance you're going to shut down the \n     government.\n\n  This came yesterday.\n\n       My husband is employed with the Civil Service on Dover Air \n     Force Base. This makes it difficult for ordinary families to \n     make ends meet. I am getting discouraged with the way things \n     are being done in Washington these days. America is in debt \n     because we overspend, then you make your average hard-working \n     employees pay the price for it repeatedly.\n\n  She concludes:\n\n       Morale is low, and frankly, I have lost confidence in the \n     bureaucracy. I wonder if things would be different if this \n     were an election year. Would you shut the government down? I \n     think not. Show you care and get something done now.\n\n  Well, to Laurie, I am sorry for the impact this shutdown has had on \nyou and your family. But it is the result of a few irresponsible \nMembers of the House of Representatives. If the Speaker would just put \non the floor for a vote what has been passed here in the Senate, we \nwould have a government reopened today and we could get back to the \nbusiness of this country. We could get back to conference on the budget \nand make progress on investing in making our communities safer, our \nfamilies stronger, our schools and our students better educated, and \ndoing the investment in our infrastructure and research we need to move \nour economy forward.\n  Let me conclude by sharing this. I have a number of wonderful folks \non my staff who work in my offices in Delaware and in Washington whose \nreal focus is constituent service. If folks call my office and they \nhave a problem or an issue at home that we need to help with, they do \nan amazing job.\n  One young man, Brendan Mackie, recently joined my staff. He is a two-\ntour veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq. He works tirelessly to make sure \nthe veterans who contact my office get the help they need.\n  A staff sergeant recently contacted us. He was wounded in Baghdad in \n2007 by an IED. He lost the documentation for his Purple Heart. Well, \nBrendan dove right in and did all sorts of work--collected sworn \nstatements and medical records, submitted everything to the relevant \nArmy review board--and has managed to get his Purple Heart reissued.\n  That is the kind of case work my folks do day in and day out, making \nsure that whether it is accessing veterans' benefits or disability \nbenefits, Social Security, or medals earned in service to this Nation \nin combat, the men and women of Delaware who contact my office and rely \non me and their services for great constituent support can get that \nhelp. Sadly, Brendan is home today and not able to serve the people of \nDelaware, not able to do his job.\n  If I might, I would close by saying this: This is the latest in a \nseries of manufactured crises, of completely senseless, self-inflicted \nwounds. It is up to the Speaker of the House and to the folks in the \nHouse of Representatives to take up and pass the bill we sent them days \nago that would allow this government to reopen and allow the leaders of \nthis Chamber and the other Chamber to move forward on dealing with the \nreal issues facing our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it appears the Republicans understand \nfinally that the government is shut down, but now they are focusing on \ntrying to cherry-pick some of the few parts of government they like. \nThey do not like it all, but they like a few parts of it. Just another \nwacky idea from the tea party-driven Republicans. You can tell that the \ntea party Republicans still want to keep the government shut down. If \nthey wanted to reopen the government, they would simply reopen the \ngovernment by bringing the Senate's bill to their floor and letting it \npass with a majority vote. We could reopen the government in a matter \nof minutes if Speaker Boehner had the courage to stand up to the tea \nparty.\n  I said the word ``we''--they.\n  We support veterans and parks. We support the FBI. We support the \nFederal Government. That is our job. That is what we do. But we cannot \nand we will not be forced to choose between parks and cancer research \nor disease control or highway safety or the FBI or, as we have heard \nhere today, on and on with examples from the National Security Agency, \nwhich has cut by more than 70 percent its personnel. The Republicans \nseem willing to fund veterans, but what about the rest of the \ngovernment?\n  First, we need to end the government shutdown and then Democrats will \nbe happy to agree on funding for specific items. We would be glad to do \nthat. We\n\n[[Page S7088]]\n\nwould be happy to agree to fund priorities as soon as Congress enacts \nlegislation to reopen the government.\n  The Republican plan is not a serious plan. It is not a plan to run \nthe country. It is not a plan the American people sent us here to do. \nThis is just as clear as the Presiding Officer seated before me--wide-\nshouldered, Former Governor of West Virginia, someone who has been in \ngovernment for many decades. It is so clear, here is what it is all \nabout. They have it in words.\n  Here is their plan. Some of the rabble-rousers over there have said \nwhat they want to do, which is take little bits and pieces of the \nFederal Government, send something over for veterans today, parks \ntomorrow, maybe security agencies tomorrow and the next day, and this \nwill go on for weeks. Well, what will not get funded? ObamaCare. Now, \nit is so obvious. In fact, one of the Senators said this. In fact, I am \nparaphrasing part of this. This appeared in the Salt Lake Tribune.\n  It is obvious we cannot end ObamaCare, so we are going to have a \ndifferent approach.\n  In light of the fact they cannot end ObamaCare, here is the quote: \n``In light of that, let's leave ObamaCare for another day and not hold \nhostage the vast majority of government functions.''\n  The Utah Republican has claimed credit for kick-starting the effort \nto use the Federal budget as leverage to halt funding for ObamaCare--a \nmove that led to the impasse and the government shutdown. So they could \nnot do that, so now what they want to do is nitpick these little things \nwhile the government is shut down and wait until the end and there is \nnothing for ObamaCare in spite of the fact that millions of people now \nhave health care today that they did not have yesterday because of the \nexchanges coming online.\n  We need to reopen the government. The key to that still remains over \nin the House of Representatives. It is the Senate-passed clean bill for \nthe whole government. If Republicans were serious, they would pass that \nbill. Doing anything else is just sour grapes. This is not serious. The \ngovernment is shut down. If they think they are going to come and \nnitpick us, it will not work. It will not work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the latest Republican proposal is a \ncynical one that pits important priorities against each other. People \nshould not have to choose between health for our veterans and cancer \nresearch. We should not have to choose between keeping our highway \nprojects going and cleaning up toxic waste areas. We should not have to \nchoose between visiting our national parks and enrolling our kids in \nHead Start.\n  As we said a thousand times, we are happy to discuss how to fund the \ngovernment but not with a gun to our head. Open up all of the \ngovernment, and then we can have a fruitful discussion.\n  You know, it gets a little tiresome. It is game after game, gambit \nafter gambit from the other side of the aisle. They keep trying new \nthings, new tricks. Some of them have to do with ObamaCare, and some of \nthem are unrelated to ObamaCare. They are trying as they might, Speaker \nBoehner, to wriggle out--Speaker Boehner is trying to wriggle out of \nthe box in which he has put himself. On the one hand, he knows shutting \ndown the government is highly unpopular and hurts America. On the \nother, he is so used to giving obeisance to the hard right that he is \nafraid not to. He is betwixt and between.\n  But I will tell you, today was a bad day for Speaker Boehner and \nthose who want to shut the government down. Polling data is \noverwhelming. Americans 3 to 1 support opening the government even if \nit means keeping ObamaCare going.\n  Americans think that the Republican Party is being irresponsible and \nnot living up to what it should be doing. Americans are telling \nRepublicans in the House: Vote now. Open the government by putting a \nclean continuing resolution funding bill on the floor.\n  They will have new games, but we are not going to go for them. Sooner \nor later, they are going to have to say: OK, we will fund the \ngovernment. Then we will discuss things, but--as has been said over and \nover--not with a gun to our heads.\n  Democratic unity is as strong as ever, from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue \nto just about every Member of the House of Representatives and to all \n54 Members of this united Democratic Caucus. This is great because it \nmeans that there is hope.\n  The bad news about today is, of course, that many innocent people \nwere hurt. There are 800,000 Federal workers who depend on paychecks to \nfeed their families and they were told they can't come in to work. They \nare dedicated to their jobs. They want to come in to work. They can't \nand, of course, they are not getting paid.\n  Millions more are affected as well. We had furloughs at the Niagara \nFalls Air Reserve Station in Buffalo of defense employees, many of them \ncivilian. We fought hard to keep that base open. Now we are telling the \npeople: Go home, you can't work today--as important as that base is to \nthe security of America.\n  Senator Feinstein was here earlier. Three-quarters of our \nintelligence people at the NSA are not working. That is an abstract \nconcept, but it relates to every single one of us and our security.\n  The idea of shutting this government down may sound good to the hard \nright in the abstract, but even when their constituents learn of what \nspecifically it means, they are going to run away from that concept.\n  To my colleagues, particularly from Texas, the junior Senator from \nTexas, who has evidently come up with this new plan, face it. The \nSenator is not going to get us to give in to extortion. The Senator is \nnot going to take as hostage millions of innocent Americans and succeed \nin getting us to do something that he wants but we don't and they \ndon't.\n  I saw in the Salt Lake City paper that the junior Senator from Utah \nsaid: Maybe we should forget about ObamaCare and look to spending cuts.\n  Well, good morning. That is what we have been saying all along. We \nmay not like the spending cuts in certain areas that they proposed, but \nwe are willing to discuss them. That is how a budget works, how \nappropriations works, and how our government is run. But to take an \nextraneous issue and to say unless we get rid of it, they are going to \nshut down the government, no way.\n  I wish to tell my colleagues if they think they are having a rough \ntime here on shutting down the government in terms of the politics, in \nterms of where people are, and in terms of their base of support, wait \nuntil they try to shut down the debt ceiling.\n  Senator Cruz, Senator Lee, it is going to be 10 times worse. The \ndangers are even greater to America. The pressure on all of us will be \neven more severe, and that will not work either.\n  I have a simple suggestion. Let's in one fell swoop fund the \ngovernment, allow the government to pay its bills, and begin debating \nthe spending issues that we should justly debate instead of putting \nAmerica through these paroxysms because they know, we know, and the \nAmerican people know they will not succeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we were notified just after lunch of the \nnew strategy that is coming out of the Cruz control that we are facing \non Capitol Hill.\n  It turns out that Senator Cruz is going to pick and choose those \ndepartments of government that he wishes to open. That's right. The \njunior Senator from Texas is going to go through his priority list of \nFederal agencies that he thinks should be open and funded.\n  We closed down virtually all of them at midnight and, sadly, some \n800,000 Federal workers have been furloughed across the United States, \nsome of them going home without a paycheck for as long as this goes on.\n  The height of irresponsibility is that the junior Senator from Texas \nnow wants to pick and choose those agencies he wishes to reopen. One of \nthose agencies, not surprisingly, is the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. Of course, we owe that obligation to our veterans. They wish \nto open the Department of Veterans Affairs, but perhaps not other \ndepartments.\n  Let me remind the Senator from Texas of a couple of realities. They \nmay fund the Department of Veterans Affairs with a short-term \nappropriations bill, but this bill will not help\n\n[[Page S7089]]\n\nbring back the paychecks of the 546,000 veterans who currently work for \nthe Federal Government--546,000, over half a million.\n  To help the Department of Veterans Affairs, they are ignoring half a \nmillion or more veterans who are Federal workers. More than one in four \nFederal workers is a veteran and more than a quarter of veterans \nemployed by the Federal Government are disabled.\n  The Senator from Texas is picking and choosing those veterans he \nwants to help. The disabled veterans working for our Federal Government \nare not going to get the help. Those working at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs will.\n  This is the height of irresponsibility, and it is the height of \narrogance. Then, of course, he decides, since he has heard all the \nspeeches about all the national parks that have been closed, we are \ngoing to open the national parks. That is a good thing. I would support \nthat.\n  But let me ask the Senator from Texas--who is now deciding what is \nimportant in our Federal Government--does he think maybe the medical \nresearch at the National Institutes of Health is important? Does he \nthink maybe the efforts that these scientists and doctors are \nundertaking to find cures for diseases, the next drug, the next medical \ndevice, the next surgical technique to save his life or the life of \nsomeone he loves is important? You bet it is.\n  The list goes on and on. It is reckless for the junior Senator from \nTexas to decide: Well, OK, tomorrow veterans and national parks. Then \nmaybe later on we will get around to medical research, or maybe we will \nget around to criminal administration in the Department of Justice.\n  Maybe we will get around to bringing the people back to the \nintelligence agencies who are monitoring terrorists all over the world \nwho threaten the United States.\n  I sure hope we make the wish list of Senator Cruz when it comes to \nour national security. To think that this Senator has the nerve to try \nto decide what is really, really important for America--I will state \nwhat is important for America. It is important to end this \nirresponsibility and this recklessness.\n  It is important to realize these are real lives and real people doing \nwork for the United States of America. Using them as political pawns is \nan embarrassment. It is an embarrassment to this institution and those \nwho are pushing this agenda. We know this problem can be cured and \nsolved in a matter of moments.\n  If Speaker John Boehner would have the nerve to put the spending bill \nthat passed the Senate on the floor of the House of Representatives, it \nwould pass in a minute. The Speaker knows it would. That is why he will \nnot call it.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair I say to my friend from Illinois, during \nall this prioritization that they are doing, this agency and that \nagency, the government is closed, isn't it? The government is closed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct. As of midnight, the notice went out that \nthe government agencies were closed. There are some that are doing \nimportant jobs that are absolutely essential--air traffic control, for \nexample--but the agencies of government have been closed.\n  Please listen to Senator Mikulski of Maryland. I wish Senator Cruz \nwould come to the floor and spend a few minutes listening to her about \nthe National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control, \nwhich due to this reckless strategy by the Republicans, have closed \ntoday. Really? Closing the doors on medical research in the United \nStates of America. What a moment of great pride for the tea party to be \nable to claim they closed down the National Institutes of Health.\n  Now they are going to pick and choose. Maybe it will make the list. \nPerhaps not this week but next week we will get back into the business \nof medical research. On the greatest Nation on Earth we are facing \nthis. It not only makes the Nation look bad around the world, it harms \nour economy. Think about it for a moment.\n  How much confidence would you have in the United States of America if \nits government is capable of shutting down, over a political squabble \nthat is totally unnecessary, shutting down the government of the United \nStates of America. What a source of pride for the tea party Republicans \nbut not for the rest of America.\n  The rest of America knows that we need to roll up our sleeves and \nsolve our problems. We have to stop these doomsday scenarios, these \nthreats, this irresponsible, reckless strategy from the tea party \nRepublicans.\n  It is time for the Speaker of the House of Representatives not only \nto lead the Republicans in the House but to be a leader for America. It \nis time for all of us to come together, to fund this government, and \nmove it forward today--not tomorrow, not next week, not beyond and \nmore.\n  When it comes to the debt ceiling, it is the full faith and credit of \nthe United States that is at stake. The question is very basic. Will \nAmerica pay its bills?\n  These same Members of Congress who voted for the spending now refuse \nto pay the bills. As Congressman Obey of Wisconsin used to say: They \nwant to pose for holy pictures. Oh, yes, we voted for the spending, but \nwe don't want to pay for it. We are not going to vote for a debt \nceiling. My goodness, the word ``debt'' scares us and it may scare the \nvoters.\n  They would see the United States default for the very first time in \nour history on our debts, fail to make payments on our debts.\n  What is the practical impact of that if families decide not to pay \ntheir debts, to skip a mortgage payment. They are going to meet their \nbanker. They are going to call them and say: Pardon me, Senator, did \nyou notice that you didn't make your mortgage payment? If you didn't \nnotice, we did. It is going on your credit report. The next time you \ntry to borrow money it is going to be at a higher interest rate because \nyou are not very creditworthy.\n  Now multiply that into a nation of more than 300 million people. The \nnext time we start to borrow the money after we have defaulted on our \ndebt for the first time in history, what is going to happen to \nAmerica's credit rating? Interest rates will go up.\n  Well, so what. A slight tick up in the interest rate paid by America \nfor its debt consumes billions of dollars that could be spent on \neducation, on research, and on building America's infrastructure. This \nis wasted money because of this wasteful strategy from tea party \nRepublicans.\n  Over and over Speaker Boehner has sent us these bills to defund \nObamaCare. Why were they so desperate to stop health care reform? \nBecause October 1, today, is a big, big day across America. For the \nvery first time we are providing Internet access to uninsured Americans \nso they can have, maybe for the first time in their lives, a chance to \nbuy health insurance. Some of them have never, ever been protected by \nhealth insurance. Now they may have a chance at affordable health \ninsurance. In the State of Illinois, 1.8 million uninsured people get a \nchance, a chance to buy health insurance that they can afford.\n  I heard at lunch today that more than 2 million people visited this \nWeb site in the State of New York this morning. Do you think there is a \npent-up demand for health insurance? It also is an indication of why \ntea party Republicans are in a fevered state over ObamaCare coming \nonline.\n  This is going to work. It is going to finally give peace of mind and \nhealth insurance protection to people who have lived a lifetime without \nit.\n  I have met them, folks who have a child with diabetes, a child with a \nmental illness, a child with asthma. This is fairly common. These are \npeople who can't get health insurance because some member of their \nfamily has a preexisting condition. ObamaCare finally wipes that off \nthe slate and says they can't discriminate against people because of \npreexisting conditions. Well, you listen to Senator Cruz and others, \nand they say we want to do away with that protection.\n\n  I hope the Senator never has to face that in his own family. Some of \nus have. And once you have faced it, you realize what a heartbreak it \nis not to be able to buy health insurance because of a preexisting \ncondition of someone whom you love in your family.\n\n[[Page S7090]]\n\n  We are going to change that with ObamaCare. We are going to give \npeople a chance to buy health insurance, and that is what frightens \nthese Republicans--the notion, as that program takes root and grows in \nAmerica, and people have the confidence and peace of mind of health \ninsurance protection, it is going to be a program they cannot wipe away \nwith the back of their hand.\n  So all of the things we are seeing, the political gymnastics coming \nfrom Senator Cruz and the tea party Republicans notwithstanding, we \nknow the bottom line is this: This is a good, strong Nation, where \nDemocrats and Republicans need to work together to solve our problems \ntogether, not with threats, not with guns to our heads, but with a \ncommon purpose of serving this great Nation.\n  I am troubled that now we are going to get the Senator Cruz list of \nhis favorite agencies. He starts with the Veterans' Administration. Let \nhim start with the Federal workforce, where over 500,000 members are \nactual veterans and a quarter of them disabled. If he really cares \nabout veterans, have him call the Speaker. Let's get this government up \nand running again tomorrow. We can reflect on what happened during the \nlast 24 hours if we do, but let's not continue this embarrassment to \nthe United States. It is irresponsible, it is reckless, it is damaging \nto our economy and a lot of innocent people. We need to put an end to \nthis government shutdown.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I regret also we are now experiencing a \npartial shutdown of our Federal Government. Through no fault of their \nown, some citizens who are visiting Washington are also being denied \ngovernment services and access to memorials that their tax dollars \nsupport. I hope we can soon eliminate any inconvenience that is being \ncaused by this shutdown for visitors and citizens who planned trips \ninto our Nation's Capital.\n  The effects of the shutdown are real and they are being felt in \npractical ways, well beyond the Nation's Capital. But certainly here in \nWashington we witnessed an example of the unintended and sometimes \nabsurd consequences of the Congress and the President's inability to \nreach an agreement.\n  Today, for example, a large group of World War II veterans from my \nState of Mississippi caught an early flight from Gulfport to Washington \nas part of the Honor Flight program. These flights allow veterans who \nmight not have the ability to come here on their own to visit the \nnational World War II Memorial that was built to honor their brave \nservice--service that saved the world from some of the greatest evils \never known. Confronted with barricades, however, that were erected this \nmorning around the open-air memorial, as a part of the shutting down of \nthe Federal Government, the citizens from my State carefully removed \nthe barriers and made a path so they were able to walk on to the \nmemorial and lay a wreath beneath the memorial's Mississippi column.\n  I am very pleased the visit of these veterans to Washington was not \nruined by the government shutdown, even though there were some \nobstacles. But I hope their experience reminds all of us--Federal \nagencies, Members of Congress, and others who live here in the Nation's \nCapital--to not make this situation more difficult than it has to be \nfor veterans or other visitors who are coming to the city. For some \nthis may be the only time in their life they will be able to do that.\n  So I take this opportunity to thank the veterans from our State for \ntheir calm, cool, and collected demeanor during what could have been a \nfrustrating experience, and I salute all veterans for their service to \nour Nation and the access they have even on a day where the agencies \nare ``closed.'' There are certain premises that should remain open and \navailable for visitation and visibility.\n  I thank the Honor Flight volunteers for their calm, cool, and \ncollected demeanor and their support for the freedoms of our country. I \nam sure they will all receive a very warm welcome tonight when they \nreturn home to Gulfport.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi for his remarks about these Honor Flight veterans. We \njust had a group come down from Rhode Island, including one gentleman \nwho was 100 years old. It was so meaningful for them. In Rhode Island, \nit is particularly the fire chiefs and the firefighters who have been \nhelping to organize these honor flights, and Chief George Farrell and \nothers took immense pleasure and meaning out of having brought these \ngentlemen down and enabling them to have this recognition.\n  The tide of time is sweeping that ``greatest generation'' into its \ndying years, and while they are still among us, it is a wonderful thing \nto do. So I thank the Senator from Mississippi for that.\n  I came to the floor to, I guess, say: Welcome to tea party shutdown, \nday 1. We do not know how long this is going to go, but it is already \nhaving, I will say, miserable impact in Rhode Island.\n  We have as many as 7,000 Federal employees facing furlough. We just \ngot word that at Naval Station Newport 800 men and women have been \nfurloughed. Our Rhode Island National Guard let us know they are \nanticipating 300 furloughs. These are people who work hard for our \nFederal Government. They do important jobs, particularly with respect \nto the National Guard and Naval Station Newport. They support our \ntroops. It is not fair to them that the tea party extremists over in \nthe House would insist on putting them out of work in order to force a \nway around the constitutional process of government here in Congress.\n  The key to putting those 7,000 Rhode Islanders, the 800 Naval Station \nNewport, the 300 civilian guardsmen employees, back on the job is a \nvery simple one, and it is in the hands of Speaker Boehner. All he has \nto do is call up the continuing resolution. All he has to do is take \nthe measure the Senate passed and put it before the House for a vote. \nJust give it a vote. That is all it takes.\n  Why does he not do that? He doesn't do that because there is this \npeculiarity over in the House called the Hastert rule. It is not a real \nrule; it is just called that. It is a practice. It is a practice named \nafter former Republican Speaker Dennis Hastert. The practice is that if \nyour own caucus won't agree on a bill--if the Republicans, all by \nthemselves in a room with no Democrats present, won't agree on a bill--\nthen the Speaker won't even give Democrats a chance to vote on it. It \nwill never come to the floor. It is the most partisan rule or practice \nthat exists in this body, in my estimation, and it has been a problem \nfor the Republicans before. There have been times when Speaker Boehner \nhas had to use that key he has to simply put a measure before the body \nwithout clearing that partisan prescreening by his Republicans. He has \ndone it over and over to protect the Republican Party from itself, when \nthey were going to force choices that would be terrible for the country \nand terrible for the party, ultimately.\n  The first was on the fiscal cliff. Remember the hair's-breadth antics \nthat led up to the fiscal cliff? Well, finally, Speaker Boehner put the \nfiscal cliff bill to a vote in the House and it passed 2 to 1. The \nRepublicans voted against it in the caucus, so we know it flunked the \nHastert rule test. But it passed the House with a bipartisan vote of \nRepublicans and Democrats, and it spared us then from going off the \nfiscal cliff.\n  That was the right call for the Speaker to make. It was the right \ncall for the country. It was the right call for his party because they \ndidn't want to own that debacle and he made a good decision at that \ntime.\n  The next was the Violence Against Women Act. Over and over we have \npassed the Violence Against Women Act in bipartisan fashion in the \nSenate, and it has been passed in bipartisan fashion over in the House. \nWe passed it again in bipartisan fashion in the Senate, but it was \ngoing to fail in the House. Well, how do you go back to your voters, if \nyou are a reasonable House Member, and say: We refused for the first \ntime to pass the Violence Against Women Act? It came over in bipartisan \nfashion from the Senate. It had strong support here, but we refused to \npass it.\n  Well, they couldn't.\n\n[[Page S7091]]\n\n  So once again Speaker Boehner waived the so-called Hastert rule--this \npractice of having to have his caucus have a pre-veto on anything that \ncomes to the floor--and he brought the Violence Against Women Act to \nthe floor, and once again it passed. It passed with Democratic and \nRepublican support.\n  The third time was the disaster bill for Sandy. Many of our States \nwere hit darn hard by Sandy. New York and New Jersey took really \ncrushing blows. But the House Republicans didn't want to fund this \nparticular disaster recovery. In fact, they voted 3 to 1 against it--3 \nto 1 against disaster recovery for their fellow Americans. That is how \nthey voted over there. But Speaker Boehner knew how much trouble he \nwould be in with, among others, Governor Christie of New Jersey, so he \ncalled it up anyway. He violated this so-called Hastert rule and he \nbrought it up for a vote, and it passed again in bipartisan fashion.\n  Today, tonight, tomorrow, the next day--any time he chooses--Speaker \nBoehner can turn the key and unlock the government tea party shutdown. \nHe can do that. He has done it three times before. Of course, that got \nall his tea party folks all excited and they started making new threats \nand new challenges and new demands, so he is reluctant to go down that \nroad again. But he has done it before, and it remains in his hands. I \nwould submit it is the right thing to do for our country, and that he \nshould put that first.\n  The first way they fouled up the continuing resolution was to try and \nstall the Affordable Care Act on it. Well, we voted that down over and \nover, and cooler heads may be beginning to prevail. But I would remind \neverybody there are two pretty distinct, I guess we will call them \nObamaCares now, since that is the word that is being used--two \nObamaCares out there. One, to use Majority Leader Reid's phrase, is a \npunch line. It is the punch line ``ObamaCare'' that revs people up at \nrallies, that sends that rightwing e-mail chain into vibrations, but \nwhich is mostly a product of a fertile and overheated imagination.\n  The real ObamaCare, at least the real one we see in my home State of \nRhode Island, is actually something we like a lot. Seniors are getting \nprotection from the dreaded doughnut hole and are saving over $1,000 \neach on prescription medications, on average. They see the Affordable \nCare Act as something that is having a real benefit in their lives \nright now.\n  Parents, such as myself, who have kids out of college and under 26--\nand I hear this from everybody across Rhode Island--are saying: Thank \ngosh the Affordable Care Act is there, because my daughter is out of \ncollege and she hasn't been able to find a job yet that has a health \ncare benefit, so I can keep her on my policy and I don't have to worry \nif she gets sick the whole family could be bust. Having her on my \npolicy makes me feel so good. Thank you for that.\n  That is what I hear. That is a real and good thing for actual Rhode \nIslanders. It is not the imaginary ObamaCare. It is the real ObamaCare.\n  Families who have a child with a preexisting condition--what do you \ndo about that? You could spend down and give up all your resources, \neverything you have worked for and earned, so that your family can go \non Medicaid--that is one way--or you could stay in the same job forever \nbecause the minute you try to move from your employer's health care \nplan to a new employer's health care plan, your child's preexisting \ncondition doesn't get covered any longer. So you are trapped. Across \nthis country, people are spared that agony by the Affordable Care Act.\n  We had Peter Orszag in the other day to talk to our caucus. He said \nthat if you extend out the cost of Medicare to the future, it is \nalready down $1.2 trillion from the savings we see from reforms that \nare happening in red States, in blue States, in Massachusetts, where \nthe Presiding Officer is from, in Utah, in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, \nin Minnesota, in California, in Rhode Island--all across the country. \nIt is not political. It is about a better health care system, and we \nare already seeing the savings.\n  That is what they want to take away. That is what they want to stop. \nOne thousand dollars out of the pockets of seniors and back to the \npharmaceutical companies--that is what the result would be; parents \nhaving to lose the protection for their kids at 26; families trapped \nwith a child with a preexisting condition never able to leave the \ncompany they work for; and the savings that we are already seeing \nbeginning to evaporate. Why do you shut down the country and harm \npeople in those ways? It makes no sense. The tea party shutdown has to \nstop.\n  I ordinarily come to the floor at this time to discuss the appalling \nway the Senate and the House are blissfully ignoring the evidence all \naround us of what carbon pollution is doing to our atmosphere and \noceans. There is a clear connection between the problems we are in \ntoday that have caused this tea party government shutdown and our \ninability to face the facts about carbon pollution as a Congress. There \nare some similar characteristics between those two problems, and I \nwould like to discuss them briefly.\n  One characteristic is an inability to face and address present or \nlooming problems--real ones. In the case of the tea party shutdown, \nthey have actually created a massive artificial problem--a government \nshutdown for our country--at the same time that the tea party members \nprevent us from getting together to take the Senate budget and House \nbudget and bring them into conference and agreement in the ordinary \nprocess like adults. It is all in the service of the pretense I just \ndiscussed: that the Affordable Care Act isn't actually good for our \ncountry. It is a triple phony-problem whammy for our country. This \ninability to face and address real problems is the first \ncharacteristic.\n  The second characteristic is that inability is based on opposition \nthat stands on false or fanciful arguments based more on propaganda \nthan facts. In the case of climate, the fanciful argument--the \nfalsehood--is that the jury is still out. The evidence is not only \nreal, but it is overwhelming right now.\n  The third characteristic is that the opposition that gives rise to \nthis inability to face and address real problems is fomented by small \ninterest groups wishing to exercise undue influence without due regard \nfor the harm they cause to their fellow Americans.\n  That is our DC trifecta these days. We can't deal with real problems. \nWe have an atmosphere of phony arguments and propaganda that foul \nthings up, and it is based on opposition that is driven by small but \npowerful special interests.\n  I hope and pray the American people will send a strong message to the \ntea party to knock off the tea party shutdown that is closing and \nfracturing our government. I hope the response of the American people \nis a wake-up call to them. As one faction of one party in one House of \nCongress in one branch of our separated powers of government, they \ndon't get to have everything their way. That is not the way the \nConstitution was structured. And that is particularly true when the \npublic doesn't agree with them--and the public doesn't agree with them. \nThey just lost an election on this exact issue.\n  We are going to have other disagreements, and if we just roll through \nthis one and then bang right up against the next hostage scenario--very \nlikely on the debt limit, which, if we blow that and go into default, \nwill be even more catastrophic than the accumulating economic harm of a \ngovernment shutdown--if we keep going into one hostage scenario after \nanother, then we won't have solved the real problem: We cannot work \nlike responsible adults when a minority--a faction of one party in one \nHouse in one branch of government--is having the procedural equivalent \nof a tantrum.\n  And true as science and real as Mother Nature, we have the problem of \ncarbon pollution bearing down upon us. Will the polluters prevent \naction on that? Will we fail to do our duty as representatives of the \nAmerican people? Will we be unable to face and address this real \nproblem because we are opposed by false and fanciful arguments, with \nthe strings pulled by special interests, instead of us looking plainly \nat the problems and coming together for a reasonable solution?\n  This has been a different day than my usual ``time to wake up'' \nspeech. It is time to wake up to the problems of carbon pollution and \nclimate change. It is also time to wake up to the peculiar\n\n[[Page S7092]]\n\nway that special and narrow interests are able to tie this body in \nknots and do damage to the American public for their own benefit. That \nlarger problem is something we are going to have to reconcile ourselves \nwith. If we just look at this as one problem--the tea party shutdown--\nand we get through it, we will simply go on to another unless we have \ndecided that our Constitution matters for something, that the structure \nof government the Founding Fathers put together gave us a procedure to \nwork out our differences and that we should follow that constitutional \nprocedure even when we have strong feelings about something. That is \nthe legacy of the men and women who founded this country. It is the \nlegacy for which men and women have fought and bled and died. It \nbesmirches that legacy to have a tiny faction of one party in one House \nof one branch of government break the whole mechanism just because they \nwant everything their own way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I think the Senator from Rhode Island had \nit exactly right calling it a tea party shutdown. It is unnecessary, it \ninflicts pain on far too many Rhode Islanders and people from \nMassachusetts and Ohioans. It is all so needless. It is so simple: Open \nthe government.\n  I think Speaker Boehner needs to make a decision: Does he want to be \nSpeaker of the far right wing of the Republican Party or does he want \nto be Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives? If he chooses to do \nthe latter, it will mean putting what is called the continuing \nresolution to reopen the government on the floor in the House of \nRepresentatives down the hall, allowing all 430-something Members of \nthe House to vote--Members of both parties, all duly elected in \nNovember, all sworn in on January 3 of this year--allow them to vote. \nIf they vote, I am confident that Democrats and Republicans together \nwill reach a strong majority, that legislation will then be sent to the \nWhite House, the President will sign it, and the government shutdown \nwill end. It is irresponsible not to let the House of Representatives \nvote.\n  Yesterday or earlier today the President said: One faction of one \nparty of one House of one branch of government shut down the \ngovernment. This whole lurching from one crisis to another by design, \nby sort of a manufactured crisis that we have seen over and over, is \nsomething that simply doesn't work for the American people.\n  I come to the Senate floor from time to time and read letters from \nconstituents. I won't read letters today because the Senator from \nArkansas will be speaking in a moment, but I will tell a few quick \nstories.\n  A number of working Ohioans--from the small business owner in Lima, \nin western Ohio, waiting for a loan, to the farmer in Chillicothe \nlooking for help from the USDA, to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, \nemployees on the base and contractors off the base--are all affected by \nthis.\n  Ninety-one World War II veterans who stepped off an Honor Flight in \nWashington, DC, on Tuesday to visit the World War II memorial--their \nmemorial--are affected.\n  I have been to those Honor Flights when they visit. They visit \nArlington and the World War II memorial, which is a fairly new memorial \non the Mall. Many of those soldiers and sailors and air men and women \nwho have come from my State have never been to Washington before. This \nis their first trip. They are often in their eighties.\n  Those 91 World War II veterans--many in wheelchairs, many with \nwalkers--came anyway even though they heard the place was shut down. \nThey weren't letting a government shutdown prevent them from paying \ntheir respects to their brothers and sisters who died during World War \nII or fought in that war and have died since. They persevered just as \nthey had fighting in World War II.\n  These organizations give back to the men and women who gave so much \nto our country.\n  These 91 World War II veterans prevailed even though the memorial was \nshut down. They pretty much forced their way in, with help from a \nnumber of others.\n  But too many Ohioans will be hurt.\n  Sharon Purdy of Spencerville, OH, wrote to me, concerned about the \nstatus of this weekend's National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service \nheld each year in Emmitsburg, MD. Her husband Lee was killed in the \nline of duty in the year 2000 and was memorialized there 12 years ago. \nSharon goes back every year to pay her respects. Two Ohio firefighters \nkilled in the line of duty will be honored this year--Michael Burgan \nfrom the Sugarcreek Fire Department and Rocky Duncan from the Niles \nTownship Fire Department. Thousands of firefighters and their families \nwill be coming from across the country to pay their respects, but \npresumably the gates will be closed. That is how government is repaying \nthem for their sacrifice because some people want to score political \npoints instead of doing their job and are irresponsibly shutting down \nthe government--the so-called tea party shutdown.\n  I received a letter today from Judith Cowan, the president of the \nOhio Energy and Advanced Manufacturing Center. She is building a state-\nof-the-art manufacturing center in Lima, OH--investing in new \nelectromagnetic forming technology. She has been partnering with the \nEconomic Development Administration to build the center.\n  She received a notice today that her reimbursement check from EDA is \non hold due to the shutdown. EDA is not allowed under the law to do \nthat. Because they can't pay the bills, they must stop because of this \nirresponsible tea party shutdown of the government. Her project is in \nmidconstruction, supplies have been purchased, concrete has been \npoured, and workers' time has been set aside. She told my office she \nmakes an effort to hire local contractors and use small businesses in \nher supply chain. She is concerned that these small businesses that \nlive paycheck to paycheck depend on her. Think of the people who poured \nthe concrete. Think of the small companies that did the ironwork. Think \nof the other companies that have sold to her for this EDA-financed \nproject and you realize some of these small businesses are going to \nface very hard times, again because of this hard-headed, far-right tea \nparty shutdown which was simply unnecessary.\n\n  Contrary to the political games the far right in the House, the \nradicals, are playing, this is not a game. These are real people facing \na real and devastating impact. They do not deserve to be punished for \nthe political ideology of a few.\n  Remember, one faction of one political party in one House of one \nbranch of government has held hostage the whole rest of the government \nand these hundreds of thousands of Federal employees and the millions \nof people affected by them. This is not about whether we will or will \nnot agree to go to conference on the budget. This is about whether \nCongress in this country can continue to govern.\n  Senate Democrats have compromised on funding levels. According to \nreports, the Senate-passed resolution comes at a level 18 percent below \nwhat the President proposed 5 years ago. It is 17 percent below what \nthe Democratic Congress proposed 4 years ago. It is 10 percent below \nwhat Republicans proposed 3 years ago and 3 percent below the debt \nceiling of 3 years ago. This is not about spending. This is not about \nfiscal issues. This is about attaching one party's--in this case the \nRepublicans'--political platform--presumably out of the 2012 Republican \nConvention--to simple legislation to make the government work, to keep \nthe government going.\n  It is a waiting game they are willing to play. The American people \nare not willing to play. For some it is OK to hurt 1,000 small \nbusinesses as the SBA loan program is furloughed. For some it is OK to \nput 50,000 Ohio Federal employees and hundreds of thousands more around \nthe country out of work. For some it is OK to deny senior citizens, in \nMansfield or in Ravenna or in Youngstown, a new Social Security \nbenefit.\n  It is not OK with me. It is not OK with most of the Members of the \nSenate. It surely is not OK with the American people. It is time to \nstop these political games. It is time to put the American people \nfirst.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I rise to say I have disappointment and \nfrustration and that is what is causing me\n\n[[Page S7093]]\n\nto speak today, because this is the day I worked very hard to prevent. \nI think many in this Chamber, on both sides of the aisle but \nparticularly on this side of the aisle, have worked very hard to \nprevent this day from happening. Our government has shut down. It hurts \nour economy just when we are turning the corner, and this is something \nI think the economists are talking about. When we talk to our \ncolleagues, not just in this Chamber but around the country, when we \ntalk to Governors and talk to State legislators and businesspeople, \npeople we know from all around the country, they are so disappointed \nthat it has gotten to this point.\n  I think most people express what I heard about 10 days ago when I was \nin Arkansas. I was at a big dinner to raise money for cancer research \nat the University of Arkansas for medical sciences. By the way, they \nraised about $1 million that night. It was a great evening. They \nhonored my parents, which was very nice. But nonetheless, when we were \nthere, I bet I had a dozen people come up to me and say: What is wrong \nwith the House? Have these people lost their minds? What are they doing \nover there?\n  This is back about 10 days ago when they voted the way they voted \nrecently on the farm bill. That was on a Thursday. On Friday, they took \nthat step that was leading to where we are today on shutting down the \nGovernment.\n  What I tell the folks in Arkansas is: Look, hyperpartisanship has \ntaken over here. This is one of those situations where if we look at \nthe track record of the Senate--I know it is not true in every single \ncase--but if we look at the track record of the Senate in our Chamber, \nwe try to work in a bipartisan way. Because of the nature of the rules, \nbecause of the size of the body, because of the traditions, quite \nhonestly because of the Constitution, because of our DNA, we tend to \nwork together in this body. That has been a key to the Senate for years \nand years.\n  What it has led to in this particular case is we have passed four \nwhat I think of as very responsible measures to keep the government \nopen. These are four responsible measures we voted on fair and square. \nThey came to the floor. The votes were not all 100 to nothing, but \nnonetheless people are working together to try to get this resolved.\n  You go down the hall to the House and what you see down there is ``my \nway or the highway'' politics. My fellow Americans know it is true that \nthese are dead-end politics. It is leading us nowhere.\n  We have to think of where we have been in the last few years. Think \nabout how bad things were in the great recession. Think about the \nprogress we have made since then. Look at our housing market. It is so \nmuch better today than it was 5 years ago. Consumer confidence is back, \nheaded in the right direction. It is good. It is getting stronger all \nthe time. Look at sales of trucks and cars in this country. They have \nreached their fastest pace since November of 2007, before the crash.\n  In the private sector, month after month they continue to add jobs \nall around the country. Those are good results. Why in the world does \nthe House want to put this all in jeopardy? I have been concerned \nbecause in the last few days I have had reporters who kind of stalk us \nout in the hallways on our way in and out of the Capitol or when we are \nvoting--I have had more than one stop me and say: You realize when we \ngo down and cover the House, they talk about red State Democrats. They \ntalk about your race in Arkansas.\n  It is going to be a very sad day in this country when we learn this \nis all about politics. I sincerely hope it is not all about politics. I \nhope we do not have people down in the other Chamber who have elevated \npolitics above what is best, what is right for our country.\n  When I hear those questions from reporters, there certainly are \npeople down there who are talking a lot about politics when this Nation \nis in crisis. I think we should all be concerned about that. I think we \nshould make sure that is not the case. If they have a legitimate \nphilosophical issue, that is one thing. But if this is all about \npolitics, if these irresponsible set of votes to shut down the \nGovernment is all about politics, then shame on them. Because when we \nlook at the impact this is going to have--the Social Security \nAdministration will be forced to reduce staff. That causes delays for \nour seniors as they file for benefits and as they apply for replacement \nSocial Security cards. The progress we have made with the VA--I have \nbeen very involved in trying to cut back the VA backlog of claims. That \nprogress we have made there is going to stop. It is going to force our \nvets to wait even longer to get the benefits they have earned.\n  When we look at small businesses with the shutting down of the Small \nBusiness Administration, we are going to have hundreds and hundreds of \nsmall businesses that are going to lose their access to capital just in \nthe next few days. The national parks, wildlife refuges, recreational \nareas--it is a terrible thing for American families who want to take \ntheir children out and want to take their families out to explore and \nexperience the great outdoors here in America, some of the raw beauty \nAmerica has to offer. But it is also bad for business. We have a lot of \nbusinesses in my State, we have a lot of businesses around the country \nthat are around these areas. They thrive on things such as canoe \nrentals, camping equipment, et cetera. It could be bicycling, could be \nhiking boots, whatever it is. These businesses depend on that type of \nactivity. They depend on those facilities being open, and they depend \non Americans having the ability to go out and see and experience the \ngreat things in this country.\n\n  I am also chairman of the subcommittee on agriculture appropriations. \nI know firsthand the devastating impact this shutdown will have on our \nagricultural industry. It is going to have negative ripple effects all \naround the Nation's economy.\n  One thing I have learned the hard way in Washington in the last 10 or \n11 years, there are a lot of people inside the beltway who do not \nunderstand agriculture. They do not get excited about agriculture. They \ndo not care about agriculture. Sometimes they take it for granted. But \nthe truth is agriculture is one of the core strengths in the U.S. \neconomy. It is something we do better than everyone else in the world. \nEveryone else in the world wants to be like us. It is something we can \nbe proud of. It adds a lot to the Nation's economy. It is also great \nfor our trade.\n  If we take my one State of Arkansas, it is our largest industry. It \nsupports one in six jobs in my State. It also creates about $17 billion \nof economic activity, and overall, when we look at the State's economy, \nit is about 25 percent of the economy of Arkansas. That is going to be \ntrue--maybe those numbers are not exactly the same--that kind of ratio, \nthose kinds of numbers are going to be true in every State in the \nUnion.\n  I know Senator Stabenow is chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee. \nShe talks about how everybody thinks about Michigan as heavy industry, \nthe auto industry, et cetera, and all that is true. But the second \nlargest industry in Michigan is agriculture.\n  It is just like if we go to a State such as Massachusetts. The mix of \nagricultural products in a State such as Massachusetts is going to be \nvery different than what we have in the State of Arkansas, but it \nallows Massachusetts to utilize its natural advantages, natural \nresources. Things such as specialty crops are going to be very \nimportant up there. We have some of that in our State. But every State \nhas a different mix and it is important that every State be very strong \nin agriculture.\n  One of the newer areas in agriculture, which is good, is organic \nfarming and the like. Certainly, that is part of the future. That is \nsomething in the Senate farm bill. It is something we want to see get \ndone. We don't want to see that brought to a halt or hampered in any \nway.\n  We don't want to see our food supply and fiber supply jeopardized by \nrank politics down the hall in the House of Representatives. The House \nhas already created turmoil in this vital industry by shutting down the \ngovernment. But to complicate matters, they have also taken another \nvery irresponsible set of actions in the last few weeks; that is, they \nhave allowed, because of their own problems down the hall, they have \nallowed the 2008 farm bill to expire.\n  Last night at midnight we went from the 2008 farm bill to the 1949 \nlaw. The United States of America is currently\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\nunder the 1949 agriculture law. The problem is there is no solution in \nsight.\n  God bless Debbie Stabenow. Senator Stabenow has been an amazing \nchampion for agriculture. I mentioned her--agriculture is the second \nlargest industry in Michigan--but she has worked so hard in the last \ncouple of years to try to get this Chamber to do right on agriculture, \nand it has.\n  Last year we passed a farm bill. It went down the hall and died. This \nyear we passed a farm bill. It went down the hall and they blew it up.\n  We see us working in a bipartisan way. By the way, that farm bill in \nthe Senate got something like 66 votes, a good, solid bipartisan vote. \nBut the House Members, they continue to wreak havoc with this economic \npowerhouse.\n  Right now, think about agriculture, one of the core strengths, one of \nthe pillars of the U.S. economy. We see it facing a double whammy. They \ngot the slowdown. Now they have the expiration of the 2008 farm bill.\n  What does that mean? If you are a farmer, you will know what this \nmeans. The Farm Service Agency, Rural Development, the Natural \nResources Conservation Service--the county offices will all be closing. \nWe had farmers today call us and say: Can I get this payment? I can \nmake this happen? Can I apply for something? A lot of times the answer \nto that is going to be, no, because those offices will be closed. When \nthey need help, there is not going to be anyone there to help them. \nWhen they go there, basically they are going to knock on the door and \nit is going to be locked up. They are going to be closed for business. \nThis means that new USDA loans and grants are being stopped. This means \nthe cutting-edge agricultural research that America is famous for is \ngoing to stop.\n  It also means that when it comes to food inspection and those \nworkers, that is going to be in jeopardy as well. That is something we \nfought very hard on. I was allied with many of my Republican colleagues \non that matter.\n\n  The worst part about this--and maybe the saddest part about this--is \nthat it was all so preventable. We can still prevent it from happening. \nWe can do something today to make this go away. But, nonetheless, here \nagain the House refuses to compromise. It is this ``my way or the \nhighway'' attitude, as I said before, that is leading us to a dead end.\n  About 2 weeks ago, several of us were fortunate enough to listen to \nTom Carper come and speak to us about some things that were on his \nmind. It was a bipartisan group. There were 15 or 20 of us there. Tom \nsingled out one of our great colleagues, Mike Enzi. Mike Enzi has been \na stalwart conservative, red rock Republican, but he is someone we all \nknow, trust, and respect.\n  He talked about when Mike Enzi and Ted Kennedy were paired up as \nchair and ranking member of the Senate HELP Committee. That is a very \nunlikely pair. They don't get any different than that in philosophy, \npersonality, background or regions of the country. Nonetheless, those \ntwo Senators adopted what they called the 80-20 rule. They knew they \ndidn't agree on everything so they said: Let's find 80 percent of the \nthings we can agree on. Let's work on those and let's get it done and \nthat is what they did. It is a great example of bipartisanship.\n  Senator Kennedy, as liberal as he was--he was a great liberal lion, \nand everybody knows that. He was very staunch in his views and very \nserious about how he took those views, but he was also very much \nwilling to reach across the aisle. That 80-20 rule is what is missing \ndown the hallway. We still have it in the Senate, to some extent but \nnot as much as we used to. We need to make sure we reestablish this 80-\n20 rule and find areas of common ground where we agree so we can work \nwith each other in every single situation we possibly can. But down the \nhall, that is gone, and that is the problem right now in Washington.\n  There are a lot of people in the Congress--some in the Senate as well \nbut in the House and Senate generally--who say: I want 100 percent or \nnothing. If I can't have 100 percent, you get nothing. They will do \neverything they can to stop it, and that is exactly what happened. That \nis why we have this crisis today. It is completely manufactured by the \nU.S. House of Representatives.\n  I feel that I am elected by my people to make the hard decisions, do \nwhat is best for the country, do what is right, and use my best \njudgment. All of these are judgment calls, and they are tough calls, \nbut that is what governing is about. It is about making those tough \ncalls and showing some leadership.\n  So tonight I urge our colleagues in the House, all 435 of them, to \nstop the hyperpartisanship, especially those on the Republican side of \nthe aisle who just can't seem to say yes when it comes to a bipartisan \nsolution. I urge them to stop the hyperpartisanship and work with the \nSenate to reopen our government.\n  I will be working very hard to find a responsible agreement, and I \nsincerely hope we have a sufficient number in the House who will join \nme, and let's get this done.\n  With that I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As chair of the HELP Committee--that great committee upon \nwhich the Presiding Officer also sits and a valuable member of that \ncommittee--I was just informed by our staff that as of this last hour, \nover 2.8 million people have gone on healthcare.gov to get information \nand sign up for the Affordable Care Act.\n  In fact, there were so many people online that at different places in \nthe country, the Web site froze. Then I heard some of my Republican \nfriends were saying: See, we told you it wasn't ready. The Web site is \nnot working right. If very few people had signed up, they would have \nsaid: See, we told you no one is going to sign up for it. They are \ntrying to have it both ways.\n  There were 2.8 million Americans on the first day logged on to \nhealthcare.gov to get this information, and, again, to sign up. By \ntomorrow we will have some data and some statistics on how many people \nwho not only inquired but have actually signed up on the Web sites. We \nwill have some more information on that tomorrow. Obviously, the \ninterest is there, and we knew it would be.\n  Leader Reid told a story today about how years ago he went out and \nvisited Google in California. At the time they were telling him that \nwhen they first started Google, they didn't realize how many people \nwould be using it, and they kept crashing and freezing. So they had \nglitches of their own. There are some glitches in this system because a \nlot of people are coming on and wanting the information and wanting to \nsign up. That is the good news, and it is what we always knew.\n  We knew that when we passed the Affordable Care Act, if we approached \nit in a diligent, forthright way but cautiously and in an orderly \nmanner, it would work, and that is why it has taken us almost 3 years \nto get to this point because we wanted to do it right. We wanted to do \nit in a way that would work.\n  I think today is a remarkable day in the history of our country in \nthat we are now going to have affordable health care insurance for \nevery American that cannot be taken away if you get sick. They can't \ndeny it to a family because somebody had a preexisting condition. \nEveryone will have health care insurance that will be affordable and \ncan't be taken away, and we will have a whole new suite of preventive \ncare measures and wellness programs to keep people healthy and to \nprevent illness in the first place.\n\n  We have turned the corner on bringing health care to every American \nregardless of their health status, regardless of their economic status, \nregardless of whether they have a job or don't have a job, no matter \nhow old, no matter how young, and no matter the circumstances. Everyone \nwill be able to be covered by health care insurance.\n  I guess I might also say it is another red letter day because of the \nclosedown of the government. We have the House of Representatives that, \nagain, will not even put the bill on the floor of the House for a vote \nthat will keep the government running. Think about that.\n\n[[Page S7095]]\n\nThey will not even put it on the floor for a vote because they know if \nthey put it on the floor, they will get enough Republicans and \nDemocrats to vote for it, and it will pass.\n  So the tea party extremists in the House--instead of putting it on \nthe floor and passing it tonight so the government could be back in \nbusiness tomorrow--are trying to make a little deal. First it was to \ndefund and delay ObamaCare. Now they have something they are doing on \nthe House floor where they are going to fund some little TV programs. \nIt is nonsense. This is not worthy of a great country.\n  I had a nice conversation with Secretary of State Kerry this \nmorning--not necessarily just about this, but, of course, we talked \nabout the government shutdown. I asked him: Secretary, you are close to \nthis. How is this playing in other countries? Secretary Kerry said: It \nis painful for us in the State Department--representing the government \nof the United States in a nonpartisan way--to have other countries look \nat us, scratch their heads, and wonder why we are doing things like \nthis. He was just pained, not for himself but for all of his wonderful \ndiplomats and ambassadors all around the world who represent our \ncountry and what they must have to go through to have other countries \nsee what we are doing and question our judgment.\n  That is what the tea party people are doing. They are driving this \ncountry down. What they are doing is very dangerous. It is \nideologically driven obstructionism, and it has taken a dangerous turn.\n  Again, despite the efforts to pass a continuing resolution to fund \nthe government, the House Republicans have shut down the government \nbecause we will not submit to defunding or delaying ObamaCare, or the \nAffordable Care Act, whichever you call it.\n  It seems as though we see this crisis differently. I was reading a \nnewspaper report that one Member of the House Republican caucus said \nwith a big smile: We are very excited. It is exactly what we wanted, \nand we got it. This is exactly what they wanted, a government shutdown \nand they got it? We are excited, she said.\n  The article also notes the reaction of another representative who \nreportedly said: It is wonderful. We are 100 percent united. Again, \nthat was from another tea party Republican.\n  What are they excited about? Are they excited about the hundreds of \nthousands of Federal workers who are on furlough today? Are they \nexcited about the closed monuments and the national parks? Are they \nexcited about the delayed veterans' benefits, Social Security, loss of \neconomic activity and jobs?\n  After more than three decades in Washington, it is difficult to shock \nme, but the sheer cynicism and fundamental lack of decency we are \nwitnessing right now is nothing short of breathtaking.\n  As I understand it, this is just the first step. The tea party \nRepublicans continue to threaten that if the Senate and President Obama \ndon't submit to their demands, they will create another economic crisis \nby causing our country to default on the national debt in the middle of \nthe month.\n  Who pays the price for this recklessness?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be delighted to yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Iowa has the special responsibility of \nthe authorizing and appropriating committee that deals with health and \neducation and the National Institutes of Health, and so he understands \nmedical research better than most.\n  I am sure he is aware now that the junior Senator from Texas, Mr. \nCruz, is making a list of those agencies of government which he and the \ntea party Republicans believe should be reopened. The first cut on that \nlist includes the Veterans' Administration, but it doesn't include the \n564,000 employees who are also veterans, one-fourth of whom are \ndisabled veterans. He has included the National Park Service because of \nthe embarrassment of international visitors coming to the Statue of \nLiberty and finding it closed, and he included the District of \nColumbia.\n  I note he has not included the National Institutes of Health.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Iowa has read the Wall Street article \ntoday. It says, as follows:\n\n       At the National Institutes of Health nearly three-quarters \n     of the staff were furloughed. One result: director Francis \n     Collins said about 200 patients who otherwise would be \n     admitted to the NIH Clinical Center into clinical trials each \n     week will be turned away. This includes about 30 children, \n     most of them cancer patients, he said.\n\n  My question is this: Would the Senator from Iowa join me in writing a \nletter to the junior Senator from Texas and the tea party Republicans \nbegging them to include the National Institutes of Health on their list \nof agencies that they may consider reopening?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Illinois, I would be delighted to \nsign on to that letter because I am acutely aware of what is happening \nat NIH, but I might also tell my friend from Illinois that I would also \nlike to include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We shouldn't push our luck with the junior Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But I must say to my friend that the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention is out there keeping diseases from spreading, \ncontaining them where they break out, putting in prevention measures \nall over this country. They too are furloughing people. Just think what \nwould happen if, God forbid, some virulent bacteria or virus were to \nbreak out and they have--as my colleague knows, the CDC is very good at \ncontainment. They know how to handle these situations. What if they \ndon't have the people to do that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Iowa, we better not push \nour luck asking for both the National Institutes of Health and the \nCenters for Disease Control from Senator Cruz.\n  In all honesty, we are not sending any letters. This is reckless and \nirresponsible, to threaten the lives of people going for clinical \ntrials at the National Institutes of Health. To quote from a distant \npast in this Chamber, in this Congress, ``Have they no shame?'' Have \nthey no shame, to shut down the Government of the United States of \nAmerica, endangering the lives of individuals over a political temper \ntantrum?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, it is shameful. It is not befitting a \ngreat nation. Maybe they would like us to be a Third World country.\n  I see this and I don't understand. The Senator from Illinois is \nright: Where is their shame? But where is their sense of \nresponsibility? Where is their sense of being responsible to the people \nof this country, to have a government that works to protect them, to \nkeep them healthy, that does the medical research that the Senator \nspoke about? I see that, and I don't understand why they don't grasp \nthe kind of damage they are doing to our country. I don't understand \nit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will respond to the Senator from Iowa and then yield \nthe floor back to him, and I see the Senator from New Hampshire \nwaiting.\n  Our last best hope in this debate is that moderate Republicans will \nstep up and say, Enough. This is not what the Republican Party is \nabout. This is not what America should be about.\n  We need to be solving these problems on a bipartisan basis. If enough \nmoderate Republicans would come to that empty side of the floor, which \nwe have been witnessing all day today, and speak out, we could bring an \nend to this national embarrassment.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his input and \nhis questions. I think the Senator has highlighted the kind of \nsituation that begs credulity. People around this country must wonder, \nHave we taken all leave of our senses here?\n  People say we should sit down and negotiate. We are always willing to \nnegotiate. We are always willing to talk about issues. But when the tea \nparty Republicans in the House say, No, we won't even keep the \ngovernment open unless we defund ObamaCare, which is the law of the \nland, that is trying to nullify a law by holding a gun at our heads and \nsaying we are going to shut down the government unless we get rid of a \nlaw--not a bill, not a proposal before us, but the law of the land \nupheld by the Supreme Court, this is not the way to govern. It is the \nway to take\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\nhostages, maybe. It is the way to commit blackmail, but it is not the \nway to run a government.\n  So I hope the moderate Republicans--and believe me, there are a lot \nof good moderate Republicans. On my own committee, I deal with good \npeople who work together to get bills passed and to get them out of our \ncommittee. We just need them to say to the tea party: You are wrong. \nThis is not good for us, it is not good for the country, and it is not \ngood for the Republican Party, either.\n  I will have more to say about this later as well as tomorrow when I \nwill bring some more figures to the floor on how many more people are \nexcited about the Affordable Care Act and are going to healthcare.gov.\n  If I might, I wish to take one extra minute here to say that I was \ndown at the World War II Memorial this morning to greet some Iowans who \nwere coming in on an Honor Flight and I saw the barricade up there. I \ntalked to one of the park officers and I said, This doesn't make sense. \nIt doesn't make sense because it is open. I have come down here at \nmidnight and walked around. It is out in the open. I could understand \nit if it were a building where you had to go through a device and \nsecurity. I could understand that because the government is shut down. \nThen some buses came from Mississippi. I had to leave before the Iowans \ncould arrive. They went behind the barrier. They went in and everybody \nwas fine. I heard this afternoon that the Park Police came down and now \nwe are moving people out again and putting up the barricades.\n  Why are there barricades on the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln \nMemorial, the World War II Memorial, the Vietnam Memorial, or any of \nthose where people walk around? It doesn't make sense to put up \nbarricades around these outdoor memorials.\n  While this whole shutdown of government is nonsense, I don't think we \nought to respond to nonsense with more nonsense. So I call upon the \nPark Service and the Department of the Interior, on those instances \nwhere it is open 24 hours a day, such as the World War II Memorial, the \nKorean War Memorial, or the Lincoln and Jefferson Monuments, why put up \nthe barricades? People are there, they go there 24 hours a day. This \ndoesn't make sense. I hope by tomorrow, whoever gave the orders to put \nthose barricades up will have those orders superseded by someone higher \nup and get those barricades down. As I said, I can understand if it is \na building where we have to have security, where we have to have guards \nand machines and equipment. I understand, with a government shutdown, \nthat is not accessible. But for something that is open, as those \nmonuments are, where people wander in and out 24 hours a day, it makes \nno sense to put up barricades. I call upon the Park Service to get rid \nof those barricades.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I came to join my colleagues on the \nfloor this afternoon to talk about and to call on our colleagues in the \nHouse--those Republicans who have been taking this irresponsible \naction--to stop what they are doing and help us resolve this government \nshutdown.\n  We are involved in a completely manufactured shutdown of our \ngovernment. This is something that didn't have to happen. Right now, \nthere is a majority in the House ready to pass a bill to keep our \ngovernment open, to start it back up again, to end this crisis. But \nhere we are. We are in the midst of the first government shutdown in 17 \nyears because a small minority of the minority party in the other House \nis holding this government hostage so it can pursue its agenda of \ntrying to end the Affordable Care Act. I don't know why they don't want \nto make sure that people in this country can get access to health care. \nI am not going to talk about that this evening.\n  This is irresponsible. We are already seeing the effects of this \ncrisis in New Hampshire and across the country. We have thousands of \nFederal employees in my State of New Hampshire who could face \nfurloughs. That includes workers at our Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. \nThose folks are from Maine and New Hampshire, but they are looking at \nfurloughs.\n  We have already heard from over 300 civilian technicians for the \nNational Guard in New Hampshire who were notified they are going to be \nfurloughed. I have started hearing from constituents whose lives are \naffected by our inability here in Washington to address keeping this \ngovernment open.\n  I heard from one of my constituents in Portsmouth, a man named Robert \nCody. He writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Shaheen,\n       Please do not allow a government shutdown to occur. The \n     consequences to individuals and the economy will be \n     catastrophic.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       To put this on personal terms, my daughter just finished \n     graduate school and began work as a consulting doctor at a \n     Veteran's Administration hospital providing care to wounded \n     veterans. If a shutdown occurs, she will lose her job and be \n     faced with crushing student loan debt and no way to pay back \n     the loans or her living expenses. The veterans who will be \n     deprived of her care will be victims of the shutdown as well. \n     Her situation is just one of many.\n\n  Robert, you are certainly right about that.\n\n       Hard-working individuals must not be forced to suffer to \n     make a political point.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Please do the right thing! The consequences to the economy \n     and unemployment will be far-reaching, and you will be blamed \n     if you contribute to this looming disaster.\n\n  I say to Robert: I couldn't agree more with what you have said. I \nthink we need to work together. We need to try to avoid any further \nharm to people who depend not only on the jobs--the people who are \ngoing to be laid off--but also those people who benefit from the \nservices the Federal Government provides.\n  Salaries for our Federal workers aren't just important for them and \ntheir families; they are also critical to their local economies. When \nhard-working New Hampshire citizens aren't able to get their paychecks, \nthey stop making their mortgage payments, they stop paying their \nutility bills, they stop shopping at local stores. That is what we are \ngoing to see if this shutdown continues. It will inflict serious \nconsequences on the economy.\n  New Small Business Administration loans are not being originated. SBA \nloans are critical for job creation in New Hampshire. Our small \nbusinesses represent 96 percent of all employers. In 2012, SBA helped \n630 small businesses in New Hampshire get access to over $130 million \nin loans. Now, because of this shutdown, businesses are not going to \nhave access to those loans.\n  The Federal Housing Administration loans are slowing. Our housing \nmarket has really just begun to recover, but it is still fragile. Now, \nbecause of the shutdown, we are going to be holding up home sales \nbecause much of the FHA staff is furloughed.\n  Of course, this is terrible timing for the tourism industry in New \nHampshire. We are just beginning our fall foliage season. It is a \nspectacular time to travel around New Hampshire. We have tourists who \ncome from all over the world, who spend money in our local restaurants, \nwho stay at our hotels, and visit our attractions. Many of our small \nbusinesses rely on this time of the year to provide the revenue they \nneed to continue operating all year long. We know the tourists who come \nfrom overseas stay longer and spend more money. But if the shutdown in \ngovernment means we are going to be turning away many of those \ncustomers, applications for visas are going to come to a halt. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, during the 1995-1996 \nshutdown, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 applications by foreigners for \nvisas went unprocessed each day, and U.S. tourism industries--the \nairlines, the hotels, the restaurants, all of the affiliated businesses \nthat depend on tourism--lost millions of dollars.\n  We also have a visa center in New Hampshire that works on those \nvisas. They are shut down as part of this government closure. We have a \nlot of small businesses in New Hampshire and across the country that \nrely on Federal contracts as they grow and create new jobs.\n  I talked to one of those small business owners today--a man named Lou \nAltman with Globafone. I have known Lou for a long time. He has worked \nin New Hampshire and around the world. He called to express his deep \nfrustration about our failing to pass a continuing resolution to keep \nthis government open.\n\n[[Page S7097]]\n\n  Globafone's satellite technologies help Federal agencies meet \ncritical needs, in addition to providing technology for many developing \ncountries. But with the shutdown, everything is up in the air for \nGlobafone. They are not certain what this means for their government \ncontracts. As a result their cash flows are uncertain. Since their cash \nflows are uncertain, their line of credit with the bank is uncertain. I \ndo not blame Lou for being frustrated for wanting to know why we cannot \nwork together to get this done.\n  I would say to my colleagues in the House, you cannot take this \ngovernment hostage and expect that we are going to be able to \nnegotiate. This government shutdown is bad for our economy, bad for \nmiddle-class families, bad for our country. Unfortunately, what we have \nseen this week is that some have decided they want to inflict another \nmanufactured crisis as a tactic to prevent health care reform from \ngoing into effect.\n  The people that I talk to in New Hampshire do not think this is a \ngood approach. They know that a government shutdown is serious, that it \nhas consequences for our economy and jobs. Considering that impact, it \nis no surprise that economists have forecast that our failure to deal \nwith this crisis will have a significant impact on our economy.\n  Even a 3- or 4-day shutdown could slow growth by 0.2 percent, \naccording to economist Mark Zandi, and an extended shutdown could \nreduce growth by 1.4 percent. So holding the economy and critical \nservices hostage to score political points is reckless and it is \nirresponsible. With the economy showing signs of improvement, this is \nthe last thing we should be doing.\n  It does not have to be this way. I was a Governor for 3 terms. In two \nof those terms the other party controlled both chambers of our \nlegislature. But we were always able to enact a budget before the \nfiscal year ended. We had a lot of differences along the way. But both \nsides understood that in order to reach an agreement, in order to pass \na budget, in order to keep government operating, we had to compromise. \nIt would have been impossible to imagine the New Hampshire legislature \nnot getting a budget to my desk because they wanted to play political \ngames or that they would have sent me a budget that they knew I was \ngoing to veto.\n  This Congress can certainly do better. We must do better. My \ncolleagues have pointed out that the Senate in taking up the bill to \nkeep the government funded, the continuing resolution, agreed to accept \nthe dollar amount that the House wanted us to pass. So we compromised \non this continuing resolution. What we saw for our willingness to do \nthat was the House decided they were going to put all kinds of \namendments on this bill to keep it from getting passed.\n  I certainly hope that we can pass this bill, that the House will take \nit up. All the Speaker needs to do is take up the clean bill that the \nSenate sent them because they have the votes to pass it. If he is so \nsure that the votes are not there, then let people vote on it and see \nwhat happens.\n  But we know that is not the case. We know that the votes are there to \npass this bill. Because it is being held hostage to a small minority in \nthe Republican caucus, this government is shut down and tens of \nthousands of people across the country are experiencing difficulties as \na result. I certainly hope that we are going to see some action soon. I \nam going to continue to work for that. I am sure all of us in the \nSenate will try to see that something gets done so we can reopen this \ngovernment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me concur with much of what my \ncolleague Senator Shaheen has just said. But let me begin by doing \nsomething we do not do enough and that is to say thank you to the 2 \nmillion civilians and 1.4 million men and women in the military in all \nof our 50 States, including some 5,000 in my own State of Vermont. So \nwe have 2 million civilians who are working for the Federal Government \nand 1.4 million men and women in the military. We owe them a deep debt \nof gratitude. The work that they do is enormously important for our \ncountry.\n  They work to make sure that our drinking water and the air that we \nbreathe is safe. It is not an accident that in many parts of this \ncountry, the air that people are breathing, that our kids are \nbreathing, is a lot cleaner than it used to be. It took a lot of work \nto make that happen. We thank them for that.\n  We have Customs people patrolling our borders. We thank them for \ntheir work. We have Federal workers to protect the health and safety of \nworking people all over the country. We have Federal workers who are \nworking to educate kids with special needs. We have Federal employees \nwho provide food to low-income pregnant women, infants, children, and \nsenior citizens. We have Federal employees who are working in VA \nhospitals, and we have nurses and many other staff doing a great job \nfor our veterans.\n  We have Federal employees who make sure that children receive needed \ncare and services so that their parents can go to work. They repair our \nroads, bridges, dams, culverts, and sewers. They sweep the floors. They \nclean our bathrooms and make sure the places we work in are not \ninfested.\n  Americans who work for the Federal Government are part of the \nbackbone of this country. I personally thank them for what they do. But \nit is no secret that in recent years there has been a huge assault \nagainst the Federal workforce. For the past 3 years, the pay of Federal \nworkers has been frozen at a time when the costs that they are \nincurring in terms of gasoline, heating oil, prescription drugs, and of \neverything else have been going up. But their pay has been level.\n  As a thank you for all of the work that Federal employees do here in \nWashington and Vermont, in Massachusetts and all over this country, our \nthank you to them has been to shut down the government and to tell some \n800,000 Federal employees--these are single moms trying to raise kids, \nthese are proud people, civilians in the military, people in our \nNational Guard; these are people who are doing important work, who have \nfamilies to raise, and who are dedicated to their jobs--we are saying: \nSorry, you have to go home. They are going home, and they are not even \nsure whether they are going to be paid or when they are going to be \npaid.\n  So you are looking at tens of thousands of lives that are being \nradically disrupted because of this shutdown. I can tell you that in \nVermont, we are very proud of the Vermont National Guard. The Vermont \nNational Guard men and women served very heavily and bravely in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  They helped us when we had the terrible Irene floods a few years ago. \nThe thank you that the Vermont National Guard is getting today--this is \ntrue all over the country--is that in Vermont some 450 workers at the \nVermont National Guard are going to be furloughed. I know many of these \npeople. They are good people. They are hardworking people. They do not \ndeserve this type of behavior from the Federal Government.\n  This affects people from all over the State, people who are trying to \nget homes, people who are trying to start businesses. That is not \nsomething that should be happening.\n  Let me just very briefly explain the dynamic of what is going on \nright here. It is not complicated. The Republicans in the House are \ndominated by a relatively small group of rightwing extremists.\n  What the Speaker there has said is that instead of bringing to the \nfloor the bill that we passed here in the Senate, what is called a \nclean CR that will continue funding the government, instead of putting \nthat bill on the floor of the House and allowing the entire 435 Members \nof the House to vote on that bill, what he has done is said to the \nHouse Republicans: OK, what do you want? The extreme rightwing has \ndominated that. What they have said is: We want to defund ObamaCare. \nThat is the only legislation that you, Mr. Speaker, can bring to the \nfloor of the House.\n  This is a moment of enormous importance for the Speaker of the House. \nHe has to determine whether he is the Speaker of the Republican Party \nor the Speaker of the House of Representatives, whether he is going to \nbe dominated by a minority of one party in one part of the government \nor whether he will allow the entire House to vote.\n\n[[Page S7098]]\n\n  What many of observers have made clear is, if he puts that bill on \nthe floor, it will pass and the government will reopen. I hope that he \nwill do that. My political view, my progressive political views are \npretty well known. My views on this issue are well known in Vermont and \nmaybe elsewhere in this country. But what I want to do is very briefly \nto express what some Republicans are saying, people who are not \nrightwing extremists, who, in fact, have very strong disagreements with \nthe Affordable Care Act but who understand that they cannot hold the \nAmerican people hostage and they cannot blackmail the government in \norder to get their way.\n  So this is not Bernie Sanders talking. These are conservative \nRepublicans, but people who are not rightwing extremists. Let me quote \nsome of my colleagues. These are the public statements they have made. \nSaxby Chambliss, a Republican Senator from Georgia, this is what he \nsays:\n\n       I'd love to [defund ObamaCare] too. But shutting down the \n     government and playing into the hands of the president \n     politically is not the right thing to do. Plus, it's going to \n     do great harm to the American people if we pursue that \n     course. We've been there. It didn't work.\n\n  Senator Dan Coats, Republican from Indiana:\n\n       Here's the hard truth: President Obama will not overturn \n     his signature legislation so long as he is president and the \n     Democrats have control of the Senate. Along with these \n     political realities, refusing to pass legislation to keep the \n     government funded will not stop ObamaCare from going into \n     effect.\n\n  Senator Tom Coburn, Republican from Oklahoma:\n\n       It's not an achievable strategy. It's creating the false \n     impression that you can do something when you can't. And it's \n     dishonest.\n\n  Republican Senator Bob Corker from Tennessee. The Washington Post \nreports that Corker compared shutting down the government to the way \nbuffalo were slaughtered in the Old West. ``I know when you get led \ninto a box canyon what that means . . . Box canyon, here we come.''\n  Representative Peter King, Republican from New York.\n\n       We should not be closing down the government under any \n     circumstances. That doesn't work, it's wrong, and you know, \n     ObamaCare passed. We have to try to defund it, we have try to \n     find ways to repeal it. But the fact is, we shouldn't be \n     using it as a threat to shut down the government.\n\n  Republican Senator Orrin Hatch from Utah.\n\n       My personal belief is the only way to get rid of ObamaCare \n     is to be intelligent and smart about it and gradually just \n     work on it, work it through . . . to expect the government to \n     shut down is not the way to do it.\n\n  Mark Kirk, Republican Senator from Illinois:\n\n       I am one of those who says, let's not shut down the \n     government just because you don't get everything you want.\n\n  Senator John McCain, former Republican candidate for President of the \nUnited States:\n\n       In the United States Senate, we will not repeal, or defund, \n     ObamaCare. We will not. And to think we can is not rational.\n\n  Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio:\n\n       I do think we need to deal with the underlying problem of \n     overspending and we have to deal with the problem of \n     Obamacare, but those ought to be handled outside of the \n     context of a government shutdown.\n\n  Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho:\n\n       There isn't anybody that thinks that ObamaCare is going to \n     get defunded. It cannot happen . . . We were elected to \n     govern--you don't govern by shutting down the government.\n  I can go on and on.\n  There are many Republicans in the Senate and Republicans in the House \nwho do not like ObamaCare. They understand that we don't shut down the \ngovernment only to make a point. We don't throw 800,000 workers who \nwork for the Federal Government, whose lives depend on a paycheck, out \non the street in order to make a point.\n  I think Jim Risch--Republican Senator from Idaho--had it right. I \nwill repeat what he said:\n\n       There isn't anybody that thinks that ObamaCare is going to \n     get defunded. It cannot happen. . . . We were elected to \n     govern--you don't govern by shutting down the government.\n\n  Senator Risch is exactly correct.\n  Where we are right now is that there are many Republicans in the \nSenate, there are Republicans in the House, and there are millions of \nRepublicans all over the country who say they have disagreements with \nObamaCare, but it was passed by the Congress almost 4 years ago and \nsigned by the President. When it was challenged by the Supreme Court, \nit was upheld as being constitutional. We had a Presidential election \nwhere the Affordable Care Act was one of the major issues being \ndebated. President Obama won by 5 million votes. We had Senate races, \nand Republicans lost two seats in the Senate. They lost seats in the \nHouse.\n  There are sensible Republicans all over the country saying: Look, \nthere are ways to deal with this issue, but don't shut down the \ngovernment. Don't punish 800,000 workers. Do not deny benefits and \nservices to tens of millions of Americans.\n  I would like to go to another area and suggest--although I think the \nPresiding Officer well understands this--that what we are seeing today \nin terms of the attack on ObamaCare is not only some isolated act on \nthe part of rightwing Republicans. I think many Americans are not \naware. People may like ObamaCare or may not like ObamaCare. As we well \nknow, today was the first day the exchange was open. Guess what \nhappened. Millions of people went to the Web site. Guess what. When we \nhave 48 million Americans who have no health insurance and millions \nmore who are in need with high deductibles and copayments and they are \ngiven the opportunity to buy insurance, shock of all shocks, many of \nthem are now going to the Web site. Our Republican friends are saying: \nNo, no, we don't want to see that.\n  My point--and I hope everybody understands this--is that this attack \non ObamaCare is only one small part of a rightwing extremist ideology \nwhich is incredibly reactionary and which really intends not only to \nrepeal ObamaCare but to repeal virtually every major piece of \nlegislation passed in this country in the last 80 years that protects \nthe interests of the elderly, the children, the sick, the poor, women, \nthe environment, and people who are vulnerable. That is what their \nagenda is.\n  I will give a few examples. The Environmental Protection Agency works \nhard to make sure the air we breathe is clean. There are many rightwing \nRepublicans who don't want only to cut funding for the EPA, they want \nto abolish the EPA.\n  We have a major crisis in this country in terms of millions of \nAmerican workers being forced to work for very low wages. People are \nworking for 8 bucks an hour, 9 bucks an hour. They can't raise a family \nworking for these very low wages. Many of us believe it is important \nthat we raise the minimum wage. Do people know what the rightwing \nagenda is, the agenda funded by a family like the Koch brothers, a \nfamily worth $70 billion that is pouring hundreds of millions of \ndollars into these rightwing extremist groups? Do you know what they \nsay about the minimum wage? They say: Let's abolish the minimum wage.\n  People think I am kidding. The view now of the majority of the \nMembers, the Republican Members in the Senate and the House, is not \nonly not raising the minimum wage, it is to abolish the concept of the \nminimum wage. What that means is that if you are living in a high-\nunemployment area and the wages that are being offered to you by an \nemployer are 3 bucks an hour or 4 bucks an hour, those are the wages \nyou will have to accept because there will be no Federal floor. The \nFederal floor is $7.25, and that is much too low. Get rid of that, and \nwe will have people working for $3 and $4 an hour.\n  One of the most significant pieces of Federal legislation ever passed \nwas passed in 1935--Social Security. Today we have over 50 million \nAmericans who are benefiting from Social Security. If you go to the \nTexas Republican Party platform--their recent platform, and they are \none of the most powerful Republican parties in the country--they are \npretty up front about what they believe. They want to end Social \nSecurity. They want to privatize it. That is their goal.\n  The Veterans' Administration--and I speak today as chairman of the \nVeterans' Committee--today we have quite good VA health care through \n152 medical centers run by the VA, 900 community-based outreach \nclinics, many vet centers. VA does, most veterans consider, a pretty \ngood job in providing\n\n[[Page S7099]]\n\nhealth care. Do you know what some Republicans want to do? They want to \nprivatize the Veterans' Administration. Check it out. This is the Texas \nRepublican Party platform, which speaks for Republicans all over this \ncountry.\n  It is not only the VA and it is not only Social Security, it is many \nother programs. We recently saw our friends in the House cut food \nstamps by some $4 billion this year. That is what they believe. \nMeanwhile, we have more people living in poverty today than at any time \nin the history of the United States. Many want to make devastating cuts \nin Medicaid, food stamps, and many other programs that people in this \ncountry are living on.\n  I will conclude by saying that we could end this crisis in a very few \nminutes. All that needs to happen is the Speaker of the House has to \nbring up the clean bill we passed here in the Senate and give all of \nhis Members a chance to vote on it. If he does that, this crisis will \nbe over.\n  It is morally wrong and it is extremely dangerous from a precedent \nperspective to allow this government and our President to be \nblackmailed or for the American people to be held hostage. If we were \nto succumb to that blackmail today, I can absolutely guarantee that in \n2 weeks, when the United States is going to need to pay its debts, and \nwe don't, for the first time in the history of this country, have the \nmoney to pay our debts, and when the economists are telling us that if \nwe don't pay our debts, there could be an international economic crisis \nleading to huge amounts of job loss all over the world, not only for \nthe United States--if we surrender to them now on this issue, they will \nbe back. They will be back and they will say: If you don't cut this and \ndon't cut that, we are not going to allow you to pay the debts the \nUnited States owes. It will go on and on. Next year they will come back \nand they may say: Well, we are not going to fund the government unless \nyou end Social Security or unless you cut Medicaid drastically.\n  This is not the way a government in a democratic, civilized society \ncan operate. We have our disagreements. God only knows we have that. We \nhave debates. But there is a process.\n  What the Republicans have not yet recovered from is the simple fact \nthat they lost the Presidential election, they do not have control over \nthe Senate, and they only have one body. They think that from \ncontrolling one body they have a right to control the U.S. Government. \nThis is not how it works.\n  I hope that people all over this country, whether they are \nconservatives or progressives, Democrats or Republicans, will listen to \nwhat some of the sensible Republicans are saying. In essence, what they \nare saying--and I have read many of the quotes from John McCain and \nothers--is this: Yes, we have differences of opinion, and, yes, some of \nthem disagree strongly with ObamaCare, but there is a process you go \nthrough to make those changes. Do not shut down the government, impact \nthe entire economy, throw 800,000 people out of work, and deny services \nto millions of Americans. That is not the way to run the government in \na democratic society.\n  Let me conclude by hoping very much that the Speaker of the House \nwill recognize that he is the Speaker of the entire House, not only of \nthe Republican Party, and that he will let all of his Members vote on \nthe legislation we passed in the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator yields the floor, I would ask permission \nto direct a question to the distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator from Vermont aware of the fact that Dr. \nFrancis Collins today announced that scores of people are being turned \naway today from the National Institutes of Health clinical trials, 30 \nlittle children from clinical trials. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I am aware of that.\n  The point the leader is raising, what the question speaks to is that \nthis is not a game we are playing when we are dealing with whether kids \nand others get treatment for cancer. What we are dealing with are life-\nand-death issues. When the government is shut down and agencies such as \nthe National Institutes of Health end cancer research--this is taking \nlife away from people.\n  Mr. REID. I ask through the Chair, is the Senator aware that this new \ngambit across the hall in the House of Representatives is only another \neffort to defund ObamaCare?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n  Let me make a point for the majority leader. Today was the first day \npeople could go onto the exchanges. Maybe the majority leader would \nlike to explain to the American people that, in fact, some of these Web \nsites actually crashed because so many people came on board.\n  Mr. REID. In response to my friend from Vermont, I had the good \nfortune of spending an hour several months ago with one of the founders \nof Google. He, with a twinkle in his eye--a young man still--and a big \nsmile, talked about when they were trying to get Google started. They \ncouldn't believe the people who wanted information. Their Web sites \nkept crashing because so many people wanted the information to which \nthey thought they were entitled.\n  Around America today millions of people, in the first few hours of \nthe opportunity to sign up, rushed and overburdened a number of \nplaces--the Web sites. This is good news for America.\n  I also say that these are the same people--I read a direct quote at \nan event earlier today. I am sorry I don't have it with me. In 1961 \nRonald Reagan talked about Medicare. I am paraphrasing, but this is \npretty close. If they do not stop Medicare, then his children and his \nchildren's children will look back at the day when America used to be \nfree.\n  Can you imagine that?\n  Mr. SANDERS. What I would say to the majority leader--and I was on \nthe floor the other day reading quotes--when Social Security was first \ncreated, we had quotes from Republicans who were talking about the end \nof life as we know it, slavery coming to America. It is the same thing \nwith Medicare. It is interesting.\n  I would say to the majority leader that despite all of the anti-\nAffordable Care Act rhetoric we hear--you would think nobody would be \ninterested in getting into the program--the first day out, over 2 \nmillion people went to the Federal Government's Web site. I am not \nquite sure why our Republican friends think that millions of Americans \non the first day should not have the right to take advantage of a \nprogram that was passed by Congress.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the advocacy of my friend from Vermont for all \nAmericans. This good man, the chairman of the Veterans' Committee, \nSenator Sanders, is like me. I don't have a military record, nor does \nhe, but that doesn't take away from the effort. We try to make sure \nveterans are taken care of. What this good man has done to protect \nAmerican veterans already in a short period of time as chairman of this \ncommittee is outstanding. It is really remarkable how much he cares. I \nexpress my appreciation to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I wish the American people also to understand that we \nare going to win this struggle because of the determination of the \nmajority leader, who is standing for tens of millions of Americans who \nnot only want access to affordable health care but do not want to see \nour government blackmailed by a small number of rightwing extremists.\n  I thank the majority leader very much for his comments.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are going to go out in a few minutes, \nbut this is my message to the House of Representatives, to the \nRepublican leadership in the House of Representatives: Stop the games. \nThe government is shut down. More than 70 percent of our intelligence \ncommunity has been sent home. The National Institutes of Health has \nhundreds and hundreds of people home when they should be looking at \ntheir microscopes trying to cure diseases in America and around the \nworld. Everyone in the world looks at the National Institutes of Health \nwith jealousy, it is such a remarkably good institution.\n  The President has said as to these games they are playing now--he \nsends these little bits and pieces over here--he will veto them. We \nwon't allow them to pass here anyway. We want the government open. If \nthey will pass the legislation to reopen the government, we will then \ntalk about anything they\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\nwant to talk about. We will have conferences on anything they want to \ntalk about. And one of the things we would like to have a conference on \nis Senator Murray's budget that we have been trying to get to \nconference on for more than 6 months.\n  The American people deserve more than they are getting from the House \nof Representatives, the so-called people's House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/01/senate-section/article/S7100-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IRAQI SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am proud that the Senate unanimously \npassed legislation late last night to extend the Iraqi Special \nImmigrant Visa--SIV--Program. This program offers nothing short of a \nlifeline for the Iraqi men and women who risked everything supporting \nthe U.S.' mission in Iraq. Despite the fact that there are thousands of \nIraqis still waiting for their paperwork to be processed, the program \nexpired last night, and we must take immediate action to renew it. \nGiven all that is on the line, I am hopeful that even in this difficult \npolitical climate, the House of Representatives will take up and \nswiftly pass this bill and we can send it to President Obama for his \nsignature later today.\n  Congress created the Iraqi SIV Program in 2008 to allow some of the \ntens of thousands of Iraqis who served alongside U.S. troops the \nopportunity to seek safety and a new beginning in the United States. \nThey were our translators and our guides. They were a critical resource \nto our troops, helping them navigate complex cultural, political, and \ngeographic terrain. They literally risked their lives for us. Now, 5 \nyears after the original legislation passed, less than 6,000 of the \n25,000 available visas have been distributed, leaving many well-\ndeserving Iraqi allies in danger and American credibility on the line.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee's Subcommittee on State Department and Foreign \nOperations, I worked hard to see that a reauthorization for the Iraqi \nSIV Program is in the National Defense Authorization Act. \nUnfortunately, that reauthorization will not pass in time to renew this \nvital program. We also made significant efforts to include that \nextension in the continuing resolution passed by the Senate last week, \nbut a congressional stalemate has eroded that path. The only option \nthat remains is for the House to take up and pass the bipartisan stand-\nalone bill immediately.\n  I am hopeful that we can do just that. I have joined with Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle in the Senate, including Senators Shaheen, \nMcCain, Grassley, and Graham, as well Members in the House, to resolve \nany concerns. We have compromised on the length of the extension and \nhave covered any costs associated with it. Passage should be quick and \nstraightforward. Lives are on the line. Our word is on the line, and it \nis time to act.\n  Among the many lessons of the Vietnam war is that we must not abandon \nthose who risked their lives to help us. We made a commitment, and we \nmust honor it. We must renew this critical program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/01/senate-section/article/S7100-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                100TH ANNIVERSARY OF STARR COMMONWEALTH\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, it is a great pleasure to join my \ncolleague Debbie Stabenow in honoring Starr Commonwealth on a century \nof distinguished service to children and families across Michigan. \nFittingly, they will mark this milestone with a Founder's Day \ncelebration on October 6 in Albion, MI. This impressive community-based \norganization is, indeed, 100 years young.\n  ``There is no such thing as a bad child.'' This simple yet profound \nbelief, held fervently by Floyd Starr, the founder of Starr \nCommonwealth, has served as the guiding principle for everything Starr \nCommonwealth has accomplished from the very beginning. A century ago, \nFloyd Starr sought to create a place where troubled youth could find \nshelter, peace and the assistance they need to grow. He understood \nthen, as we do today, that it is important to ensure that all young \npeople, regardless of their circumstances, have an opportunity to \nflourish. Today, Starr Commonwealth is stronger than ever, and their \nstrength-based approach to transforming the lives of young people has \nproven successful time and again.\n  Situated on 350 acres in Albion, MI, Starr Commonwealth has nurtured \nan environment steeped in natural beauty to serve as an oasis where \ntroubled youth can begin the process of comprehensive, constructive \nchange. This nonprofit, multiservice organization currently reaches \nmore than 1.5 million people annually, including families across \nMichigan, around the United States and in more than 60 countries \nthroughout the world. Starr Commonwealth operates dozens of programs \nwith a focus on helping young people reach their full potential. These \nprograms include residential care services, a therapeutic boarding \nschool, community-based and home-based programs, a public access \ncharter school, and an international learning network for professionals \nworking in positive youth development, trauma-informed care and racial \nhealing, among many others.\n  Organizations such as Starr Commonwealth play an invaluable role in \ncommunities across our Nation. They provide young people with the tools \nthey need to succeed and become productive members of society. Helping \nyoung people face adversity and overcome challenges in a caring, \npositive way is a blessing Starr Commonwealth has bestowed not just on \nthe young they nurture, but on the future of our State.\n  Success stories can be found in communities across our land. The \nlives of countless young people have been transformed; their families \nare healthier; and the communities in which they reside are stronger as \na result of Starr Commonwealth's work. Senator Stabenow and I are \ndelighted to congratulate all who have contributed to the success of \nthis fine organization. Our young people, and our State, have brighter \nfutures because Starr Commonwealth is there to help them along the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/01/senate-section/article/S7100-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1348.

A bill to provide for the compensation of furloughed Federal \nemployees; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Federal Employee \nRetroactive Pay Fairness Act. I am pleased to have Senators Boxer, \nBrown, Carper, Feinstein, Harkin, Heinrich, Hirono, Kaine, Leahy, \nMikulski, Sanders, Schumer, Udall (NM), and Warner as original co-\nsponsors. This bill is a companion bill to legislation Representative \nJim Moran introduced in the House of Representatives, H.R. 3223. The \nbill is simple and straightforward. It requires that all Federal \nworkers furloughed as a result of the lapse in appropriations that \nbegan last night at midnight receive their pay retroactively as soon as \nis practicable. It is the right thing to do. It is the fair thing to \ndo. Federal workers didn't cause this shutdown. Federal workers don't \nwant this shutdown. They are dedicated public servants who simply want \nto do their jobs on behalf of the American people. They shouldn't \nsuffer because so-called Tea Party Republicans, mostly in the House of \nRepresentatives, suffer from the delusion that shutting down the \nFederal Government will somehow prevent the Affordable Care Act from \nbeing implemented.\n  As the Congressional Research Service has reported, in ``historical \npractice'', Federal workers who have been furloughed as a result of a \nshutdown have received their pay retroactively ``as a result of \nlegislation to that effect''. The language in our bill is the language \nused to provide pay retroactively to workers furloughed in the Newt \nGingrich-led shutdowns in 1995 and 1996; that language was contained as \npart of section 124 of P.L. 104-56 (109 STAT. 553).\n  Mr. President, Federal workers already have endured a 3-year pay \nfreeze and ``contributed'' over $90 billion to deficit reduction. That \nwas before sequestration hit. On top of the pay freeze, hundreds of \nthousands of Federal workers have been furloughed because of \nsequestration. Their pay hasn't just been frozen; it has been cut. They \nhave had fewer resources to carry out their missions and administer the \nprograms they are responsible for.\n  Now, upwards of 800,000 Federal workers are being furloughed, again, \nand the rest of federal workforce is being compelled to work without \npay. And Republicans are threatening that there won't be any \nretroactive pay. This is happening to hardworking, patriotic public \nservants, mostly middle class and struggling to get by like so many \nother Americans. Enough is enough.\n  Increasingly, Federal workers are asked to do more with less. \nAccording to the Office of Management & Budget, the size of the Federal \ncivilian workforce relative to the country's population has declined \ndramatically over the last several decades. In the 1950s and 1960s, \nthere were, on average, 92 Americans for every Federal worker. In the \n1980s and 1990s, there were 106 Americans for every Federal worker. By \n2011, the ratio had increased to 145 Americans for every Federal \nworker.\n  Since the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. population has increased by 76 \npercent and the private sector workforce has surged 133 percent, but \nthe size of the Federal workforce has risen just 11 percent. Relative \nto the private sector, the Federal workforce is less than half the size \nit was back in the 1950s and 1960s. Now it just got smaller by another \n800,000 workers overnight because of Republican action regarding the \nfiscal year 2014 continuing resolution.\n  The picture that emerges is one of a Federal civilian workforce whose \nsize has significantly shrunk compared to the size of the U.S. \npopulation it\n\n[[Page S7102]]\n\nserves, the private sector workforce, and the magnitude of Federal \nexpenditures. Yet Republicans are intent on making things even more \ndifficult for Federal workers and their families across the United \nStates.\n  Preventing Federal workers from doing their jobs doesn't just harm \nFederal workers; it harms all Americans because Federal workers patrol \nour borders, make sure our air and water are clean and our food and \ndrugs are safe, support our men and women in uniform and care for our \nwounded warriors, help our manufacturers compete abroad, discover cures \nfor life-threatening diseases, prosecute criminals and terrorists, \nmaintain and protect critical infrastructure, explore the universe, and \nmake sure Social Security, Medicare, and other social safety-net \nprograms are functioning properly.\n  When Federal workers do their jobs, they are helping each and every \nAmerican live a safer and more prosperous life. And I would argue that \nwhat Federal workers are able to do on behalf of the American people \noften redounds to the benefit of all humankind, whether we are talking \nabout conducting ground-breaking basic scientific research or \nestablishing the rule of law.\n  Our tasks here in Congress are simple--not easy, perhaps, but simple: \nwe need to end the shutdown and put federal workers back on the job; we \nneed to raise the debt ceiling so we can continue to pay our bills and \nmaintain the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government; we need to \nreturn to regular order around here and negotiate a comprehensive \nbudget deal that spreads the burden of deficit reduction in a fair way; \nand we need to hold Federal workers and their families harmless after \nsubjecting them to so much harm over the past several weeks and months.\n  We need to stop demonizing and scape-goating and punishing Federal \nworkers. We need to re-open the government, continue paying our bills, \nand replace the sequester with a rational budget. One of the greatest \nattributes of the American character is pragmatism. Unlike what some \nother Federal workers are actually doing, here in Congress, balancing \nthe budget is not ``rocket science''. We know the various options. \nFormer President Lyndon Johnson was fond of quoting the prophet Isaiah: \n``Come, let us reason together'' That is what we need to do. We can \nacknowledge and respect our differences but at the end of the day, the \nAmerican people have entrusted us with governing, with being pragmatic. \nLet us do our job so Federal workers can get back to their jobs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/01/senate-section/article/S7102-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 264--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY, DOCUMENTS, AND \n  REPRESENTATION IN STATE OF FLORIDA V.
