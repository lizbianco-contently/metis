The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8824]]\n\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 243, S. 1356, a bill to \n     amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to strengthen the \n     United States workforce development system through innovation \n     in, and alignment and improvement of, employment, training, \n     and education programs in the United States, and to promote \n     individual and national economic growth, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in morning business until 5:30 \nthis afternoon. At 5:30 the Senate will proceed to executive session. \nThere will be at least 3 rollcall votes: Confirmation of the Patterson \nnomination, cloture on the Johnson nomination, and confirmation of the \nJohnson nomination.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. President, last week was difficult for the entire Senate \ncommunity. When cooperation is lacking, as it was last week, completing \nthe business before this body becomes much more difficult. Last week, \nthough, the Senate confirmed four district court judges, two DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals judges, an Equal Employment Opportunity Commissioner, \nthe Secretary of the Air Force, a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \nBoard member, and a Deputy Secretary of State.\n  Although we accomplished a great deal, the process was neither easy \nnor pleasant. This week the Senate has just as much to achieve as it \ndid last week. Without cooperation we will face another daunting vote \nschedule. But I am optimistic the same spirit of cooperation that made \ntonight's votes possible will last all week long.\n  Tonight the Senate will vote on Anne Patterson's nomination to be \nAssistant Secretary of State. We will also vote on cloture on the \nnomination of Jeh Johnson to be Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. If cloture is invoked, this body will immediately vote on \nJohnson's confirmation.\n  As General Counsel of the Defense Department from 2009 to 2012, Mr. \nJohnson served as the senior lawyer for the largest government agency \nin the world. He oversaw the work of more than 10,000 military and \ncivilian lawyers. Prior to his work at the Defense Department, Mr. \nJohnson served as Assistant U.S. Attorney and spent nearly 2 decades in \nprivate legal practice. He is eminently qualified, and we all look \nforward to his confirmation.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Tomorrow, the Senate will begin consideration of the budget measure \npassed by the House last week. Although neither side got everything it \nwanted from this agreement, the legislation should help break a \nterrible cycle of governing by crisis. It rolls back the painful and \narbitrary cuts of the sequester, protects Social Security and Medicare \nbenefits, and will help prevent another dangerous government shutdown \nin the new year.\n  On Wednesday, the Senate will turn to the Defense authorization \nmeasure, crucial legislation that safeguards our Nation, ensures our \ntroops have the resources and training they need, and provides for the \nmilitary families who support our fighting men and women.\n  The Senate must also confirm Janet Yellen to head the Federal \nReserve, Alejandro Mayorkas to be Deputy Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, and John Koskinen to head the Internal Revenue Service. The \nnominations of Robert Wilkins to be a member of the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals and Brian Davis of Florida to be a district court judge are \nalso priorities for us. Mr. Davis' nomination has been pending for 2 \nyears.\n  The Senate must also move quickly to confirm Sarah Sewall as Under \nSecretary of State, Jessica Wright to be Under Secretary for Readiness \nat the Defense Department, Sarah Bloom Raskin to be second in command \nat Treasury, and Mike Connor to be second in command at Interior, and \nSloan Gibson to be deputy at the Veterans Affairs Department, and Rick \nEngler's nomination for the Chemical Safety Board.\n  Christmas is 1 week from Wednesday. We have a lot to do. We could \ncomplete all of our work by Thursday, by Friday, by Saturday, by \nSunday, by Monday, or Tuesday, but finish it we must. I have outlined \nwhat we need to do. It is up to the minority to determine what, if \nanything, they are going to stop us from doing.\n  I am happy to work with them on time. But there are several items \nthat I have indicated we have got to get done before Christmas.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono.)

I am proud to rise to speak in strong support of the \nnomination of Jeh Johnson to serve as the Secretary of the Department \nof Homeland Security. As my colleagues know, I have been concerned for \nmany months about the high number of senior-level vacancies that exist \nat the Department. In fact, the Department of Homeland Security has \nbeen without a Senate-confirmed Deputy Secretary since April and \nwithout a Senate-confirmed Secretary since early September. That is \nsimply too long for such critical positions to be vacant, especially \nsince the Department of Homeland Security has been without Senate-\nconfirmed leadership in a number of other senior leadership positions \ntoo.\n  That list of vacancies includes the position of Deputy Secretary, as \nwell as the heads of Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, and the Inspector General.\n  Working with the President, we need to do something about it. Today \nwe can. It is my hope and expectation that we will vote to confirm a \nnew Secretary to lead the Department within the next few hours, \nallowing Jeh Johnson to be sworn in and start work later this week.\n  Getting a Secretary of Homeland Security quickly confirmed is \nessential to help effectively run this Department and protect the \nsafety of our citizens. This Department is a large and complex entity \nwith a diverse set of missions and challenges.\n  It is composed of 22 distinct agencies spread across various \nlocations throughout the country. In the 10 years after its creation, \nthe Department of Homeland Security still lacks a strong sense of \ncohesion.\n  Moreover, given the Nation's fiscal challenges, the Department, as \nmany Federal agencies, is being asked to do more and get even better \nresults with fewer Federal dollars.\n  That being said, over its 10 years, the Department has celebrated a \nnumber of important milestones. In fact, only last week, for the first \ntime ever, the Department of Homeland Security received a clean \nfinancial audit.\n  There is one outlier among the major departments of our government \nthat hasn't received that clean financial audit, and that is the \nDepartment of Defense, which has been around for approximately 70 \nyears.\n  The Department of Homeland Security took 10 years and has been on the \nGAO high-risk list for all of those 10 years. I was delighted when I \nreceived word last week that this goal had been achieved. It is a major \naccomplishment and one for which I heartily congratulate the \nDepartment.\n  There is an old saying that goes something such as this: You can't \nmanage what you can't measure.\n  Now the Department of Homeland Security achieved a clean financial \naudit. It is my hope that its financial management practices will \ncontinue to improve. In order to build upon this and other successes, I \nbelieve the Department needs Senate-confirmed leadership.\n\n[[Page S8825]]\n\n  There is no doubt that even on a good day, serving as Secretary of \nthe Department of Homeland Security is a very hard job. Jeh Johnson, \nhowever, is no doubt up to this enormous task. Again, I strongly \nsupport his nomination.\n  Mr. Johnson is a seasoned national security expert who is eminently \nqualified to take the reins to run the challenging Department of \nHomeland Security. After graduating from Morehouse College and then \nColumbia Law School, Jeh Johnson started his career in private \npractice. Later he became an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern \nDistrict of New York, where he prosecuted public corruption cases. He \nthen returned to the private sector where he became a partner with the \nlaw firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.\n  While working with this law firm, Mr. Johnson again answered the call \nto public service, first as the Air Force's top lawyer during the \nsecond term of the Clinton administration and, more recently, in the \nfirst term of the Obama administration, as the top lawyer for the \nentire Department of Defense. In both positions he was confirmed by the \nSenate with strong bipartisan support.\n  Having served in such important positions at the Department of \nDefense has no doubt helped him develop a number of outstanding skills \nthat will enable him to lead this Department effectively.\n  There are few better places to learn how to manage a complex national \nsecurity bureaucracy than at the Department of Defense. For example, \nfor 4 years he was a partner and a part of the senior leadership team \nthat ran the Defense Department. He played a critical role in \noverseeing more than 3 million military and civilian personnel \nscattered around the country and across the world, including having \ndirect responsibility for nearly 10,000 attorneys.\n  He provided key advice to two exceptional Defense Secretaries--Bob \nGates and Leon Panetta--and was an important member of their management \nteams. To me, this is an invaluable experience for the huge task to \nwhich he has been nominated.\n  He also participated in almost every discussion of consequence for \nthe Department, helping to shape the policies that directly impacted \nthe lives of our brave men and women in uniform and their families.\n  In fact, during his time at the Pentagon, Mr. Johnson developed a \nreputation for tackling some of the toughest issues in the Department \nof Defense and finding a way to build consensus and develop thoughtful \nand effective policy. For example, he won praise from both sides of the \naisle for his work on the issue of don't ask, don't tell and on the \nmilitary commission system.\n  Additionally, Mr. Johnson was an influential member of the \nPresident's national security team and helped design and implement many \nof the country's policies to fight terrorism and dismantle the core of \nAl Qaeda. Because of his experience in these positions and in other \ncommanding roles, Mr. Johnson is well prepared to face the challenges \nthat will await him if he is confirmed by the Senate today.\n  People don't have to take my word for it. Mr. Johnson has received \nhigh praise from many distinguished former government officials from \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  In a letter to our Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs, for example, every single former Secretary of that \nDepartment--Tom Ridge, Michael Chertoff, and Janet Napolitano--lauded \nMr. Johnson as an ``eminently qualified nominee.''\n  They went on further to state, and I paraphrase: Jeh Johnson's \nservice at the highest levels of the Department of Defense--the largest \ngovernment agency in the world--provided him a keen understanding of \nhow to successfully execute large-scale operational missions of varying \ncomplexity and purpose.\n  This is what former Defense Secretary Bob Gates, a highly regarded \nand much-admired manager himself, said about Jeh Johnson and his time \nat the Department of Defense:\n\n       Take my word for it: [Jeh Johnson] has successfully managed \n     an array of major initiatives across the biggest bureaucracy \n     in the government--and, in so doing, won the esteem of \n     virtually everyone with whom he worked.\n\n  Similarly, former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said this about Jeh \nJohnson:\n\n       Jeh has proven himself to be a talented, capable, \n     bipartisan, and trusted public servant. I give my strongest \n     recommendation and full support to his confirmation as the \n     Nation's next Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, \nwho stepped down in late 2011, has also expressed his deep confidence \nin the nominee, stating:\n\n       Jeh Johnson is as fine a person and professional as I have \n     ever met.\n\n  I wish to state that again. Admiral Mike Mullen states:\n\n       Jeh Johnson is as fine a person and professional as I have \n     ever met. I am confident in his choice and that he will \n     succeed in leading this most complex organization at a \n     critical time in our country.\n\n  Mr. Johnson has also received encouraging words and praise from a \nnumber of law enforcement groups, including the Major Cities Chiefs \nAssociation and the national Fraternal Order of Police.\n  I would also add that at Mr. Johnson's confirmation hearing, our \nranking member, Dr. Coburn, made known his support for Jeh Johnson and \neven went so far as to ask him to consider staying on as Secretary \nafter the 2016 election, a high compliment indeed. I might add as an \naside, Mr. Johnson's wife was sitting immediately behind him, and when \nDr. Coburn asked for that assurance from the nominee, I wasn't sure if \nshe was going to come out of her seat--and it wasn't in support of the \nidea.\n  Mr. Johnson is undoubtedly a highly skilled leader. He is just the \ntype of person that we need for this extremely important and \nchallenging position.\n  Mr. Johnson, of course, will not be alone in the task of leading the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. It is critically important that Mr. \nJohnson be allowed to surround himself with a capable leadership team. \nWe can help. Indeed, we must help.\n  At the Department of Homeland Security alone, there are 14 \nPresidentially appointed positions that are without a permanent \nreplacement. Of these, 10 require Senate confirmation. This is an \nedition of what I call executive branch Swiss cheese.\n  As we consider Mr. Johnson's nomination, we must remember that \nprotecting the homeland is a team sport, and those of us in the \nlegislative branch are critical members of this important team. If Mr. \nJohnson is confirmed, we must do our part to expeditiously, but \nthoroughly, vet and confirm his leadership team as well.\n  We need to put aside our partisan differences, work together, and \ngive the President and the Department the entire team it needs to \nbetter protect our homeland. That includes confirming Ali Mayorkas for \nDeputy Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  Today the question before us is Mr. Johnson's nomination. For my \ncolleagues still on the fence about Mr. Johnson's nomination, I leave \nus with a few thoughts on his character and his integrity. I have \ngotten to know Jeh Johnson very well over the last couple of months. I \nhave been impressed by his forthrightness, his thoughtfulness, his core \nvalues, and his impeccable moral character, as well as his deep \ncommitment to public service and serving our Nation. He treasures his \nfamily, and he strives to honor the legacy through his work.\n  I had the privilege of meeting several members of his family at the \nconfirmation hearing last month. His wife is an accomplished \nprofessional in her own right. In fact, Jeh met his wife when she was \npracticing dentistry--and I think he might have been the patient.\n  Together they are the proud parents of two young adults that any \nparent would be proud to call their own. He is also a devoted son and \nbrother. Although they could not attend his confirmation hearing, I \nknow his parents are deeply proud of the son that they raised.\n  I noticed in his confirmation hearing that Jeh proudly wore a pin \nthat was his grandfather's. His great grandfather worked as a Pullman \ntrain car porter in the early 20th century. I think that quiet \nstatement says a lot about the importance of family to Jeh and how the \nvalues and character his family instilled in him are always with him.\n\n[[Page S8826]]\n\n  It is clear he is a student of history and draws inspiration from the \ncivil rights movement. One of Jeh Johnson's guiding principles is a \nlesson he learned from Dr. Benjamin ``Bennie'' Mays, the former \npresident of Morehouse College and a mentor to Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr., who said, ``You earn a living by what you get; you earn a life by \nwhat you give.'' Think about that for a second. ``You earn a living by \nwhat you get; you earn a life by what you give.'' Think about that and \nthink about all the times Jeh Johnson has left the comforts of the \nprivate sector--three times before--so that he could give back and \nserve the people of our country as a leader in our government. With \nthat in mind, I think we know what kind of leader we are getting in Jeh \nJohnson and what he will bring to the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting today for Jeh Johnson.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/16/senate-section/article/S8826-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8826-S8830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to share some thoughts about \nthe bipartisan Budget Control Act which passed through the House and is \nnow here, and we are going to have a cloture vote on it in the morning.\n  I appreciate the hard work which Chairman Ryan and Chairman Murray \nput into that. It is a complicated and important task. But I am not \ngoing to be able to support it.\n  I am the ranking member on the Budget Committee. I have dealt with \nthese issues, and Chairman Ryan and Chairman Murray and I have all \ntalked about them for a number of years. There are a lot of things \nwhich are important as we work through this. The proposal before us \nwould increase spending, increase taxes and fees, and it would violate \nthe core promise Congress made when passing the debt ceiling in 2011.\n  In August of 2011, we told the American people that if they allow us \nto raise the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion, we would cut $2.1 trillion in \ndiscretionary spending, essentially over the next 10 years. We would \ntry to reach a bigger agreement. But if we didn't, we would cut money \nthrough the discretionary accounts: Defense and nondefense. No \nagreement was reached. The automatic cuts went into place.\n  I think we could modify those reductions in spending in a way which \nmakes them less harmful and gives the agencies and departments--\nparticularly Defense--much better ability to meet the reductions in \nspending we asked them to meet, without doing unwise damage as I think \nwe probably are today. We could make it a lot better, but not to spend \nmore than we agreed over the now 8 years remaining in the Budget \nControl Act's time.\n  I am willing to give and take on some of this, but I am a bit \nfrustrated that we are now going to spend from $63 billion to $65 \nbillion more mostly in the next 2 years over the Budget Control Act's \nlimits, which include the sequester that we agreed to. I am worried \nabout that. It is going to be spent, and we are going to try to cut \nsomewhere else to fund it. Over half the cuts that are going to fund \nthis $65 billion occur outside the 8 years remaining on the Budget \nControl Act, in the last 2 years. That is not good.\n  We promised in 2011 we would reduce spending $65 billion more this \nyear, or contain its growth, more than this legislation says. We \npromised that. Now this legislation is going to cost from $63 billion \nto $65 billion more this year and next year in spending which we \npromised just 2 years ago. So I am a little uneasy that we are going to \nsay we are going to pay for that extra spending in years 8 and 10 over \nthe next 10-year budget.\n  Forgive me if that causes me concern, but it does. I am worried about \nit, and I hope that our colleagues will study this.\n  There are a couple of big issues that are out there. One is a real \nhit to retired military. People who served 20 years are going to have \ntheir military retirement pay until they are 62 reduced significantly.\n  In addition, we have a problem which I think is even more serious and \nimportant to me. As a member of the Budget Committee who has made and \nraised budget points of order on the floor of the Senate, I wish to \nmake this point clear:\n  There is a budget point of order under current law that--if this \nCongress attempts to spend more money than was agreed to in the Budget \nControl Act and the sequester--that any Member can raise, and I have \nraised it on at least three occasions, and we prevailed on each one of \nthose three occasions.\n  What it says is: Even though you may say you have more money--you \nraised taxes or fees--we agreed not to spend over this level. This is \nour spending limit. It shows growth over 10 years in spending. It is \nnot a real cut, although it cuts in the short term this year. But after \nthis year, defense and nondefense discretionary spending will grow 2.5 \npercent each year. So this is not a permanent savaging of the Federal \nbudget.\n  The point is, it was an agreement to limit spending. Somehow, in this \nagreement reached by Chairman Murray, the Democratic Senate budget \nleader, and Chairman Ryan, the House Republican budget leader--who is \nnot familiar with Senate rules, but Senator Murray is--the Democrats \nobviously insisted that we change that budget point of order. That \nmeans if somebody proposes to spend more than the Budget Control Act \nsays and proposes to pay for it with taxes and fees, it is no longer \nsubject to a 60-vote point of order. That will undermine in a real way \nour ability to be successful, because it will pit unpopular taxes on \nsome business against some needy cause, and it will say that you didn't \nvote to help people in need; whereas, in truth we agreed to spending \nlimits, and we should adhere to those limits.\n  In the past we have had votes, and the vote was simply: This \namendment, this bill that is before the Senate, spent more money than \nwe agreed to spend. Go back and find some other way to fund this good \ncause you want to fund, not by more taxes and more spending. So this \nhas been eroded significantly, and I am worried about it.\n  There are a number of other problems with the legislation, and I know \npeople will complain about it. But nothing is perfect. I know that, and \nI know we would like to have an agreement, and hopefully somehow we \ncan.\n  But what should happen is the Senate should not agree to reduce \nmilitary retirees' benefits, at least not before we know there is no \nother alternative, and that other employees of the Federal Government \nat least have the same kind of reductions. It doesn't appear to be so \nhere, and we ought not to have changed the internal budgetary \nenforcement powers included in this point of order. That should not be \neliminated, and, unfortunately, that is what has happened today.\n\n\n                           Johnson Nomination\n\n  In a bit we will be voting on the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security. This is a very, very important position, one of the \nmost important positions in our entire government. It is a massive \nagency. It was cobbled together under President Bush's tenure after \npushing from Congress.\n  What happened was President Bush, after 2001 and the attack of 9/11, \nwas pressured to have a new agency for homeland security. He didn't go \nfor that at first, but the pressure built, and he decided to do it. He \nsubmitted legislation to do so. I supported it, but being a Federal \nprosecutor, having worked with virtually all of these Federal agencies, \nI probably knew better. It was a big deal, and it is very, very hard to \ncobble these agencies together--with their own history, their own \nadministrations, their own policies, their own rules and regulations--\ninto one. I am not sure it is a totally win-win. But we did it, and I \nvoted for it eventually. Now it is the law of the land. The problem is \nit has not yet been brought under control. It has not yet been unified \nin an effective way.\n\n  There are over 240,000 employees of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and we need a strong leader to make this happen. We need a \nstrong leader\n\n[[Page S8827]]\n\nwho can blend these agencies into one harmonious whole. I don't know \nwhy Coach Nick Saban came to mind. But you need somebody who is strong \nenough to drive the special interests, the old historical biases, the \nold ideas of doing things, into one focused whole to make this the best \nagency in the U.S. Government. That is what we need.\n  The nominee, Mr. Jeh Johnson, doesn't come close to that. He is not a \ngood choice for this position. I am not saying he is not a good man. I \nam saying he is not a good choice.\n  Let's go over some of these things here. With over 240,000 employees, \nthe Department of Homeland Security is the third largest cabinet-level \ndepartment, behind only the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs, \nand it is less cohesive than those two by far. When it was established, \nit subsumed 22 government agencies which all came together.\n  Some of the many DHS components which still exist today as part of \nHomeland Security include the U.S. Customs and Border Protection \nservice, which itself has 25 component parts; the U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Service, which itself has 21 parts. They are an unhappy \ngroup. Their officers association has complained to this administration \nabout the lack of support and lack of commitment to law. The U.S. Coast \nGuard is part of Homeland Security; FEMA, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, which has 37 component parts; and U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement, ICE. The ICE Office of Principal Legal Advisor \nalone has 41 component parts.\n  ICE is an important agency. It has been decimated under this \nadministration. They have voted ``no confidence'' unanimously in their \nDirector John Morton, who finally retired. All of these report directly \nto the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  Before the Judiciary Committee 2\\1/2\\ years ago, I asked Secretary \nNapolitano if she was aware of the ICE officers association morale, \nwhich according to government surveys was virtually the lowest in the \nentire U.S. Government, and would she meet with them, and she didn't \nmake a commitment to do so. So a year later she came back before the \nJudiciary Committee and I said: Have you met with them yet? No. She \ndidn't meet with them. So this is a big problem.\n  The U.S. Secret Service, the group which protects the President and \nprovides security throughout the country, is a very important agency. \nThe TSA, Transportation Security Administration, airport security \npeople, has 21 component parts in that entity. The Domestic Nuclear \nDetection Office; the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; the \nDirector for National Protection and Programs, which includes the \nOffice of Emergency Communications; the National Cybersecurity and \nCommunications Integration Center, the Stakeholder Engagement and Cyber \nInfrastructure Resilience Division, the Federal Network Resilience \nDivision, and the Network Security Deployment Division.\n  I was a U.S. attorney. I worked with many of these Federal agencies \nfor years, but I never heard of those. But they are out there, and they \nare important. The Directorate for Science and technology, which has 37 \ncomponent parts; the Office of Infrastructure Protection, which has 5 \ndivisions; the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning; the \nOffice of Intelligence and Analysis--and that doesn't include 10 other \noffices.\n  On December 12, 2013, the Government Accountability Office--our \nindependent agency that investigates departments and provides \ninformation to Congress--published a report stating that since its \ninception in 2003, the Department of Homeland Security ``has faced \nchallenges in implementing its human capital functions and Federal \nsurveys have consistently found that DHS employees are less satisfied \nwith their jobs than the government-wide average of Federal \nemployees.''\n  Some of those agencies are at the very bottom of satisfaction and so \nforth.\n  DHS has ranked 36 out of 37 agencies that participated in the Office \nof Personnel Management Employee Viewpoint Survey. They surveyed the \nemployees. How do you view your agency? They are at the bottom. We need \na leader who can turn that around. This program is down. We need a \ncoach who can build a winner.\n  This survey includes questions such as whether leaders generate high \nlevels of motivation and commitment in the workforce and whether \nemployees have a high level of respect for their organization's senior \nleaders. That is what they ask when they do this survey. From the years \n2006 through 2013, DHS scored lower than the governmentwide average \neach year. While the governmentwide scores for this index have declined \n3 percentage points since 2011, DHS's scores have decreased by even \nmore--by 5 percentage points from their previous level.\n  My point is that this is a massively important agency on which we \nspend billions of dollars, and it needs a top-flight manager, a proven \nleader, somebody who understands law enforcement. It could be a \nGovernor, it could be a State attorney general, but in my opinion we \nreally need somebody who is a Federal law enforcement officer who has \nbeen a leader or deputy leader at the very top of some of these \nagencies--the FBI, the Secret Service, the Coast Guard--somebody who \nunderstands these issues and is committed to turning this agency \naround.\n  I have to tell you that the secret is that there is no real intent to \nturn this agency around because the immigration system--U.S. Customs, \nICE, the Border Patrol, the Customs and Immigration Service, which \nevaluates requests for admission to the United States--is in disarray. \nThis administration's goal is to further undermine their ability to be \neffective because they do not really want vigorous enforcement in these \nagencies. That is one reason their morale is so bad.\n  The ICE officers of the United States of America filed a lawsuit in \ncourt in Texas. They said their supervisors were instructing them not \nto fulfill their sworn duty, which was to enforce the laws of the \nUnited States. The lawsuit went on for some time. It eventually got \ndismissed on technical grounds, but the judge found that the \nsupervisors of these agencies, the top people in these agencies, could \nnot direct people not to enforce the law--which is what they are doing. \nWe can go into that in some depth, and I am going to do that if I have \nthe time. I am going to document, for the last 4 or 5 years, the \nsystematic action by the President of the United States and his \nhomeland security officers and Secretary and sub-Secretaries to \nundermine law enforcement, not to help our officers do better but to \nblock them from doing their job. It is breathtaking. We have had too \nlittle discussion of it.\n  Jonathan Turley, legal scholar, supporter of President Obama, has \nsaid this goes beyond--this crosses the line. This goes beyond what is \nan Executive power that the President has. It goes beyond his power to \nbasically tell his agencies to implement a DREAM Act law that Congress \nthree times refused to pass. Congress wouldn't pass it, so he directed \nhis agencies to do it anyway.\n  Professor Turley said this is a breathtaking violation of the \nMadisonian concept of three branches of government. It crosses the \nline. He was crystal clear. If I have time, I am going to talk about \nwhat he said about that.\n  Mr. Johnson, who is a nice individual and capable, is a lawyer. He \ncame by to see me. We talked some about this. I expressed, frankly, my \nconcerns to him.\n  The administration has pointed to Mr. Johnson's position as General \nCounsel for the Department of Defense as proof of his management \nability. That position is actually substantially equivalent to being an \nAssistant Secretary of Defense. There are 15 of those. But one thing \nthat counsel for the Department of Defense does not do is manage the \nDepartment and deal with all the conflicts about the agencies and \ndepartments and so forth.\n  An Assistant Secretary of Defense is the fifth highest ranking \nofficial within the Department's organizational hierarchy. First, there \nis the Secretary of Defense, then the Deputy Secretary of Defense, then \nthe Executive Secretary, Under Secretaries, and Deputy Chief Management \nOfficer. You have to go that low, and then he is the counsel--not a \nmanager, a lawyer.\n  He was previously a litigator at some big New York law firm and an \nassistant\n\n[[Page S8828]]\n\nU.S. attorney for 2 years. I was U.S. attorney. I managed an office--a \nrelatively small office--of 12. He was for 2 years an assistant U.S. \nattorney. He is now supposed to be able to manage this entire \nmonstrosity of an agency.\n\n  The first Secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge, had served as \nGovernor of Pennsylvania for 6 years. That is a big State. That \nrequires some management skills. And he was President Bush's Homeland \nSecurity Advisor from 2001 to 2003 and was a part of the post-9/11 \nresponse, and President Bush appointed him and he was the first leader \nin the Department of Homeland Security.\n  His successor, Mike Chertoff, had been a judge on the U.S. court of \nappeals, but, more significantly to me, he had a long term in the \nDepartment of Justice and as U.S. attorney in one of the big offices in \nAmerica, the District of New Jersey. He worked with every one of those \nagencies for a long period of time, spent decades of prosecuting cases, \nand he understood the culture of the agencies that came together to \nform Homeland Security.\n  Even Secretary Napolitano had been Governor of Arizona for 6 years \nand had been State attorney general, both of which were management \npositions.\n  In an interview with the blog abovethelaw.com, nominee Mr. Johnson \nwas asked why he left a lucrative private practice to join the \nDepartment of Justice, and he replied: ``Loyalty to this President, \ncommitment to public service, and safety for our country.'' The first \nthing he mentioned was loyalty to this President.\n  According to one article, Johnson was described as ``a loyal \npolitical operative of the President who often referred to himself as \n`the President's man' at the Department of Defense.'' So the President \nhad his man, the lawyer, at the Department of Defense. I suppose that \nis OK, to have a friend at the Department of Defense, but is he capable \nof running the Department of Homeland Security?\n  On October 18 of this year, at the press conference announcing his \nnomination, Mr. Johnson said, ``I love this country, I care about the \nsafety of our people, I believe in public service, and I remain loyal \nto you, Mr. President.''\n  While at the Department of Defense, Mr. Johnson is credited with \nspearheading the President's effort to repeal the don't ask, don't tell \nlaw or policy despite the fact that a poll of the combat units showed \nthey didn't favor that. A report he produced dismissed these attitudes \nas laden with emotion and misperception. He was hailed as ``a hero of \ndon't ask, don't tell repeal'' by the Washington Post. I think that is \nwhat he has been given the most credit for, being active in that issue. \nI am not saying that is disqualifying; I am saying that is what he \nspent his time doing at the Department of Defense. He wasn't dealing \nwith how much aircraft carriers are going to cost. He wasn't dealing \nwith the kind of weapons we need to be providing or building today to \nbe used by our military down the road and doing so in a constrained \nbudget.\n  According to Senator McCain, recently the White House instructed Mr. \nJohnson not to be responsive to Senators' requests for information in \nrelation to his nomination, and he has complied with that instruction. \nI think it was a concern of Senator McCain's that Cabinet members have \na duty to be responsive to the U.S. Congress and that when you ask a \nnominee or Cabinet member a question, they need to respond. If they are \ngoing to be loyal to the President to the extent they do not respond to \nlegitimate questions from Congress, then maybe they do not need to be \nconfirmed to the job. Are they not going to respond? And who at the \nWhite House told him to do that? It was probably not the President; it \nwas probably some staffer, maybe in his thirties, never done any of \nthis stuff before, and they decided politically they didn't want him to \nanswer questions, so they told him not to, and he didn't do it.\n  We are having a problem today with this. Getting responses is an \nimportant matter for any Cabinet head. But, of course, he had some \nother matters. I am not attacking Mr. Johnson's integrity. I am not \nattacking him in any way personally. But according to the Federal \nElection Commission, he has donated over $130,000 to various Democratic \ncandidates since 1998, including the President's 2008 campaign. \nAccording to the Web site opensecrets.org, Mr. Johnson was a bundler \nfor President Obama's 2008 campaign to the tune of $65,000. He also \nserved on President Obama's fundraising committee. He donated to many \nother groups, and he was counsel to Senator Kerry's 2004 campaign.\n  He is an insider. He is close to the President. They are close \npersonally. He is, perhaps, a good lawyer. Maybe he has some good \npolitical skills, but we have a department that is in disarray, a \ndepartment that is hurting perhaps more than any other department in \nWashington. It is a massive department that needs real leadership. They \nneed a new coach. They need somebody to whip them into shape, break \ndown these barriers, and eliminate the petty turf fights that are still \ngoing on in that agency.\n\n  We need strength, integrity, and a commitment there, and I don't \nbelieve Mr. Johnson has ever had the opportunity to demonstrate that. \nHe has not been trained in those kinds of issues, and he has had no \nexample of it.\n  My colleagues remember the execution of the nuclear option in this \nvery Chamber in which the majority leader broke the rules of the Senate \nto change the rules of the Senate, to eliminate the ability of the \nSenate to have 60 votes to confirm nominees, although most of the \nPresident's nominees were being confirmed and have overwhelmingly been \nconfirmed.\n  They got irritable about a few judges so they changed the rules of \nthe Senate. It has been a devastating change for a lot of reasons. One \nof the ramifications is--with loyal Democratic senatorial support--that \nMr. Johnson doesn't have to respond to my letter or to the inquiries of \nSenator McCain. He has to respond to some staffer in the White House \nwho said: Don't give them any information. Just give them some general \njunk. He will still be confirmed because we have 55 Senators, and they \nonly have to have 51. The ability to put pressure on these nominees is \nimportant.\n  I know my friend Senator Reid made a huge error. He has a tough job, \nbut he did not need to go along with this. I know he had radical and \nprogressive groups pushing him to do this nuclear option, pull the \ntrigger, stick it to them, do it, and he eventually ended up doing it.\n  It has been reported that when Senator Reid left the Senate Chamber \nand went to the Mansfield room, there was raucous applause and cheering \nfrom the ACLU and many leftwing groups that were over there that wanted \nthis thing to happen.\n  I know the hard left wanted that. They have been pushing for \nelimination of the classic Senate prerogatives that make us different \nfrom the House of Representatives. I guess this was the first big step \nthey feel they achieved. It has certainly undermined our ability to ask \nthis nominee, before we confirm him to this hugely important agency, to \nget some commitments from him about how he is going to manage this \nagency.\n  Ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, along \nwith myself, as ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Hatch, \nas the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, Senator Cornyn, who \nis second in command and the whip in the Senate for the Republicans, \nand Senators Lee and Cruz, sent a letter to Mr. Johnson on November 15 \nregarding several issues. Most of the issues focused on the outright \nrefusal of this administration to enforce immigration law as written.\n  On Friday we received a letter that can only be described as \ninsufficient. He refused to give a straight answer to a single \nquestion. He said he would provide his ``more general views as they \nexist at this stage.''\n  What kind of commitment is that? I am going to give you some of my \n``more general views as they exist at this stage.'' Is that the kind of \nresponse the Congress should expect from a man about to head this \nagency? I am sure it is the kind of response the White House staff told \nhim to give.\n  Mr. Johnson's answers are critical to the ability of Senators in this \nbody to properly judge him. It goes to the essence of his \nqualifications for the post and one of the central areas of \nresponsibility under his direction.\n\n[[Page S8829]]\n\n  According to Senator McCain, Mr. Johnson said the White House \nprevented him from giving more complete answers.\n  Now that President Obama, Majority Leader Reid, and the leftwing \ninterest groups have decided and successfully nullified the Senate's \nconstitutional right of advice and consent, why should any nominee be \nresponsive to questions on any topic, let alone controversial ones such \nas: Will you enforce the immigration laws of America? Isn't that \nsomething we ought to be able to ask him? Or will you continue to \ndirect your officers to violate their oath and not enforce the law \nfaithfully? That is what is being done right now, as I will document, \nif we have time do so.\n  This Department has been at the epicenter of this administration's \nrefusal to enforce our laws. The administration's political appointees \nhave amounted to little more than rubberstamps, and they abdicated \ntheir sworn duty to enforce the law.\n  The White House has summarily suspended entire portions of Federal \nimmigration law, granting unilateral reprieves to people based on \neverything from family connections, age of entry, and criminal record. \nThese policies, I fear, are only the tip of the iceberg.\n  The one thing Mr. Johnson was clear about in his letter is that he \nsupports the Senate's immigration bill, one that passed the Senate, but \nthe House has said it was dead on arrival. This bill provides amnesty \nwithout ever securing the border, that further erodes what interior law \nenforcement is left, is even weaker than current law, and provides the \nSecretary of Homeland Security unprecedented discretion and waiver \nauthority. One of the big problems--and one of the reasons the law is \nnot being enforced--is the Secretary says that I am waiving all of \nthese portions of the law, and that is why you don't enforce the law, \nofficers.\n  Under the bill that cleared the Senate, it gave even broader power to \nthe Secretary to not enforce plain law.\n  I think there is no doubt that if Mr. Johnson is confirmed, he will \nuse the additional powers he has to even further undermine enforcement.\n  Speaker Boehner of the House has said they will not take up the \nSenate bill but will take up several immigration bills in a step-by-\nstep approach. Does anyone believe this administration will actually \nenforce anything they pass? They are not enforcing current law.\n\n  Before the House gets into passing laws and conferring on any kind of \ncomprehensive bill, I urge that they start insisting--and help us \ninsist--that this administration enforce the law they have. If they \njust refuse to do it, why should we assume that passing the bill has \nany ability to change the path we are on?\n  The first responsibility of Congress must be to restore the rule of \nlaw, secure the border, and bring the administration into compliance \nwith the laws of the United States. Until that happens, there is no \nreason or basis to offer any legalization plans considered in the \nCongress.\n  Congress cannot capitulate into this overreach. The first place we \nought to start is Mr. Jeh Johnson, the nominee of Homeland Security. He \nwould control the Customs officers, the Border Patrol officers, and the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. Those are all under his direct \ncontrol, and they need to be strengthened and not further undermined.\n  The record of lawlessness is what we sought to explore in our policy-\noriented inquiry to Mr. Johnson, but we got no response to it.\n  In September 2011, the President said:\n\n       We live in a democracy. You have to pass bills through the \n     legislature and then I can sign it.\n\n  Yet less than 1 year after he personally disputed the notion that the \nexecutive branch could not act on its own, he decided to grant legal \nstatus to a class of individuals. He instituted an action called the \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a directive to all the agency \ndepartment heads--all the way down to the officers at the lowest \nlevel--which would grant legal status to a mass population of \nindividuals who are in the country illegally.\n  The directive, combined with the so-called Morton memo, ordered law \nenforcement agencies in the field to stop apprehending and removing \npeople in the country illegally and instead allow them an opportunity \nto apply for legal status.\n  There is no law that allows them to apply for legal status. The law \ncame up three times in Congress and three times Congress rejected the \nlaw.\n  As Professor Turley said, this is a big deal. Three times Congress \nrejects the law and then the President directed his officers to execute \na law that was never passed; in fact, it was rejected.\n  The President told an audience in November of this year that he did \nnot have the power to halt deportations, stating:\n\n       If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without \n     passing this through Congress, then I would do so. We're a \n     Nation of laws . . . the easy way out is to try to yell and \n     pretend like I can do something by violating our laws.\n\n  He said that, but he is doing just the opposite. His statement is \naccurate.\n  Every Member of Congress should be alarmed by this.\n  I asked my Democratic friends who have been awfully quiet on this \nissue: What would you do if a President refused to enforce welfare laws \nor minimum wage laws or fair housing laws? What would you do if a \nPresident circumvented Congress to implement a policy you disagreed \nwith and Congress had explicitly rejected? Would your reaction be the \nsame silence we are seeing today?\n  Once the rule of law begins to be undermined, this whole Republic is \nin danger. The American people get it. They talk to me about it all the \ntime. They use different phrases. They say: What is a Constitution? The \npeople don't tell the truth. The law is not being enforced. How can he \namend ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act?\n  I was taught in elementary school and high school that the President \nexecutes the laws; he doesn't make law. How can he change the law you \nguys just passed? I get asked that all the time. I have to say it is \nnot a frivolous question because we have an abuse--as Professor Turley \nand others have said--that is very significant. It has to end. No one \nis above the law. That is what the judge in Texas said and that is what \nthe judge said to President Nixon when he didn't want to do some \nthings. He said: You are not above the law. They said it to President \nClinton too.\n  Failure to uphold our laws violates our legal and moral \nresponsibilities to our own citizens and those who came to this country \nlegally and creates the preconditions necessary for a repressive and \ncapricious government.\n  When the majority leader can stand before this Senate--and the rules \nof the Senate say that to change the rules of the Senate, you must have \na two-thirds vote. In order to shut off debate, you must have 60 \npercent of the people vote for it. When you make a parliamentary \ninquiry and overrule the Parliamentarian and Presiding Officer who rule \nexactly that and say we can shut off debate on Presidential nominees \nwith 51 votes, something bad has happened. That is a very clear problem \nwe have.\n\n  I spoke to Mr. Johnson, and we had, by chance, an opportunity to have \na few minutes in my office, and he said he supported the law. So I \nasked him why he wanted this job because he was not going to be allowed \nto enforce the law because this President's policies were contrary to \nthat. He had his own ideas about immigration, inconsistent with the law \nof the land, and he was executing his ideas about immigration laws, not \nwhat is the law of the land.\n  So I am going to detail--if I don't finish, I will offer the \ninformation for the record and maybe speak on it later--a long, \ncontinuous trail of violations of law and improper policies designed to \nblock the enforcement of law in America concerning immigration. It is \nstunning, and we should be talking about that with Mr. Johnson, but he \ndoesn't have to answer our questions. He just says he will give us some \ngeneral ideas about what his views are and the views he has at this \ntime. Of course, they may change.\n  Most Americans probably don't know that a law enforcement officer who \napprehends someone for speeding and discovers the person is illegally \nin the country does nothing. The Federal people will not come to pick \nthem up; it is against the policy. They just release them on the spot. \nThey could have caught him for other lesser offenses. They are released \nbecause people won't\n\n[[Page S8830]]\n\ncome and get them. It is actually being applied to people in prison who \nare supposed to be deported.\n  In early 2009 there was an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid--\nand this story explains how we got into this--initiated and planned \nwhile President Bush was in office. And he had been weak on enforcement \nof the laws too, but he was actually getting a little better. He called \nout the National Guard, and momentum was moving in the right direction. \nSo they executed an enforcement action at an engine machine shop in \nWashington State, where ICE agents detained illegal immigrants without \nauthorization. In a statement about the operation, ICE said they were \ninvestigating criminal activity. They discovered hiring records \nrevealing a significant number of people who were using bogus Social \nSecurity numbers and counterfeit documents. They found 26 illegal \nimmigrants working at this company. It was a completely legitimate and \njustified law enforcement action, but President Obama had just taken \noffice and he had clearly promised this kind of thing wouldn't happen. \nShortly thereafter, certain pro-amnesty groups criticized him. As a \nresult, Secretary Napolitano vowed she would ``get to the bottom of \nit.'' An article in the Washington Times quoted a Homeland Security \nofficial as saying, ``The Secretary is not happy about it.'' And \ninstead of enforcing the law, the Secretary investigated the law \nenforcement officers for simply doing their duty--apparently in \nresponse to some secret demand made or promises made to advocacy groups \nduring the campaign.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these thoughts. As I said, that \nwas the first event, and we have had a series of those since--a long \nlist of them--that got us then to a point where we need to know where \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security stands on these issues. We should \nnot confirm somebody who is not crystal clear about what their policy \nwould be for this great office and we shouldn't confirm somebody who \nhas no apparent training or background or capacity to be the kind of \nstrong leader we need at this point in time in history.\n  I see Senator McConnell is on the floor. I appreciate his leadership \nin trying to make sure we adhere to our spending agreements and do the \nright thing on our spending.

Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama for his \nkind words, and I commend him for the great job he has been doing in \noutlining the issues before us, not to mention the particular nominee \nhe was speaking about.\n  A few weeks ago the Obama administration essentially declared that it \nhad met its goals for fixing the ObamaCare Web site. With the Web site \nfixed, they led us to assume that ObamaCare was ``fixed'' as well, but \nthat was never true. As I have been saying all along, the problems are \nmuch bigger than a Web site.\n  Even the administration's claims about the Web site have been \nexaggerated. Recent news reports suggest that many Americans who \nthought they had enrolled on the exchanges will find that they do not, \nin fact, have coverage on January 1, largely as a result of lingering \nproblems with the site.\n  An even larger problem lies with the coverage options folks are \nactually finding if they manage to make it through the Web site. For \nfolks patient enough to successfully navigate through healthcare.gov, \nmany are finding that ObamaCare offers higher premiums, higher costs, \nor higher deductibles--sometimes all three--in exchange for coverage \nthat is in many cases inferior to what they had before: fewer choices, \nrestricted hospital networks, losing doctors our constituents know and \ntrust. That is what many are getting in exchange for higher costs and \nskyrocketing premiums, even after the President promised ObamaCare \nwould ``cut costs and make coverage more affordable for families and \nfor small businesses.''\n  Despite the President's serial pledges to the contrary, the \ngovernment's own studies on this issue now indicate that ObamaCare will \nactually increase the cost of health care in America by more than $620 \nbillion. ObamaCare will actually increase the cost of health care in \nAmerica by more than $620 billion.\n  As one California woman recently put it, for her, ObamaCare has meant \nbeing forced into lower coverage for more money. Many Kentuckians feel \nexactly the same way.\n  Giselle Martino is a constituent of mine from Prospect, KY. Here is \nwhat she recently wrote to me after losing her coverage:\n\n       I paid a very high premium to have a major medical plan. I \n     am now forced into the exchange for a lesser plan with more \n     exclusions and higher deductibles. I will most likely never \n     reach those deductibles. How does this help me? I am \n     basically paying into the plan for the others. If I must pay \n     for my higher tier heart drugs anyway, why should I bother \n     with the health plan? What a disappointment this \n     administration has caused.\n\n  Higher costs and less care, that is what ObamaCare means for Giselle \nMartino.\n  ObamaCare has been a disappointment for Mike Conn from Prestonsburg \ntoo. Here is what he had to say about this law:\n\n       A policy that has similar coverage to what we had would \n     cost us around $1,100 a month. [That] is a 100-percent \n     increase for me and my wife. I was informed by the individual \n     that was helping me find coverage that it was because we live \n     in eastern Kentucky.\n\n  Mike says his plan is no longer available in that part of the State, \nand now he is evidently facing a 100-percent increase in cost because \nof where he lives--a 100-percent increase in cost because of where he \nlives. It is not fair.\n  Mike and Giselle both have every right to be upset. But that is the \nreality of ObamaCare for too many Kentuckians, a State where 280,000 \npeople have already lost the coverage they had because of this law. It \nis a reality facing millions of Americans across our country. When the \nWhite House was asked today whether they were confident that the \nmillions of Americans with canceled policies would be able to sign up \nfor new insurance before January 1, they couldn't give a straight \nanswer.\n  That is why we Republicans are going to maintain our focus where it \nbelongs--on the people we represent and on the issues that truly matter \nto them because our constituents understand that ObamaCare is about so \nmuch more than a Web site. The administration needs to start \nunderstanding that too. Fixing a few lines of code isn't going to help \npeople keep the plans they like, plans that work for their families. It \nisn't going to help our constituents afford the law's exorbitant \npremiums and deductibles. It isn't going to help our constituents cope \nwith fewer choices and lower quality of care. These are the things that \nactually matter to the middle class.\n  The administration and its allies in Congress can talk until they are \nhoarse about a Web site or about nominees or about whatever else they \nthink they can say to distract Americans from the failures of this law, \nbut that isn't going to work.\n  To the millions of Americans suffering under ObamaCare, people should \nknow that Republicans are on their side. We are going to keep fighting \nfor true health reform that lowers costs, for reform that promotes \nchoice and a better quality of care, and we are going to keep fighting \nagainst the idea that government knows better than our constituents \nwhen it comes to their families' health care. That is what our \nconstituents expect of us, I know that is what Kentuckians expect, and \nthat is just what Republicans are going to continue to do.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the great \nleaders in the history of Boston. It might seem odd to describe a man \nwho is still with us today, alive and well, as a figure in history, but \nin the almost 400 years since Boston was founded, a history that is \nfilled with names known across this country--Winthrop, Adams, Lowell, \nLodge--in this 400-year history, few have done more for Boston than our \nmayor Tom Menino.\n  Looking back at his 20 years in office, it is clear how much Tom \nMenino has done for our city. Mayor Menino revitalized Boston. From the \nwaterfront and Innovation District to Dudley Square and Roxbury, Mayor \nMenino led the resurgence of our neighborhoods, expanded parks and \nlivable spaces, and created a city whose innovative potential is \nunbounded.\n  Mayor Menino worked for Boston. With firm convictions, he cautioned \nagainst predatory lenders, starting the ``Don't Borrow Trouble'' \ncampaign long before the great recession. With political will and \ncourage, he improved education for all our kids, creating full-day \nkindergarten and making Boston schools some of the best in the country. \nWith foresight of the next frontiers, he fought for hospitals and \nscientific research, giving Boston the world's leading health care \ninstitutions. With fierce moral clarity, he stood firmly for equality--\nequal opportunity for immigrants, equal rights and equal marriage for \nthe LGBT community, equal pay for women.\n\n  Perhaps most importantly, Mayor Menino has been there for Boston. It \nis often said that more than 50 percent of Boston residents have met \nMayor Menino personally. I do not believe this is true. I believe the \nnumber must be much greater. It seems as if the mayor attends every \ncommunity event, every potluck dinner, every school play, and every \nsoccer game. From Grove Hall to the North End, Bowdoin to West Roxbury, \nwe know Mayor Menino will be there for us in our moments of greatest \ntriumph--ribbon cuttings for new buildings and parks, World Series \nvictories, a new Bostonian's citizenship, a child's graduation--and we \nknow he will be there for us in our moments of great tragedy--the death \nof a loved one, terror in Copley Square.\n  Of course, Mayor Menino could not have done it alone. By his side for \nall these years he has had Angela Menino. Angela is a devoted wife, \nmother, and grandmother. To all of us in Boston, she was not just a \nfirst lady but a first friend. Angela championed causes that often went \nunheralded in the press, supporting women and children, employment and \neducation, and fighting to end homelessness. Today we thank Angela as \nwell for helping make our city into a warm and thriving community.\n  Almost 400 years ago, on a ship sailing from England to the New \nWorld, John Winthrop declared that the new city they would found, \nBoston, would be a ``city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon \nus.'' And if that experiment, our city, was to succeed, he said ``we \nmust be knit together . . . we must entertain each other in brotherly \naffection . . . we must rejoice together, mourn together, labor and \nsuffer together, always having before our eyes our commission and \ncommunity in the work, as members of the same body.''\n  For 20 years Mayor Menino has made Boston into a city that all eyes \ncan see is a model for the country and for the world. He has succeeded \nbecause he knew all along that our fortunes depend on our work \ntogether--as one people, as one community, as one Boston.\n  On behalf of a grateful people, Tom Menino, we thank you for your \nhard work, for your service, and most of all for your dedication to \nmaking Boston a better place.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an outstanding \nmember of our staff, a friend, and a very special person who will soon \nleave the Senate--after almost 11 years of service--with her family to \ngo to Nashville to begin the next exciting phase of their lives.\n  I first met Laura Lefler when she was a staffer working in Senator \nLamar Alexander's front office answering the phones and greeting \nvisitors. I was in Washington to try to decide, like the Presiding \nOfficer, whether running for the U.S. Senate was something I should \nconsider. Seeing her smiling face and listening to her Tennessee accent \ncertainly made me feel at home.\n  Later, after I decided to run, we became involved in one of the most \ndifficult races in the country in 2006. I was the only new Republican \nto make it through. Toward the end, with the race nationalized and \ndealing with all kinds of issues, a whole crew of folks descended upon \nour office to help us get across the top. One of those was young Laura \nLefler, who helped us in our communications office. I think she was \nsurprised by the fierceness of a campaign such as this. She took it all \nvery personally--a sign of someone you want to be at your side.\n  Then came the transition. Laura was the first person to open our \noffice, and she helped us interview people and find our way through the \ndaunting task of opening a new Senate office. When it came down to \ndeciding who would lead our communications office, we had gotten down \nto people who had been here and done it for a long time and Ms. Laura \nLefler. She always said I was concerned about whether she should really \nbe the person, and, in fairness, now that she is leaving, I will say I \nwas. She was young. She had never done this before. Certainly I had \nnever done this before. And I wondered whether we needed someone who \nwas more seasoned and had different experiences. Without question, \nhiring Laura to lead our communications office is one of the best \ndecisions I have ever made in my life. I cannot imagine the last 7 \nyears without Laura in our office, and I know the rest of our staff \nfeels the same way.\n  Laura has been instrumental to our office in every way. No doubt, she \nhas done an outstanding job as a communications director. I think every \nperson in our office, those in other offices, and the media people \nthroughout the Capitol and throughout Tennessee would all speak to the \nfact that she has been a professional, she has been endearing and a \nresponsible communications director.\n  She has also been instrumental in other ways, such as always ensuring \nthat I have never forgotten where I came from. She has that knack when \nwe are making a decision over a tough vote to slip in toward the end \nand sit down privately and express her own feelings--something I value \ngreatly.\n  As time went on, I realized something was different about other \nSenate offices. Most Senate offices center around the U.S. Senator. Our \noffice has never been that way; it has always revolved around Laura.\n  It began with this guy named John Herzog, whom she later married. Was \nhe going to end up having the kind of job that would allow him to know \nhe could support a family? And then when he did, was he going to ask \nher to marry him? This went on for months and months.\n  Then there was the wedding after he asked. I do not think I have ever \nseen so many photographs of dresses and flower arrangements, nor have \nothers in our office.\n  Then came the decision about their home purchase. Where would it be? \nWhat would it look like? How far of a drive would it be? You know the \ndrill.\n  Then came young Jack. His hair was so perfect when he was born, he \ninstantly was dubbed ``the Weatherman.'' Then, of course, which daycare \nwould he attend? Would it be close enough? Would she continue to be a \ncommunications director and a good mom? As we all knew would be the \ncase, she has been exceptional at both.\n  Then more of the same in Tennessee. I remember a townhall meeting in \nLoudon, TN, where over 1,000 people showed up at the gymnasium--a place \nwhere Laura Lefler had been the valedictorian. I remember walking in \nwith such excitement that so many people would be there at this \ntownhall meeting to hear me discuss the big issues facing our Nation, \nbut, not surprisingly, the first thing that was said\n\n[[Page S8832]]\n\nwhen I walked in the door was, ``Where's Laura?''\n  Now, as we all knew would happen at some point, it is time for them \nto move on to the next phase in their lives. While we have all been a \npart of her life and lived the ups and downs, she has been a part of \nall of ours. We will miss her greatly. She knows full well that I would \ngladly continue to be second fiddle in our office if she would stay. \nBut we all know it is time for her and John, with their wonderful son \nJack and possibly others to come, to go back to Tennessee, time to go \nback and be a part of other people's lives the way they have been a \npart of ours.\n  She has made life better for all of us over the last 7 years. Her big \nsmile and ability to take ribbing--and also dish it out--have made each \nday so much more enjoyable. She is a consummate professional, always \nseeking perfection but with the ability to make it fun along the way. \nWe will miss her, but we are so happy for her, for John, and for Jack. \nWe are happy for her mother, who lives just across the line in \nKentucky, and her dad, who lives right up the road in Loudon. We know \nNashville will be a much better place with the Herzogs there. We look \nforward to visiting them often, and we all hope they will continue to \ninvolve us all in their wonderful life, their story, and the evolution \nof the Herzog family in Tennessee.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge my \ncolleagues to support the bipartisan budget agreement.\n  I congratulate our colleagues, especially Budget Committee chairwoman \nMurray for her outstanding leadership in forging this bipartisan \nagreement with her House counterpart, Mr. Ryan. They reached this \nagreement in a way that is indeed a compromise--not everyone's desired \noutcome but a fair and necessary one. I urge my colleagues to support \nit. I think it is fantastic that they actually got a budget done. This \nis the first time in several years we are actually going to vote on a \nbipartisan budget conference agreement, and I think it bodes well for \nfuture activity where we return to the due order of passing \nlegislation, one in each House, having a conference committee to hammer \nout the disagreements, and then it coming back to us for final \nagreement.\n  What I like about this agreement is it creates certainty by avoiding \nsequester for 2 years, giving the top-line funding to us on the \nAppropriations Committee for 2014 and 2015. Many people do not realize \nthat we on the Appropriations Committee who actually put money in the \nFederal checkbook to be spent have a cap put on our spending by the \nBudget Committee. That is called the 302(a) or the top line. We have \nnot been able to do our Appropriations Committee work because we have \nnot had a top line. This enables us to have one for 2014. We are under \na mandate to bring it back to the Senate and to the House by January \n14. We will meet that deadline. It is going to be tough. It is going to \nbe stringent. But we are going to get the job done. It also gives us \ncertainty for 2015 so we can return to a regular order of actually \nknowing where we stand with our cap, holding our hearings, and bringing \nbills to the committee.\n  The other facet I like about this bipartisan budget agreement is it \nprevents harm. It protects seniors and families. It preserves the \nsocial safety net, such as Medicare and Social Security.\n  Finally, the agreement ends gridlock. The American people are tired \nof shutdown, slowdown, slam-down politics. This agreement ends the \nlurching from crisis to crisis and shows we can compromise and we can \ngovern.\n  First of all, and foremost, this budget agreement creates certainty \nfor America's businesses and families. By avoiding sequester for 2 \nyears, it prevents further across-the-board cuts--not that we do not \nneed strategic cuts, and we will come up with them in the \nAppropriations Committee--but across-the-board cuts where we do not \nknow if a program works or if a program is dysfunctional. This way, we \ncan actually look at those programs that we do need to cut--those that \nare dated, those that are duplicative, those that are dysfunctional. \nSure, let's cut those.\n  But at the same time let's keep the good programs and make sure that \nthey are adequately funded. I believe that avoiding the sequester and \nthe meat-ax approach to cuts really helps us to have better governance. \nWe will have a more frugal government, and we will have a more sensible \nway of spending.\n  It also gives us this top line funding for 2014 and 2015 for the \nAppropriations Committee. It means that we can write an omnibus bill. \nWhat does an omnibus bill mean? We on the Appropriations Committee have \n12 subcommittees. We would like to have brought these subcommittees up \none by one and have the House exercise their due diligence in looking \nat the bills to see what they want to add, subtract or change.\n  We could not do it because we failed to have this budget agreement to \ngive us the top line. What we will now be able to do is for 2014 we \nwill be able to bring them all up at one time in a bill called the \nomnibus. I hope it is a bus that really moves. It will enable us to \nmake smart choices about our investments in America instead of \ngovernment on autopilot through a continuing funding resolution.\n  This agreement saves America from lurching from one continuing \nfunding resolution to another. It is a fair compromise. For 2014 it is \n$45 billion above the House-proposed budget, but it is $45 billion \nbelow the Senate-proposed budget. Our budget leadership met in the \nmiddle and really thought that would be an adequate compromise. I would \nhave preferred the 1.058 level, but it is adequate.\n  The bipartisan agreement also, as I said, prevents harm to the middle \nclass. What America is looking for, though, is not only numbers and \nprograms and so on, they want us to get our act together. They want us \nto really do our job, and do it in a way that is sensible and civil.\n  I believe that is what was done in that budget committee. They want \nus to work together across the aisle and across the dome. This \nbipartisan agreement shows what can be done when we do meet in the \nmiddle to make progress for the middle class and for those people who \nare neither right or left but want to take the middle of the road.\n  This compromise is not perfect. Compromises never are. For me, some \nof the pay-fors were not exactly what I was happy about. For example, \nthey require new Federal employees to pay more for their retirement and \nworking-age military retirees to receive smaller COLAs. I would have \npreferred an agreement that closed tax loopholes or canceled some of \nthose out-of-date farm subsidies left over from the 1930s.\n  However, by avoiding the sequester, we also will be able to avoid \nfurloughs. If you talk to the civilian employees at Defense, and you \ntalk to Federal employees in the domestic agencies about this whole \nidea of furloughs and sequester, some of them had to have a double \nfurlough, such as at the FBI. We were facing furloughs in the FBI. We \ndid not have gas for the FBI cars. That is not right.\n  We want to make sure we continue to fund our government and meet our \nresponsibilities. I cannot stress enough how important this bipartisan \nagreement is. If we continued the path that we left and the sequester \nwas left in place, it is would cost our economy 800,000 jobs in 1 \nyear--800,000 jobs.\n  Maryland already lost 21,000 jobs because of the sequester. We have \nimportant Federal agencies. We have over 250,000 contractors, both in \ndefense and civilian agencies, and the ripple effect through my State \nhad an impact on institutions like Johns Hopkins and the University of \nMaryland and on major flagship companies like Lockheed Martin, and it \nwas really significant.\n  By passing this, we have a certainty that enables us to keep those \njobs. The Appropriations Committee is ready to write a funding bill \nthat will create jobs today and jobs tomorrow. Jobs today and important \ninvestments in infrastructure, education, research and development, and \njobs tomorrow.\n  Let's take this bipartisan agreement, and we will produce a bill. We \non the\n\n[[Page S8833]]\n\nAppropriations Committee will produce a bill that meets our national \nsecurity needs, our compelling human needs, and at the same time lay \nthe groundwork for a more prosperous America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and end gridlock and \ndeadlock. Let's get on with making sure that we have certainty and \nreliability in funding the government of the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in 12 days, unemployment insurance will \nexpire for 1.3 million Americans. This will impact virtually every \nState. Over the course of the next year, it will set back millions of \nhard-working families, slow down job growth, and slow our economic \nrecovery.\n  Today I filed three amendments to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement \nAct. The amendments would extend UI for 1 month, 3 months, or a year \nrespectively. While I believe the best policy is to extend unemployment \ninsurance for 1 year in order to keep our economic recovery moving \nforward, I am willing to work with my colleagues who object to \nextending it for the full year to find a path forward.\n  What we must, I think, provide is at least a message to those people \nthat they will not see their benefits eliminated on December 28, and \nthat we will, in fact, be working to make sure that this protection is \nin place for families all cross this country. Over the next several \ndays I will be coming to the floor seeking consent and urging my \ncolleagues to extend unemployment insurance.\n  The expiration of unemployment insurance will be devastating to \nfamilies across the entire Nation who rely on this as the last \nremaining source of support, in many cases for people who have worked \nhard for many years and because of this economy have lost their jobs.\n  This is a stressful time.\n  My home State of Rhode Island has an unemployment rate of 9.2 \npercent. We have been struggling since 2008 and 2009. This is very \ndifficult for people. This difficulty will be particularly hard to bear \nas we celebrate the holidays--at a time when people should be able to \nconsider and count their blessings--they will instead be looking ahead \na few days afterward to the loss of valuable, irreplaceable income.\n  It is also a devastating blow to our local businesses and economy. \nExtending UI is not only doing the right thing for American families, \nthis is doing the right and smart thing for the American economy.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if we fail to extend \nunemployment insurance, we will lose 200,000 jobs--at a time when our \nmajor priority should be getting as many jobs as we can--and will slow \neconomic growth by about .2 percent GDP.\n  This is not only the right thing to do in terms of the families of \nAmerica, it is the smart and right thing to do for our economy. There \nis a compelling, economic rationale to provide these extended \nunemployment insurance benefits.\n  Mark Zandi, a noted economist, estimates that for every $1 we put \ninto the UI Program we get $1.55 in return of economic activity. It \nmakes sense. People who are living without their income from \nemployment, when they take this money, they go to the store, they put \nfood on the table, they pay rent. They pay for heat in the Northeast \nwhere the President pro tempore resides.\n  They are not stashing it away. In some cases, they are putting it \nright back into the economy. So this is a wise, economic policy, as \nwell as a humane and decent policy.\n  Now is not the time to let this program expire for the individuals or \nfor the economy. We have to extend UI immediately. December 28 is the \nday it stops; it is a cliff. People are off the program. Then, \nthroughout the year, as people exhaust their State benefits at 26 \nweeks, they fall off because there is no Unemployment Insurance \nProgram.\n  This is an economy where we are just beginning to see some recovery. \nLast month's numbers suggested about a 200,000-job gain. That was good, \nbut hidden in those statistics was increasing evidence that long-term \nunemployment is increasing. Those people who haven't found jobs quickly \nare not finding jobs very well at all.\n  That trend is continuing and that is another reason we need the long-\nterm benefits that are provided by the Federal program.\n  I am going to do my best to try to bring people together to recognize \nthat this is an issue that is about American workers. People don't get \nunemployment insurance unless they have worked. It is about American \nfamilies, because it is so necessary to support these families, and it \nis about States all across this country. Rhode Island has a 9.2-percent \nunemployment record. Nevada is the highest with 9.3 percent.\n  We can look at States--North, South, East, West--scattered across \nthis country that have unemployment rates over 8 percent that need this \nprogram for their residents. I hope we can come together, work \ntogether, and get this done.\n  I urge, again, in the next few days that we all stop and think about \nour obligations, not only to the families of America but to keeping the \nmomentum of economic growth moving forward. I would particularly ask \nthose colleagues who are representing States with unemployment rates \nthat are above the national average--and the national average is 7 \npercent--to think very hard about what they are going to tell many of \ntheir constituents on December 28 when they have lost their benefits.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/16/senate-section/article/S8833-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8833-S8834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. COATS. I know we will be voting shortly. The narrative out of the \nWhite House is that this health care plan is starting to work. That is \nnot what I am hearing from home, and many are questioning this.\n  The Wall Street Journal today published an analysis showing how the \nhealth care law will raise premium rates. We all are familiar with the \nPresident's promise that rates will not increase under the ObamaCare, \nAffordable Care Act. According to The Wall Street Journal, Americans--\nparticularly young, healthy adults--``could see insurance rates double \nor even triple when they look to buy individual coverage.'' Other \ngroups, Oliver Wyman, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Milliman, all issued \nreports estimating that ObamaCare would increase premiums by up to 60 \npercent.\n  On and on this drama goes with broken promises. The American people \nare learning and discovering promises were made when this law was \npassed--and all through the 3\\1/2\\ years leading up to where we are--\nand assurances were coming from the President and the White House: \nDon't worry. Your premiums won't go up, period. You can keep the doctor \nthat you have, period. It is not going to cost any more money, period.\n  Those promises have been broken and Hoosiers are finding out about \nthis every day.\n  Regardless of the statements coming out--don't worry, everything is \ngoing to be OK, sort of take it to the bank, trust us--that is not what \nis happening on the ground.\n  People are writing to me. They are calling our office. They are \ntweeting, emailing, and doing everything they can to give us these \nhorror stories, saying: Do I have to do this?\n  Unfortunately, they do. Edward from Chesterton, IN, said he has spent \ncountless hours on healthcare.gov searching for a health care plan. He \ndiscovered that the plans offered under the ObamaCare exchange had \nexpensive premiums that he hadn't anticipated. In order to afford the \nmonthly premiums, he has to choose the plan for\n\n[[Page S8834]]\n\nhis family with unaffordable deductibles in order to keep his premiums \nat the level he can afford to pay. It is basically: Edward, don't get \nsick. Don't have a medical expense throughout your family every year, \nand you will be OK. But if you do, what you didn't pay in premiums you \nare going to have to pay in much higher deductibles.\n  John from Martinsville, IN, was finally able to get on the \nhealthcare.gov Web site. He found the bronze plan that was going to be \nat least $100 more per month. He doesn't qualify for a government \nsubsidy, and he doesn't see any way this new law will be saving money \nfor his family. John says the only thing he sees is that he now will be \nsubsidizing the health care system even more than before the law was \npassed.\n  DeWayne from Shipshewana, IN, wrote to tell me that not only is the \nsmall group health insurance plan his business currently offers not \navailable any longer starting in 2014, but in his 15 years of \nadministering the business health plans, he said he has never seen a \nrate increase this high.\n  DeWayne's health insurance plan for him and his business employees \nwill increase 65 percent in this coming year. DeWayne's small group \nhealth insurance is increasing 65 percent for 2014--and this is called \nthe Affordable Care Act?\n  I wish to give one more broken promise. William from Granger, IN, \nwrote and told me that his wife who works as a part-time nurse will no \nlonger be offered health care since she works part-time. I assume they \nhave children at home or maybe the hospital has determined they want to \nstay under that 40-hour workweek level, so they put her on part-time. I \nam not exactly sure what the case is.\n  In any event, they have discovered they will have premiums rise from \n$11,544 a year under their current plan to $19,076 per year, an \nincrease of over $7,500.\n  He goes on to say: ``So much for [the President's promise] if you \nlike your plan . . . if you like your doctor . . . your costs will go \ndown by $2,500.''\n  William's costs go up by $7,500.\n  This isn't only Republicans in Washington highlighting these health \ncare costs. These are Hoosiers from all backgrounds, Republicans, \nDemocrats, and from all walks of life, sharing their stories with me \nabout how they are paying the price for the President's broken \npromises.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support the confirmation of \nJeh Johnson to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. Mr. Johnson's \ndistinguished career in public service, including his service as a \nFederal prosecutor and as general counsel of the Department of Defense, \nwill suit him well as he takes on this new and very challenging \nresponsibility. I look forward to inviting Mr. Johnson to testify \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee for an oversight hearing in the \nnew year, which he has committed to do. Mr. Johnson will oversee many \nissues within the Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction, not the least of \nwhich is Federal immigration policy.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Johnson recently and discuss \nsome of the issues that have been of interest to me over the last \nseveral years. I encouraged him to continue to support the exceptional \nwork U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Alejandro \nMayorkas has done to make USCIS a better, stronger agency. In \nparticular, I encouraged Mr. Johnson to build upon Director Mayorkas' \nwork to strengthen and improve the EB-5 Regional Center Program, which \nis a successful, job-creating immigration program that has transformed \nparts of Vermont and other communities across the country. I look \nforward to working with Mr. Johnson and Director Mayorkas following his \nconfirmation as Deputy Secretary for Homeland Security to continue the \npartnership the Senate Judiciary Committee developed with USCIS to make \nthe improvements necessary to maintain the highest standards of \nintegrity in this important program, and to sustain it as a significant \neconomic engine for the United States.\n  I relayed to Mr. Johnson my concerns about Border Patrol checkpoints \nin the interior of the country, such as the one that the previous \nadministration implemented and operated nearly 100 miles south of the \nCanadian border on Interstate 91 in Vermont. Over the past several \nyears, I have heard from many Vermonters who find the idea of a Federal \ncheckpoint 100 miles from the Canadian border, deep into the State of \nVermont, entirely inconsistent with Vermont values and an overbearing \nFederal presence that creates an environment susceptible to racial \nprofiling and the needless harassment of law abiding citizens. I \ncontinue to have serious questions about the effectiveness of \ncheckpoints such as these, especially when weighed against the \nsignificant intrusion into the privacy of Americans.\n  I also discussed with Mr. Johnson my concerns related to the \ntreatment of Americans returning to the United States, in particular \nthe practice of CBP officials conducting warrantless searches of \nAmericans' persons and belongings, including conducting forensic \nsearches of electronic devices. These searches within the border zone \nare not subject to the usual protections provided by the Fourth \nAmendment to Americans. Recent CBP activities have raised serious \nquestions about whether Federal officials are circumventing the \nprotections of the Fourth Amendment by conducting opportunistic \nsearches on individuals when those officials know they will be \nreentering the United States. As I wrote in a letter to the current \nacting secretary, such authority must be used with great restraint. I \nlook forward to continuing my discussions about these important issues \nwith Mr. Johnson.\n  Finally, I will seek to work with Mr. Johnson to address the \noverbroad material support bar in our immigration law. It has resulted \nin people, including vulnerable refugees, being unfairly barred from \nthe United States based solely on de minimus commercial or social \nconduct that has negligible connection to the support of terrorism. One \nexample involves an individual who sold flowers to members of a \nterrorist group, and is now considered to\n\n[[Page S8836]]\n\nhave provided ``material support'' to terrorism. That simply does not \nmake sense and must be changed. As I have with his predecessors, I will \nurge Mr. Johnson to address this unjust situation as soon as possible \nafter he takes office.\n  I congratulate Jeh Johnson on his confirmation and look forward to \nworking with him as Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/16/senate-section/article/S8836-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I am proud to recognize the 10th \nanniversary of the enactment of the ``Hometown Heroes Survivors \nBenefits Act'' which occurred this past Saturday. Back in 2003, I \nworked with a bipartisan group of Senators to pass this legislation to \nimprove the Department of Justice's Public Safety Officers' Benefits--\nPSOB--program by allowing families of public safety officers who suffer \nfatal heart attacks or strokes to qualify for Federal survivor \nbenefits. I am proud to mark the 10-year anniversary of this important \nprogram.\n  I first want to thank each of our Nation's brave law enforcement \nofficers, firefighters, and emergency medical responders for the work \nthey do for the American public each and every day. This legislation, \nlike the Public Safety Officers Benefits program, is for them. It is \nCongress' recognition of the importance of their service to their \ncommunities and to the Nation.\n  Our public safety officers are often the first to respond to a crime \nscene or emergency situation. They are often the first line of defense \nin a natural disaster or national security emergency. They are among \nour most courageous and dedicated public servants. I applaud their \nefforts in responding to more than 240 million emergency calls each \nyear--whether those calls involve a fire, crime, medical emergency, \nnatural disaster, or act of terrorism--without hesitation. They act \nwith a steadfast commitment to the safety and protection of their \nfellow citizens and, sadly, sometimes lose their own lives in the \nprotection of their communities.\n  Each year, hundreds of public safety officers nationwide lose their \nlives and thousands more are injured while performing their duties. And \nwhile these benefits can never be a substitute for the loss of a loved \none, the families of all these fallen heroes deserve this financial \nsupport from the Federal government.\n  The PSOB program was established in 1976 to authorize a one-time \nfinancial payment to the eligible survivors of Federal, State, and \nlocal public safety officers who die in the line of duty. While there \nhad been various efforts over the years to improve the program leading \nup to 2003, the benefits did not extend to officers suffering a fatal \nheart attack or stroke from a work-related, non-traumatic injury, such \nas stress or strain from the job.\n  The Hometown Heroes Act of 2003 expanded PSOB coverage to ensure that \nthe survivors of public safety officers who die of heart attacks or \nstrokes in the line of duty or within 24 hours of a triggering effect \nwhile on duty--regardless of whether a traumatic injury is present at \nthe time of the heart attack or stroke--are eligible to receive \nfinancial benefits. Ensuring public safety is dangerous, grueling, and \nstressful work. A first responder's chances of suffering a heart attack \nor stroke exponentially increases when he or she puts on heavy \nequipment and rushes into a burning building or gets into a shootout \nwith dangerous criminals. Since enactment of the Hometown Heroes law, \nthe Department of Justice has approved 373 claims. This is 373 families \nwho have received this important support in the face of a tragedy. The \nfamilies of these brave public servants deserve coverage under the PSOB \nprogram and I am grateful that Congress was able to pass legislation to \nmake sure the law covered these situations.\n  Over the past few years I have increasingly sought ways to improve \nthe PSOB program. Last year, as part of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, I was successful in adding to that legislation the \nDale Long Act. The inclusion of this amendment fixed coverage gaps in \nthe Federal PSOB program by extending benefits to private, non-\nemergency medical services--EMS--volunteers and personnel. In Vermont \nalone, this change covers an estimated 1,200 EMS personnel for the \nprogram. This legislation also streamlined what had been an unwieldy \nand unnecessarily long appeals process for claimants, clarified the \nlist of eligible survivor recipients, and eliminated an artificial \ndistinction under current law to include vascular ruptures as a type of \ninjury that would make a public safety officer's survivors qualified \nfor Hometown Heroes benefits. Since 2012, as a result of the Dale Long \nAct's enactment, an additional 23 Hometown Heroes cases have been \napproved.\n  Finally, I want to recognize the outstanding work of Director Denise \nO'Donnell and her staff at the Department of Justice's Bureau of \nJustice Assistance. Under Director O'Donnell's leadership, her \ndedicated staff has put into place significant reforms and improvements \nto the program that have increased efficiency, transparency, and \ncommunication with the survivors of fallen first responders with \npending claims. They are putting to good use the new statutory \nprovisions that were enacted as part of the Dale Long Act provisions \nthat make the program more cost effective and easier for administrators \nand claimants to find resolution. As a former prosecutor, Director \nO'Donnell understands the importance of this program to first \nresponders across the country and she has worked very hard to listen to \ntheir concerns and act on them. I know the staff members within the \nPSOB program office recognize the solemnity and importance of the work \nthey do and recognize that each case represents a family that has \nendured a great sacrifice. They carry out their duties with the respect \nthese cases deserve and I thank them as they continue to carry out the \npromise Congress made to America's first responders over 30 years ago.\n  Public safety officers are part of the bedrock of our Nation. We must \ncontinue to recognize their hard work and selfless dedication to \ncommunities across this country and ensure that they and their families \nhave the protections they need and most certainly deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/16/senate-section/article/S8839-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8839-S8840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JAMES NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the process for running these nominees \nthrough the Senate is unnecessary and contrived simply to ignore a \nnumber of Republican concerns.\n  I do not oppose all the nominees, however. I wish to strongly support \nthe confirmation of Deborah James for Secretary of the U.S. Air Force. \nWith three Air Force installations in Oklahoma--Tinker Air Force Base \nin Oklahoma City, Altus Air Force Base, and Vance Air Force Base in \nEnid--the Air Force has long been a part of the fabric of the State of \nOklahoma. Oklahoma is home to five major military installations between \nthe U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army. They employee thousands of Oklahomans \nand contract work throughout the State being responsible for a \ntremendous role in Oklahoma's economy. These installations enjoy the \nstrong support of the communities in which they are located and the \nentire State of Oklahoma.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee held a nomination hearing on Ms. \nJames back in September. In addition, I have met with Ms. James, and I \nhave had an opportunity to discuss with her my concerns about this \nunprecedented period in which the readiness and capabilities of the Air \nForce are at significant risk because of budget cuts and sequestration.\n  For example, the Air Force was forced to ground one-third of its \ncombat coded active squadrons for a time during fiscal year 2013 and \naccording to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force it will now cost a \nminimum of 10 percent more flying hours to fully retrain the grounded \nsquadrons than it would have to simply keep them trained all along. \nFurther, General Welsh stated that sequestration in fiscal year 2014 \ncould force flying hours to be cut by 15 percent and within 3 to 4 \nmonths, many units would be unable to fly at rates required to maintain \nmission readiness.\n  Ms. James has over 30 years of senior homeland and national security \nmanagement, policy, and program experience in government and the \nprivate sector. She served with SAIC in McLean, VA from 2002 as the \npresident of SAIC Technical and Engineering Sector, executive vice \npresident for communications and government affairs, and senior vice \npresident for Homeland Security. Prior to those positions, she served \nas vice president for\n\n[[Page S8840]]\n\nInternational Operations and Marketing at United Technologies from 1998 \nto 2000.\n  She served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs from \n1993 to 1998, overseeing all matters pertaining to the National Guard \nand Reserve Forces. She has significant experience working with \nCongress, as a former professional staff member on the House Armed \nServices Committee from 1983 to 1993. She has a bachelor's degree in \ncomparative studies from Duke University and a master's degree in \ninternational affairs from Columbia University.\n  I believe she is very qualified and ready to start her new role. I \nlook forward to working with Secretary James in her new role and \nstrongly congratulate her.\n  However, I would like to point out that these nominations are not \nwithout controversy which may be why the Democratic majority would \nrather ignore the minority and change the Senate for the first time in \nover 200 years.\n  For example, Ms. Patricia Wald who the Administration nominated to \nserve on the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board has written \nthat those accused of terrorism should be given access to the civilian \ntrial court system and be afforded the protections of simple criminal \ndefendants. These views ignore the devastating effects of terrorism and \nignore our actual war against terrorism around the world. These acts \nare not simply criminal acts, they threaten our entire country. This \nshould be the subject of debate in the Senate, not simply brushed aside \nfor quick confirmations.\n  Earlier the Senate voted on the nominations of two district court \njudges for Montana. These are lifetime appointments. The Senate \nconfirmed these judges by a wide margin, but the Senate should not \nsimply group a number of nominations together to pass for lifetime \nappointments for circuit and district judicial vacancies simply because \nthe majority does not even want to work with the minority. This session \nwill end with continued confirmation votes. It is to the detriment of \nboth parties if the prerogatives, priorities, and concerns of the \nminority are not considered in the Senate, but it will not be easily \noverlooked.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join my \nfriend Senator Manchin from West Virginia in introducing legislation \nauthorizing a Congressional Gold Medal for United States Air Force \nFighter Aces.\n  This bill specifically honors those American pilots who have shot \ndown five or more enemy aircraft in aerial combat during a war or \nconflict in which American armed forces have participated.\n  Since the First World War, there have been 60,000 American fighter \npilots who have taken to the air in harm's way, but only 1,444 have \nbecome fighter aces. Our bill authorizes the U.S Mint to strike--at no \ncost to the taxpayer--a medal of appropriate design to American fighter \naces in recognition of their heroic military service and defense of our \ncountry's freedom, which as spanned the history of aviation warfare.\n  American Fighter Aces hail from every State in the Union are one of \nthe most decorated military groups in American history. Twenty-two \nfighter aces have achieved the rank of admiral, and 79 have achieved \nthe rank of general in the Army, Air Force, and Marines. And there are \n19 Medal of Honor recipients.\n  One of those aces hailed from my home State of Oklahoma.\n  BG Robinson ``Robbie'' Risner was from Tulsa, OK, my hometown, and a \nfellow graduate of Tulsa Central High School in 1942. Risner then \nenlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force as an aviation cadet and began his \ncareer as one of America's most celebrated Fighter Aces.\n  After being stationed in Panama during World War II, he returned home \nto serve in the Oklahoma Air National Guard until he was called to \nfight in the Korean war. There, he flew 108 missions in his sweptwing \nF-86 Sabre and became an ace by shooting down eight enemy MiG-15s. He \nalso received one of two Silver Stars in his valiant attempt to save a \nfellow pilot.\n  During the Vietnam war, General Risner flew 55 missions and led the \nfirst flight of air strikes over North Vietnam in Operation Rolling \nThunder, earning him the Air Force Cross.\n  While flying in another raid in his F-105 Thunderchief on September \n16, 1965, he took fire and was forced to bail out. He was captured and \nwas a prisoner of war for 7 years 4 months and 27 days, serving most of \nhis time in the infamous Hanoi Hilton. He was kept shackled for weeks \nat a time and spent more than 3 years in a darkened, solitary cell. In \nhis 1973 memoir, ``The Passing of the Night: Seven Years as a Prisoner \nof the North Vietnamese,'' he wrote, ``I did not ask God to take me out \nof it. I prayed he would give me strength to endure it.''\n  After his release in 1973, General Risner returned to the air in the \nF-4 Phantom II in the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing at MacDill Air Force \nBase, FL. He was later transferred to Cannon Air Force Base, NM, in \nFebruary 1974 to command the 832d Air Division, in which he flew the F-\n111 Aardvark. He was promoted to brigadier general in May 1974, became \nvice commander of the USAF Tactical Fighter Weapons Center at Nellis \nAir Force Base, NV, in 1975 and retired in 1976. He spent his \nretirement years involved in community service projects and spoke often \nbefore gatherings of veterans and other pilots.\n  He was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1974 and passed \naway in his sleep on October 22, 2013, at the age of 88.\n  I salute Gen Robbie Risner and all other American fighter aces who \nhave served our country so courageously and selflessly. It is my honor \nto be associated with the introduction of this legislation today which \nauthorizes a Congressional Gold Medal for U.S. Air Force fighter aces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/16/senate-section/article/S8840-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8840-S8841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN LILLEY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, any Senator will acknowledge that each \nof us is only as effective as the staff who support us. For nearly as \nlong as I have been a Member of this body, I have enjoyed the benefit \nof the considerable abilities and expertise of Stephen Lilley. \nStephen's tenure on my staff has drawn to a close, and the U.S. Senate \nloses a gifted lawyer and a dedicated public servant.\n  Stephen joined my team in 2008 as a Heyman Federal Public Service \nfellow and quickly demonstrated a keen understanding of the workings of \nthe Senate and of the Judiciary Committee. Unwilling to part with \neither his sharp legal analysis or his good humor, we brought him on \nboard full time as a counsel after his fellowship ended. After more \noutstanding work, he was soon promoted to chief counsel on the \nSubcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts and later the \nSubcommittee on Crime and Terrorism.\n  Stephen has ably staffed hundreds of committee hearings and markups \nand advised me on every issue under the wide-ranging jurisdiction of \nthe Judiciary Committee. In particular, he played a key role in the \ninvestigation of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts into the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques in \nthe aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; he helped \nme during the confirmation of two Justices to the Supreme Court; he \nworked with me to promote and defend the role of the civil jury; and he \nhas emerged as one of the Senate's leading experts on cybersecurity and \nintellectual property, facilitating immensely complex negotiations that \nbrought us to the brink of comprehensive cyber legislation.\n  In addition to producing great work, Stephen elevated the work of \nthose around him. His diligence, his ability to work well with other \noffices, his passion for doing right, and--not least--his sharp and dry \nwit, all made him a pleasure to work with. I particularly wish to thank \nhis wife Jaynie and his daughter Mary Win for supporting Stephen and \nfor sharing him with us.\n  Stephen's hard work brought him success before his arrival at the \nSenate, whether at Princeton University, where he graduated summa cum \nlaude; at Yale University, where he earned his law degree; or as a \nclerk to Judge Thomas Ambro on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit and Judge Jeremy Fogel on the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of California. I have no doubt he will find continued \nsuccess in all of his future endeavors.\n  Theodore Roosevelt reminded us of the credit due to the man who \nspends\n\n[[Page S8841]]\n\nhimself in a worthy cause. I gratefully credit Stephen Lilley for his \nexceptional service to the Senate, the people of Rhode Island, and the \nUnited States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/16/senate-section/article/S8841-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8841-S8844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-3770.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Audit the Pentagon Act of \n     2013''.\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 9 of Article I of the Constitution of the \n     United States requires all agencies of the Federal \n     Government, including the Department of Defense, to publish \n     ``a regular statement and account of the receipts and \n     expenditures of all public money''.\n       (2) Section 3515 of title 31, United States Code, requires \n     the agencies of the Federal Government, including the \n     Department of Defense, to present auditable financial \n     statements beginning not later than March 1, 1997. The \n     Department has not complied with this law.\n       (3) The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of \n     1996 (31 U.S.C. 3512 note) requires financial systems \n     acquired by the Federal Government, including the Department \n     of Defense, to be able to provide information to leaders to \n     manage and control the cost of Government. The Department has \n     not complied with this law.\n       (4) The financial management of the Department of Defense \n     has been on the ``High-Risk'' list of the Government \n     Accountability Office, which means that the Department is not \n     consistently able to ``control costs; ensure basic \n     accountability; anticipate future costs and claims on the \n     budget; measure performance; maintain funds control; [and] \n     prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse''.\n       (5) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2002 (Public Law 107-107) requires the Secretary of Defense \n     to report to Congress annually on the reliability of the \n     financial statements of the Department of Defense, to \n     minimize resources spent on producing unreliable financial \n     statements, and to use resources saved to improve financial \n     management policies, procedures, and internal controls.\n       (6) In 2005, the Department of Defense created a Financial \n     Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan, overseen by a \n     directorate within the office of the Under Secretary of \n     Defense (Comptroller), to improve Department business \n     processes with the goal of producing timely, reliable, and \n     accurate financial information that could generate an audit-\n     ready annual financial statement. In December 2005, that \n     directorate, known as the FIAR Directorate, issued the first \n     of a series of semiannual reports on the status of the \n     Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan.\n       (7) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2010 (Public Law 111-84) requires regular status reports on \n     the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan described \n     in paragraph (6), and codified as a statutory requirement the \n     goal of the Plan in ensuring that Department of Defense \n     financial statements are validated as ready for audit not \n     later than September 30, 2017. In addition, the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law \n     112-239) requires that the statement of budgetary resources \n     of the Department of Defense be validated as ready for audit \n     by not later than September 30, 2014.\n       (8) At a September 2010 hearing of the Senate, the \n     Government Accountability Office stated that past \n     expenditures by the Department of Defense of $5,800,000,000 \n     to improve financial information, and billions of dollars \n     more of anticipated expenditures on new information \n     technology systems for that purpose, may not suffice to \n     achieve full audit readiness of the financial statement of \n     the Department. At that hearing, the Government \n     Accountability Office could not predict when the Department \n     would achieve full audit readiness of such statements.\n       (9) At a 2013 hearing of the Senate, Secretary of Defense \n     Chuck Hagel affirmed his commitment to audit-ready budget \n     statements for the Department of Defense by the end of 2014, \n     and stated that he ``will do everything he can to fulfill \n     this commitment''.

Mr. President, I spoke a bit earlier in relation to the \nnomination of Jeh Johnson to be Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  It is an important department with 240,000 employees, and includes \nthe Coast Guard, the Secret Service, TSA airport personnel, and ICE \nofficers who enforce immigration laws, our Border Patrol officers who \npatrol the border, the Citizenship and Immigration Service which \nevaluates and approves or disapproves people who apply for admission to \nthe United States, and agency after agency.\n  I have watched many of these complex departments and do not believe \nthey have been brought together to the degree they ought to be, and it \nhasn't had the kind of strong leadership it needs to have to be \neffective for the American people.\n  In addition to that, we have the difficulty that this administration \nhas basically told the immigration component of Homeland Security--one \nof its largest components--that they shouldn't do their job. They have \nbeen blocked and instructed not to enforce the law to a degree that \nProfessor Turley said represents an unacceptable alteration of the \nMadisonion understanding of the separation of powers.\n  In other words, the President is charged with the duty to enforce \nlaw, to see that the laws of the United States are faithfully enforced. \nHe is not given the power to flatly direct his officers not to enforce \nlaws of the Congress.\n  I am sure Mr. Johnson has many abilities. He is apparently a Wall \nStreet lawyer, a big political campaigner, has raised a bunch of money\n\n[[Page S8863]]\n\nand gave money to President Obama. He is a close confidant of President \nObama, was made the legal counsel for the Department of Defense--about \nwhich he said he was President Obama's man at the Department of \nDefense.\n  But he has not had any real leadership and management experience. He \nshows no interest in or desire to seize control of this Department, to \nmake it better, and to honor the officers who are a part of it and who \nserve their country often at risk every day, only to find that high \npolitical appointees in that Department undermine their ability to \nenforce the law and place their lives at risk.\n  You say: Jeff, that is an exaggeration. I am going to talk tonight in \nsome detail about some of the things this administration has done to \nundermine, block, and frustrate the ability of the fine law enforcement \nofficers--ICE officers, customs enforcement officers, Border Patrol \nofficers--who serve our country on a daily basis at risk to themselves, \nand it is not good.\n  A lot of people might not know that I was a Federal prosecutor and \nAttorney General of Alabama. Back in the mid-1990s when I was traveling \nthe State, I would meet the law enforcement officers and I would ask \nthem: What happens when you apprehend somebody in Alabama whom you \nidentify as illegally in the country?\n  Their answer was: Nothing. We let them go. We are told by the Federal \nofficials--who are the only ones that can deport anybody: If you don't \napprehend at least 15, don't bother to call us. So we just don't do it.\n  People are shocked at that. I would have town meetings and I would \nask people: What happens if your local police officer or local sheriff \napprehends somebody? They think they turn them over to the Federal \nGovernment for deportation, and that did not happen. It hasn't happened \nin a long time. But it has gotten worse than that.\n  The argument was: What we would do is enforce the workplace and we \nwould keep people from getting a job. If they don't have a job, they \nwon't come to America. We are going to enforce that. That has never \nbeen effectively enforced. That is just talk. It is not happening. At a \ntime of extraordinarily high unemployment, at a time when wages for \nworking Americans are sliding downward and not going up, and when every \nmonth that goes by we see large numbers of people hired part time \nrather than full time, all of this is happening while we are totally \nunwilling to take any action which would stop illegal workers from \ngetting jobs that Americans need.\n  We have American people that are hurting. We have American people \nunemployed. We have children and grandchildren and grandparents and \nmothers and fathers unemployed or only in part-time jobs. Over the last \n5 or 6 years, the number of people who have gotten jobs in America is \nabout 1.9 million over that period. That is how many immigrant workers \nentered the country. So the net improvement in employment in a \nmathematic sense has all gone to foreign workers who come to America--\nlegally or illegally.\n  So we need to be serious about this. We need to ask ourselves: Don't \nwe have an obligation to the American people to faithfully enforce the \nlaws, and to end the lawlessness and create a good immigration system \nwhich serves the interests of America and of American workers? I think \nwe do. I think that is what the American people want. I think they are \nentitled to that, and I want to show tonight how far away from that we \nare today.\n  The reason I am talking about this is we just confirmed Jeh Johnson \nas the Secretary of Homeland Security. He is the political confidant of \nthe President, and the President has no intention of enforcing the laws \nand has created a circumstance which is not good for this country.\n  Mr. Johnson, in my brief conversation with him, seemed like a nice \nenough gentleman. But I asked him: Why do you want this job, Mr. \nJohnson? You say you believe in law and you believe the laws ought to \nbe enforced. If you take this job, you are not going to be allowed to \nenforce the laws. You just need to know that.\n  I asked him, was he going to be willing to confront the President and \ntell him: You can't do this. I am a sworn officer here. I have \nthousands of law enforcement officers working for me out there on the \nstreets, out there dealing directly with people in violation of \nAmerican law, and I can't keep telling them not to do what they are \nrequired to do. I don't have the ability to deny them the right to \nenforce the laws of the United States.\n  This issue was defined early in the Obama administration.\n  President Bush was slow. But President Bush, after comprehensive \nreform in 2006 and 2007 failed, seemed to get it. So he called out the \nNational Guard, which made a positive difference. He stepped up \nenforcement. We finally began to build fencing, and he began to have a \npretty good bit of workplace enforcement. They raided some chicken \nplants in Georgia, and they found hundreds of people working here \nillegally.\n  What happened in Georgia was they had to raise pay to get legal \nimmigrants to come to work. What is wrong with that? Pay is too low in \nAmerica. We need higher wages.\n  So the people during the campaign who had been interfacing with the \nObama administration obviously had a deal. They were told they were \ngoing to stop these kinds of enforcement and they weren't going to do \nthem anymore. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in \nWashington State was a completely justified enforcement action. But \npro-amnesty groups complained. As a result, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity Janet Napolitano--who Mr. Johnson will replace--vowed that she \nwould get to the bottom of this problem.\n  An article in the Washington Times quoted a Homeland Security \nofficial as saying: The Secretary is ``not happy about it.'' Instead of \nenforcing the law, the Secretary investigated the law officers who were \nsimply doing their duty--apparently in response to some demands of \nadvocacy groups who had been pushing them during the campaign.\n  Then Esther Olavarria, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, said on a phone call with employers and pro-amnesty groups: \nWe are not doing raids or audits under this administration.\n  This statement symbolized the end of workplace enforcement in \nAmerica, and it is in violation of law. Workers are not entitled to \nwork illegally in American factories or plants. Where did this come \nfrom? How did it ever get to be the idea that Americans can have their \njobs taken by people illegally in the country, and you can't ever do an \ninvestigation or enforcement action and remove people who are illegally \nhere and not authorized to work?\n  Then, in 2010, the administration began implementing its plan to \ndismantle the immigration law enforcement system as we know it.\n  On May 19, 2010, in an interview with the Chicago tribune, then-\nDirector of ICE John Morton announced that ICE may not even process or \naccept the transfer of illegal aliens to the agency's custody by \nArizona officials. Arizona, of course, was facing a very serious \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, on May 27, 2010, an internal ICE email revealed that \ntop officials declared that the low-risk immigration detainees would be \nable to have far greater visitation rights, with visitors staying an \nunlimited amount of time during a 12-hour window--which can really make \nmaintaining order at a detention facility difficult--and also that \nthey, the detainees, would be given access to unmonitored phone lines. \nThe mayor of your town, who is in jail over tax evasion, doesn't get \nunmonitored phone line use, but apparently illegal aliens do. They get \nemail, free Internet calling, movie nights, bingo, arts and crafts, \ndance and cooking classes, tutoring and computer training. All of these \nare for people who have been apprehended while illegally in the \ncountry. It really should be on a fast turnaround to be returned to the \ncountry from which they came.\n  On June 25, 2010, the National ICE Council, which is the union that \nrepresents more than 7,000 fine ICE officers, cast a unanimous vote. \nThey voted ``no confidence'' in their Director, John Morton. According \nto the union, the vote reflected ``the growing dissatisfaction among \nICE employees and union leaders that Director Morton\n\n[[Page S8864]]\n\nhad abandoned the agency's core mission of enforcing United States \nimmigration laws and enforcing public safety and has instead directed \ntheir attention to campaigning for programs and policies relating to \namnesty.''\n  I have been here in the Senate now for going on 17 years and I am not \naware of a major governmental employee union voting ``no confidence'' \nin its boss, particularly when it deals with the simple policies of law \nand enforcement, not even relating to some workplace rule or complaint.\n  In August 2010 top ICE officials began circulating a draft policy \nthat would significantly limit the circumstances under which ICE could \ndetain illegal aliens. In effect, ICE agents were no longer authorized \nto pick up an illegal alien for illegally entering the country or for \npossessing false identification documents. False documents? You go to \nthe bank or you go to get on an airplane and you use a false document, \nsomebody is going to prosecute you. But if you are, apparently, a \nnoncitizen who entered the country illegally, you are given immunity by \nthe administration. Why? Because they do not want to see the law \nenforced. That is the reason. They basically have made that decision. \nUnder the new policy, illegal aliens could only be detained if other \nlaw enforcement agencies made an arrest for a specific criminal \nviolation. This was the beginning of what would become known as \nadministrative amnesty.\n  Then in December 2010 a Washington Post article on internal ICE \nemails and communications reported that ICE had padded its deportation \nstatistics. Many of you have heard that the administration claims they \ndeported far more people than before; therefore, they should be \napplauded for being effective law enforcement officers. But it is a \nfact that those numbers were padded and exaggerated. According to the \nWashington Post article, ICE included 19,422 removals in fiscal year \n2010 that were actually removals from fiscal year 2009.\n  We have had a problem in this country. There is a growing concern \nabout this administration not telling the truth. Their philosophy seems \nto be, we say whatever is convenient at the time, and when we get \ncaught we do not worry about it, we just keep right on going and our \nfriendly press will ignore it. But it is beginning to bite now. People \nare getting tired of this.\n  This is a deliberate--by 19,000--misrepresentation of the number of \nremovals.\n  The article also described how ICE extended a Mexican repatriation \nprogram beyond its normal operation date, adding 6,500 to the final \nremoval numbers--again, making them look better than they were.\n  In a March 2, 2011 memo, ICE Director Morton outlined new enforcement \npriorities and encouraged agents not to enforce the law against most \nillegal aliens and to only take action against those who meet certain \npriorities.\n  On July 17, 2011, ICE Director Morton issued a second memorandum \nfurther directing ICE agents to refrain from enforcing the law against \ncertain segments of the illegal alien population--criteria similar to \nthat under the DREAM Act--despite having no legal or congressional \nauthority to do so and despite the fact that Congress had explicitly \nrejected the DREAM Act three times. This is a matter of serious \nconstitutional import.\n  On June 17, 2011, ICE Director Morton issued a third memo instructing \nICE personnel to consider refraining from enforcing the law against \nindividuals engaged in a protected activity related to civil or other \nrights. So if you are in the country illegally and, for example, union \norganizing or complaining to authorities about employment \ndiscrimination or housing conditions, you can be protected from being \ndeported. Anybody who is in a nonfrivolous dispute with an employer, \nlandlord, or contractor seems to be eligible to avoid the consequences \nof being in the country illegally.\n  On June 23, 2011, the ICE Agents and Officers' Union again expressed \noutrage over Director Morton's actions, noting that since the \nadministration was ``unable to pass its immigration agenda through \nlegislation, it is now implementing it through agency policy.'' That is \nexactly what they did. Everybody who knows enough about what is going \non knows that is what they did. But somehow, like the frog in the ever-\nwarming water, we are oblivious to the consequences when an executive \nbranch declares and directs a law to be enforced and carried out that \nwas never passed and in fact was rejected in recent years three \nseparate times.\n  The ICE officers association accused the appointees of working hand \nin hand with the open borders lobby--they see this on a daily basis--\nwhile excluding its officers, the ICE officers, from the policy \ndevelopment process.\n\n  In effect, ICE officers allege that the political appointees at ICE \nwere advancing the agenda of those here illegally and maneuvering \nagainst their own law enforcement officers trying to do their duty--to \nenforce the law and end the illegality in America. That is exactly what \nthey said was happening, and that is exactly what is happening, \ncolleagues.\n  On June 27, 2011, an internal memorandum revealed that ICE officers \nattempted to publicly distance themselves from the administrative \namnesty policies and deny that they ever existed after the Houston \nChronicle exposed the Department of Homeland Security directive to \nreview and dismiss valid deportation cases then in process.\n  On August 1, 2011, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit in Federal \ncourt to stop Alabama's law that was designed to assist the Federal \nGovernment in identifying and bringing forth to the Federal officials \npeople in the country illegally.\n  On August 18, 2011, Secretary Napolitano announced that DHS was \nreviewing all pending and incoming deportation cases to stop \nproceedings against those illegal aliens who were not DHS priorities.\n  On September 28, of 2011, at a roundtable with amnesty advocates, \nPresident Obama admitted that his deportation statistics were \nmisleading. He said:\n\n       The statistics are actually a little deceptive because what \n     we've been doing is . . . apprehending folks at the borders \n     and sending them back. That is counted as a deportation even \n     though they may have only been held for a day or 48 hours.\n\n  That is pretty interesting. So the President is meeting with amnesty \nadvocates, and he is admitting this to them but not to the American \npeople. He told the American people they had an enhanced number of \ndeportations. But when he met with the amnesty people to assuage their \ncomplaints that too many people were being deported, he said the \nnumbers were not correct.\n  We need the President of the United States to look the group in the \neye and say: If you come to America illegally, expect to be deported if \nwe apprehend you. What else should he say? He is the chief law \nenforcement of America. He is charged with ensuring that the laws of \nthe United States are faithfully executed.\n  On October 12, in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, \nDirector Morton admits that Cecilia Munoz, a former senior vice \npresident of the National Council of La Raza and now assistant to the \nPresident and Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, \nassisted in the preparation of the administrative amnesty memorandum.\n  La Raza has been awfully aggressive on these issues. They have every \nright to be aggressive, but I have to tell you their positions are \nnowhere near anything that comes close to being an advocate for a \nlawful system of immigration in America. They want the lawlessness to \ncontinue.\n  On October 18, 2011, ICE refused to take any action after the Santa \nClara County, CA, Board of Supervisors voted to stop using county funds \nto honor ICE detainers except in limited circumstances.\n  Let me tell you about this. I have been an attorney general and a \nU.S. attorney. A detainer is a very useful law enforcement tool that is \ncritical for harmonious relationships between various agencies. If \nsomebody arrests somebody and they are serving time for drug dealing or \nburglary and another jurisdiction has a charge against him, they place \na detainer against him at that jail. As soon as they finish their term, \nthey are not released; they are turned over to the agency that has \nanother charge pending against them.\n  So the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors voted not to allow the \nFederal Government to place detainers on people in their jail who were \nhere in the country illegally and voted, in effect, not to turn them \nover, as all law\n\n[[Page S8865]]\n\nenforcement officers do and have done for decades.\n  So ICE didn't do anything about it. They still send them Federal \nmoney for law enforcement. They have things that they could do. They \njust went along with it because I guess they don't care.\n  On October 19, ICE refused to act after the mayor of District of \nColumbia, Vincent Gray, issued an order to prevent the DC police from \nenforcing U.S. immigration law. Among other things, the order prohibits \nall public safety agencies from inquiring about an individual's \nimmigration status--they can't even inquire about it--or from \ncontacting ICE if there is no nexus to a direct criminal investigation \nother than immigration.\n  The District of Columbia knows better than that. ICE says their \nofficers can't even inquire to see if somebody is illegally in the \ncountry? That is a stretch. That is unacceptable. We ought to cut off \nfunds for cities that refuse to at least conduct minimal cooperation \nwith Federal law enforcement.\n  October 31, 2011, the Justice Department filed a suit against South \nCarolina to block their immigration law designed to help the Federal \nGovernment enforce immigration laws. They had plenty of time to sue \nStates and other entities who want to help them enforce the laws. They \nhad plenty of time also to meet with amnesty groups but no time \nwhatsoever to meet with these law officers and find out what their \nconcerns are or to draft policies that would help us to be more \neffective.\n  On November 7, 2011, USCIS issued a memo stating that USCIS will no \nlonger issue ``notices to appear'' in immigration court to illegal \naliens who do not meet administration priorities. That is a major step \nbackward.\n  On November 22, the Justice Department filed suit against Utah's \nimmigration enforcement system. They have plenty of time to sue Utah, \nwhich would like them to help enforce the law.\n  On November 22, ICE refused to act after Mayor Michael Bloomberg \nsigned a measure ordering all New York City jails to ignore certain ICE \ndetainers issued to deport illegal aliens from those jails. So the \nmayor of New York issues an order not to honor the detainers placed \nthere by the Federal Government--the U.S. government.\n  Mr. Bloomberg is spending millions of dollars of his billion-dollar \nwealth to lobby the House to pass an amnesty bill. It is his money; I \nguess he can spend it where he wants to. But just because he has made \n$1 billion, I don't think it suggests to me that he has any better idea \nabout how to run the immigration system of the United States than I do, \nsince I spent 14 years dealing with Federal law enforcement.\n\n  On December 15, 2011, DHS rescinded Maricopa County, Arizona's 287(g) \nagreement, a cooperative agreement whereby local law enforcement \nreceived training in identifying and apprehending illegal aliens and \nhandling them in a way preferably consistent with law--being very \ncareful in how we treat people who are detained in a decent and very \nfine way. The 287(g) Program is a very fine program. It really is good. \nAnd it is a great disappointment to me that this administration has \nbasically killed it.\n  I remember Alabama was the first State in the Nation that \nparticipated in the 287(g) Program. A certain number of officers--not a \nhuge number--came to a training center for several weeks and were \ntrained on how to be of valuable assistance to the Federal officers to \nmaximize their ability to be effective. This has been canceled. It \nbasically ended under this administration.\n  Director Morton told a Maricopa County attorney that ICE will no \nlonger respond to calls from Maricopa County sheriff's officers \ninvolving traffic stops, civil infractions, or other minor offenses. \nDHS's legal reasoning is unclear given that Federal law requires the \nFederal Government to respond to inquiries by law enforcement agencies \nto verify immigration status. In other words, local officers apprehend \nsomebody and they make an inquiry as to whether this person is lawfully \nin the country and they have a right to be responded to. Apparently, \nthey have chosen not to respond to that basic law enforcement request.\n  On December 29, 2011, ICE announced the creation of a 24-hour hotline \nfor illegal alien detainees to be staffed by the Law Enforcement \nSupport Center--the same organization that ICE had already stated was \nunderstaffed as far as keeping up with the immigration status check \nrequests for State and local law enforcement. They were getting lots of \nrequests for statuses on people, about whether they were legally or \nillegally here, from local law enforcement. They don't have enough time \nto do that, but now these officers have been given the extra duty of \nhaving a 24-hour hotline for illegal alien detainees. Who are we \nserving here?\n  ICE then revised its detainer form to include a new provision which \nstates ICE should consider this request for a detainer operative ``only \nupon the subject's conviction'' of an offense. It completely ignores \nthe fact that presence in the United States of America illegally is a \nviolation of federal law.\n  On January 3, 2012, there was a report by the inspector general that \nrevealed that USCIS officials or top political officials pressured the \nemployees to approve applications that should have been denied and that \nemployees believed they did not have enough time to complete the \ninterviews of applicants, ``leaving ample opportunity for critical \ninformation to be overlooked.'' The 911 Commission said people should \nbe interviewed face-to-face, but that idea has completely collapsed \ntoday.\n  On January 10, 2012, the President promoted Cecelia Munoz to be the \nnew Director of his Domestic Policy Council. She previously served as \nsenior vice president of La Raza. We need an objective person in that \nposition, not an advocate for undermining the law. I am not saying she \nis a bad person. She is perfectly legitimate to be an advocate for \namnesty or open borders. It is a free country. But she ought not to be \nput in a top position where the duty is to enforce the law.\n  On January 17, 2012, DHS stopped the rollout of the Secure \nCommunities Act in Alabama, according to a DHS email, because the \nadministration disagrees with Alabama's immigration law. They just quit \ncooperating.\n  In January 2012, ICE attorneys in Denver and in Baltimore recommended \nthat the agency voluntarily close 1,667 removal cases, resulting in the \nrelease of illegal aliens already in proceedings without consequence of \ntheir violation of immigration law.\n  On January 19, 2012, the President issued an Executive order waiving \ncertain screening safeguards, allowing those applying for nonimmigrant \nvisas--people who come here to work only--to obtain them more easily \nfrom China and Brazil. On the same day, the State Department announced \nit will waive the longstanding statutory requirement of in-person \ninterviews by a consular officer.\n  On February 7, 2012, ICE announced the creation of a public advocate \nwho is to serve as a point of contact for aliens in removal \nproceedings, community advocacy groups, and others who have concerns, \nquestions, and recommendations they would like to raise about the \nenforcement of laws and amnesty efforts.\n  In February 2012, the President revealed in his budget a proposal to \ncut funding for ICE and the 287(g) Program, effectively gutting the \nprogram.\n  On April 17, 2012, the administration announced it would reduce \nNational Guard troops stationed at the border from 1,200 to 300. Is \nthis an action of an administration that seems to be interested in \nseeing that we have a lawful system of immigration we can be proud of, \na legal system that promotes the interests of the United States of \nAmerica? Are we at a point in time where we are undermining law?\n  I have about half of these done so far, and I could continue. It goes \non and on and on. It is a consistent trend and agenda. It is basically, \nif you don't grant amnesty, Congress, I am not going to enforce the \nlaw. Just forget it. I am going to direct my officers to do what I want \nthem to do, not what the law of the United States requires them to do. \nIt is a deep and fundamental challenge to the very integrity of \nAmerican constitutional order.\n  People say: Jeff, you are exaggerating.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about a recent House Judiciary hearing that \nwas held on the President's constitutional duty to faithfully execute \nthe laws. Chairman Goodlatte summarized the reason for the hearing as \nfollows:\n\n\n[[Page S8866]]\n\n\n       The Obama administration has ignored the Constitution's \n     carefully balanced separation of powers and unilaterally \n     granted itself the extra constitutional authority to amend \n     the laws and to waive or suspend their enforcement. This raw \n     assertion of authority goes well beyond the executive power \n     granted to the President and specifically violates the \n     Constitution's command that the President is to take care \n     that the laws be faithfully executed. The President's \n     encroachment into Congress's sphere of power is not a \n     transgression that should be taken lightly. As English \n     historian Edward Gibbon famously observed regarding the fall \n     of the Roman Empire, the principles of a free constitution \n     are irrevocably lost when the legislative power is dominated \n     by the executive.\n\n  From ObamaCare to immigration, the current administration is picking \nand choosing which laws to enforce. So this is correct. I believe \nChairman Goodlatte is discussing an important issue.\n  What about the testimony of the witnesses at that hearing? It was \nstunning. One witness, Professor Jonathan Turley, well known throughout \nthe country, writes a lot in publications and legal journals. He is the \nShapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington \nUniversity Law School and is a nationally recognized constitutional \nscholar. He said he is a supporter of President Obama's policies and \nvoted for him. But I want you to hear this, colleagues. Professor \nTurley, at the hearing, said this:\n\n       I believe the president has exceeded his brief. The \n     president is required to faithfully execute the laws. He's \n     not required to enforce all laws equally or commit the same \n     resources to them. But I believe the president has crossed \n     the constitutional line in some of these areas.\n\n  (Ms. WARREN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. He goes on--this is a direct quote--\n\n       This goes to the very heart of what is the Madisonian \n     system. If a president can unilaterally change the meaning of \n     laws in substantial ways or refuse to enforce them, it takes \n     offline that very thing that stabilizes our system.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       I believe the members will loathe the day that they allow \n     that to happen.\n\n  He is talking about Members of Congress. ``I believe the members [of \nCongress] will loathe the day that they allow that to happen.''\n  He goes on:\n\n       This will not be our last president. There will be more \n     presidents who will claim the same authority.\n       When I teach constitutional law, I often ask my students, \n     what is the limiting principle of your argument? When that \n     question is presented to this White House, too often it's \n     answered in the first person, that the president is the \n     limiting principle or at least the limiting person. We can't \n     rely on that type of assurance in our system.\n\n  That is what Professor Turley said, who voted for President Obama and \nis a well-known legal scholar. That is dramatic testimony and we need \nto listen to it. I am hearing it from my constituents daily. They think \nthis administration is not telling the truth on a regular basis. They \ncannot imagine how we can pass a health care law, and the President is \njust going and picking and choosing what parts of it he wants to go \nforward, what parts he wants to delay. How can this happen? Is this a \nlegal system or not?\n  Mr. Turley goes on:\n\n       The problem of what the president is doing is that he is \n     not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he \n     is becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to \n     avoid: that is, the concentration of power in any single \n     branch. This Newtonian orbit that the three branches exist in \n     is a delicate one, but it is designed to prevent this type of \n     concentration.\n\n  Wow. This is very strong. Then, when Professor Turley was asked \nwhether the President has acted contrary to the Constitution, Professor \nTurley answered in the affirmative. He said further:\n\n       I really have great trepidation over where we are heading \n     because we are creating a new system here, something that is \n     not what was designed. We have this rising fourth branch in a \n     system that's tripartite. The center of gravity is shifting, \n     and that makes it unstable. And within that system you have \n     the rise of an uber presidency. There could be no greater \n     danger for individual liberty, and I really think that the \n     framers would be horrified by that shift because everything \n     they've dedicated themselves to was creating this orbital \n     balance, and we've lost it. . . .\n\n  That makes the hair stand on the back of my neck. This goes to the \ncore of our government. Are we a legal system or not? If we start \neroding these classical principles of law, duty, and responsibility--\nthe appropriate balance between the three branches of government--we \nhave done something that is important. As Professor Turley said, we are \nundermining the orbital balance. Indeed, he said we have lost it--\nProfessor Turley, not me.\n  Professor Turley goes on to say:\n\n       It's not prosecutorial discretion to go into a law and say \n     an entire category of people will no longer be subject to the \n     law. That's a legislative decision.\n\n  It is a legislative decision, not the President's decision. The \nlegislature represents the people. Over a period of years, people are \nelected to this body and the House.\n  It goes on. Professor Turley said:\n\n       Prosecutorial discretion is a case-by-case decision that is \n     made by the Department of Justice. When the Department of \n     Justice starts to say, we're going to extend that to whole \n     sections of law, then they are engaging in a legislative act, \n     not an act of prosecutorial discretion. Wherever the line is \n     drawn, it's got to be drawn somewhere from here. It can't \n     include categorical rejections of the application of the law \n     to millions of people. . . .\n\n  Great Scott. He is so correct. Prosecutors have discretion. They do \nnot have to prosecute every case that comes before them. But the \nPresident does not have power just to eviscerate whole sections of law \nthat affect millions of people. Professor Turley hit that exactly \ncorrect. He goes on to say:\n\n       Many of these questions are not close, in my view. The \n     president is outside the line. . . . And that's where we have \n     the most serious constitutional crisis, I view, in my \n     lifetime, and that is, this body is becoming less and less \n     relevant.\n\n  He is talking to the House, the House of Representatives. You are \nbecoming less and less relevant. He considers this to be ``the most \nserious constitutional crisis . . . in my lifetime.'' We sit here \noblivious to what has been happening. I have talked about it an awful \nlot, but I guess I have not been very effective. Professor Turley's \narguments and remarks just hammer home how serious it is, this question \nwe are dealing with.\n  So he goes on to say this:\n\n       I believe that [Congress] is facing a critical crossroads \n     in terms of its continued relevance in this process. What \n     this body cannot become is a debating society where it can \n     issue rules and laws that are either complied with or not \n     complied with by the president. I think that's where we are . \n     . . [A] president cannot ignore an express statement on \n     policy grounds. . . .\n\n  He says the President cannot ignore an express act, statement of law \nbecause he has a different policy view.\n  Now, does anybody contend that he can? I would like to see them send \nme a note on it. Any Member of this body who thinks the President of \nthe United States can ignore an express statement of law because he \njust disagrees with it on policy grounds--I would like to hear them \ndefend that issue or explain their position on it.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       [I]n terms of the institutional issue . . . look around \n     you. Is this truly the body that existed when it was formed?\n\n  He is talking to the House now.\n\n       Does it have the same gravitational pull and authority that \n     was given to it by its framers? You're keepers of this \n     authority. You took an oath to uphold it. And the framers \n     assumed that you would have the institutional wherewithal \n     and, frankly, ambition to defend the turf that is the \n     legislative branch.\n\n  Isn't that true?\n\n       . . . the framers assumed that you would have the \n     institutional wherewithal and, frankly, ambition to defend \n     the turf that is the legislative branch.\n  We are sitting here, we had the majority leader stand before the \nPresiding Officer and break the rules of the Senate to amend the Senate \nrules just a few weeks ago. It was a stunning development. This is \nThird World stuff. This is not the United States of America, a \nconstitutional Republic that I served as a prosecutor year after year.\n  We took so much pride, my staff and I, in trying to make sure nobody \nwas given an advantage or disadvantage based on status or wealth or \nrace, intelligence or background or whatever advantage they had: equal \njustice under the law. We enforced the law whether anybody would have \nvoted for it or not had we been in Congress. It was passed by Congress, \nwe enforced the law. At that same hearing, Nicholas Rosenkranz, a \nprofessor of law at Georgetown University Law Center and the author of \nthe single most downloaded article about constitutional interpretation \nin the history of\n\n[[Page S8867]]\n\nthe social science research network, also testified before the House \nJudiciary Committee.\n  He stated that the President's Constitutional duty to take care that \nthe laws be faithfully executed ``is not optional; it is mandatory,'' \nand that President Obama's ``wholesale suspension of law . . . is the \nparadigm case of a `take care' clause violation.''\n  He further testified:\n\n       What's striking about this is the president's decision to \n     enforce the immigration laws as though the DREAM Act had been \n     enacted, when in fact it has not. . . . Rather than declining \n     to comply with a duly enacted statute, the president is \n     complying meticulously, but with a bill that never became \n     law.\n\n  So they offered a bill. It was rejected by the Congress. The \nPresident is almost to the letter enforcing a bill rejected by the \npeople's representatives. Professor Rosenkranz goes on to say:\n\n       Congress has repeatedly considered . . . the DREAM Act. The \n     President favors this act. Congress has repeatedly declined \n     to pass it. So the President simply announced that he would \n     enforce the Immigration and Nationality Act as though it had \n     been--as though the DREAM Act had been enacted. To put the \n     point another way, the president's duty is to take care that \n     the laws be faithfully executed, laws capital L, not those \n     bills that fail to become law, like the DREAM Act.\n\n  I think this is a serious matter and I think Professor Rosenkranz \nhits it directly. Professor Rosenkranz was in agreement with Professor \nTurley that ``prosecutorial discretion is one thing.''\n  It is real.\n\n       But wholesale suspension of law is quite something else, \n     and that is what has happened under ObamaCare. Likewise, in \n     the immigration context, kind of case-by-case prosecutorial \n     discretion is one thing, but a blanket policy that the \n     immigration act will not apply to 1.8 million people, that's \n     quite something different. This is a scale of decision-making \n     that is not within the traditional conception of \n     prosecutorial discretion.\n\n  That is certainly true. It is hard to believe we are here. I think we \nare here because in the great law schools of America and the top levels \nof our academic world in our new media and so forth, we have moved in \nsort of a postmodern world in which words do not have meaning. They are \nsubject to being altered whenever they choose to fit the mood of a \nmoment.\n  The President said, when he nominated people for the Supreme Court, \nhe wanted nominees who would show empathy. What is empathy? It is not \nlaw. Is it politics? Is it bias? Is it personal opinion? Our system is \nbased on law, not empathy, not bias, not politics, not ideology. This \nis a serious matter. Chairman Goodlatte then interjected:\n\n       In fact the president has taken it a step further and has \n     actually given legal documents to the people in that \n     circumstance, well beyond simply deciding not to leave them \n     there and not prosecute them, but to actually enable their \n     violation of the law by giving them documents to help them \n     evade the problems that ensue from living in the country that \n     they're not lawfully present in.\n       Professor Rosenkranz replied, ``Quite right.'' This matter \n     is not going away. We are going to deal with it. I truly \n     believe the American people expect this government of theirs \n     that works for them to produce an immigration system, a legal \n     system that involves ObamaCare and other policies that is \n     committed to law and not to the feelings of the chief \n     executive and not to his policy preferences.\n\n  We avoid that or we have a serious matter in this country that goes \nto the heart of the strength of this Republic. You could sap that \nstrength, erode the power of our legal system. The legal system, in my \nopinion, is the greatest strength this Nation has.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/16/senate-section/article/S8867-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
