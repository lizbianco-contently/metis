Mr. President, I wish a happy baseball opening day to \neveryone. Actually, it started last night, not today, but it sounds \nbetter to do it during the daytime.\n  Although it is opening day for Major League Baseball, it also happens \nto be the last day for Americans to sign up for ObamaCare, the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  To date there are over 10 million newly-insured Americans benefiting \nfrom the health care law now in effect, and there are millions more who \nhave changed their insurance because of this legislation. So it is \nclear Americans are signing up for this quality health care in record \nnumbers--and that is an understatement.\n  I also am very happy we have been able to come to an agreement on the \nMedicare physician payment system. It is a 12-month fix. We need to \ntake action on this to ensure that Medicare patients will be able to \nsee their doctors. But the fact remains this legislation is not \nperfect. It is not ideal. I wish we could have followed the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Wyden, who came in kind of late. Most of \nthe work was done by Ambassador Baucus before he came in. But he worked \nreally hard, and he wants to pay for it in a way I think is \nappropriate--to use the unspent money we have from the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, called OCO, the Overseas Contingency Operations fund. But \nat this\n\n[[Page S1840]]\n\nstage it doesn't appear it is now going to happen.\n  This legislation wasn't some last-minute deal. Senator Baucus worked \non this for months, and it is the basis for what we are going to do \nhere today. There were tough negotiations. Unfortunately, the parties \ncould not come to an agreement on what a permanent fix should be. I \nsaid that I believe a permanent fix should be what Chairman Wyden \nsuggested and continues to suggest.\n  But House Republicans, though, chose to pass a partisan bill and \nincrease the number of uninsured Americans and raised the cost of \npremiums. I believe we should repeal the defective payment system \nwithout increasing costs and without limiting access to quality health \ncare. We need to restore sanity to the Medicare payment system without \ncutting benefits to seniors and without shifting the financial burden \nto hospital and other providers. We have done enough of that already. \nBut right now we don't have the votes to do what would be the better \nthing to do.\n  So for millions of elderly Americans and their doctors, this fix is \ngood news. It means the promise of accessible, quality health care to \nour Nation's seniors is being honored again--this time for another \nyear. So while I am pleased with this temporary patch, I hope it is our \nlast patch.\n  In the meantime, I extend my appreciation to Senator Wyden, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, for his work to bring stability to \nthe Medicare payment system. From the moment he assumed the gavel to \nbecome chairman of that committee, he hit the ground running on this \nissue, as well as reforming the entire Tax Code. As we speak he is also \ndoing some good work on the so-called tax extenders. It is my \nunderstanding he is meeting with his committee members today.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Extension\n\n  After confirming this long-awaited judge for the Ninth Circuit and \napproving a patch for the Medicare payment program, the Senate will \nturn to a long overdue extension of benefits for the long-term \nunemployed. This is a matter of really significant importance to \nmillions of Americans. We have waited 3 months since Republicans first \nfilibustered a bill to restore emergency benefits. More importantly, \nunemployed Americans have waited even longer. Since that filibuster, \nnearly 1 million more Americans have lost their benefits. That is \n300,000 people a month who have been thrust into poverty not knowing \nhow they will pay their bills.\n  I received a letter recently from a Nevadan named Jane who pleaded \nfor Congress to extend benefits for the long-term unemployed. She is \nwhat we would call an older American, an older Nevadan. She didn't make \nthe plea for herself. It was for her son. She said:\n\n       Please do all in your power to get this matter resolved. . \n     . . My son has been looking since May of last year. He held \n     his last job for 26 years and doesn't have a lot of \n     experience in other fields. I cannot continue to help him. I \n     lost my husband last July and lost his Social Security. I \n     only have mine now. Please do what you can to help those who \n     are in this position.\n\n  So imagine an elderly woman, a widow, so desperate to assist her \nmiddle-aged son that she is using her meager Social Security check to \nhelp him get by. Now her own financial situation is in jeopardy.\n  Jane and her son have already seen what happens when much-needed \nunemployment benefits don't get extended. For Nevadans struggling to \npay their rent, to keep the lights on or to feed the kids, they have \nwaited long enough. But we know why Republicans prefer to wait. For \nmany of my colleagues across the aisle, waiting means doing nothing. So \nthe fact is the majority of Republicans here in Congress are simply \nopposed to helping the long-term unemployed. Most won't say so, but \nthat is the truth.\n  One GOP Congressman from California even said that an extension of \nunemployment benefits ``will encourage unemployment.'' That is a tough \none to follow. This elected Congressman believes that the half million \npeople in the State of California who had their unemployment benefits \nterminated actually prefer to be jobless. I don't think so.\n  Here in the Senate last Thursday only 10 out of 45 Republicans voted \nto help Democrats break the 3-month filibuster. In fact, the GOP \nSenators from the State with the third-highest population of eligible \nlong-term unemployed--Texas--both voted to block an extension of \nbenefits. It is as if they simply don't care that some of their own \nconstituents are teetering on the verge of indigence.\n  Notwithstanding this opposition to extending unemployment benefits, I \nam confident we will pass this bipartisan legislation in the Senate \nthis week here. Then, hopefully, the Republicans in the House will have \nsoft hearts and strong minds and allow this to pass over there. It is \nin their hands.\n  We hope they will be considerate to the roughly 2.8 million long-term \nunemployed across the country. Perhaps then these struggling Americans \nwill finally get the relief they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/31/senate-section/article/S1840-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I would now suggest the absence of a quorum and have the \ntime divided equally between both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, America's top priority is the same today \nas it was last year, the year before that, and the year before that: \nunemployment, jobs, and how to get this economy growing again.\n  Of course, these are concerns which transcend any kind of partisan \naffiliation. They transcend geographic and demographic boundaries. They \nare shared, of course, by Republicans, Democrats, Independents--\neveryone--people from all parts of our country.\n  But the sad fact is it has been almost 5 years since America's \nofficial economic recovery began and still too many people who want to \nwork can't find a job. There are still 3.8 million people who have been \nunemployed for more than 6 months, and the labor force participation \nrate remains stuck at 63 percent. Of course, those are the people who \ndon't even show up on the unemployment statistics because they have \ngiven up looking for work. This is what we talk about when we are \ntalking about the labor participation rate--the lowest number since 30 \nyears ago.\n  Since the current President took office, the average amount of time \nthe unemployed have been without a job has almost doubled, from less \nthan 20 weeks to more than 37 weeks. This is a shocking statistic.\n  So since President Obama has been in office, the average time people \nhave been unemployed--have been out of work--went from less than 20 \nweeks to now 37 weeks, and the number of people on food stamps has \nincreased from 32.2 million to nearly 46.8 million people.\n  As for median household income, it is now more than $2,400 lower than \nit was at the end of the recession in June of 2009. The President talks \na lot about\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\nincome inequality, but the problem is, it has gotten worse since he has \nbeen in office, not better.\n\n  We should be focused like a laser on things we might be able to do to \nset the stage to help the economy start growing again, because only \nwhen the economy grows do we see the unemployment numbers go down, do \nwe see the labor participation rate go up, and we see regular American \nfamilies have the opportunity to provide for themselves and to pursue \ntheir dreams. But right now that American dream is somewhat cloudy. \nMany people feel as though it is starting to pass them by, and that is \nthe American tragedy. So you would think that at a time when there is a \nbipartisan consensus we need to get the economy moving again, we need \nto get people back to work so they can provide for their families, that \nthere would be bipartisan agreement here in the Senate that anybody \nwith a good idea ought to step up, offer it, debate it, and let's vote \non it.\n  Well, unfortunately, the majority leader has a different point of \nview. He is refusing to let anyone on this side of the aisle offer any \nsuggestions in the form of amendments that actually might have a chance \nof improving the situation for people who are out of work or people \nlooking for jobs. Not only is the majority leader blocking votes on \nbills that would make it easier for Americans to find work, he is also \npromoting and defending policies that would actually discourage work. \nFor example, both the majority leader and President Obama are \nadvocating a minimum wage increase of 40 percent, while the \nCongressional Budget Office has told us it could destroy up to 1 \nmillion jobs.\n  Now the majority leader and the President may not agree with that \nestimate, but I will remind them of what Federal Reserve Chairwoman \nJanet Yellin said; she is President Obama's own appointee as Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board. She said she wouldn't want to argue with \nthe Congressional Budget Office's assessment about the number of people \nwho would be put out of work if you raised the minimum wage by 40 \npercent. For that matter, the evidence suggests that any increase in \nthe minimum wage would destroy jobs and do very little, if anything, to \nreduce poverty rates. The best thing we could do is to get out of the \nway and let the economy grow again by making the environment more \nconducive to the people who invest, take risks, and start businesses or \ngrow small businesses. That is the thing we could do that would help \npeople the most.\n  But in addition to the minimum wage increase, the majority leader and \nPresident Obama are pushing for yet another extension of long-term \nunemployment benefits, even though President Obama's own former chief \nWhite House economist has said that ``job search is inversely related \nto the generosity of unemployment benefits.'' So, in other words, \npeople react in situs, and when the government continues to pay \nunemployment benefits for people who are out of work, human nature is \nsuch that people are disincentivized to go back to work and look for \nwork on occasion.\n  We all recognize the importance of this safety net program, and the \ntruth is under the current law 26 weeks or 6 months are available for \nunemployment benefits. But under this administration we have seen \nunemployment benefits go from 6 months to 2 years. Two years after \npeople have been out of work and those benefits lapsed, we have done \nnothing to improve job training programs that would help match the \nskills of out-of-work Americans to the jobs that are out there which \npay good money--and I have seen many of them in my State, and I am sure \nthe Presiding Officer has as well. We have seen a lot of good jobs go \nwanting for lack of a skilled workforce to be able to perform those \njobs. So what we ought to be doing instead of extending unemployment \nbenefits is we ought to be focusing on how we can train workers and \nprovide them with the skills they need in order to qualify for those \ngood, high-paying jobs.\n  At a time when the American people are desperate for more jobs and \nmore work, the majority leader is steadfastly determined to pass \nlegislation which would disincentivize people from going back and \nlooking for work and would in fact discourage work and discourage job \ncreation. That is before we even get to ObamaCare, a law the \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated would effectively reduce the \nsize of America's labor force by 2.5 million people over the next \ndecade. Remarkably, I guess trying to spin it any way they could, the \nWhite House actually took the position that was actually a good thing \nbecause people would have more time off.\n  Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised. After all, this is the same \nadministration that unilaterally gutted the work requirements in the \n1996 welfare reform law, one of the most successful welfare reform laws \never passed. It is the same administration that refuses to approve the \nKeystone XL Pipeline, a project that would directly create thousands of \nnew jobs right here in the United States, and it is the same \nadministration that refuses to embrace progrowth tax reform.\n  America's corporate tax rate is the highest in the world, and yet the \nPresident said he won't enter negotiations to reduce those rates, to \neliminate double taxation so people will bring the money they earn \noverseas back here to hire more Americans and to build their businesses \nhere. The President won't do that without an agreement on this side of \nthe aisle to raise taxes, to raise revenue by $1 trillion. That is not \na bargain we are interested in negotiating. This is the same \nadministration that refuses to support energy, the energy renaissance \nwe have seen, and continues to support regulations which actually \nthreaten jobs and hurt families in return for meager or nonexistent \nbenefits.\n  As I have said before, this administration and its policies have \nbecome nothing less than a war on the American worker. I am not \nsuggesting that is their intention, but I am suggesting that is the \nresult.\n  If there is one thing we ought to all be able to agree upon it is \nthat work is about basic human dignity. It is about self-worth and \nself-reliance; it is about giving people the opportunity to reach their \nfull potential and to support their families. When the policies of the \nFederal Government actually discourage people from working, it makes it \nharder for teenagers to learn basic social skills and professional \nskills. It makes it harder for college graduates to utilize their \neducation and pay off their student loan debt. It makes it harder for \npeople of all backgrounds to start families. It makes it harder for \nmothers and fathers to gain the self-respect that comes from providing \nfor your own children.\n  It is bad enough that the President and the majority leader have \nembraced an agenda that is fundamentally antiwork. What makes it even \nmore outrageous is that this week the majority leader will deny the \nopportunity for anyone on this side of the aisle to offer any sort of \nconstructive suggestions about how to deal with that problem. He is \nrefusing to allow proposals that would actually encourage work and \nencourage job creation.\n  Here are just a few examples of the amendments and proposals that \nwould come from this side of the aisle if the majority leader--it is \nhis sole prerogative--would allow those amendments to be debated and \nvoted on by the Senate:\n  For example, the senior Senator from Maine has a bill that would \nrelieve the burden of ObamaCare on workers and businesses alike and \nrestore the traditional 40-hour workweek. This has been one of the \nprimary complaints of organized labor, some of the biggest supporters \nof ObamaCare. They said that in order to avoid the penalties that go \nalong with ObamaCare, many employers are moving people from full-time \nwork to part-time work. The amendment from the senior Senator from \nMaine, Senator Collins, would address that problem and fix it.\n  The senior Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, has a bill that would \nabolish the job-killing tax on medical innovation.\n  The junior Senator from Missouri has a bill that would exempt \nmilitary veterans from ObamaCare's employer mandate.\n  The junior Senator from Kentucky has a bill that would make it easier \nfor Congress to block regulations that do not pass a simple cost-\nbenefit test.\n  The junior Senator from South Carolina has a bill that would \nmodernize\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\nworkforce training and eliminate duplicative government programs--\nsomething I was just talking about a moment ago.\n  The senior Senator from North Dakota has a bill that would \nsinglehandedly create thousands of jobs by approving the Keystone XL \nPipeline.\n  If and when these bills are offered as amendments to the pending \nlegislation, they deserve a vote, but if the majority leader denies \nthem a vote, he is effectively denying us a chance to expand our \neconomy, create more jobs, and get people back to work. I used to think \nthis was something Republicans and Democrats both agreed was a good \nthing. I thought we all agreed that job creation and work promotion \nshould be the cornerstones of our economic agenda. With an agenda such \nas that, perhaps we could finally have a recovery of our economy worthy \nof its name.\n  So I hope the majority leader reconsiders his decision to deny an \nopportunity for a full debate and vote on these constructive \nsuggestions. None of these are nongermane. All of these are directly on \npoint and would actually help improve the underlying legislation and \nactually do something about the underlying symptom that necessitates in \nsome people's minds this long-term extension of unemployment benefits.\n  We are not helping people out by continuing to pay unemployment \nbenefits for 2 years and then leaving them hanging without the skills \nthey need in order to reestablish themselves in the workforce. \nUnfortunately, the only conclusion I could draw is if the majority \nleader is not interested in having an honest and open debate about how \ndo we solve the problems, then something else must be driving his \nagenda. I think we should get back to the day when collectively we were \nmore concerned about solving problems than trying to beat on an issue \nand gain political advantage, but that seems to be the road we are \nheaded down based on the majority leader's decision not to allow any \nvotes on amendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Jeremiah Denton\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to mourn the passage of a friend \nand to pay tribute to a remarkable man. Jeremiah Denton once served his \ncountry as a pilot, a prisoner of war, a rear admiral in the Navy, and \na Senator of the United States. He passed away Friday morning at the \nage of 89, having been active until near the end.\n  From time to time men and women are born into this world who are made \nof something special, individuals who seem to have an unlimited \nreservoir of strength and courage, who are made of sterner stuff. These \npeople carry themselves with grace and dignity even as the world's \nweight rests upon their shoulders. Jeremiah Denton was such a man.\n  A proud son of Mobile, AL, he attended local Spring Hill College and \nthe local Catholic schools and McGill-Toolen in Mobile, and he \ngraduated later from the U.S. Naval Academy, becoming a pilot and \ncommander. What happened next would etch his name into the annals of \nAmerican history.\n  On July 18, 1965, Denton led a squadron of 28 jets on a bombing raid \nwhen he was shot down over North Vietnam. It was his 12th flight. \nCaptured by the North Vietnamese, he would be a captive in prison camps \nfor the next 7 years and 7 months. During his time as a prisoner of \nwar, he endured virtually constant and excruciating torture. He was \nheld captive at prisons the POWs called Hanoi Hilton, the zoo, and \nAlcatraz. He endured merciless beatings as well as solitary confinement \nfor 4 years.\n  As a senior officer, he was a leader among the prisoners and rebelled \nagainst their brutal efforts to extract propaganda. Denton refused. \nDenton explained in an interview to the New York Times:\n\n       I put out the policy that they were not to succumb to \n     threats, but must stand up and say no. We forced them to be \n     brutal to us.\n\n  Denton wrote a memoir, ``When Hell Was in Session''--which is a \nfabulous book and too little appreciated, really--recounting his time \nas a POW. He describes a torture session in which his captors placed a \n9-foot, cement-filled bar across his shins. He wrote that his captors \n``stood on it and . . . took turns jumping up and down and rolling it \nacross my legs. Then they lifted my arms behind my back by the cuffs, \nraising the top part of my body off the floor and dragging me around \nand around. This went on for hours . . . They were in a frenzy \nalternating the treatment to increase the pain until I was unable to \ncontrol myself. I began crying hysterically, blood and tears mingling \nand running down my cheeks.''\n  In May 1966, Denton would defy and outsmart his Communist captors and \ndisplay to the whole world the depth of American courage and ingenuity. \nHis captors interrogated Denton for a propaganda interview. While \nanswering their questions at this interview, filmed by a Japanese film \ncompany, Denton was simultaneously and repeatedly blinking out a \nmessage, letter by letter, in Morse code. The message was ``torture.'' \nIt was the first official message informing Americans and the world \nthat American POWs were being tortured by the North Vietnamese.\n  During the interview, he further displayed his unshakeable resolve by \nboldly declaring to his captors:\n\n       Whatever the position of my government is, I support it \n     fully . . . I am a member of that government, and it is my \n     job to support it, and I will as long as I live.\n\n  North Vietnam's most ruthless interrogators couldn't break the will \nof this rock-ribbed American and Alabama native.\n  More than 7 long years later, on February 12, 1973, Denton would be \nfreed as part of ``Operation Homecoming'' following the signing of the \nParis Peace Accords. He was the senior officer of the first planeload \nof released POWs at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. Denton brought \ntears to the eyes of the entire Nation at that moment as he walked from \nthe plane. It was reported that he wasn't told to make any official \nremarks or make a speech, but he got off the plane and these were his \npowerful words:\n\n       We are honored to have had the opportunity to serve our \n     country under difficult circumstances. We are profoundly \n     grateful to our commander-in-chief and to our nation for this \n     day. God bless America.\n\n  Millions of Americans remember that day.\n  Denton earned the Navy Cross, the Defense Distinguished Service \nMedal, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, three Silver Stars, the \nDistinguished Flying Cross, five Bronze Stars, two Air Medals, two \nPurple Hearts, and numerous other campaign awards. He rose to the rank \nof rear admiral and retired from the Navy in 1977.\n  In 1980 the proud and grateful State of Alabama would send our native \nson to the U.S. Senate. A man of deep faith, Denton believed in the \ndignity of public service and the selflessness required of those of us \nwho serve. He believed that and he demonstrated it in his life.\n  He fought alongside Ronald Reagan to rebuild America's defenses and \nto fight the spread of communism and to help bring about the end of the \nCold War. He was a firm believer in peace through strength. President \nReagan recognized Senator Denton during his 1982 State of the Union \nAddress. Many remember this. President Reagan said:\n\n       We don't have to turn to our history books for heroes. They \n     are all around us. One who sits among you here tonight \n     epitomizes that heroism at the end of the longest \n     imprisonment ever inflicted on men of our armed forces. Who \n     will ever forget that night when we waited for the television \n     to bring us the scene of that first plane landing at Clark \n     Field in the Philippines, bringing our POWs home? The plane \n     door opened and Jeremiah Denton came slowly down the ramp. He \n     caught sight of our flag, saluted, and said, ``God bless \n     America.'' Then he thanked us for bringing him home.\n\n  So said Ronald Reagan.\n  I had the privilege of getting to know Jeremiah Denton. He was a very \nspecial man. His word was his bond and his loyalty was unshakeable. He \nwas modest. While he was a fierce advocate for his profound beliefs, it \nwas never about him. In fact, he was very uncomfortable with the term \n``hero'' being applied to him. His comeback was always: ``We were only \ndoing our duty.''\n  They said, after his time in Communist prison, that he was out of\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\ntouch; he didn't know the 1960s had occurred. Perhaps so. In fact, it \nwas so. In plain fact much had occurred while he was in prison and \nbeing tortured. It was, among other things, a culturally momentous \ntime. Many of those changes he did not like. He said so in plain \nlanguage. He didn't like the surge of crime and drugs. He believed in \nloyalty to one's spouse. He opposed abortion. He lamented the \nconsistent weakening of family bonds, sexual promiscuity, the decline \nin decency. He cared enough to speak out and again give of himself for \nhis faith and his country.\n  He represented the best America has to offer. His grit and bravery \nshined through from his dark prison cell deep in Vietnam, and it lit up \nthe world. He loved his country. He loved his God. He loved his family.\n  In 1996, when I was considering running for the U.S. Senate, I sought \nhis counsel. He graciously agreed to come by my house in Mobile. It was \na very valuable discussion. Near the end, we talked of his service. He \ntold me a story--and I think it may be appropriate to tell it now--of \nhis time in prison that he had not put in his fine book. After \nPresident Nixon's bombing and strong military action had brought the \nNorth Vietnamese to the conference table, Denton was firmly of the \nbelief that the Vietnamese were defeated and they knew they were \ndefeated. Concerned over possible war crime trials, one of the prison \nofficials demanded that Denton tell them all what he would say to the \nworld about his treatment if he were to be released. Senator Denton \nsought to avoid the question, saying: Why are you asking me? I am not \nthe senior officer in the camp.\n\n  But they pressed him again and again, and he kept saying: Why me? I \nam not the senior official.\n  Finally, the prison official looked at him and said: ``Because you \nare incredible, Denton.''\n  That is the flat truth. He was incredible.\n  When he told the world and his captors during that ``show'' press \nconference before the Japanese television where he blinked the word \n``torture'' that ``whatever the position of my government is, I support \nit fully . . . I am a member of that government, and it is my job to \nsupport it, and I will as long as I live,'' it was a moment of great \ncourage, historical significance, and fidelity to duty that few in this \nNation would be able to match. He knew the captors would not like it, \nand they did not like it. They beat him brutally for the disrespect he \nshowed by telling that truth, and they even did so before they knew he \nhad blinked out ``torture.''\n  His family was his life. He was married to the late Kathryn Jane \nMaury for 61 years, with whom he had seven children. He is survived by \nhis second wife Mary Belle Bordone and his children: Jeremiah, William, \nDonald, James, Michael, Madeleine Doak, and Mary Lewis.\n  The entire Senate sends our prayers to his loved ones, and we send \nour promise that Jeremiah Denton will not be forgotten.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, every Senator in this body represents \nsmalltown America. There are small towns across this country, from \nConnecticut, to Texas, to small towns in my State of Montana. In fact, \nI grew up and still live outside one of those small towns--a town by \nthe name of Big Sandy, MT, which is home to 600 people. There are no \nstoplights. The high school has about 60 students.\n  What makes America great is that we believe and we cherish the idea \nthat whether a person grows up in a town such as Big Sandy or a town as \nbig as New York City, a person gets a fair shot in life. That fair shot \nincludes the basic freedoms we enjoy as Americans. It includes the \nright to a good education. It includes the right to high-quality, \naffordable health care no matter where we live.\n  As a resident of Big Sandy and as a Senator from Montana, it is my \njob to not only represent the entirety of America but to point out when \nour Nation is not living up to its ideals when it comes to rural \nAmerica. Right now Washington is tying the hands of rural hospitals and \nsmalltown physicians and threatening the health care of Americans in \nall of rural America.\n  The bill we are voting on tonight is a good and important bill. It \nprevents a 24-percent reimbursement cut to physicians under Medicare \nand TRICARE.\n  Many folks don't realize that this bill affects retired military and \nNational Guardsmen who have bought into TRICARE. This bill is \ncritically important to them as well.\n  Above all, it makes sure that doctors can keep treating patients and \nthat folks can still keep getting emergency services. It may be a \ntemporary solution and one we have reached too many times, but it is a \nnecessary solution to keep our health care system working.\n  I appreciate Leader Reid bringing it to the floor. However, this bill \ncould be stronger, especially for folks in rural America. I pushed to \ninclude two provisions in the bill to strengthen rural health care, but \ndespite my best efforts, they are not going to be a part of the measure \nwe vote on this evening.\n  The first provision, which I introduced with Senator Roberts, removes \nthe requirement that physicians at critical access hospitals certify \nthat a patient will be discharged or transferred in less than 96 hours \nin order for that hospital to be reimbursed for services.\n  Critical access hospitals are treatment centers in rural areas that \nhave no more than 25 inpatient beds. They play a vital role in \nproviding quality, affordable health care in rural and frontier \ncommunities across this country. Without them, folks would have to \ntravel long distances to get care, and many would not get treatment at \nall.\n  But imagine being a rural physician and having to determine exactly \nhow long a patient will stay as they are admitted. What if the patient \ndevelops a secondary condition such as pneumonia? You would have to \ndecide whether to discharge the patient, keep them in and risk losing \nreimbursement, or transfer them to another facility at cost.\n  Now, how is that good health care? How is that fair to rural America?\n  Hospitals should not have to choose between caring for their patients \nand getting paid. This is a choice no one should have to make, and it \nis certainly not one the government should be forcing on rural \nphysicians who already have their hands full.\n  The second provision, which Senator Moran and I introduced, prevents \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from enforcing a new \nrule that requires direct physician supervision of outpatient \ntherapeutic services--such as drug infusions--at critical access \nhospitals and other small hospitals.\n  If this rule is enforced, it will severely limit the ability of rural \nAmericans to get much-needed care in their local communities, where the \ncommunity's one physician may be out of town when the call comes in.\n  Should a patient be denied basic blood work because the doctor is not \navailable?\n  When folks in small towns get sick, the last thing they need is the \nadded burden of traveling to another town to get the care they need. \nThat is why Senator Moran and I introduced this bill, because \nWashington's one-size-fits-all solutions sometimes just simply do not \nwork for rural America.\n  Our bill passed the Senate, but there is no companion bill in the \nHouse of Representatives. So we sought to include it in tonight's fix. \nDespite the fact that there is no stated opposition--and that both of \nthese bills will not cost the American taxpayer one dime--we were \nunsuccessful in our efforts.\n  I am not asking for much. These two bills are widely supported. They \nare bipartisan, and they will not add to the deficit. And they offer \nmuch-needed flexibility for rural hospitals seeking to provide high-\nquality health care while making ends meet.\n  I know Senator Wyden supports them. So does Senator Hatch. I \nappreciate their support. But the House of Representatives, for \nwhatever reason, chose to leave these important proposals out. They are \nexactly the kind of bills we should be approving--bills that offer \nsupport for the thousands of hospitals that provide critical care \nacross rural America, hospitals that should not have to have their \nhands tied by regulations that work better in urban communities. We \nshould be making sure they have the flexibility they need to meet the \nneeds of their communities.\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\n  Mr. President, if you or I need emergency care here in the Senate, \nthere are multiple large hospitals nearby where we can get the \ntreatment we need. But that is not the case in rural America. Distances \nin rural America are measured not in city blocks but in miles. We need \nto make sure the regulations coming out of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services reflect that.\n  Montanans elected me to bring a little more common sense to \nWashington. Often this is not an easy job. But these are two \nstraightforward, commonsense provisions to prove to Montanans that \npoliticians in Washington get it and they get their concerns. And we \nhope that all Americans get a fair shot at the opportunities promised \nto us, regardless of their ZIP Code. I will keep fighting for these \nprovisions and other measures that strengthen and support rural \nAmerica.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the new chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee--16 working days on the job--it is humbling to be parachuted \nlate into the issue of reimbursing doctors for Medicare services, and I \nintend to be brief here at the outset of this debate.\n  All sides agree that the current system for paying doctors, known as \nthe SGR, does not work well for seniors, the many gifted physicians who \nserve them, or taxpayers. Devised in 1997, the SGR sets an annual cost \ntarget for Medicare physician payments, and it is honored more in the \nbreach than in the observance. When the SGR is not met, the Congress \nsays that is OK, we will just apply a patch and we will punt. Patch it \nup and let that SGR limp along, just as it has year after year after \nyear.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, there have now been 16 of these \npatches--16--and every Senator who I talk to says that just defies \ncommon sense and it seems bizarre even by Beltway standards. The cost \nof the patches now resembles the cost of the full repeal.\n  To his great credit, the majority leader, Senator Reid, has \nrepeatedly said his first choice for dealing with this issue is to \nfinally repeal the SGR. Now is the ideal time for repealing SGR. The \ncost of full repeal is far less than anticipated. Thoughtful, \nbipartisan work has been done in the House and the Senate on repeal and \nreplace, and leading advocates for seniors and their doctors want to \nreplace the status quo with real reform.\n  So as an alternative to the flawed status quo--an SGR patch No. 17--\nthis afternoon I will make two unanimous consent requests so that the \nSenate is allowed to have a choice; specifically, a vote on a proposal \nto permanently repeal and replace the SGR and also to fund the health \ncare extenders.\n  I will wrap up by briefly describing this proposal. Its essence is to \nclose two chapters of Federal budget fiction. Since the SGR is just \npretending that Congress will hold the line on Medicare spending, I \nbelieve it is time to end this fiction and wipe SGR off the books. And \nfor balance, I am going to propose ending another piece of budget \nfiction, specifically the Overseas Contingency Operations, known as \nOCO, and the spending on wars that are winding down. This too is \nfiction.\n  As former Republican Senator Jon Kyl said--a conservative by \nanybody's calculation--during a previous SGR debate, let's use war \nsavings for one last time to wipe out the debt Congress has built up by \noverriding reductions in payments to doctors, and from that point on \nwar savings would only be used for defense.\n  So there you have my proposal: truth in budgeting all around. Wipe \nthe slate clean on Medicare so you can support seniors and their \ndoctors and move forward with real reforms along the bipartisan lines \nthe House and Senate have already agreed to.\n  I would add that if Congress took the action I just proposed, it \ncould go farther and address the health extenders. Unlike the SGR, \nthese are real programs helping, for example, vulnerable low-income \nseniors, rural communities, and seniors who need a variety of \ntherapies. Each one of those has strong bipartisan support.\n  This, too, could be addressed in a fiscally responsible manner. A big \nchunk of the cost of 10 years' worth of these extenders could be \naddressed with the savings of the 1-year patch.\n  So here is my closing: A lot of good work has gone into a bipartisan, \nbicameral reform plan that finally repeals and replaces the SGR. I \nwould just say to my colleagues, doesn't that deserve a vote? If my \nunanimous consent request is accepted, we would have that vote.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous order with respect to H.R. 4302, following \ndisposition of the Owens nomination, when the Senate resumes \nlegislative session, the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 336, S. 2157; that following the reporting of the bill, \nthe bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage \nof the bill with no intervening action or debate; and that upon \ndisposition of the bill, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 4302, \nas provided under the previous order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nexpress my appreciation to Senator Wyden for his leadership. He is \ngoing to do a great job as chairman of the very important Finance \nCommittee. He is active in all the issues before our Senate. But, \nregrettably, a number of Members on this side object to proceeding with \nhis legislation at this point.\n  I would note that budget experts tell us that paying for this through \nOCO is the mother of all gimmicks. I just spoke about the passing of \nSenator Jeremiah Denton, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. We could \nuse the savings from the Vietnam war that we are not spending today to \npay for this bill.\n  So I would object, Mr. President. Hopefully, we can figure out \nanother way to make this happen because Senator Wyden is correct, it is \ntime to get a permanent fix of this matter done.\n  I would ask consent that S. 2122, Calendar No. 330, be proceeded to \nfor immediate consideration. It would repeal the Medicare sustainable \ngrowth rate offset by repealing the ObamaCare individual mandate. I ask \nconsent that the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The unanimous consent request from \nthe Senator from Oregon is on the table. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I did object, yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 330, S. 2122, a \nbill to repeal the Medicare sustainable growth rate offset by repealing \nthe ObamaCare individual mandate. This is proposed by Senators Hatch \nand McConnell and Cornyn. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read \na third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \nleadership and hopefully something can be worked out on this because it \nis important. But it is frustrating that there is no intention, it \nappears, to allow this provision, this fix to be brought up. Therefore, \nwithout that kind of consent, I think it is unlikely we will get a \nunanimous consent to move forward with Senator Wyden's fix.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before my friend from Alabama leaves the \nfloor--just to highlight where we are--I think he knows how strongly I \nfeel about always trying to tackle these issues in a bipartisan \nfashion. I would just assure the Senator from Alabama, the reason we \ntook as our underlying repeal-and-replace bill the good work that was \ndone by Senator Hatch and Chairman Camp and Chairman Upton is I felt \nthat extended the olive branch in trying to bring the parties together. \nI intend to do that consistently on the Finance Committee--pretty much \njust\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\nthe way I did when I supported George W. Bush on Part D of Medicare.\n  The challenge, of course, here is that this would be the 51st attempt \nto essentially try to make changes in the ACA that would end up \nparticularly shifting costs to so many vulnerable people.\n  It seems to me, particularly today as we have thousands and thousands \nof people still trying to sign up--I noticed the Wall Street Journal, \nSaturday, stated that the CBO said the original target for the \nAffordable Care Act had been met. I think it would be particularly \nunfortunate to go forward with what would be the 51st effort to try the \nsame kind of approach that particularly would cause so much cost \nshifting in American health care onto the books of a lot of folks who \nare already walking an economic tightrope.\n  I know a number of my colleagues want to speak. As the manager of the \ntime, it is my intention to try to alternate with colleagues of various \npoints of view with respect to this issue. I am sure that will be done \nas well on the other side.\n  I note my friend from Virginia on the floor. He is going to be the \nnew chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Fiscal \nResponsibility. I think he brings extraordinarily important credentials \nto this job. His support of the kind of approach I have advocated this \nafternoon highlights that this will have support in both political \nparties from Members who have strong credentials in terms of promoting \nfiscal responsibility.\n  I would yield to him and look forward to my colleague's remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the chairman of the \nFinance Committee for his efforts in this endeavor. I am disappointed \nthere was an unwillingness to at least have a vote on this important \nissue. I have been a very lucky individual. I have had the opportunity \nto have a career in business, and I have had a career as a Governor. In \neach of those cases, I had to learn business practices and accounting \npractices. Business accounting practices are different than government \naccounting practices. State accounting practices are somewhat different \nas well.\n  But I have to tell you, what takes the cake is what passes for \nrational accounting and scoring practices in the Federal Government and \nhow we maintain these fictions about what are costs, what are expenses \nin a way where the vast majority of Americans do not have the slightest \nidea what we are talking about: SGR, OCO, terms we throw around in this \nbody that have no relationship to the bottom line but prevent us from \ntaking action to at least start the process of getting our balance \nsheet right, a balance sheet that right now is $17 trillion in debt, \nthat goes up 4 billion a night.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee outlined very well how this \nprocess came to be, the sustainable growth rate, where Congress 17 \nyears ago said they saw at that point that the cost of Medicare would \nrise and the cost of our entitlement programs was rising. They put in \nplace at that point what they thought was a rational solution to slowly \nslow the rate of growth.\n  The challenge was Congress immediately punted. As opposed to \nresolving it at that point, we have maintained this legal fiction and \nthis accounting fiction that no one under any kind of traditional \nstandards of accounting would accept, where we built in this cost \nincrease, and then each year we come back and so-call patch it.\n  Each year we go through a fire drill where lobbyists across town \nharangue and harass Members of both parties on a universal basis and \nsay: Oh, my gosh. We cannot allow this to happen. Hospitals and doctors \nwho should be spending time providing health care or finding cheaper \nand better ways to deliver health care storm the halls of the Capitol \nto make sure we do not provide what would now be an unsustainable cut \nin their reimbursement rates.\n  But it appears to me we are now about to go, for the 17th time, one \nmore year on a short-term patch and will one more time kick this can \ndown the road. What we are avoiding, if we take this vote this \nafternoon and simply patch over an effort that was brought over from \nthe House, an effort in the House that I would remind my colleagues \nnever came to a rollcall vote, we will once again avoid the opportunity \nto start to, in effect, clear our balance sheet, to make the size of \nour debt and deficit--and for those of us who have been involved in \nthis issue, to go ahead and get rid of some of the budgetary fakery \nthat quite honestly makes so many of our other efforts that may be \nlegitimate seem illegitimate because we cannot even clean up our books.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee went through how this SGR was \ncreated in 1997 and how we have gone through annual patches. It is \nremarkable that the total cost of these patches actually exceeds--what \nwe have already spent exceeds the cost of repeal. The repeal of SGR at \nthis point is roughly $135 billion. Based upon previous budget \nestimates, this is the year to take this action.\n  What has been the challenge in the past, while there has been \nagreement--we heard from the Senator from Alabama, and others will come \nand bemoan the fact that SGR is a fakery, SGR is budget gimmickry. We \nhave this action that is taken on every year, where doctors, hospitals, \nothers storm the Congress and say please do not do this, and then at \nthe eleventh hour we extend.\n  What has avoided opportunities in the past to get rid of this issue \nis that there has not been a solution, not been a bipartisan solution. \nBut this year, due to the good work of the chairman, the ranking member \nof the Finance Committee and their equivalents in the House, there is \nagreement on what a replacement to the SGR would look like. We would \nmove to a system that would actually fix the problem but also improve \nthe quality of service covered under Medicare.\n  We would move to a payment system which would reward doctors for \nfocusing on providing high-quality care. Doctors would actually be \nrewarded for talking to each other, to make sure tests and services are \nnot unnecessarily duplicated. Doctors would be rewarded for ensuring \npatients have access to care when they need it, such as same-day \nappointments. Doctors would be rewarded for spending more time with \npatients and genuinely talking about the patient's priorities and \nconcerns rather than running off to their next appointment.\n  These are all goals--regardless of what some of our colleagues may \nfeel about the Affordable Care Act, these are all goals that almost all \nof us would agree would actually improve the quality of health care in \nAmerica, and for Medicare start to help drive that cost curve back in \nthe right direction.\n  If we would act on this bipartisan solution, we could make a real \ndemonstration, even in an election year, that Congress is actually \nworking together to solve the problem.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee noted that in the 5 years I \nhave had the honor of representing Virginia, there is no issue I have \nbeen more passionate about, involved with, than trying to find that \ncommon ground around our debt and deficit, sometimes to the chagrin of \nmy own colleagues on this side of the aisle.\n  I believe getting our fiscal house in order is absolutely the top \npriority that this Congress and our Nation face. I believe failure to \ndo that will squeeze out any investment in education, infrastructure, \nmilitary, whatever our other priorities are. Part of that is getting \nour entitlement costs under control. But if we are going to get our \nentitlement costs under control, we have to eliminate the budget \ngimmicks and fakery that now are part of the process.\n  The primary one on the entitlement side is the SGR. We have a \nremarkable opportunity to get rid of this peace of budget fakery, to \nclear the books, to put in place a better system. I know there have \nbeen questions about the cost. I believe the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee will soon put up a chart which will quote a periodical that \ndoes not often say good things about those of us on this side of the \naisle; that is, the Wall Street Journal, which has called the SGR a \n``bookkeeping gimmick which merely hides Medicare's true cost by moving \nfuture spending off the balance sheet.''\n  Again, we have a chance to get rid of that today. What I think the \nchairman of Finance Committee has offered is we could actually get a \ntwo-for. We could\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\nget rid of repealing and replacing the SGR and at the same time \neliminate another budget gimmickry tool, the OCO account.\n  I cannot understand why we would not take advantage of this \nopportunity to start down the path of cleaning up our balance sheet. At \nthe end of the day, the actions we take today will not get rid of that \n$17 trillion in debt. It will not bring down our deficit in itself, but \nit will allow future actions to be dealing with an accounting system \nand a budget that is much truer to reality.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee has called this the Medicare \nmigraine. I think it is time for this Congress, this Senate, to \nactually take two aspirin, pass this replace and repeal, get rid of \nthis migraine, and at the same time show the American people we can act \nin a bipartisan fashion, even in an election year.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he yields the floor, through the \nChair, I would pose a question to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The Senator from Virginia has, as usual, gotten right to the heart of \nthe long-term challenge with respect to entitlements. I have always \ntried to describe it as the challenge of protecting the Medicare \nguarantee because what seniors have is a guarantee. It is not something \nthat is up for grabs. It is a guarantee. It is inviolate. Protecting \ntheir guarantee means that in the days ahead we are going to have to \nfigure out new ways to hold down costs.\n  What I have heard the Senator from Virginia talk about very \neloquently is one of the key ways to do that is what the Senator from \nVirginia and I have sought to do, which is to start having Medicare--\nstart having Medicare pay for value rather than just staying with this \nvolume-driven fee-for-service system, which largely rewards \ninefficiency. I think it is my sense that the Senator from Virginia \nbelieves it is very hard to start the kind of real entitlement reform \nwe need, where we protect the Medicare guarantee and hold down costs, \nunless we make the kind of approach we are advocating in this repeal-\nand-replace strategy with SGR.\n  We better get to it, because until we have those changes, we cannot \nbegin to get on with another area that the Senator from Virginia feels \nvery strongly about; that is, chronic diseases--diabetes, cancer, heart \ndisease, and stroke--which consume more than 80 percent of the Medicare \nbudget. By my calculation we cannot get on that or any of the \nstructural entitlement challenges until we do what the Senator from \nVirginia is talking about: Is that pretty much the way the Senator from \nVirginia sees it?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would agree with the comments made by \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee. In the repeal-and-replace \nproposal we have laid out ideas that again I think across the aisle \nthere is going to be common agreement on. I know we have been joined by \nmy good friend the Senator from Oklahoma. No one knows more about \nhealth care and has been a stronger voice on entitlement reform than \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  We have spent an awful lot of time wrestling with how we get to that \ncommon cause. These commonsense reforms that move us closer to quality \nrather than quantity are a first step.\n  Also, a first step is trying to relieve the annual or sometimes \nevery-6-month fire drill we go through where health care providers \nacross the country have to rush to Congress to try to get a patch in \nplace, which at the end of the day we know we will put in place. The \nway we put the patch in place more often than not is simply passing \nmore cost to the providers in an outyear. This is the kind of budget \ngimmickry that quite honestly we tried to address in our so-called Gang \nof 6 that would have had more constraints. We didn't get it done.\n  We have another opportunity today--not to solve the whole problem, \nbut by getting rid of SGR, by getting rid of OCO, we are moving two of \nthe accounting and gimmickry obstacles, which would help clear the \ndecks toward the ultimate debate we are going to have about tax reform \nand about retirement reform. But the value is that by repealing the \nSGR, we would also put in place reforms that move us toward a better \nquality health care system for our seniors.\n  I know the consensus and conventional wisdom is that at moments such \nas these we will always punt. We will have a chance this afternoon to \nsee whether we will punt one more time or whether we will actually--if \nit takes a few more days--wrestle this to the ground and come up with a \ncommon cause where we could repeal SGR, replace it with a better \nsystem, and perhaps at the end of the day get rid of not one but two \ngimmicks that have made our budgeting so much more difficult.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like to spend some time talking about the bill \nthat is on the floor.\n  I thank my colleagues from Oregon and Virginia. I have enjoyed \nworking with them.\n  The bill we have on the floor is one of the reasons I am leaving \nCongress at the end of this year. This is why the American people are \ndisgusted with us. We are going to put off until tomorrow what we \nshould be doing today. We should be fixing this problem instead of \ndelaying the problem. I concur a lot with what my colleague from \nVirginia said. But the fact is that there is no courage, there are no \nguts, and there are no intentioned actions to do what is the best thing \nin the long term for this country in this body anymore.\n  We have a bill that came to us--and I appreciate the fact that the \nchairman wants to try to fix it. But if they vote for this bill that is \non the floor today, they are part of the problem. They are not part of \nthe solution; they are part of the problem.\n  There are four budget points of order that lie against this bill. Why \nin the world would there be four points of order lying against this \nbill? We are only going to vote on one of them. It is because it is a \nsham. It is a lie. The pay-fors aren't true. They are nothing but \ngimmicks. It is corruptible. There is no integrity in what we are \ngetting ready to vote on in terms of being truthful with the American \npublic and in terms of being truthful with the people who are providing \nthe care for Medicare patients.\n  I have a little bit of experience--25 years of practicing medicine. I \ncan tell you what is wrong with the payment system. We have a payment \nsystem both from the insurance industry and from Medicare and Medicaid \nthat says: See as many patients as you can if you want to pay your \noverhead because we are going to pay you based upon a code rather than \nhow much time you spend with a patient.\n  The first thing a doctor is taught in medical school is sit down and \nlisten to the patient. If we spend time with the patient, the patient \nwill tell us what is wrong with them. We know that is true because we \nhave two of the sets of data now--both on the concierge medicine that \nhas come up in the past few years as well as what we have seen in one \nof the great HMOs on the west coast. They order 62 percent fewer tests \nwhen they are listening to the patient.\n  One of the biggest costs for Medicare, one of the biggest wastes for \nMedicare is tests. Why do doctors order tests? Because they didn't \nspend the time figuring out what is really wrong with the patient, so \nthey order a bunch of tests to try to help them; whereas, if they had \nspent an additional 15 or 30 minutes with the patient, most of those \ntests--and most are not without risk--would never have been performed.\n  We have the Senate doing what we usually do: We are putting this off \nuntil tomorrow when we can actually fix the real problem now.\n  It comes to another principle of medicine. The principle of medicine \nis that we don't treat symptoms, we treat disease. When we treat the \ndisease, the symptoms go away. If we just treat the symptoms, we will \nnever find the disease. We will cover up the disease. That is exactly \nwhat we are doing.\n  The SGR was a great idea. It started in 1995 in the Ways and Means \nCommittee in the House under former chairman Bill Archer. Had we \nfollowed it, we would have seen some significant reining in of the \ncosts of care and Medicare. But what happened? We cut spending and we \ncut reimbursement rates one time. Instead of responding to the \npolitical clamor of the provider group, we fixed it--a short-term fix. \nWe have been doing that ever since 1999, short-term fixes.\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\n  We are not fixing this problem today. What we are doing is taking a \nbig old can and kicking it down the road. Worse than that, we are not \neven being truthful about what we are doing.\n  One of the little gimmicks is to shift $5 billion of sequester from \n2025 to 2024 and say you saved money. But we all know this little red \narea on this side will go over to the other side and we will spend that \nmoney. Nobody believes it. It is kind of the wink and the nod to the \nAmerican public: Oh, look at us.\n  There is no truth, there is no honesty about what we are doing. And \nthat is only one. This is the other offset. The sequester was the one I \njust showed. Savings from future Medicare cuts: $2.3 billion. They will \nnever occur. If you think they will occur, you obviously think--if they \nwill occur, then we should have fixed the real problem, the real \ndisease of Medicare today. But we didn't. So the actions will continue \nto be exactly the same. That $2.3 billion will never be materialized \nwhatsoever. It is a falsehood--$4.4 billion to Medicaid. It will not \never come about. That is in the future, but we will take the money now \nto pay for it.\n\n  In this bill of approximately $20 billion, half of the savings we say \nare there aren't there. Every Member of this body knows that. So when \nthey vote for this fix today and vote against the budget point of \norder, what they are saying is: I am dishonest, I am playing the game, \nand I will not stand up for truth so the American people actually know \nwhat we are doing. I do not believe in transparency. I do not believe \nthat we ought to have to live within our means, that we ought to make \nhard choices, just as every American family out there does today.\n  Finally, some of this is very unfair to the very people who worked on \nthis with the committees because they made some commitments for real \ncuts to them to get a long-term fix. Guess what. The real cuts--the \nportion that is actually paid for--pay for it for only 1 year. So not \nonly are we dishonest with the American people, we are dishonest with \nthe stakeholders who negotiated this for a 10-year elimination.\n  The budget points of order against this bill--just so we know what we \nare talking about, it violates pay-go. Plain and simple, it violates \npay-go. This bill increases the on-budget deficit. I dare somebody to \ncome down to the floor and tell me it does not. It does.\n  It violates the Ryan-Murray 2014 congressional Budget Act because it \nviolates the top line. Nobody is going to come to the floor and say it \ndoesn't. We won't hear one speaker come to the floor and say it doesn't \nviolate that. It does. They know it does, but they won't speak the \ntruth.\n  This bill also spends money in excess of the Finance Committee's \nallocation--another point of order against the Budget Act. Everybody \nknows that is true, but they won't come down and say it doesn't; they \nwill just vote for it.\n  It also has language in it within the Budget Committee's jurisdiction \nthat has not been reported or discharged. So we are totally ignoring \nthe process the chairman of the Finance Committee would like to have so \nwe can do the expedient political thing to take some pressure away, \njust as we did on the flood insurance bill. It got a little hot in the \nkitchen. Instead of actually cooking the omelet, we threw the eggs in \nthe trash can and ran out of the room, and that is exactly what is \ngoing to happen in the Senate. We are again putting off the hard \nchoices.\n  Let me tell you why this is important. The Senator from Virginia \noutlined this a little bit. When I came to the Senate, which was 9 \nyears ago, the individual debt each one of us held on the national debt \nwas under $32,000. Today it sits at 54,800-and-some-odd dollars. We can \nkind of get lost in that. What we have to think is this: Well, what is \nmy family's obligation for what we haven't paid for in the Federal \nGovernment?\n  Let me tell you what it is. For every family in America, whose \naverage income is $53,000 per year--the same as it was in 1988 in terms \nof real dollars; we have gone backward--your obligation is now $1.1 \nmillion per family.\n  And we are going to play this game again and we are going to add \nanother $10 to $12 billion between now and April? We are going to say \nand claim it doesn't add anything, but we are going to add another $10 \nbillion so we can get away from the heat, so we can get out of the \nkitchen, so we won't be responsible.\n  Which is more responsible--to tell the truth about where we really \nare or to actually profess an untruth to your constituents in this vote \nthis evening? Because that is what it is. Mark my words: Every Senator \nwho votes for this bill that came out of the House will be telling an \nuntruth to the American people. They know it is not paid for. They know \nit violates all sorts of rules in the Senate. They even violated the \nHouse rules as they passed it--all to meet a deadline?\n  To give a little history, we have missed the deadline before on SGR \nfixes. Does it cause additional work for providers, doctors, hospitals, \nand doctors' offices? Yes. Does it provide additional work for CMS? \nYes. Do we eventually catch up on it? Yes. So what is the hurry? Why \nnot really treat the real disease? The real disease is that we have a \npayment system that is not good for patients and is not good for \nproviders. We can't fix it over a weekend, but we can fix it. If we \ndon't fix it, as the chairman would like to see a long-term fix--I \ndon't necessarily agree with everything he wants to do, but I applaud \nhis effort to get a long-term fix. If we don't fix it, we don't deserve \nto be in the Senate.\n  There will be no credibility left and there will be no legitimacy \nleft if we pass this bill. It is all a pack of untruths--untruths to \nthe stakeholders, untruths to the American public and, most \nimportantly, untruths to the generation coming up that is going to pay \nthe bill for our untruths. This isn't an unfixable problem. It is a \nproblem that hasn't gotten the attention and the time it needs, and it \nreflects poor leadership of the Congress and the committees. We knew \nthis was coming up 1 year ago. The Senator from Oregon can totally be \nforgiven because he wasn't in charge of the Finance Committee until 1 \nmonth ago. But there is no denying the fact this problem was there.\n\n  Doing a patch--and even doing some of what Senator Wyden wants to \ndo--won't fix the ultimate problem. Think about the interaction you \nhave with your caregiver. The average time in a doctor's office when \nyou go in, before you are interrupted by your physician, is now 6 \nseconds. You go in, sit down, and the doctor asks: Why are you here \ntoday? You start to say something, and the first thing you know, you \nget interrupted. Why? Because that physician knows he needs to get to \nthe next patient to pay the bills because we are paying bills based on \nCPT cuts rather than paying the physician based on the amount of time \nthey spend with the patient, including outcome measures.\n  We have a system that is designed to be defrauded and creates \noverutilization. We designed it. We can fix it. Voting for this bill \ndoesn't fix anything except a little heat in the kitchen. When we come \nback the next time, the heat is going to be hotter, and hotter, and \nhotter. This bill is a cowardly response to the real problem that we \nhave. It is time we quit being cowards.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Before he leaves the floor, I want to say to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, who says--and always with a smile--that he and I \ncertainly don't agree on everything in this debate, that the concept of \nwhat he is talking about--that physicians spend time with their \npatients--is certainly a concept that ought to be incorporated into how \nwe proceed in the days ahead.\n  The other aspect of this that people ought to focus on, with respect \nto what the Senator from Oklahoma is talking about, is that time that \nthe physician spends with the patient in the office presents a pretty \ngood chance that some of those discussions they have there in the \noffice are going to help keep that patient out of the hospital, and all \nsides ought to see that as a constructive goal.\n  So I want my colleague from Oklahoma to know that in the discussions \nhe and I have had--and I appreciated the way my colleague said with a \nsmile we don't agree on everything--the concept he is talking about \nwith respect to doctors and time in the office--is something that ought \nto be incorporated into this, and it is my intention to work with my \ncolleague on that.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to pick up on another aspect of what \nboth\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\nthe Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Oklahoma have talked \nabout, and that is that at this rate we have to be concerned that after \npatch 17 there will be patch 18, and after 18 there will be patch 19. I \nam sure there are some young people up in the galleries who are light \nyears away from Medicare. In fact, the distinguished Presiding Officer \nof the Senate is a number of years away from the program, and I don't \nwant to see him looking at patch 30 or 31 or 32. But the reality is if \nall we do is to take what we have and extend it, we are not going to \nturn this situation around.\n  My colleague from Virginia and I started talking about one of the key \nconcepts in our repeal and replace strategy, and that is making sure we \nhave a hard date--really, for the first time--to start paying for value \nin health care. Repeal and replace has that hard date. This is long, \nlong overdo. Until then, in much of our country, we will still have \nvolume-driven, fee-for-service medicine still driving health care in \nthose communities from one end of the country to another.\n  I heard one observer say what they hoped for is that somebody in \nWashington would take a machete to fee-for-service. At a minimum, we \nought to do what repeal and replace does, which is to reward for the \nfirst time quality, and ensure the message goes out to every corner of \nthe country. I have heard the distinguished Presiding Officer of the \nSenate say with respect to his important health care reform efforts \nthat instead of just paying for volume, we should actually pay for \nresults, and results mean patients have a higher quality of life. What \nwe know, in many instances, is that kind of care also costs less \nbecause we don't have people sicker and needing more expensive services \nand possibly institutional care.\n  So now, while I wait for additional colleagues to come and speak, I \nwant to take a few minutes to describe some of the other opportunities \nwe are missing out on by not going forward with full repeal and \nreplace, as I and Senator Warner and others would like to see.\n  In particular, it is very clear that Medicare in 2014 is remarkably \ndifferent than Medicare back when it began in 1965. Medicare in 2014 is \nnow dominated by chronic disease. Cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and \nstroke is more than 80 percent of the Medicare spent. I believe we have \nsome opportunities for some very important breakthroughs.\n  The Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, has joined me in a bipartisan \nbill here--the Better Care, Lower Cost Act. It is bipartisan in the \nother body with Congressman Peter Welch and Congressman Erik Paulsen. \nThat would give both parties an opportunity for the first time to \nprovide the real financial incentives for the long term to reward the \nkind of coordinated care we are not getting in this country for \nseniors.\n  For many seniors, after the free physical they now get under \nMedicare, their care is so fragmented, so poorly coordinated that until \nthey land in a hospital emergency room, perhaps with a $1,100 \ndeductible and can't figure out all the doctors they have seen during \ntheir odyssey through chronic care treatment, we have virtually no \nsystem that responsibly manages and is accountable for that senior's \ncare.\n  In repeal and replace, we take the first steps toward building a \nchronic care policy for our country. We take the chronic special needs \nplans--what are called the CSNPs--that haven't worked out as hoped and \ninitiate reforms for those particular plans to ensure that all of the \nindividuals who are part of that program would, for the first time, \nhave an individual care plan. That is something many seniors--certainly \na majority of seniors--lack, particularly if they are part of \ntraditional fee-for-service medicine. They don't have an individual \ncare plan. They might have two or more kinds of chronic conditions.\n\n  A senior might think they can manage their own medicines and manage \ntheir own nutrition, but there would be an alternative. That would be \nwhat Senator Isakson and I have talked about for the long term and what \nwe would begin with in a true repeal and replace program for SGR. With \nSGR, we would start finally looking at those chronic care patients in a \nway that ensured they got coordinated care from the first time they saw \na physician, who, under our approach for the long term, would have a \npharmacist and a physician assistant and maybe a nurse. They would be \nable to have one person accountable for their care.\n  The irony is that all over the country there are programs that are \nnow doing this and reaping dramatic savings. For example, in rural \nPennsylvania there is a particularly promising program where the \nsavings have exceeded more than 20 percent on some of the sickest \npatients with the kind of approach that Senator Isakson and I are \nadvocating for the long term, and which we would at least begin with \nthese chronic special needs patients under full repeal and replace of \nthe SGR.\n  Now, I want to close with one other point before I yield the floor to \ncolleagues. The full repeal and replace of Medicare would also contain \nan idea that Senator Grassley and I have worked on for over 3 years, \nwhich is to open the Medicare database. The Medicare database is really \na treasure trove of the most useful information about Medicare claims \nand payments around this country. It holds the record of all payments \nfrom taxpayers to physicians and other providers for seniors' health \ncare.\n  Right now, access to this Medicare database is very limited. If the \npublic or seniors or others want to get access to this information, \nthey have to wade through the bureaucracy, and there are simply very \nsubstantial obstacles. We know this kind of information can often \nproduce better quality for lower prices because providers who do well \nwhen that information gets out will see they are rewarded for their \nwork, and those that are not measuring up to those standards will \neither have to change their practices or simply find it hard to keep \ntheir doors open. The markets work best when information is transparent \nfor all parties.\n  Today, most patients lack any comparative information and usually \ndon't find out the cost of their care until after the fact, if at all. \nSo Senator Grassley and I have proposed there be a free and searchable \ndatabase, one that would allow seniors to find and choose doctors and \nother health care professionals enrolled in the Medicare program, \nadding the actual services that are performed and what price Medicare \npays for those services.\n  Americans would finally be able to compare what Medicare pays for \nparticular services in different parts of the country. Opening the \nMedicare claims database in this way would help us hold down health \ncare costs, would also improve the quality of Medicare services, be a \ntool in fighting fraud, and would be useful in helping individuals with \nprivate health plans--private plans, HSAs and employer-based insurance.\n  What is going to happen there is, if you have an employer plan in \nHartford, CT, or an HSA in Connecticut, the first thing you are going \nto say is, this is what Medicare pays for a particular service; why \ncan't I, with my employer plan or my HSA have the same price? If I am \nnot getting it, that probably means I am getting less pay, and I would \nrather see health care costs held down so I could get more in my \npaycheck.\n  So opening the record--from a quality standpoint--of Medicare-paid \nservices would be a very powerful tool for measuring hospital and \ndoctor performance. The claims data, with full protection of patient \nprivacy, would open how doctors and hospitals are treating patients. It \nwould also provide a full accounting of areas which lack access to \ndoctors, specialists, treatment, and procedures. Making this \ninformation readily available would also allow doctors to collaborate \non improved care management, and make sure the highest quality services \nare delivered to patients at lower costs.\n\n  Finally, the transparency we would get from the efforts Senator \nGrassley and I have teamed up on, which was part of the full repeal-\nand-replace strategy, would help us have a powerful new tool against \nfraud and waste.\n  We look at the Medicare Program. The Wall Street Journal and the \nCenter for Public Integrity have been able to, even with limited access \nto Medicare claims data, look at that information and expose through a \nseries of articles how doctors and medical practitioners game Medicare \nto increase their profits. If we made the system\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\nmore transparent, as Senator Grassley and I have sought to do and is in \nthe full repeal-and-replace proposal, we would have a significant new \ntool to root out those--and they are a relatively small number, \nfortunately--who truly fleece seniors and taxpayers and allow us to get \nmore value for the Medicare dollars.\n  In 2012 the Medicare Program cost about $580 billion. In a few years, \ngiven the demographics and technology, this bill is going to go over $1 \ntrillion.\n  Often when I go to a high school and meet with young people--as I am \nsure does the distinguished Presiding Officer--16-, 17-, and 18-year-\nolds, we talk about matters which concern them, student scholarships, \nparks, transportation. Toward the end of the meeting I often say: So \nyou all are 16, 17, and 18. My guess is, given your age, you probably \ntweet your friends when you get up in the morning about Medicare.\n  These students smile: Well, there is another person from Washington, \nDC, who doesn't get it.\n  I kid with them a little bit. Finally, I say: I just want you to know \nI am kidding, but not really. Because if we don't figure out how to \nprotect the Medicare guarantee and hold down the costs for all you \nstudents who care about scholarships and parks and roads and the like, \nguess what. There is not going to be any money for the concerns which \nare first and foremost to you.\n  At this point, of course, the students jump right in, and they want \nto know about preventive medicine and how to root out waste and some of \nthe things we are talking about. But we can't get to a lot of those \nimportant Medicare reform issues which Senator Warner articulated so \nwell when he began his remarks if we can't get full repeal-and-replace \nof the badly flawed Medicare SGR Program.\n  I have spent a few minutes talking about how Senator Isakson has an \napproach which is bipartisan in both the Senate and the House on how to \ndeal with chronic disease; I have talked about opening the Medicare \ndatabase which is in full Medicare repeal and replace; I have talked \nabout some broad reforms. Of course, at the center is paying for value, \nwhich is in full repeal and replace starting in 2018, and we may not \nget for a while if the Congress just keeps reupping from the 17th patch \nto 18th patch to the 19th patch.\n  So what we are going to have to do here in this body--and I know the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer has a great interest in the question \nand the budget and the future particularly of entitlement costs, which \nI would say puts the Medicare guarantee and holding down costs front \nand center--we are going to have to speed up, we are going to have to \naccelerate the drive to actually get full repeal and replace, rather \nthan patch 17, patch 18, patch 19, patch 20, and up. My view is we \nought to be doing it now.\n  I recognize the objection from the other side. But I have talked to a \nlot of Senators over the last 3 days of both political parties, and I \nthink there is a growing awareness that simply extending what we \nalready have and punting on the need to fix the urgent structural \nproblems with what we have--which is what some Senators and House \nMembers sought to do--can't be ducked much longer.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time for closing.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                            Afghan Democracy\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support for the people \nof Afghanistan who this week on Saturday will be in the midst of a \nPresidential election pursuing the first Democratic transfer of power \nin that nation's history. April 5 will be a momentous day, a \nPresidential election where millions of Afghans will head to the polls \nto determine their destiny by a peaceful means. As we know much is \ngoing on in the world in Ukraine, Syria, and Iran. It is easy to miss \nthis milestone, but it is a milestone I think should have some \nsignificance to us as Americans.\n  Americans should be proud of the role we have played in bringing the \nAfghan people to this point, given the significant sacrifice members of \nour country have made. There have been nearly 2,300 servicemembers who \nhave given their lives in Afghanistan--2,299. The United States has \nspent $600 billion in Afghanistan since September of 2011. While we \ncannot gloss over the challenges that remain in Afghanistan today and \ntomorrow, we should remember the progress that has been achieved in 13 \nyears since the Taliban fell in October of 2001, progress that has been \nmade possible because of the sacrifices of American service men and \nwomen, our diplomats, the American people, and the grit and \ndetermination of the Afghan people.\n  On April 5 Afghans will defy those who seek to intimidate them \nthrough violence and terrorism because it is a fundamental choice: Does \nAfghanistan want to move forward or go backward to horrific days. The \nink-stained finger of an Afghan voter will send a far more powerful \nmessage than any terrorist gun or bomb. I think Afghan men and women \nwill be thinking of their children as they vote on Saturday, the \npromise of the next generation as they head to the ballot box. An \nAfghan girl born in October of 2001 when the Taliban fell is now 13 \nyears old. She has no doubt faced hardship and will continue to, but \nshe now has before her unprecedented opportunities.\n  Sometimes we get into a little bit of a mode where we say things \nhaven't gone well in Afghanistan or the investment of blood, treasure, \nand energy by the United States hasn't made a difference. I wish to put \non the record 13 very real indicators of a transformation in an \nAfghan's life in the last 13 years.\n  No. 1, two-thirds of Afghans today have and are able to use cell \nphones compared to 5 percent before 2001. Before 2001 Taliban-\ncontrolled radio was the only news source in Afghanistan. Today Afghans \ncan choose from 75 television stations and 170 radio stations.\n  The Afghan national gross domestic product has grown nearly tenfold \nsince 2001. One in three Afghans has access to electricity. Kabul \nenjoys a power supply 24 hours a day.\n  In 2001 in Afghanistan there were only 30 miles of paved roads, which \nhad a direct impact on their economy. Today nearly 10,000 miles of \npaved roads--nearly 300 times the amount in 2001. Over 50 percent of \nthe population now has safe drinking water, nearly double from 2004.\n  The number of teachers in Afghanistan was only 20,000 in 2001. Today \nit is 175,000, 30 percent of whom are women. Three million Afghan girls \nare enrolled in schools compared to only 5,000 in 2001, a nearly 600-\nfold increase. Overall school enrollment in Afghanistan has increased \nto more than 8 million.\n  There are 168 female judges across Afghanistan and 68 women members \nof the National Assembly. Eighty-five percent of Afghans now live in \ndistricts with health care providers. Infant mortality has been reduced \nto 327 per 100,000 live births, which would still be high for the \nUnited States, but in 2002 that number was 1,600. So it has been \nreduced to one-quarter or one-fifth.\n  The number that is the most powerful is this: Afghan women now have \naccess to more health care than before. Female life expectancy has \nincreased since 2001 from 44 years to 64 years--from 44 years to 64 \nyears. So just think about what 20 extra years of life is like for a \nwoman and then multiply that by every woman and girl in Afghanistan. \nMale life expectancy has improved as well because of improvements in \ninfant mortality. This is a significant change, a real transformation \nin Afghan life.\n  We cannot discount remaining challenges to combat corruption and \nstrengthen civil society and to further advance women's rights. The \nrecent attacks by the Taliban on the electoral process at an NGO \nguesthouse in Kabul at the Serena Hotel and over the weekend at the \nAfghan election commission remind us that security is a problem. Our \ncondolences go out to the victims. The attacks show a cowardly \ndesperation.\n  The ballot box represents the largest threat to the Taliban and any \nterrorist affiliate and they are resorting to indiscriminate attacks \nbecause they know a ballot box and electoral democracy will be their \ndemise. By killing Afghans on the threshold of an election, the Taliban \nis only sowing the\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\nseeds of their own demise. They recognize the tide of history is \nagainst them.\n  A word about the Afghan National Security Forces who are working \ntogether with the United States and other partners going forward, \nespecially on these elections this week: More than 350,000 Afghan \nsoldiers and policemen are the security lead now throughout the \ncountry. They bear the brunt of the casualties of these attacks. More \nthan 13,000 Afghan security force members have been killed in the line \nof duty, but they are determined, with the support of our country and \nthe training we have provided them and that others have provided them--\nthey are determined to protect their homeland and they have proven \ncapable of securing their homeland. Our servicemembers and diplomats \nhave for years trained and assisted, and that training is paying off as \nis shown every day. We also have numerous examples of Afghan \ninterpreters who have assisted our servicemembers in that training, and \nwe cannot forget them.\n  The Afghan forces will not face the challenges of this week, the \nelectoral challenge, or the challenges beyond alone. The future of \nAfghanistan is not a military challenge alone. It rests upon security \nthroughout civil society, and these elections are a pivotal moment but \nnot the only pivotal moment.\n  The commitment of the United States to Afghanistan continues. In 2011 \nwe signed a strategic partnership agreement. We designated Afghanistan \nas a major non-NATO ally of our country. There is a text that is \ncomplete of a bilateral security agreement outlining our willingness to \ntrain, advise, and assist in this mission beyond 2014. I am confident \nit will be signed once the new government takes place.\n  One of the reasons I am confident is that all of the candidates for \nthe President of Afghanistan are engaged in a civil debate, and they \nare being asked what they think about the role of the United States, \nand they are all committed to the United States playing this new role \nas they transition their democracy with this peaceful transfer of \npower.\n  Finally, a word about what is at stake because it is not just about \nthe statistic, it is also and most importantly about individual lives.\n  Just 3 months ago in January, Colonel Jamila Bayaz, a 55-year-old \nmother of five, became the first woman to be appointed a police chief \nin Afghanistan. At her promotion ceremony she said she would not have \nachieved her position but for the efforts of the United States and the \ninternational community.\n  In a letter that same month to President Obama, over three dozen \ncivil society Afghan leaders stated as follows:\n\n       Over the coming years, Afghanistan will be completing its \n     political and security transitions as the foundation for the \n     future that we seek. It is our sincere hope that the people \n     of the United States, who were with us during difficult \n     years, will remain with us as we complete the challenging \n     transition period and become more self-reliant.\n\n  Hengama Anwari is the woman who is the current head of the Afghan \nhuman rights commission. Last week she stated: ``10 years is only a \ndrop in the ocean in the process of changing a society.'' But Ms. \nAnwari is still hopeful about the future of her country and is \nrelentless in her effort to advance women's rights.\n  When George Washington stepped down as President during America's \nfirst Democratic transition, it was a pivotal moment for our young \nRepublic. This transition, the first peaceful transition in \nAfghanistan's history, is equally pivotal. We stand shoulder to \nshoulder with Afghans, but this is an Afghan moment. Every candidate, \nevery soldier, every election monitor, every citizen must do their part \nto ensure the success of this transition.\n  Finally, as the Afghans transition, so do we--so do we. The \ncongressional action that authorized our military presence in \nAfghanistan was passed in this body on September 14, 2001, nearly 13 \nyears ago. With our combat mission in Afghanistan coming to an end with \nthis election and a peaceful transition, with the transition of \nAmerican military participation to a train, assist, and advise role, \nthis 13-year effort is now transitioning to something new that will be \nthe subject of that bilateral security agreement.\n  We haven't been able to have a welcome home party for all of our \nAmerican service men and women who served in Afghanistan because the \noperation was ongoing. It is my hope this transition in Afghanistan, \nwhich will also transition our role, will enable us to have one of \nthose pivotal expressions of American pride. We have all seen the \npictures of V-E Day and V-J Day, when the American Republic celebrated \nthe end of a period of sacrifice of our service men and women. This is \na period of sacrifice that has been going on longer than any war in the \nhistory of this country. It is my hope that while we will continue to \nwork together with the Afghans, we may reach a moment where we can \ncelebrate, we can acknowledge this transition, and say welcome home and \nthank you to all the American service men and women who along with \ntheir families have given so much in the last 13 years.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would ask to proceed on my leader \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The Republican \nleader is recognized.\n\n\n                               Final Four\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we all know a huge percentage of \nAmericans across the country filled out their brackets a couple of \nweeks ago to get ready for March Madness. Now it is down to the final \nfour, and once again the University of Kentucky is in the final four. \nIt has become something we are quite accustomed to after having won the \nchampionship at UK in 2012. We kept the championship in our State for \n2013 with the University of Louisville. Now we intend to further \nunderscore that the college basketball capital of the world is indeed \nin the Commonwealth, and we look forward to watching in Dallas the \nfinal four next weekend.\n\n\n                          ACA Signup Deadline\n\n  Mr. President, today is the normal deadline for most people to sign \nup for ObamaCare, and while one Senator on the other side of the aisle \nsaid yesterday there is no such thing as ObamaCare, that will come as \nnews to millions of our constituents--the millions of Americans facing \nhigher premiums, canceled plans, and the loss of doctors and hospitals \nthey like as a result of this law.\n  ObamaCare is definitely real to middle-class families whom we \nrepresent. If our friends on the other side want to make the pain of \nthis law go away, they can work with us to replace it with smart, \nbipartisan reforms. They are trying to wish away their own ObamaCare \nlaw or are simply pretending it is not there. That is not going to \nwork. The American people deserve a law better than that.\n\n\n                       Innovation and Opportunity\n\n  We will be having a vigorous debate this week in the Senate about how \nto create jobs and rebuild the middle class. On the one side our good \nfriends the Democrats will be offering more of the same. They will \npropose treating the symptoms instead of meaningfully improving the \nprospects of people who are struggling out there.\n  On the other side Republicans will be proposing concrete ways to \nbreak the cycle of unemployment and hopelessness that pervades the \nObama economy, ideas aimed at helping people reach their true potential \nand build a better life for themselves. The Republican message is all \nabout innovation and opportunity and making it easier for more people \nto join the ranks of the middle class. It is about reforming the \nunderlying causes of unemployment instead of just perpetually treating \nthe symptoms. It is about how we create jobs for the future that will \nallow Americans to do a lot more than simply pay their \nbills. Republicans will offer a series of jobs amendments this week \nthat underline our determination to reorient America's economic \ntrajectory. We want to lift our country from stagnation to growth, from \nhostility toward enterprise to an embrace of innovation, and from a \nsystem rigged by government elites for their own benefit to one that \ncan actually work for the middle class again.\n\n  Americans will hear two competing agendas this week: on the one hand, \na tired, government-centered Democratic agenda designed by and for \nideologues of the left; on the other, a modern, enterprise-oriented \nRepublican agenda designed around the hopes and potential of the middle \nclass.\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\n  This is a debate Republicans welcome. It is one we have been waiting \nto have for a very long time, and we hope Washington Democrats will \nactually be serious this time when they say they want to focus on jobs \nbecause every time they say that, they keep getting distracted and \npivot to other issues.\n  Here is something else we need to expect from the majority: votes on \namendments for positive reform. The American people deserve at least \nthat much. After so many years of failure, the middle class deserves \nthe chance for something better. Remember, there are nearly 4 million \nAmericans who have been unemployed for 6 months or longer. These \nAmericans deserve to have a Congress that is committed to making it \neasier, not harder, to create jobs.\n  Let's have this debate. Let's vote on Republican jobs amendments, and \nlet's give some hope again to the middle-class families who have \nsuffered for entirely too long.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the Senator from \nKentucky by again making it clear that it is my interest to work very \nclosely with colleagues on the other side of the aisle on these health \ncare issues, and that is why we took the proposal Senator Hatch had for \nrepeal and replace on Medicare as the base bill. It is why I spent a \nlot of time working with colleagues on the other side of the aisle on \nMedicare Part D and trying to make sure it could be implemented well.\n  What was striking was that a lot of the stories about Medicare Part D \nin the first couple of months resembled the stories we are now seeing \nabout the Affordable Care Act. The Congressional Budget Office has made \nthe comment that Part D has come in more than 25 percent less in terms \nof projected costs than what CBO saw years ago.\n  We are going to work in a constructive way. I hope we will not see a \npush, for example, to repeal the Affordable Care Act because if you do \nthat, you will go back to the days when health care in America was for \nthe healthy and the wealthy because you would again allow \ndiscrimination against those with a preexisting condition. The \nAffordable Care Act has air-tight protection for those who have a \npreexisting condition, and if you repeal the Affordable Care Act, you \nwould simply go back to those days.\n  Working with colleagues in a bipartisan way on strengthening the \nhealth care system and our economy--absolutely. But turning back the \nclock on vital consumer protections, such as protecting our people from \ndiscrimination against preexisting conditions, is something that I \nthink would be a huge mistake.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal last weekend. It is \nentitled ``Health Insurers Make Late Push to Enroll Young People'' with \nrespect to the Affordable Care Act. The signups topped the \nCongressional Budget Office's target ahead of the March 31 deadline.\n  I was particularly pleased by the comments from insurance executives \nin Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Florida. They all talked about how \nmore younger people are signing up, which, of course, is key to what we \nall want to do in terms of bipartisan approaches that strengthen the \nrole of private health care in America.\n  I would like to have this article printed in the Record so my \ncolleagues can read the remarks of Highmark, Inc., a major health plan \nbased in Pittsburgh. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island said \ntheir fastest rising segment in March was people ages 22 to 40. Florida \nBlue senior vice president Jon Urbanek said, ``Younger people are \nsigning up.''\n  I think all of this indicates--as far as private sector health care \nis concerned, which we all sought to promote in connection with this--\nthat more younger people are signing up for these plans.\n  Also, in response to my friend from Kentucky who asked about the jobs \nagenda, Senator Hatch and I have been working very constructively \ntogether on efforts to go forward in the Finance Committee--which could \neven begin this week--to deal with the tax extenders. Tax extenders are \nparticularly important for the jobs Senator McConnell seeks--as he \nmentioned in his remarks--to get some traction. We will be talking \nabout an extension for the research and development tax credit, which \nis key for innovation. We will be talking about jobs and renewable \nenergy and jobs for veterans. This is the kind of jobs agenda we are \npursuing in the Finance Committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n         Health Insurers Make Late Push To Enroll Young People\n\n             (By Anna Wilde Mathews and Christopher Weaver)\n\n       Insurers are pressing ahead with a final marketing push to \n     bring as many young, healthy customers as possible onto their \n     rolls and buttress a recent surge in health-law enrollments.\n       The flood of late sign-ups that helped boost the \n     marketplace total to six million enrollees, a key milestone \n     for the Obama administration, has also brought some insurers \n     an uptick among younger people. But it isn't clear if the \n     trend is broad enough to balance out an earlier skew toward \n     older enrollees, who are more likely to have costly ailments.\n       ``We are seeing our average age come down every week, so \n     it's clear that younger people are starting to come into the \n     pool,'' said Wayne DeVeydt, the chief financial officer of \n     WellPoint Inc. ``What isn't clear yet, though, is, did it \n     come down enough.'' WellPoint has said the demographics of \n     its sign-ups have generally matched its projections.\n       Highmark Inc., a major health plan based in Pittsburgh, \n     said in recent weeks that it had seen a ``marked increased'' \n     in enrollees younger than 34. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of \n     Rhode Island said its fastest-rising segment in March has \n     been people ages 22 to 40.\n       Florida Blue Senior Vice President Jon Urbanek said \n     ``younger people are signing up,'' but the insurer doesn't \n     know if that will move the dial in a customer pool that had \n     been ``skewing older than we anticipated.''\n       Medical Mutual of Ohio said its enrollment through the \n     health-care marketplace has gotten younger each week, and the \n     average age is now a decade below where it was when \n     enrollment kicked off in October. But, the company said, the \n     average is still eight years older than the company projected \n     when it set prices for 2014.\n       Insurance officials also caution that age doesn't always \n     indicate health status-younger people may have serious, \n     expensive conditions, while some older people rarely need \n     medical services. Age is a ``pretty good predictor,'' said \n     Tom Snook, an actuary with Milliman Inc. who works with \n     insurers offering plans on public exchanges, but ``it's not \n     even close to a perfect measure.''\n       So far, insurance carriers have limited insight into the \n     health needs of their new enrollees. Under the law, insurers \n     can't deny coverage or charge higher prices based on health \n     status, and enrollees need to provide only limited \n     information, including age, when they sign up through the \n     marketplaces. Enrollees must start the process of choosing a \n     plan by March 31 to avoid penalties. The Obama administration \n     has extended a grace period to complete enrollment even after \n     the deadline.\n       As the deadline looms, it isn't clear just how broad the \n     uptick in youth sign-ups has been. HealthMarkets Inc., a \n     health-insurance agency, said its age balance for enrollees \n     hasn't changed in recent weeks. EHealth Inc., which tracks \n     the average age of individual purchasers of nonmarketplace \n     plans through its site, shows it flat in recent weeks. \n     GoHealth LLC, another major health-insurance site, said it \n     had seen an increase in young customers.\n       To prod a big final wave, insurers, exchanges, health-care \n     providers and others are amping up their enrollment push with \n     a blitz of countdown ads and events. Blue Shield of \n     California is sponsoring events across the state, including \n     sign-ups this weekend at all 42 stores of a Southern \n     California grocery chain with many Hispanic customers. Land \n     of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Co. in Illinois parked a \n     tractor-trailer emblazoned with its orange logo outside a \n     hospital sign-up event on Friday.\n       Health plans are particularly hoping to reach ``young \n     invincibles'' like Trevor Dawes, a 23-year-old apprentice \n     plumber from the Queens borough of New York City who said he \n     is planning to shop for a plan through New York's insurance \n     marketplace this weekend, ahead of the deadline. He learned \n     recently from a video on Facebook that he could face \n     penalties for going without insurance, which he hasn't had \n     for about a year. ``I'm healthy, and I didn't even know it \n     was important,'' he said.\n       Arches Health Plan in Utah plans to keep up its push past \n     March 31 to capture late finishers. ``We're going right up to \n     the bell,'' said Shaun Greene, the company's chief operating \n     officer.\n       Independence Blue Cross, which sponsored a contest to \n     create short digital films about health insurance, is turning \n     the lobby of its downtown Philadelphia headquarters into an \n     enrollment site this weekend and Monday. The insurer said the \n     average age of its enrollees has dropped by 1.5 years since \n     January.\n       Arches will sport sign-up tables at three Utah Jazz \n     basketball games in the first\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\n     weeks of April. Mr. Greene has enlisted his 17-year-old son \n     and some of his son's football teammates to blanket cars in \n     Wal-Mart parking lots Friday with fliers bearing slogans such \n     as ``Peace of Mind Is Priceless.''\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Alan Bruce\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to thank a \nlongtime member of my staff who is leaving the Senate after 27 years of \nservice to Congress. Alan Bruce is not technically from Illinois, but \nhe is from Indiana--in this case, close enough. The fact is that he \nserved the people of Illinois in an extraordinary way during his time \non Capitol Hill.\n  For the last 22 years Alan has been my systems administrator. He \njoined my staff in 1992 when I was a Member of the House and moved with \nme to the Senate in 1997. He is the person most responsible for keeping \nmy offices in Illinois and Washington connected electronically to each \nother and to the world outside the Senate. He oversees our network of \ndesktop and laptop computers, BlackBerrys, cell phones, and all the \nrest.\n  Over the years, he taught me a lot of things, and there was a lot to \nlearn, everything from how to make my computer work, dealing with \nemail, saving a digital photo, and how to Skype. He has been a good \nteacher and a hard-working, loyal member of my staff.\n  In an age when most people change employers and even careers \nrepeatedly, Alan is unusual. The U.S. Congress is the only employer he \nhas had since he graduated from Cumberlands College--now the University \nof the Cumberlands--in Williamsburg, KY, in 1986. He didn't plan to \ncome to work on Capitol Hill. Six weeks after he graduated from \ncollege, he was getting ready for an interview to become a manager of a \nRadio Shack in Fort Wayne, IN.\n  On the morning of the interview, his mom said: You don't really want \nto do this, do you?\n  Alan said: No, I really don't. My heart is not in it.\n  Well, that day happened to be Saturday. It was also the day of the \nannual Circus City Days parade in Alan's hometown of Peru, IN. Alan \ncanceled his interview at Radio Shack, and he and his mom instead went \nto the parade. Working the parade line that day was a new candidate for \nthe House of Representatives--a man who would later become a friend of \nmine when we served together. His name was Jim Jontz. Jim introduced \nhimself to Alan and Alan's mother and learned that Alan just graduated \nfrom college and, in fact, was looking for a job. Radio Shack's loss \nwas Congressman Jontz's gain--and my gain as well. A few days after \nthat parade Alan was working as a volunteer driver for Jim's campaign.\n  When Jim won his election, he hired Alan to work in his Kokomo, IN, \noffice helping constituents on matters related to military and veterans \naffairs. It was a good fit. Alan grew up in a military family. His dad, \nPhillip ``Bud'' Bruce, was a career Air Force man. In 1989 Alan moved \nto Washington to work in Congressman Jontz's DC office as system \nadministrator. Managing a congressional computer network in those days \nwas a lot different. The Internet was still an obscure tool used mostly \nby elite researchers. People didn't have email. Back then, high-tech \ncommunications meant fax machines. Computers were used mainly for \nkeeping lists--data entry. Cell phones were a perk of just the wealthy \nfew. Almost no one had ever heard of Web sites, and smart phones, \nYouTube, Twitter, and Flickr--nobody even imagined what that meant.\n  Alan joined my staff as systems administrator in 1992. To give a \nsense of how dramatically his world changed, consider this: In 1997, my \nfirst year in the Senate, I received 30,000 pieces of mail--that is \nreal mail--through the U.S. Postal Service. Last year my office \nreceived 600,000 pieces of mail, and only about 2 to 3 percent went \nthrough the post office; the rest were emails. However constituents \nreach out--whether by the postal service or email--Alan works with the \nrest of my staff to make sure their letters are answered.\n  The technological revolution is only one of the big societal changes \nAlan has taken part in in the last 25 years on Capitol Hill. Alan was \nan early leader in Congress among staff to end workplace discrimination \nagainst lesbian and gay congressional staffers. In the early- to mid-\n1990s, he was an early board member of what was then called Lesbian and \nGay Congressional Staffers Association. The association held frequent \nbrown-bag lunches to brief other staffers on issues of importance to \nlesbian and gay Americans, including the don't ask, don't tell policy \nand the Federal Defense of Marriage Act. Today, both don't ask, don't \ntell and DOMA are history. Federal employees who are legally married to \nsame-sex spouses receive the same Federal privileges and \nresponsibilities as other married Federal workers.\n  As Alan prepares to start the next phase of his life in sunny Tampa, \nFL, I want to thank him again both for keeping my office connected to \nthe larger world and, of course, to the State of Illinois and for \nkeeping the U.S. Congress as an employer, moving toward the American \nideal of equality and justice for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, according to the National Institute of \nMental Health, approximately one in four adults suffers from a \ndiagnosable mental health disorder that could be treated if diagnosed \nand treated properly. The bill the chairman brings to the floor today--\nthe bill that establishes the so-called doc fix, the repair and \nreimbursement issue--has an important provision in it that allows us to \nlook at those individuals who have these mental health behavioral \nillnesses and begin to treat them, in eight pilot States, like any \nother illness.\n  When Senator Stabenow and I introduced the Excellence in Mental \nHealth Act in February 2013, our goal was to be sure that federally \nqualified centers, such as behavioral and mental health clinics, which \nmet the proper standards could offer mental health treatment like any \nother kind of health treatment.\n  This bill, which we will vote on later today, includes a provision \nwhich allows the country to have a 2-year pilot in eight States. Those \neight States aren't designated in the legislation. The States \nthemselves would step forward and say if they want to be a part of \nthis.\n  Certainly when we introduced this legislation in February 2013--\nsupported from the very start by Chairman Wyden, who has just become \nchairman of this critically important Finance Committee--we did it \nlooking at the reality that people's lives have changed and the people \nthey impact have changed.\n  One of the things that moved the Senate toward talking about mental \nhealth was some of the violent tragedies we have had in the country in \nrecent years. In fact, after the Sandy Hook tragedy in December--a year \nago--the committee that deals with these issues had a hearing on mental \nhealth in January 2013. It was the first hearing on mental health since \n2007. For whatever reason, these are issues that, as a society, we have \nnot wanted to deal with in a way we could.\n  As I mention these violent tragedies, I want to be sure to say that \npeople who have a behavioral illness are much more likely to be the \nvictim of the crime than the perpetrator of the crime. Even when saying \nthat, we know that the one consistent issue in these tragedies over and \nover in this country and other countries is that somebody has a \nbehavioral illness that has not been dealt with, somebody has a clear \nneed, and no one has reached out to meet that need.\n  In pursuing the Excellence in Mental Health Act and now pursuing this \npilot project for eight States, the law enforcement community has been \nwidely supportive of dealing with these challenges when we can deal \nwith these challenges at locations that people want to go to create \nmaximum accessibility and fully qualified locations.\n  The veterans community--unbelievably responsive. The Iraq and \nAfghanistan veterans community was in Washington last week dealing with \nmental health challenges. This was their No. 1 priority. We just had a \nnews conference here in the building and somebody from that group was \nonce again with\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\nus, as they have been since February of 2013. The community that \nsupports mental health and looking for mental health solutions has been \nwidely supportive of what we are trying to do.\n  The House passed this legislation. It is legislation we worked on--\nHouse Members, Senate Members, bipartisan. One of the House Members, \nDr. Tim Murphy, a psychiatrist who understands these issues, not only \nwas supportive of what we were doing but we became supportive of what \nhe was doing when he was advocating for people who have a behavioral \nillness--people having mental illness who are involved in a nonviolent \ncrime--that dealing with their illness rather than incarcerating the \nindividual is the better approach that should be available to law \nenforcement, to judges. That is an important part of what we are doing.\n  The Excellence in Mental Health Act was originally cosponsored by a \nbipartisan group of 25 Senators. It has been supported by 50 mental \nhealth organizations, veterans organizations, law enforcement \norganizations. It creates a place where people's needs are met. The \ndemonstration project would allow community mental health centers an \nopportunity to increase the types of services they provide within and \nto their local communities by providing a similar rate under Medicaid \nthat federally qualified centers receive for primary care services. \nThis is something we have been talking about for a long time. It allows \ngovernment to begin to treat these behavioral challenges exactly as we \ntreat other challenges--to have a healthy body, a healthy mind, all in \none person, all in one spirit, all treatable.\n  This provision in this bill that comes before us today I think is the \nbeginning of a significant change in how we look at helping people \nchange their lives. It is the beginning of a significant change in \nlooking at mental illness as though it is any other illness. I believe \nwe are going to see a good response to this on the floor today as we \nvote. More importantly, I think we are going to see a number of States \nthat are incredibly interested in being one of these eight pilot States \nthat will allow that to happen. I certainly hope Missouri turns out to \nbe one of those States. Clearly, our State has been a leader in so \nmuch, including mental health, first aid. Many of our federally \nqualified clinics have added behavioral help. Many of our community \nclinics have added a level of service that this law would anticipate we \nneed to have to meet community needs. I certainly have worked closely \nwith the Missouri Coalition of Community Health Centers. They just \ncelebrated their 35th anniversary and they are very excited about this \nlegislation.\n  Senator Stabenow and I were on the floor the last day of October, the \n50th anniversary of President Kennedy signing the Community Mental \nHealth Act. Many of the goals of that act have not been achieved in the \nway I believe the country 50 years ago had hoped to see them achieved. \nBut this legislation today includes a significant step toward that goal \nset half a century ago--still unrealized--that allows us to do things \nas a country we wouldn't otherwise be able to do.\n  Senator Stabenow has been a great partner in this legislative effort, \na great advocate for this effort. Our bipartisan friends in the House \nhave as well. I look forward to a successful vote today so we can see \nthis important step move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cardin be yielded 5 \nminutes at this time to address the SGR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Wyden for his leadership \nin fixing this reimbursement structure under Medicare. I thank Senator \nBlunt and Senator Stabenow for their leadership on the mental health \ndemonstration program that is in this--whatever bill we pass it will be \nin--because it is absolutely essential we address the growing problems \nin our community health networks. So I thank both of them for their \nbipartisan leadership.\n  The current way we reimburse physicians under Medicare is broken. The \nSGR system has been broken since it was passed in 1997 as part of the \nBalanced Budget Act. We have had 16 temporary patches to the SGR \nsystem, and it has created uncertainty not just among the medical \ncommunity as to what the reimbursement rate will be for Medicare \npatients, but it has caused uncertainty among Medicare patients as to \nwhether they know their doctor will be there to treat them for their \nillnesses. If we don't fix the problem and let it go off the cliff, we \nwill see a 24-percent cut in reimbursements to physicians under \nMedicare. That is not sustainable. As we know, it would affect access \nfor our seniors and the disabled to their doctors. We have to fix this \nproblem. It expires today, March 31. So we have to take action.\n  We have two choices. One is we could take advantage of the \nopportunity to not just make sure we don't go off the cliff but to \nactually fix the problem. That is what Senator Wyden has been able to \nput together, with Senator Hatch and with our colleagues in the House--\na replacement that will actually work, that will actually reward \nphysicians for taking good care of their patients by managing their \ncare, by bringing down the costs of health care, by managing our \ndelivery system, taking high-cost patients, treating them so their \nillnesses are treated, but also done in a more cost-effective way. That \nis what the replacement would do if we could pass a permanent fix to \nthe SGR physician reimbursement structure in Medicare. We have a \nbipartisan proposal. That bipartisan proposal will reward proper \ndelivery of care.\n  It also takes care of the therapy caps and others of the health care \nextenders. I mention that because Senator Collins and I have been \nworking for a long time to try to get a permanent replacement to the \narbitrary cap on therapy services. That was also put in the 1997 BBA--\nBalanced Budget Act. That put an arbitrary cap on therapy services, so \nthe more severely a person is injured, the more severe a person's \nillness, the less services they will be able to get that they need in \norder to be able to take care of the illness or injury. That makes \nabsolutely no sense at all. So we fixed it.\n  Why are we debating this, with strong bipartisan support? Because \nthere are two proposals out there. One is the proposal Senator Wyden \nbrought forward that fixes the problem, that substitutes a rational \nsystem, and it is paid for. I could argue it has been paid for many \ntimes over. It has been paid for because we have already passed patches \nthat have been paid for--$153 billion. That is more than this permanent \nfix costs. Who has paid that $153 billion? It has been clinical labs; \nit has been skilled nursing facilities; it has been community health. \nAll have paid for a problem they didn't create within the Medicare \nsystem. This has been paid for already. It has been paid for already \nmany times. It is current policy.\n  No one expects us to go off the cliff. Senator Wyden, in an effort to \ntry to deal with this in an upfront way--CBO is now scoring this \nproposal to be a little over $118 billion. That is a bargain \nconsidering just a couple of years ago it was $300 billion over a 10-\nyear period. I remember in 2005, I filed a fix of this bill with then-\nCongressman Clay Shaw--bipartisan bill. It scored at $50 billion. This \nhas been paid for many times over.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Senator Wyden, in an effort to try to accommodate everyone here, \nsaid, OK, we will take the cost savings that are already in the House \nbill--I could argue that really has nothing to do with the physician \nproblem, but it is one I think we could agree on so we have real cost \nsavings of over $20 billion that Senator Wyden has put in this bill. He \nsaid, we have these scored savings under the contingency operations; \nlet's use that if people feel we have to have an offset, even though we \nhave already paid for it over and over again.\n  So we have two options: Another temporary fix with continuing \nuncertainty, continuing this problem down the road, asking those who \ndidn't cause it to pay for it, even though it has already been paid for \nbefore or we could really take care of it and tell our medical \ncommunity: Let's work on other\n\n[[Page S1854]]\n\nissues to improve our health care system rather than coming here every \nyear and asking for a temporary extension of the Medicare physician \nreimbursement structure and not allowing the SGR system to take effect. \nThose are the two options we have.\n  So I come here to thank Senator Wyden for putting forward a proposal \nthat would fix it, that would really do it, so we wouldn't have to come \nback again next year, so Congress could really get something done. It \nis bipartisan, bicameral. The fix has already been signed off by the \nHouse and the Senate. Senator Wyden has come up with a plan that allows \nus to be fiscally responsible.\n  I urge my colleagues to go down the path of fixing the physician \nreimbursement structure so we can take that uncertainty out of the \nMedicare law, do what is right for our Medicare beneficiaries so they \nhave the certainty of their care under Medicare, and do it in a \nfiscally responsible way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of Senator Wyden \nand others on this problem. It is a matter we need to fix.\n  The Senator from Maryland said the fix is signed off by the House \ntoo, so I guess we are supposed to know the fix is in. We are just \ngoing to take care of the doctors who need their money and we are not \ngoing to pay for it. We are not going to do it within the budget, \nagain.\n  As ranking member of the Budget Committee, I feel I have a \nresponsibility to report to this body the plain financial truth about \nthe legislation that comes before us. The bill offered by our \nDemocratic colleagues is worse than this one. I guess this is a Reid-\nBoehner bill that is before us now. But the Democrats' bill would claim \nto pay for it with OCO--the Overseas Contingency Operation--which \ncouldn't be anything worse than the pay-for in this bill.\n  The Reid-Boehner doc fix legislation we are about to consider \nviolates the spending limits we passed in December, the Ryan-Murray-\nraised spending limits--by $6 billion only 3 months after those limits \nwere signed into law. Think about that. Bloomberg News released an \nanalysis today concluding that:\n\n       Since December 2013, the Republican House and the \n     Democratic Senate have approved more than $40 billion worth \n     of spending ``offsets'' in the form of cuts that would take \n     place in 2023 at the earliest or timing shifts in policy to \n     bring savings into the 10-year window.\n\n  In other words, Congress has gimmicked an additional $40 billion in \nnew spending in just a few months since Ryan-Murray was passed. That is \njust what it is. The Budget Committee and Chairman Murray, our \nDemocratic chairman, has already ruled it violates the budget. It \nspends money we don't have. It is not a legitimate pay-for. So here we \nare again, proposing to bust the spending limits. This is the behavior \nof a profligate Congress.\n  How many of our Members were running for office 2 years ago, 4 years \nago, 6 years ago, and they were talking to their constituents and they \nsaid that Congress is spending us into bankruptcy; they are \nirresponsible; they won't even write a budget; they spend, spend, \nspend; they don't worry about the deficit. The country is going into \ntoo much debt.\n  How many have said that in their campaigns--when I get there, I am \ngoing to do something about it. And what do they do when they get here? \nSome of our Members say, Oh, we have to take care of the doctors. And \nwe do need to do that. But there is waste, fraud, and abuse and savings \nthroughout this $4 trillion budget of ours that we could use to reduce \nthat spending legitimately to pay for what we need to do for our \ndoctors.\n  That is what we agreed to do when we passed the Budget Control Act. \nThat is what the Budget Control Act did. The Budget Control Act in 2011 \nsaid this. The President signed it. It passed both Houses of Congress. \nIt had Democratic and Republican support. The Budget Control Act says \nover the next 10 years we are projected to increase spending by $10 \ntrillion; but we are going to be more frugal than that, we are only \ngoing to increase spending by $8 trillion. So spending would increase \nby $8 trillion.\n  What happens? As soon as it begins to bite a little bit, and we are \nchallenged to make some priorities and to decide, for example, how we \nare going to help our doctor friends--who do need some relief--what do \nwe do? We just violate the agreement, we spend money we do not have, \nand we say somehow it is paid for. That is what brought us the Ryan-\nMurray deal and now we are rewriting that agreement. Senator Murray \nagrees that this legislation currently before us violates the budget \nand is not paid for.\n  So last year we borrowed--think about this--$221 billion just to pay \nthe interest on our debt. We have a debt of $17 trillion. We have to \npay interest on it, colleagues--surely we all know that--and it was \n$221 billion last year.\n  Federal aid to education is $100 billion. The Federal highway bill is \n$40 billion. We spent that much on interest last year alone. But the \nworst news is, the Congressional Budget Office tells us that 10 years \nfrom today our interest cost will surge to $880 billion a year \nannually. That is more than $5,000 in interest payments for every \nAmerican worker--$880 billion. Can you imagine that? That is over $400 \na month for the average worker that pays taxes in America. That is how \nmuch their share is going to have to be raised in taxes to pay the \ninterest in 1 year.\n  What do I say about that? This assumes, colleagues--this $880 billion \nin interest and the surge in our debt--this assumes that we will adhere \nto the Budget Control Act and the Ryan-Murray agreement, which this \nbill busts and violates. It is not the first time, and it will not be \nthe last. They are going to come back again and again and again with \ngimmicks and violations because people in our Congress are unwilling to \ntake the heat to find real offsets.\n  So we should keep that in mind as we consider this or any other \nlegislation that will increase the amount of money we have to borrow.\n  I would like to call attention to three specific ways the proposed \nlegislation violates spending and deficit limits. Each of these are \npoints of order that lie against the bill confirmed by the majority on \nthe Budget Committee. What I am saying is, each of these three points I \nam raising now represent points of order; in other words, the Budget \nCommittee has ascertained that they violate the budget. We spend more \nthan we are allowed to spend.\n  So No. 1, a $17.6 billion increase in the on-budget deficit over the \n5-year period from fiscal year 2014 through 2018; and a $9.5 billion \nincrease in the on-budget deficit over the 10-year period of 2014 \nthrough 2023--$9.5 billion.\n  No. 2, spending in excess of the top line total in the Ryan-Murray \nlevels for fiscal year 2014. We just passed Ryan-Murray in December. \nThe President signed it in January. This is going to add $6.1 billion \nmore than we just agreed to spend in fiscal year 2014.\n  Oh, well, that is not a problem. I say it is a problem. I say it is \nthe way a nation goes broke.\n  How about this? Spending in excess of the Finance Committee's \nallocation. The committees are allocated so much money. They are not \nentitled to spend above the allocated amount. So this spends $6.1 \nbillion in budget authority and outlays in fiscal year 2014--this year \nwe are in--above the Finance Committee's allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Was there a time agreement, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an order to go to executive session \nat 5 o'clock. Would the Senator like to ask a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes, and I will wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my courteous colleagues.\n  Maya MacGuineas, at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget--a \nwell-respected group--was quoted as saying, ``We are disheartened that, \neven in a 12-month `doc fix,' the legislation under consideration would \nuse a budget gimmick to offset a portion of its costs. . . . \nSpecifically, a portion of the bill's `savings' are achieved by simply \nshifting sequester savings set to\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\noccur in 2025 into 2024, within the Congressional Budget Office's \nscoring window, but this has zero actual impact on the debt. . . . \nCongress should remove the phony savings in this bill and replace them \nwith real cuts or shorten the duration of the `doc fix.' ''\n  That was an objective analysis of it.\n  So, Mr. President, that being the case, the pending measure, H.R. \n4302, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, would violate the Senate \npay-go rule and increase the deficit. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder against this measure pursuant to section 201(a) of S. Con. Res. \n21, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable \nbudget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act \nand applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the pending bill, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent to make a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous order with respect to H.R. 4302, following \ndisposition of the Owens nomination, when the Senate resumes \nlegislative session, the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 336, S. 2157; that the substitute amendment, which is at \nthe desk, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill with no \nintervening action or debate; and that upon disposition of the bill, \nthe Senate resume consideration of H.R. 4302 as provided under the \nprevious order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have to raise some objections, so I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 330, S. 2122, a \nbill to repeal the Medicare sustainable growth rate offset by repealing \nthe ObamaCare individual mandate. I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President. I am thrilled to be here \ntoday as the Senate gets ready to send a proposal that I have been \nworking on for several years now to the President for signature. The \nproposal, which is based on my bill, the Excellence in Mental Health \nAct, will improve quality, expand access, and ensure greater \ncoordination in the delivery of mental health services through \ncommunity mental health providers, creating an important leap forward \nin ensuring mental health parity.\n  Specifically, this proposal establishes an eight-State demonstration \nprogram where the appropriate State agencies in the States that \nparticipate will certify that community mental health providers meet \nnew high standards and offer a broad range of mental health services \nlike 24-hour crisis psychiatric services. These services can then be \nadequately reimbursed under Medicaid just as Federally Qualified \nCommunity Health Centers are reimbursed for comprehensive primary care \nservices.\n  Now, I was incredibly fortunate to work closely with several of my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle on this bill. But no one played \na more important role than my friend from Missouri, Senator Blunt. \nWhether it was fighting on behalf of his constituents struggling with \nmental illness or working with our Republican colleagues in both the \nSenate and House to garner support, he was there every step of the way.\n  I would like to yield to my colleague from Missouri for a question. \nSpecifically, I would like to hear what role he believes the community, \nmeaning community behavioral health clinics, advocacy groups, and \nfamilies with loved ones struggling with mental illness, will--and \nshould play--in the development of this demonstration project.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Senator for her work on behalf of her \nconstituents in Michigan and all people struggling with mental illness. \nShe is a strong advocate and I am very pleased we were able to work \ntogether on this important issue. As she mentioned, this demonstration \nprogram will allow communities to improve the amount and quality of \nmental health services available to those suffering from mental \nillness.\n  As Senator Stabenow and I have constructed this program, it is our \nstrong and clear intent to ensure this demonstration project is driven \nby the community. Our local community mental centers are the best \nsource for learning what the needs are in communities across our States \nand the country. It is critical States work not only with these \ncenters, but with groups that advocate on behalf of those struggling \nwith mental illness, and the patients themselves--and their families--\nwho can explain the difference that access to quality mental health \nservices makes in the lives of people struggling with mental disease.\n  For example, in Missouri, many current community mental health \ncenters have partnered with community health centers in their area. \nThis has worked well for Missouri providers and allows patients an \nexcellent opportunity to receive coordinated care. If these pilot \nprojects prove successful, which I believe they will, it is my hope we \nwould see these programs continue and expand to other States, so other \npatients can benefit from higher quality services in their communities.\n  I would like to yield back to Senator Stabenow to ask her to talk \nabout the role she envisions States should play in the application \nprocess.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank Senator Blunt for his thoughtful response and \nfor his question. I could not agree with him more. From the earliest \niterations of our bill and through our conversion to a demonstration \nproject, we have fought to make sure that this is a ground-up approach \nwhere the local communities, advocates, and patients work with the \nappropriate State agencies to explain what the needs are and where the \nneeds are, and then to have these groups come together to construct a \nState-specific approach to providing for those needs.\n  What our demonstration project does not intend to do is to create a \ntop-down approach where States draft proposals without comprehensive \ninput from local communities to create a partnership with community \nmental health clinics, federally qualified health clinics, and VA \noutpatient centers, nor does our approach intend to permit State \nlegislatures to put obstacles in the way of communities receiving the \ncare and services they know they need. That type of approach simply \nadds more bureaucracy between patients and the care they need. If we \nare to achieve the true aim of our demonstration project, it is simply \ncritical that communities be intimately involved in the planning and \napplication process.\n  Which leads me to my final question for my friend. Our proposal lays \nout a demonstration project that happens in phases. First, no later \nthan September 1, 2015, Health and Human Services must publish criteria \nfor a clinic to be certified as a community behavior health center and \nit must issue regulations describing how the program will work for \nStates selected to participate. Then, no later than January 1, 2016, \nplanning grants will be issued to States interested in exploring \nparticipation in the demonstration project. States are selected for \nparticipation in the program no later than September 1, 2017. Finally, \nthe recommendations are due to Congress no later than December 31, \n2021. The theme here is ``no later than.''\n  I ask the Senator, should we encourage--even expect--the \nadministration to move more swiftly than the timeframe allotted?\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Senator for this important question. And I can \nanswer it quickly. Yes.\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\n  After hearing from countless people in our home States, we know that \nthe time to act is now. We have a model that works and this \ndemonstration project allows States the opportunity to try it in their \ncommunities. The dates and timeframes you mentioned for getting this \nprogram started should be viewed as absolute deadlines. I would like to \nsee things move even quicker, if possible. We firmly believe--and \nexpect--that the administration will work quickly to get this program \noff the ground. There are people around the country who will benefit \nfrom these services. The sooner we enact these pilot programs, the \nsooner we can test the effectiveness of this model. As I mentioned, I \nbelieve this model will work and am eager to see it put into place not \nonly in eight States, but all 50.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I completely agree. People are suffering now. Families \nare suffering now. While we understand that the administration needs \ntime to implement this demonstration project in a sound and effective \nway, we are in absolute agreement that the expectation is that the \nadministration will work expeditiously to ensure that actions are taken \nwell in advance of deadlines.\n  I thank the Senator for his tireless work on behalf of Missourians \nand all Americans suffering with mental illness. I thank him for \nfighting beside me to get us here today. I know we would not have \ncrossed the finish line without his efforts and for that I am grateful.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook \nElementary, the Aurora movie theater, and the Washington Navy Yard \nserved as wake-up calls to our Nation that action must be taken to \nprovide better care and support for Americans living with mental \nillness and their families.\n  As an original cosponsor of the bipartisan Excellence in Mental \nHealth Act, I am pleased that the bill before us today includes a \nprovision, based on our legislation, to establish pilot programs in \neight States to strengthen and improve access to quality community \nmental health services.\n  Unfortunately, patients with serious mental conditions all too often \nlack access to care and experience difficulties obtaining appropriate \nand sustained treatment for their illness. Over the course of a year, \nfewer than half of those with severe mental disorders receive any \ntreatment at all. Treatment rates are even worse for children, \nadolescents and young people between the ages of 16 and 24. This is \nespecially troubling given that nearly half of all lifetime cases of \npsychiatric conditions begin by the age of 14, and 75 percent by the \nage of 24.\n  Of the 20 percent of Americans who will suffer from mental illness at \nsome point in their lives, just one in five will receive professional \ncare. These kinds of numbers would be totally unacceptable for patients \nafflicted with cancer, diabetes, heart disease or any other physical \ndisorder. They therefore should not be accepted for schizophrenia, \nbipolar disorder, severe depression, or any other serious mental \nillness.\n  I am particularly concerned about the high rates of suicide among our \nactive duty military and returning veterans. The number of reported \nsuicide deaths in the U.S. military surged to a record 349 in 2012, \nwhich is more than the number of servicemembers who lost their lives in \ncombat in Afghanistan during the same period of time.\n  The number of suicides among veterans has reached an astounding rate \nof 22 a day according to some studies. These losses are simply \nunacceptable. With at least 25 percent of returning veterans from Iraq \nand Afghanistan experiencing some type of mental health condition, it \nis even more urgent that comprehensive mental health services be \navailable in communities across the country. This is particularly true \nin rural states like Maine, where mental health services may not be \neasily accessible through the VA.\n  We know that people suffering from mental illness are more likely to \nbe the victims of violence than the perpetrators. However, we also have \nseen too many tragic examples of what happens when people with serious \nmental illness do not get the treatment and services they need.\n  The legislation that we are considering today has been endorsed by \nmore than 50 mental health organizations, veterans organizations and \nlaw enforcement organizations. It takes an important first step toward \nexpanding access to care and improving quality of care so that more \npeople living with mental illness can get the treatment they need in \ntheir communities.\n  In closing, I want to commend my colleagues from Michigan and \nMissouri for their tireless work to increase access to community mental \nhealth services and to improve the quality of care for those living \nwith mental illness.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we were unable to \ncome together to permanently repeal the Sustainable Growth Rate \nformula, and instead passed a 1-year patch to prevent reimbursement \ncuts for physicians from going into effect in April.\n  The bill the Senate passed tonight averts a 24 percent cut to \nMedicare payments that would start tomorrow, April 1. Given the \npotential impact of such a large cut to Medicare patients and to their \nphysicians, I supported this measure.\n  While a patch is not the permanent solution many of us have sought, I \nvoted for it because we must act to prevent these cuts from taking \nplace. Having averted these cuts, I will continue to work for a \nbipartisan solution to permanently repeal the SGR.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve this goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/31/senate-section/article/S1856-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1856-S1859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF JOHN B.

Owens, of \nCalifornia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                               SGR Patch\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on H.R. 4302. \nThis is a bill that will extend for 1 year the so-called doc fix \nrelating to the sustainable growth rate--or SGR--formula.\n  Patching the SGR has become a regular item of business here in the \nCongress. Indeed, it is basically an annual ritual that we have to go \nthrough.\n  From the first day the SGR went into effect in 2002, Congress has \nacted to prevent its reimbursement cuts to physicians from going into \neffect in order to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries continue to have \naccess to quality care.\n  More often than not, SGR patches have been cobbled together at the \nlast minute between the leadership offices of both parties. They are \nusually tacked on to larger pieces of legislation without the input of \nMembers and without the benefit of going through a committee.\n  For years this process has bothered Members of Congress who, like me, \nwant to see transparency and regular order returned to the legislative \nprocess.\n  It has also bothered seniors and physicians who are constantly \nworried about whether the gridlock in Congress is going to finally send \nthem over the SGR cliff.\n  There is bipartisan support for repealing and replacing the SGR, or \nthe sustainable growth rate, and, to the surprise of many, progress has \nbeen made to do just that. For more than a year, a bipartisan, \nbicameral group of Members of Congress worked to fully repeal the SGR \nand replace it with more reasonable reforms that move Medicare's \nantiquated fee-for-service reimbursement system for physicians toward a \nsystem that rewards doctors for providing quality care based on health \noutcomes.\n  I was part of that group, as was former Senator Max Baucus.\n  Chairman Baucus and I worked for months to produce an SGR repeal bill \nhere in the Senate. Eventually, that bill sailed through the Finance \nCommittee with broad, bipartisan support.\n  At the same time, the two relevant House committees--the Ways and\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\nMeans Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee--also reported a \nbill to repeal the SGR. That, in and of itself, would have been quite a \nfeat. However, we were not done yet.\n  Realizing that we were close to achieving our goal, the chairmen and \nranking members of all three relevant committees--that is three \nRepublicans and three Democrats--decided to come together to find a \nsingle unified approach that both parties in both Chambers could \nsupport.\n  At the time there were a lot of naysayers. Indeed, given Congress's \nrecent track record, there were reasons to be skeptical.\n  However, by consulting with all the relevant stakeholders and hearing \ntheir recommendations and concerns, we were able to craft a policy that \nhas near unanimous support across the health care community.\n  That is right. For the first time since the SGR was enacted in 1997, \nRepublicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate are united behind \na policy that gets rid of this flawed system once and for all.\n  However, we cannot get ahead of ourselves. From the outset of this \nprocess, Chairman Baucus and I, along with our House counterparts, \nagreed that any legislation to repeal and replace the SGR must be \nfiscally responsible.\n  Without any offsets, this policy would add roughly $180 billion to \nthe deficit--if we do not have offsets. If it is going to pass in both \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives--and if we are going to \nmaintain the same level of bipartisan support for the package--we need \nto find offsets that both parties can support. It is kind of miraculous \nwe have come together, but both the bilateral and bipartisan people who \nhave worked on this have agreed that we have to have solid offsets.\n  In the months since we reached an agreement on the underlying policy, \nall the parties involved have been working to find suitable offsets.\n  I am not going to disparage anything. This is a difficult process. \nBut it has to be done.\n  Despite the bipartisan good will this process has engendered, there \nhave been some who were not satisfied with our progress. With today's \nSGR deadline looming, there was an effort to hijack this bipartisan \nprocess and turn it into yet another partisan sideshow.\n  With an agreement in place and with parties still at the negotiating \ntable, some of my friends on the other side of the aisle thought it \nwould be preferable to simply bring our bill to the floor and demand a \nvote either without offsets or with offsets they knew Republicans would \nnot be able to support. In other words, they wanted to force our \nbipartisan policy through the Senate on a partisan basis and then jam \nthe House with it.\n  This was, to say the least, disappointing to me. Here we have a \nhistoric opportunity to do something that will help people throughout \nthis country and do it with the type of broad, bipartisan consensus \nthat is all too rare in Washington these days. Yet there were still \nsome who would prefer to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and set \nup yet another political showdown destined to end in a partisan \nstalemate.\n  Needless to say, I am glad that eventually cooler heads prevailed, \nwhich brings us to today's vote. The SGR patch that we will be voting \non today is not perfect. However, I am not going to make the perfect \nthe enemy of the good. The bill before us today is a good-faith effort \nto move the ball forward, thanks to the good work of Speaker Boehner \nand Majority Leader Reid.\n  What we need now is time to get this done in the right way. This bill \nwill give us that. So for these reasons, I plan to vote in favor of the \nSGR bill before us today. I urge my Senate colleagues to do the same. \nOnce this legislation is signed into law, we need to get back at the \nnegotiating table. I have no doubt that my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon, as he always has, will work with me and others in \norder to resolve these problems that have arisen.\n  Like I said, there are three committees with jurisdiction over the \nSGR issue. We all need to work together to find a responsible path \nforward. Hopefully, the bill that we will vote on today will put an end \nto the unnecessary distractions and roadblocks that have been thrown in \nour path. This is an important vote today. I am very grateful for those \nwho are willing to support what we are at least trying to do. I want to \nthank all concerned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I thank my \npartner from Utah for his exceptional work in terms of putting together \na repeal and replace program and say, as I have in the course of the \nafternoon, that essentially the proposal I have talked about here today \ncould more properly be called the Hatch-Kyl plan because the underlying \nbill is essentially the outstanding work done by the Senator from Utah, \nChairman Camp, Chairman Upton, a number of Democrats, and essentially \ntakes as a pay-for what our former colleague, Senator Kyl, a \nconservative by anybody's calculation had in mind.\n  We are going to be doing a lot of bipartisan work in the Senate \nFinance Committee. Senator Hatch and I, as I touched on earlier, are \nalready working on the tax extenders. I simply thought that the ideas \nof Senator Hatch and Senator Kyl, two conservatives who I admire, fit \nquite well with the kind of bipartisan approach that you heard many \nSenators on this side of the aisle talk about this afternoon, such as \nSenator Cardin and Senator Warner.\n  At the end of the day, I guess I will put my final remarks in the \ncontext of what Senator Coburn, our friend from Oklahoma, said. He \nessentially said: Do not put off until tomorrow what you can do today. \nThe good work that Senator Hatch has done on this--I was not the point \nperson for the Democrats at that time; it was Chairman Baucus--I think \nhighlights what we could be moving on today.\n  The pay-for that our former colleague Senator Kyl from Arizona put \nforward several years ago is just as valid as it once was. So we will \ncontinue, as Senator Hatch has described this afternoon, to work very \nclosely together. I am hopeful that here in the next couple of days \ncolleagues will also see it on a vital matter relating to jobs because \nthe two of us are working together on tax extenders, which is for \npromoting innovation in our economy: the research and development \ncredit, renewable energy, jobs for veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to talk about John Owens, who \nis the first vote, for a judgeship, particularly one for the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. No one questions his qualifications. \nI spoke on the floor about him before. I was proud to nominate him to \nthe President. He has a sterling background and would be an excellent \ncircuit court judge. The question that arose was because of the \nprevious judge, a man by the name of Stephen Trott. He spent his entire \nlegal career in California before joining the Reagan administration. He \nwas licensed to practice law in California. He was supported by two \nRepublican Senators from California for various federal appointments. \nBlue slips for his nomination were sent to California senators.\n  Now what am I trying to do? I am trying to say, this was a California \njudge for the Ninth Circuit. What has happened since then is because he \nmoved his home to Idaho once he was a judge, Idaho or some of the \nrepresentatives from Idaho tend to believe that, voila, this is now an \nIdaho seat. It is not an Idaho seat. I explained last week that \nCalifornia has less than its proportional share of Ninth Circuit Court \njudgeships.\n  Idaho has its fair share. Senator Crapo, who came to the floor and \nspoke about this, said nothing about population or caseload to \nillustrate why this judgeship should move to\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\nIdaho. This has been a long-standing attempt to take this seat away \nfrom California. When I came to the floor before, I outlined the whole \nprocess of how historically this is, in fact, a California seat.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to consider the precedent they would \nbe endorsing if they vote against this nominee because of this seat's \nhistory; and that is, if a circuit court judge in your State decides to \nmove to another State in the circuit, then your State has lost that \njudgeship. That is the precedent that not approving this judge would \nset.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to support this nominee, \nnotwithstanding the opposition of the Senators from Idaho.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Thursday the Senate voted to end the \nfilibuster on the nomination of John Owens of California to a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \nThis is the longest running vacancy in our entire Federal court system. \nToday the Senate will finally vote to confirm this outstanding nominee \nto a court that is in desperate need of judges.\n  The Ninth Circuit is the busiest circuit court in the country, and \nyet it has not been operating at full strength for more than nine \nyears. It has the highest number of appeals filed, the highest pending \nappeals per panel and the highest pending appeals per active judge. It \nalso takes far longer than any other circuit court to resolve an \nappeal. The delay in resolving these appeals hurts the American people. \nAfter confirming John Owens, the Senate should proceed to Michelle \nFriedland's nomination to the Ninth Circuit as soon as possible.\n  The nomination of John Owens is an example of how the process of \njudicial nominations and consultation with home State senators should \nwork. Under Article II of the Constitution, the Senate has a \nsignificant role to play regarding our independent judiciary. We are \ncalled upon to work with the President by providing advice and consent \nfor Federal judicial appointments.\n  Some have recently questioned the rationale behind the so-called \n``blue slip'' process that solicits the views of the home State \nsenators before a judicial nomination moves in the Senate. I have \nexplained that this blue piece of paper reflects the ``advice'' prong \nof the Senate's role. If an administration does not consult with home \nState senators to seek their advice on a nominee, it is far less likely \nthe nominee will receive their support. This support is crucial to the \nsuccessful confirmation of judicial nominees. In the almost four \ndecades I have served in the Senate, I cannot recall a single judicial \nnominee confirmed over the objection of his or her home State senators. \nToday's confirmation to the Ninth Circuit is yet another example of \nthat reality.\n  In the prior administration, rather than working with the California \nsenators to fill this seat on the Ninth Circuit, President Bush \nunnecessarily complicated and delayed filling this vacancy by \nnominating Judge Randy Smith of Idaho. In doing so, President Bush \nattempted an end run around home State Senators Feinstein and Boxer. \nInstead, he consulted with the senators from Idaho--both of whom were \nRepublican senators. Judge Smith was not a Californian and did not \nreceive support from the California Senators. When President Bush took \nmy advice and re-nominated Judge Smith to fill an Idaho vacancy on the \nNinth Circuit at the beginning of 2007, Judge Smith received the \nsupport of both Idaho Senators and was confirmed quickly.\n  The Bush administration also tried to get around home State senators \nin Maryland to fill a vacancy on the Fourth Circuit. President Bush \nchose to nominate Claude Allen of Virginia, a controversial nominee \nwith limited experience who received a partial ``not qualified'' rating \nfrom the American Bar Association, and the Maryland Senators \nunderstandably objected. Mr. Allen's nomination did not move forward \ndue to the objection of the proper home State Senators from Maryland. \nMeaningful consultation and support of the appropriate home State \nSenators continues to be important to the confirmation of nominees, and \nthe vote we are taking today on John Owens is proof of that.\n  President Obama nominated Mr. Owens last August, and his early \nOctober hearing date had to be moved after Republicans forced a \nshutdown of our government. A hearing on his nomination was finally \nheld in late October. Mr. Owens could and should have been confirmed \nbefore we adjourned last year. Instead, because Republicans refused to \nconsent to hold any nominations in the Senate, every single one had to \nbe returned to the President at the end of last year. They then had to \nbe renominated and reprocessed through committee this year. Mr. Owens \nwas voted out of committee on a voice vote, without dissent, on January \n16, 2014.\n  Born in Washington, DC, Mr. Owens earned his B.A., with high \ndistinction, from the University of California, Berkeley, and his J.D., \nwith distinction, Order of the Coif, from Stanford Law School. At \nStanford, he was the Nathan Abbott Scholar, an award given to the \nstudent with the highest cumulative point average in the class. Mr. \nOwens served as executive editor of the Stanford Law Review, where he \nearned the Stanford Law Review Board of Editors Award.\n  After law school, Mr. Owens served as a law clerk to Judge J. \nClifford Wallace of the Ninth Circuit and for Associate Justice Ruth \nBader Ginsburg of the United States Supreme Court. He has been a \nlitigator in both public and private practice. In 1998, he joined the \nU.S. Department of Justice, where he would later serve as an Assistant \nU.S. Attorney for the Central District of California and the Southern \nDistrict of California. In 2008, Mr. Owens was promoted to serve as the \nDeputy Chief of Major Frauds and later the chief of the criminal \ndivision. In 2012, he rejoined private practice as a partner at Munger, \nTolles & Olson where he presently works. Over the course of his legal \ncareer, he has been counsel of record in more than 20 cases before the \ncourt on which he is nominated to serve.\n  Mr. Owens has the support of his home State senators--Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Boxer. I hope my fellow Senators will join me \ntoday to confirm Mr. Owen's nomination to the Ninth Circuit so that he \ncan get to work for the American people.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 404\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I shortly am going to make a unanimous \nconsent request on S. Res. 404, a resolution I submitted honoring the \nlife and legacy of Cesar Chavez. This resolution has been blocked by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle every time it has come up for \nthe last 7 consecutive years--every time.\n  Now, today, on what would have been Cesar Chavez's 87th birthday, I \nask my Republican colleagues to find it in their hearts to honor a man \nwho really made a difference in our country. Frankly, I do not \nunderstand their reluctance. I do not understand their obstructionism. \nI do not understand how they can look back at that time in history, at \nthe sacrifices Cesar Chavez made for our country, asking for nothing \nmore than fair treatment and justice.\n  I realize it is uncommon to make a live unanimous consent request for \na\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\ncommemorative resolution, but if Republicans are going to object yet \nagain--for an eighth year in a row--to honoring, in my view, a great \nAmerican hero, I really want it to be on the record. I think \nRepublicans need to answer to the American people as to why, as a \nparty, they can agree to passing resolutions honoring World Plumbing \nDay or congratulating the Penn State Dance Marathon--both Senate \nresolutions that were adopted this month by unanimous consent--but \ninsist on standing in the way of honoring a civil rights trailblazer \nwho changed the course of our Nation's history.\n  Cesar Chavez was a man before his time, and he deserves proper \nrecognition. He dedicated his life to fighting for equality, justice, \nand dignity--not only for Hispanic farm workers but for all workers in \nthe United States. Yet our friends on the other side cannot find it in \ntheir hearts to honor him. I have to ask why. Why can't they simply say \nyes, he was an extraordinary man who gave of himself for his cause and \ndeserves to be remembered and honored by the U.S. Senate?\n  The President of the United States proclaimed today, March 31, 2014, \nas Cesar Chavez Day. Over 10 States honor his life and legacy each year \non this day. The Secretary of the Interior established a national \nmonument in his honor, and across the country you will find schools, \nparks, streets, libraries, and other public facilities named after \nCesar Chavez as well.\n  So I implore Senate Republicans to reconsider denying Cesar Chavez's \nlegacy for an eighth year in a row. Adopt this commemorative resolution \nby unanimous consent. Give Cesar Chavez the recognition he so deserves. \nThat is all we ask--nothing more.\n  This year there is a new movie chronicling the life of Cesar Chavez--\na life lived with honor and dignity and decency for the betterment of \nall of us. The film is long overdue. That life, that dedication, that \nspirit will always be missed.\n  He was born near his family's farm in Yuma, AZ. When he was 10, in \nthe hard times of the Depression, the family lost their farm, like \nmillions of Americans, and they became migrant farm workers, laboring \nin vineyards across the Southwest, where he learned of the injustice \nand hardship of a farm worker's life. He never left those fields. He \nnever left the land. He never turned his back on the people who worked \nit. And the rest is history.\n  Robert Kennedy called him one of the most heroic figures of our time. \nI think it is because Cesar Chavez understood and believed in one \nfundamental truth. He always said: ``The fight is never about grapes or \nlettuce; it's always about people.''\n  He was right. And that fight continues today. The struggle for \nfairness and dignity for every American goes on, and Cesar Chavez was \nand is its inspiration. He certainly is an American hero but most \ndefinitely a hero to the Hispanic community. He paved the way for the \ncontributions of Hispanic Americans--for innovative progress and social \nimprovements. If there is one man who redefined leadership, it is Cesar \nChavez.\n  I think my colleagues need to know that the community stands with me \ntoday and stands firmly behind my resolution honoring the life and \nlegacy of Cesar Chavez.\n  Mr. President, I have a list--and in the interest of time, I will not \nread it--of 37 national Hispanic and labor organizations that all \nsupport the resolution. I ask unanimous consent to have that list \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               2014 CESAR CHAVEZ RESOLUTION (S.

We all eagerly await the day when politics will no \nlonger preclude its passage.\n  Cesar Chavez's profound legacy and lasting influence can be reduced \nto three words--the motto of the United Farm Workers--that recall his \nfight for justice and have echoed from the fields of Delano, CA, across \nAmerica all the way to the White House: ``Si se puede.'' These three \nwords, while simple in nature, harbored the power to move entire \ncommunities from the dark shadows of injustice toward a brighter light \nof hope. These three words represent at their very core the spirit that \nbreathes life into Americans' struggle for a better life.\n  As the leader of the first successful farm workers union in the \nUnited States, he fought to ensure those working tirelessly to provide \nAmericans with food received the benefits they deserved. Nonetheless, \nhis service extends far beyond our agricultural fields and provides \ninspiration to those working to improve human rights, empowering \nworkers, regardless of race or ethnicity. His countless efforts to \nensure equality, justice, and dignity for all people in the United \nStates are a testament of his leadership and success--a success that \ncan only be measured by the lasting impact he has made toward ending \nworkplace discrimination, unsafe and unfair working conditions, low \nwages, and child labor. He was more than just a farmer with a vision. \nHe was a civil rights leader who embodied the pursuit of justice that \ncontinues to inspire millions of Americans today.\n  So I come to the floor today to honor the life and achievements of \nCesar Chavez, to ask my Republican colleagues to put aside their \npolitics and do what is right by a man whose life and legacy deserve \nthe recognition of this Nation--one Nation and one Congress.\n  Let's stand together and recognize the accomplishments of a great \nAmerican hero but, most importantly, let's honor the values that make \nour country great--the values of tolerance, hope, and freedom, upon \nwhich this country was founded. And let's always remember, as Chavez \nsaid, the fight is always about the people.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 404, the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nnote that the resolution has not come out of the Judiciary Committee \nand\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\nthat Senator Vitter, who has filed an amendment to the resolution, asks \nthat that amendment be accepted or voted on, which has been not agreed \nto. The amendment would say a couple things.\n  One:\n\n       Whereas Cesar Estrada Chavez strongly believed in enforcing \n     immigration laws, thereby reducing the deleterious effects of \n     inexpensive labor on the wages of farm workers in the United \n     States, as recognized by the Congressional Budget Office in \n     the June 2013 report entitled ``The Economic Impact of S. \n     744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and \n     Immigration Modernization Act. . . .\n\n  And he offers this ``whereas,'' a second one:\n\n       Whereas Cesar Estrada Chavez recognized the importance of a \n     secure southern border with Mexico, through citizen \n     participation in the enforcement of immigration laws, by \n     encouraging members of the United Farm Workers of America to \n     contact the Immigration and Naturalization Service to report \n     instances of illegal labor. . . .\n  So that not having been accepted, I would ask that be accepted. It is \nat the desk. I ask it be agreed to prior to adoption of this \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Jersey so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, this is not about Cesar \nChavez. This is about immigration. I know my distinguished colleague \nhas a different view about immigration than I do. I know Senator \nVitter, for whom he is offering this amendment, also has a different \nview.\n  The Senate has spoken on the question of immigration. Sixty-seven \nSenators, two-thirds of the Senate has already sent an immigration \nreform bill to the House of Representatives. So while we may have \ndifferent views, that is not the issue of Cesar Chavez. In my view it \nis an injustice to his memory to offer such an amendment. That is why I \nwill have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would object and would note I do have a different \nview on these issues. With regard to the impact of S. 744, had it \npassed, it would have been adverse to farmworkers who are in this \ncountry working hard, need pay raises, and need better job \nopportunities. I think these are important parts of Mr. Chavez's \ncareer. It seems to me that the Senator would be pleased to accept \nthat, but I understand we have a disagreement. I express my respect for \nSenator Menendez and his leadership on the Foreign Relations Committee, \nbut we disagree on this subject.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have a deep respect for Senator \nSessions. But I will just simply say this is the 8th year, the 8th year \nin which under some figleaf--before they could hide through their \nobjections. But this is really a fig leaf. The Senate has expressed \nitself on immigration reform. This is not about immigration reform. \nThis is about Cesar Chavez. This is about a man who led boycotts across \nthe country to bring to justice the rights of farmworkers and of all \nworkers across the land.\n  There is no bigger supporter, by the way, than the United Farm \nWorkers, which he helped build, create, and today is one of the \nstrongest voices for that immigration reform.\n  It is, from my view, shameful that we can pass commemorative \nresolutions on some of the most insignificant issues, but on the life \nof someone who changed the course of this country for millions of \nLatinos who understand that life and history and would want to see that \nlife commemorated, that there can be a continuing objection for 8 \nyears. I will keep coming each year to the floor to make this happen. \nAt some point it will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Before the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \nleaves, I wish to thank him for his diligence and advocacy on behalf of \na distinguished American. I can say, as chair of the agriculture \ncommittee, without the work of Cesar Chavez, without those who toiled \nin the fields picking the fruits and vegetables and providing the \nbackbone of the agricultural workforce, we would not have an \nagricultural economy in many places in this country.\n  To say on the date of his birth that we recognize Cesar Chavez is \nsomething that is straightforward and ought to be happening and should \nhave happened 8 years ago.\n\n\n                      Community Mental Health Care\n\n  Mr. President, today marks the culmination of a long fight to improve \ncommunity mental health care in our country. Last Thursday the House of \nRepresentatives passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, which \nincludes a demonstration project based on the Excellence in Mental \nHealth Act that my friend and partner from Missouri Roy Blunt and I \nauthored.\n  I wish to recognize Senator Maria Cantwell, who is one of our \ncosponsors who is on the floor, for her wonderful, passionate support \nand voice helping us get this done. I wish to thank our House sponsors. \nThis is a House-Senate Republican-Democratic initiative. Who says we \ncannot work together when we want to get things done?\n  Congresswoman Matsui, a Democrat from Hawaii; Congressman Lance, a \nRepublican from New Jersey, were our sponsors. We also had significant \npartnership and advocacy from Congressman Tim Murphy, a leader in \nmental health in the Congress, a Republican from Pennsylvania.\n  I wish to thank Susan Collins who, as a Senator from Maine, has been \na passionate advocate as well and Senator Jack Reed, who has worked \nwith me for years on this legislation. He and I were partners for a \nlong time to get this done. I wish to thank the chairman of the Ways \nand Means Committee in the House, Chairman Camp, and Chairman Upton for \nworking with us, both from my home State of Michigan--for working and \npartnering with us.\n  I wish to thank the Speaker and Majority Leader Reid, who put \ntogether a proposal, not what most of us would have liked to have seen \nin terms of permanently fixing this issue of the SGR or Medicare \nreimbursement for physicians, but even in looking at a fix for just 1 \nyear, they came together and supported our vision for positively moving \nforward on a demonstration project to increase community mental health \nservices.\n  Certainly, last but not least, I wish to thank Senator Ron Wyden, who \nhas been there since day one and now as chairman of the Finance \nCommittee has been unequivocal in his passionate support for what we \nare doing. I wish to thank Chairman Wyden for his leadership and \nsupport.\n  Our legislation is a landmark step forward for community mental \nhealth funding, one of the most significant advances we have seen in \ndecades. This bill will improve the lives of people all across the \ncountry by providing funding to create 24-hour emergency psychiatric \nservices and higher standards and funding for community care.\n  We authored this bill because mental illness touches all of our \nfamilies in some way, one out of four Americans. For me, it was my \nfather who suffered from bipolar disorder and was not diagnosed for at \nleast 10 years when I was growing up. I saw the impact on my dad, the \nmost loving, wonderful father someone could have, on my mom, on my \nbrothers, our whole family, as we struggled to figure out what was \ngoing on and get him the help and support he needed.\n  When he finally was accurately diagnosed and received the right \ntreatment and support, got the right tools to manage this disease, he \nwas able to go back to work and live a happy and rewarding life for the \nrest of his life. Similar to my dad, too many people who need treatment \ndo not get it, including one-third of all people living with mood \ndisorders and more than half of those with severe mental diseases.\n  That is because in this country we treat mental health and physical \nhealth differently. If you have diabetes, you monitor your sugar \nlevels, you take insulin to manage your disease. You go on with your \nlife as you are managing your disease. If you are bipolar, meaning you \nhave a chemical imbalance in the brain, you may receive zero treatment, \nmaybe lose your job or worse your family, maybe end up in jail or on \nthe streets.\n  Diabetes and bipolar disorders are both chemical imbalances in \ndifferent\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\nparts of the body. Both deserve treatment. People deserve to be able to \nget effective treatment for both. Both are treatable--both are \ntreatable. The same is true for schizophrenia and many other behavioral \ndiseases. There is hope when people get help.\n  There is treatment available and from that the ability to manage \ndiseases, as we do for so many physical diseases that people have. This \nbill which we just passed in the Senate will make it more likely to \nhappen that people can get the treatment and support they need. This \nbill makes great improvements in the way we treat mental health care as \nwell. It will expand access, make sure people get treatment at a higher \nquality level, because just as we do with federally qualified health \ncenters, we are now creating federally qualified behavioral health \nclinics.\n  If you meet higher standards, you get higher reimbursements and \ntherefore more services available. This legislation authorizes eight \nStates to be designated to receive enhanced funding for community \nmental health services, based on meeting high-quality standards for \nservices, as I said before, for the designation of federally qualified \nbehavioral health clinics.\n  This is voluntary. States will compete to be designated as one of the \neight demonstration States. I expect many States and communities across \nthe country to be working together to do that. I fully expect this \ndemonstration project will save lives and save money to communities in \nevery State that is housing people in jails who should be getting the \ntreatment they need in the community in order to manage their diseases \nand live productive lives.\n  It has taken a long time to get here. The fight began 50 years ago, \nwhen President John F. Kennedy called on Congress to create a new type \nof health care facility that would improve the quality of mental health \ncare in the community--in the community--and reduce stigma. He pushed \nCongress to take action on mental health care because he had a vision \nto bring mental health treatment out of institutions and into \ncommunities across America.\n  Following his lead, Congress sent him the Community Mental Health \nAct. It was the last bill he signed before he was murdered in Dallas. \nIt is one of the most important bills that he signed. Senator Blunt and \nI spoke on the Senate floor last fall to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of that bill's signing because it marked a major change in \nthe way we treat mental health.\n  Unfortunately, over the past few decades, instead of increasing \nfunding for mental health services, we have seen cut after cut after \ncut. We are seeing the consequences. Inpatient facilities all across \nthe country have closed their doors, but they have not been replaced by \nservices in the community. Too often we are turning the emergency room \nor worse to jails or prisons as our primary mental health treatment \nfacilities.\n  As Cook County, IL, Sheriff Tom Dart testified in the House of \nRepresentatives just last week, ``The unfortunate and undeniable \nconclusion is, that because of dramatic and sustained cuts in mental \nhealth funding, we have criminalized mental illness in this country.''\n  The ER and the jails are not the place to treat mental illness. We \ncan do better than that in this country. We have now taken a major step \nto do that. Our families deserve better. That is why our former \ncolleagues Senator Pete Domenici and Senator Paul Wellstone, a dear \nfriend to so many of us and whom we miss dearly, and later another dear \nfriend, Senator Ted Kennedy, whom we also miss dearly, a towering \nfigure on so many issues, joined together with Senator Kennedy's son, \nRepresentative Patrick Kennedy, and wrote the bipartisan Mental Health \nParity and Addiction Act. They wanted to make sure we had parity in how \ninsurance companies treat mental and physical health. That bill became \nlaw finally in 2008. It was a huge step forward.\n  I was proud to offer mental health parity in the Affordable Care Act, \nwhich was the next big step forward. Today we voted on the final step \nin mental health parity in the community, the ability to get funding \nfor quality mental health care services the same way we fund quality \ncommunity health services.\n  I have met and heard from so many people who personally felt the \neffects of mental illness and who wanted us to pass this bill so they \nand others could get the treatment they need.\n  One of those people who joined us--in fact, today at a press \nconference, flew in from Michigan--is Malkia Newman, who lived for over \n30 years with undiagnosed bipolar disorder. She finally got the \ntreatment she needed through the Oakland County Community Mental Health \nAuthority in the Detroit suburbs.\n  She recovered, is now managing her illness, and is the board chair of \nthe very same mental health board community she turned to for help so \nshe can help others. Her message to Congress is: ``Please pass this \nbill so everyone can get the mental health help they need.''\n  Not everyone is as lucky as Malkia, though. There are many who still \nneed our help, which is why what we have done today is so important.\n  Today, one in four returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan is in \nsome need of some form of mental health care treatment. I recently \nheard from Marcia in Dearborn about her friend.\n  She said:\n\n       My friend bravely served two tours in Iraq for this \n     country. Before he left for war, he was so outgoing and all \n     he wanted was to put a smile on everyone's face. He had the \n     biggest heart of anyone I know.\n\n  But when he came home from war with PTSD, her friend was in trouble.\n  Marcia writes:\n\n       What is done for these men and women when they come home? \n     They go to war, they see things no one should ever see and do \n     things no one should ever do, and they're expected to return \n     home and live normally?\n\n  Her friend killed himself after suffering from PTSD for 8 years. \nMarcia's friend is only 1 of the 22 veterans who take their own lives \nevery single day in America. This is where our bill comes in. This \nbipartisan bill expands access to mental health care, working with \noutpatient VA clinics, working with community mental health centers, \nand federally qualified mental health centers, all working together. I \nthank so much the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans for being with us every \nstep of the way, advocating, all of the veterans organizations that \nhave been so supportive. This bill will create a broad range of mental \nhealth services, such as 24-hour crisis psychiatric services in \ncommunities that are selected, integrated preventive screenings, \nintegrated treatment for mental illness and substance abuse, and \nexpanded peer support and counseling for families and patients alike.\n  It allows community mental health centers to finally be reimbursed \nthe same as physical health providers. We are finally saying that as a \ncountry we are going to treat illnesses from the neck up, the same way \nwe treat illnesses from the neck down.\n  Instead of merely talking about mental health in the wake of \ntragedies such as the Navy Yard in Washington last fall that took 13 \nlives or the tragedy at Sandy Hook, we have taken action this evening.\n  Mental health isn't a partisan issue. Senators Domenici and Wellstone \nunderstood it just as Senator Blunt, Senator Cantwell, Senator Collins, \nand I understand.\n  Senator Wellstone isn't here to see the progress we have made, but he \nonce said:\n\n       Politics is not about power. Politics is not about money. \n     Politics is not about winning for the sake of winning. \n     Politics is about the improvement of people's lives.\n\n  That is exactly what we are doing, improving people's lives and \ncreating hope and opportunity for people to get the help they need to \nlive long, successful lives.\n  I thank all of our colleagues for working together to get this done. \nIt will be something, as we move forward, of which we can all be proud.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in \nmorning business for less than 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, first I wish to address legislation that \npassed the Senate earlier this evening. The sustainable growth rate is \nsuch an important issue to the people from the\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\nState of Kansas. I come from a State in which senior citizens are a \nvery prevalent portion of our population, and access to health care is \nso dependent upon whether Medicare reimburses a physician, a hospital, \na home health care agency or a nursing home in an adequate amount. I \nfear that in the absence of that adequate Medicare reimbursement we \nwill see a lot fewer doctors, and hospital doors will close.\n  I have been an advocate of and in fact I never voted to create the \nsustainable growth rate, and I suppose I should explain what that is. \nIn the broadest of terms it means there is a formula that ultimately \nreduces the reimbursement a physician receives under Medicare. It has \nbecome a very dramatic issue. This year I believe it is around a 24 \npercent reduction that will occur April 1, tomorrow, if the sustainable \ngrowth rate formula is not altered.\n  The reality is that Congress has altered that formula to avoid those \nreductions, because we know when a health care provider is not \ncompensated in a way that covers the cost of providing the service, \nmost likely we are going to have fewer health care providers. Hospitals \nwill not be there, physicians will no longer be in practice, and, \nparticularly in areas of our country that are rural where, again, a \nsignificant portion of the population is senior citizens whose medical \nbills are paid, in part, through Medicare.\n  My discouragement, my dissatisfaction, is once again the Senate has \ndemonstrated its dysfunction by passing a very short-term fix to this \nlong-term problem. If history is any indication, we will be back 1 year \nfrom now in the same predicament. We have made alterations 16 times \npreviously. This is the 17th time in which we have done a short-term \nfix to a long-term problem. To me, it is one more symptom of our \ninability as a Senate to function in a way that benefits the American \npeople: in this case, patients who are served by physicians who will be \nharmed.\n  In instances across Kansas, our hospitals are now employers of \nphysicians, and so they have entered into a contract with a physician. \nWhen the reimbursement rate for the physician is reduced, it means less \nrevenue to the hospital and a tighter squeeze to the many hospitals \nthat barely hang on by a thread.\n  I express my appreciation to Senator Wyden, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, for his efforts to find a long-term solution, a \npermanent repeal of the SGR and again express my willingness to him and \nto others to work with Democrats in the Senate, to work with \nRepublicans in the Senate, to find the necessary numbers of us who will \ncome together to support legislation that would permanently end the \nSGR, and that we would not be then asked a few months from now to come \nback once again to solve the problem.\n  We know the problem is there. We know we will have to find a \nsolution. The consequences of failing are so great, but we were \nunwilling to take the necessary steps today to pass a permanent repeal \nand an elimination of the SGR formula.\n  Again, to Senator Wyden, he and I have had conversations since last \nThursday about my willingness to have conversations with Republican \nMembers of the Senate to find the necessary votes to pass legislation \nfor a permanent repeal. I expressed that offer again to Senator Wyden, \nthat we are still interested in doing that, and that the country, its \nhealth care providers and their patients, deserve better than what we \nwere able to do today.\n\n\n                      Remembering the Mull Family\n\n  I turn to a story about a very special Kansas family. Unfortunately, \nit is a sad story.\n  I often describe to my friends and colleagues in Washington, DC, how \nspecial Kansas is and in a special way how we live our lives there.\n  Families are important. The values of family run deep in our \ncommunities. We have neighbors who care for each other and we all know \neach other one on one, name by name, family by family. We know where \nthey go to church, we know what schools their kids are in, and we know \nhow their families are doing. When tragedy strikes, the entire \ncommunity is shaken.\n  I pay tribute today to a family from north central Kansas, the Mulls. \nGlenn Mull and his wife Elaine, their daughter Amy Harter and their \ngranddaughter Samantha Harter were traveling to the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association trade show in Nashville on February 3 when \nthe plane they were in crashed during its second landing attempt. The \njet went down about 10 miles from the airport in Bellevue, TN.\n  I saw on the Internet a Bellevue resident, who I don't know. She \nwrote this tribute to Glenn Mull, the pilot.\n  She said:\n\n       Glenn had reached the most bustling section of our \n     community at the busiest time of the day. . . . He would have \n     seen hundreds of homes with cars in the driveway. A Kroger \n     packed with shoppers. An assisted living community. And an \n     enormous YMCA, where hundreds of families were streaming in \n     and out to swim in the indoor pool, exercise and take \n     classes. Glenn didn't know this, but school was cancelled for \n     our kids . . . so a larger number than usual were at the Y \n     with their parents. Some experts are saying now that the \n     last-second sharp turn Glenn made in the seconds before the \n     plane crashed indicates that he made a heroic decision to hit \n     the one spot in the immediate vicinity where no one on the \n     ground would be hurt. . . . Glenn managed to spare all of \n     their lives.\n\n  The Bellevue resident went on to describe her own community as one \nwhich is ``filled with people who shared Glenn's obvious affinity for \nfamily.'' She said that Bellevue residents:\n\n       . . . are all talking about Glenn Mull, the hero, who we \n     believe had the extraordinary courage and presence of mind to \n     save our families, even as he realized he couldn't save his \n     own.\n\n  Glenn was born in Great Bend and raised on his family farm near \nthere, where his parents instilled in him a strong work ethic and a \nsense of integrity. He went on to graduate from Kansas State University \nwith a business degree, and K-State is where he met his wife Elaine. \nThey moved back to north central Kansas to grow the three-generation \nfamily farm and eventually to raise their three children. He promoted \nhis life's work through representation of Kansas farmers and ranchers \nin organizations such as the Kansas Livestock Association and the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n  Glenn and Elaine were well respected not only in the cattle industry \nbut also in their community for their generous commitment to improving \nthe lives of their neighbors. As a founding board member of Pawnee \nValley Community Hospital Foundation, one of Glenn's top priorities was \nimproving health care in Larned, KS. Their hospital was faced with \npotential closure in 2009 until efforts were made by the city of Larned \nand community members such as Glenn to solve the problem and to keep \nthe hospital doors open. For rural communities such as Larned, access \nto the types of health care facilities offered by Pawnee Valley \nCommunity Hospital is essential to their community's future.\n  Elaine, his wife, had a tireless heart for service and volunteered in \na number of organizations, including the Fort Larned Historical \nSociety, the Larned Hospital Auxiliary, the Santa Fe Trail Center, \nLarned Music Club, 4-H, Girl Scouts, and was a K-State trustee, just to \nname a few of her activities.\n  She played the piano and taught Bible study classes at Grace \nCommunity Church in Great Bend where the pastor said that he loved to \ntalk with Glenn about the weather, which is a very common Kansas \nconversation, and that he always used the farmer's expertise to analyze \nthe day.\n  The pastor said:\n\n       He knew exactly how much moisture we had and what we \n     needed, whether this was good for the wheat versus the milo \n     and how it might affect the feed yards.\n\n  The pastor continued:\n\n       There has been talk that Glenn behaved in a very heroic \n     way. I have no idea whether that is true, but I will tell you \n     that he is the kind of guy who would absolutely have done the \n     right thing.\n\n  Glenn and Elaine's legacies of selflessness, philanthropy, and \nleadership undoubtedly live on. I have met many people in my life, and \nI don't know that I have ever met a couple with more optimism, with \nmore care and concern for other people, with a sense that things will \nbe better tomorrow, and that the idea that hard work and living your \nlife with integrity and as a companion to your Creator, would mean that \ngood things would happen for you and your family.\n  Amy Harter, their daughter, and her family lived in a house on the \nMulls' land and worked in the family business, while she and her \nhusband Doug raised their children, Chase and Samantha.\n\n[[Page S1865]]\n\n  Sixteen-year-old Samantha, the granddaughter, was killed in that \nplane crash. She was described by one of her classmates at Larned High \nSchool, which has a student body of about 300, as a silly girl but a \nserious enough one to be a member of the honor choir. She would have \nthe most energy in the honor choir practice at 7 in the morning. She \nwould either be there--tired--with caramel rolls her mom had made or \nlaughing and having fun.\n  Kansans know what it means to persevere, and certainly the Mull \nfamily has persevered through many difficulties. No farmer or rancher \nescapes that in our State. We embrace our State's motto--``Ad astra per \naspera''--``To the stars through difficulties.'' During difficult times \nwe often see the very best in people--as in Glenn's decision to save \nlives in Tennessee when he couldn't save himself or his family.\n  Amidst the loss of Glenn and Elaine, their daughter and \ngranddaughter, and the suffering of this Kansas community, what stands \nout is the outpouring in Larned and Great Bend in central Kansas of \ncare and compassion shown by their friends and neighbors but also by \nthe residents of Belleview, NE, who were united in their care and \nconcern for this family they never knew.\n  Glenn, Elaine, their daughter Amy, and granddaughter Samantha will be \ngreatly missed, and all we can do now is model our lives after the \nlives they led and ask that God comfort them, their families and be a \nsource of support for all who knew them as we go through this continued \ntime of grief.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for his \nremarks and extend my sympathies to the family. I thank the Senator for \nhis rendition of his State's fortitude. My State is working with \nfortitude right now too in the Oso-Darrington mudslides, and \nperseverance is a good word.\n  So I thank him.\n  Mr. MORAN. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                    Excellence in Mental Health Act\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we took an important step today to \nimprove the lives of millions of Americans who deal with mental \nillness. I am talking about the Excellence in Mental Health Act, which \nwas included in the provisions of the legislation we just passed this \nevening.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Stabenow and Blunt, for their \nleadership on this bill. Senator Stabenow just gave a very passionate \nhistory of why she has been so involved with this issue. People may not \nrealize that she has been working on this since 2005. So I thank her \nfor that leadership because around here it takes time to get things \ndone, and she has never forgotten how important this is for those with \nmental illness and the loved ones and family members who care about \nthem.\n  This legislation was bipartisan legislation, and that certainly \nhelped us get the bill passed. It was something I was happy to \ncosponsor with Senator Stabenow when we worked it through the committee \nand then also when we tried to get it included in this latest package. \nSo I am proud to be here tonight to thank her and Senator Blunt for \ntheir leadership in getting this done.\n  This legislation improves access to community health centers and \nleads to better quality of care. It will give access to those \nparticipating States that are fortunate enough to be in this first \nphase of a pilot program, and it will help local governments and health \ncare systems that are all plagued by these challenges. Most \nimportantly, it will help save lives.\n  Community mental health treatment centers are struggling because they \nare trying to meet the demand and do so within the balance of their \nbudgets. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, States \nhave cut more than $1.6 billion in mental health funds since 2009. So \nhere we are with a very pervasive problem and budget tightening, which, \nobviously, causes big challenges. What are those challenges? Basically \ntoo many people falling through the cracks.\n  Nationally, more than half of those with serious mental disorders \ndon't get the treatment they need to lead productive healthy lives. In \nmy State, the State of Washington, 55 percent of those with mental \nillness are not getting treatment. That translates to 500,000 people \nwho are not getting the help they need, according to the Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Service Administration. When they reach a \ncrisis point, it is not just a burden on them and their families but on \nour communities, our hospitals, and our criminal justice systems. As a \nresult, our jails and our emergency rooms have become the mental health \nclinic of last resort.\n  As the Tacoma News Tribune wrote in a recent editorial, ``Jails and \nprisons have become our de facto mental institutions.''\n  Not only is that approach ineffective, it is also extremely \nexpensive. It means local governments spend more for housing and court \nservices and medication and treatment of the mentally ill while in \ntheir custody. For emergency rooms it means they fill up with mentally \nill patients they are often ill equipped to deal with.\n  In Washington we have seen a dramatic rise in psychiatric boarding--\nor warehousing. Boarding happens when involuntarily committed patients \nmust wait for hours in a hospital emergency room because psychiatric \nfacilities have no open beds.\n  A recent investigation by the Seattle Times found that boarding has \nbecome routine in our State, ``traumatizing thousands of mentally ill \nresidents, wreaking havoc on hospitals, and wasting millions [in] \ntaxpayer dollars.'' Patients are ``frequently parked in hallways or \nbound to beds, usually given medication but otherwise no psychiatric \ncare.''\n  This report is the basis of why this legislation is so important. The \nreport also talked about financial costs. Boarding costs Washington \nState's health care system $10.5 million a year, according to the \nState.\n  I believe we can do better, and this legislation helps us do that. We \ncan support proven models that improve efficiency and reduce spending. \nOne such model is this legislation we just passed--community -based \ncare that focuses on prevention, early intervention, and coordination \nbetween providers. All of that is why the legislation is so important. \nIt helps increase efficiency while bolstering the community health \ncenters with increased Medicaid support.\n  It will also enable the State to improve the quality and range of \nservices. It requires the State to certify community mental health \ncenters and meet higher standards. Some of those services would be \nthings such as 24-hour crisis management, screening assessments and \ndiagnosis, outpatient mental health substance abuse services, \noutpatient primary care screenings to monitor the indicators of health \nconditions, peer support and counseling, better coordination with \nveterans' clinics, acute care hospitals, and inpatient psychiatric and \nsubstance abuse services.\n  All of these are missing in our communities, and oftentimes those \nindividuals end up, as I just said, in either the emergency room of a \nhospital or in a jail. Currently, there are no standards for mental \nhealth services in community health facilities. States that will \nparticipate in this program will be able to get a Medicaid \nreimbursement equal to what federally qualified health centers receive \nfor primary care services.\n  This is so important, and something Senator Stabenow mentioned--\nputting this on equal footing. More than 50 mental health, medical, and \nlaw enforcement groups and organizations supported this important \nlegislation because it is what they need to help do their job in these \ncommunities. Some of those organizations that supported this \nlegislation are the National Sheriffs' Association, the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, the American Psychological \nAssociation, the American Medical Association, and the American \nFoundation for Suicide Prevention.\n  In Washington we have seen how some of these community-based services \nare paying off. In rural central Washington, the counties of Yakima, \nKittitas, and Klickitat have reduced their hospitalization through \nstrengthening outpatient services and investing in early intervention \nprograms, such as community treatment teams that meet with patients in \ntheir homes.\n  This region in my State now has the lowest per capita psychiatric \nhospitalizations, according to an editorial in the Seattle Times just \nlast week. This demonstration project builds on what we already know \ncan be successes.\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\n  Clearly, we have a lot of work to do, but this important legislation \nwill help us be smarter about community-based care that will keep \npeople out of the emergency rooms and out of our jails, keeping them \nfrom becoming the mental health clinics of last resort.\n  As Chris Imhoff, an official with the Washington State Department of \nSocial and Health Services, remarked:\n\n       It's exciting for a community when something like this \n     happens. . . . It helps us not strand people with psychiatric \n     emergencies in emergency rooms, which is a good thing.\n\n  That is why this legislation is taking us in the right direction. So \nagain, I thank the Senators from Michigan and Missouri for their \nleadership on this legislation. It is so important we got it passed, \nand, hopefully, now it will move towards the President's desk and \nimplementation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/31/senate-section/article/S1866-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Mr. President, March 21 was the 21st anniversary of World \nWater Day. On this day, we call attention to the centrality of water in \nour lives and communities, and we recognize the vital work that must \ncontinue to ensure that every person has access to clean water and \nsanitation.\n  The acute challenges in improving access to clean water and \nsanitation in developing countries are well known. Nearly 800 million \npeople lack clean water and more than 2 billion people are without \nbasic sanitation. In a world of increasing water scarcity and climate \nunpredictability, the risks associated with an unstable water supply \nwill only intensify. A wide assortment of global health and development \nchallenges can be traced directly, or indirectly, to a lack of access \nto clean water and integrated water resource management.\n  In recent years, the depth and pervasiveness of these problems have \ngained increasing attention. In 2000, the U.S. signed the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, one of which seeks to halve the number of people \nwithout access to clean water and basic sanitation by 2015. This \nattention has also led to the formation of international partnerships \nsuch as Water and Sanitation for All in 2012, of which the United \nStates is an active member. As projections stand now, the MDG clean \nwater target has already been met while there is still a long way to go \nin reaching the sanitation goal by 2015.\n  The United States has long been a leader in supporting efforts to \nimprove global access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and \nwater resource management. The Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of \n2005, a bill which I strongly supported, was the first major \nlegislation enacted to make access to clean water and sanitation a U.S. \nforeign policy priority. Each year, as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on the Department of State and Foreign Operations, I have \nincluded increasing amounts of funding to implement the Paul Simon Act.\n  We should reflect on the legacy of the late Senator Simon and take a \nmoment to recognize and appreciate his contributions to making clean \nwater a development priority. His work is carried on through the \nprograms and policies of the legislation that bears his name.\n  On World Water Day, we should also recognize the indispensable work \nthat has been done by governments, NGO's, and private companies to \nprovide access to clean water and sanitation. I have visited Haiti \nthree times in recent years to inspect the work of rebuilding crucial \ninfrastructure, shattered by the earthquake. My wife Marcelle worked \nfor many years as a registered nurse. In 2012 she saw, firsthand, some \nof these vital clean water and sanitation initiatives. A nonprofit \norganization, Pure Water for the World, based in Rutland, VT, \nimplements a sustainable model for clean water programs in developing \ncountries by building low-cost water filtration systems, installing \nlatrines to improve sanitation, and providing hygiene education in \nlocal communities.\n  We must also realize how much work is still left to do in this area \nof development, and understand that to tackle 21st century problems we \nneed innovative solutions. The release of the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development's new water strategy last year was an \nimportant step, especially with its focus on sustainability and \nenhanced monitoring and evaluation of projects.\n  I will continue to support USAID's work to carry out its mission and \nthe strategic objectives in the water strategy. More than $365 million \nwas included for WASH programs in the 2014 omnibus appropriations bill \nthat was signed into law on January 17. Congress should also pass the \nWater for the World Act, which would give USAID additional tools to \naddress these critical issues.\n  Lastly, I want to highlight the theme of this year's World Water Day, \nwhich is ``water and energy.'' The links between water and energy \ncannot be ignored. Nearly eight percent of all global energy is used to \ntransport, pump, and treat water for a variety of consumers, while \nenergy generation and transmission also requires massive water \nresources. With more than a billion people also lacking access to \nelectricity, we need to address both these issues together.\n  World Water Day reminds us how fortunate we are in the United States \nto be able to turn on a faucet and have clean water, because for many \nhundreds of millions of people this luxury is not close to a reality. \nWhile we have made progress in bringing clean water and sanitation to \nmillions across the world, there is still much work to be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/31/senate-section/article/S1866-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1866-S1867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN Mr. President, on March 14, 2014, a popular teacher named \nMichelle Wilcox got into an argument. People get into arguments all the \ntime. It is part of life. But this argument ended, as all too many do \naround our Nation, in tragedy: suddenly, the man with whom Ms. Wilcox \nhad been arguing pulled out a firearm, chased after her, shot her, and \nleft her body in a grassy patch near a preschool.\n  In this case, as in so many others, the presence of a gun turned an \nordinary altercation into a horrific murder. Had a firearm not been \npresent, Ms. Wilcox might have been able to walk away that fateful \nmorning--frustrated, angry, but alive. Instead, she was murdered, her \nhusband of 12 years now awaits trial, and their child has lost its \nmother. A momentary bad decision ended one life and has irrevocably \nchanged so many more.\n  We may not know if anything could have prevented this tragedy, but we \ndo know that this grim scene repeats itself all around our Nation, \nalmost every day. Statistics compiled by the Law Center to Prevent Gun \nViolence show an indisputable correlation between domestic violence \nincidents and firearms: that, for instance, abused women are ``five \ntimes more likely to be killed by their abuser if the abuser owns a \nfirearm.'' Other statistics indicate that domestic violence assaults \ninvolving a gun are ``23 times more likely to result in death'' than \nthose involving other weapons, and that over ``two-thirds of spouse and \nex-spouse homicide victims in a 28-year span were killed with \nfirearms.'' And in 2011, almost two-thirds of women killed with guns \nwere killed by their intimate partners.\n  These sad figures show the importance of keeping firearms out of the \nhands of domestic abusers. But all too often, our Nation's system to \nprevent such dangerous individuals from getting guns fails. It failed \nin the case of Christen Naujoks, a student at the University of North \nCarolina. For a brief time in 2004, Ms. Naujoks dated another student, \nJohn Peck, before ending the relationship. Mr. Peck had previously been \nconvicted of sexually assaulting another woman, and as a result was \nlegally prohibited from purchasing a gun. This didn't stop him, \nhowever, from exploiting a loophole in current law that allows \nindividuals to purchase guns from private sellers' without undergoing a \nbackground check. Mr. Peck bought an assault rifle from a private \nseller, and on June 4, 2004, murdered Ms. Naujoks by shooting her 11 \ntimes in front of her apartment building. Three days later, Mr.\n\n[[Page S1867]]\n\nPeck committed suicide during a police shootout.\n  There is legislation pending before the Senate that, if enacted, \ncould prevent future convicted domestic abusers from evading background \nchecks to buy murder weapons. These bills could be the critical \ndifference in preventing another domestic argument from becoming \nsomething so much worse. We owe it to the memory of victims of domestic \nviolence around this country to take every step possible to prevent \nsimilar incidents in the future. I urge my colleagues to pass gun \nsafety legislation that closes the gun show loophole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/31/senate-section/article/S1867-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             2014 OLYMPIANS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, every 4 years elite athletes from across \nthe globe gather together to share their prodigious talent and skill \nwith a world audience through friendly competition. This year's Winter \nGames in Sochi, Russia was no different. Indeed, it is a tradition \nfamilies across the Nation have gathered together to watch on TV and \nshared for generations.\n  We are transfixed by the Winter Olympics and the athletes who take \npart for many reasons. We enjoy the intense competition that is the \nhallmark of the games. We enjoy the gravity-defying athletes who only \nseem to get more daring with each passing year. And, we enjoy the speed \nand precision that is required to excel at the Olympic level. There are \nalso many personal and heartwarming stories of triumph and perseverance \nthat are highlighted at the games. They remind us of what is possible. \nWe witness athletes both in victory and defeat, but always at their \nbest. We admire their journey and the Olympic spirit that is embodied \nby each of them.\n  To become an Olympian is no easy task. Each athlete has sacrificed \nmuch to earn a spot at the Olympics. These games and the performances \nwe bear witness to are often the capstone of careers that have spanned \nmany years and are the product of an enormous amount of training, \ndedication, and focus. This year, as in years past, we glimpsed into \nthe lives of these athletes, which includes parents, coaches and family \nmembers who shaped these athletes from the very beginning, spending \ncountless hours and effort in training, travelling from competition to \ncompetition, and molding young athletes into the competitors we see \nbefore us.\n  The Winter Olympics seamlessly blends the events and traditions we \nhave come to enjoy for many years with newer, fresher disciplines that \nleave us in awe and bravely test our limits. Young people are shaped by \nthese moments. Some will even grow up and follow this impressive path.\n  Michigan was well-represented at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. One \narea where Michigan shined was in ice dancing. Impressively, 15 of the \n24 teams participating in the ice dancing trained in metro Detroit in \none of three rinks: the Detroit Skating Club, Novi Ice Arena, and \nArctic Edge in Canton, which is where the Gold and Silver Medal teams \ntrained. This reflects the level of coaching and talent that resides in \nMichigan.\n  There were many inspired performances at these games. Fittingly, the \ncouple that captured our imagination for the second straight Olympic \nGames, Meryl Davis and Charlie White, capped their Olympic career with \na captivating, Gold Medal performance in ice dancing, adding this to \ntheir Silver Medal performance in 2010 and their team Bronze in Sochi. \nThe list of ice dancers with strong ties to Michigan is long and \nincludes Maia Shibutani, Alex Shibutani, Evan Bates, Madison Chock, \nTessa Virtue, Scott Moir, Kaitlyn Weaver, Andrew Poje, Alexandra Paul, \nMitch Islam, Anna Cappellini, Luca Lanotte, Charlene Guignard, Marco \nFabbri, Nathalie Pechalat, Fabian Bourzat, Pernelle Carron, Lloyd \nJones, Nelli Zhiganshina, Alexander Gazsi, Julia Zlobina, Alexei \nSitnikov, Isabella Tobias, Deividas Stagniunas, Danielle O'Brien, Greg \nMerrian, Cathy Reed and Chris Reed.\n  Olympic hockey also showcased the talent Michigan has to offer. \nPlayers with ties to Michigan represented a number of different \ncountries. They included Americans Ryan Miller, Ryan Kessler, Cam \nFowler, Jimmy Howard, Patrick Kane, Phil Kessel, Justin Faulk, Kevin \nShattenkirk, Ryan Suter, James van Riemsdyk, Max Pacioretty and Dan \nBylsma. Those who skated for other countries included Henrik \nZetterberg, Daniel Alfredsson, Niklas Kronwall, Jonathon Ericsson, \nJohan Franzen, Jonas Gustavsson, Pavel Datsyuk, Tomas Tatar, Tomas \nJurco, Duncan Keith, Chris Kunitz, Mike Babcock and Brian Lebler. Each \nmade a significant contribution and provided us ample reason to be \nproud.\n  In addition to these incredible athletes are Narumi Takahashi, \nRyuichi Kihara, Jeremy Abbott, Valentina Marchei and Patrick Chan who \ncompeted admirably in figure skating. Jessica Smith, Jilleanne Rookard, \nShani Davis, Jordan Malone, Kyle Carr, Chris Creveling and Anthony \nLobello graced the speed skating track. And there were snowboarders \nKarly Shorr, Danny Davis and Nick Bumgartner whose style and flair was \nunmistakable.\n  Rounding out Michigan's contribution in Sochi was Lauryn Williams, a \nSummer Olympic star who became the first woman, and fifth person \noverall, to medal in both the Summer and Winter Olympics. Her Silver as \npart of a two-person bobsled team was one of the most memorable moments \nof the games.\n  I join many across Michigan in congratulating each of these athletes. \nIt was gratifying to watch and reminds us all, especially young people \nacross Michigan, that reaching for the stars, or in this case the \nOlympics, is firmly within their grasp. As one Olympic figure skater so \naptly put it, ``To be able to come up here and feel stiff and white as \na ghost but stare fear in the face is what I'm all about.'' That's the \ntrue Olympic spirit we tune in to watch, and that is a fitting way to \ndescribe the grit, grace, and athletic prowess we witnessed day after \nday in Sochi. This is why I am delighted to honor these athletes here \ntoday by placing their names in the Congressional Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/31/senate-section/article/S1867-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CATHY MYERS\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and thank Cathy \nMyers--a valued member of my staff who left Senate service today after \n35 years on Capitol Hill.\n  Cathy has worked in Congress since 1979 when she was hired to serve \nas a secretary in the office of Congressman Samuel Devine of Ohio. She \nsubsequently held the same position in the office of Congressman Gene \nSnyder of Kentucky, and first came to the Senate in 1983, when she took \na job as secretary to Senator Bob Kasten of Wisconsin.\n  In 1993, Cathy went to work for New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg, \nserving as his executive assistant for 18 years. Senator Gregg is well-\nknown in the Granite State for his service to constituents, and Cathy \nplayed an indispensable role in helping him stay in close contact with \nthe people of New Hampshire.\n  When Senator Gregg retired, I was so pleased that she agreed to \ncontinue serving the people of New Hampshire as a member of my \nWashington staff. Cathy has been so helpful to me as I have gotten my \nSenate office up and running. She does a tremendous job keeping the \ntrains running on time, and I have been so deeply grateful for her \ndedicated service.\n  During the 3 years Cathy worked as a member of my staff, I have also \nappreciated her personal warmth and generous spirit. Cathy is perhaps \nbest known in my office for the candy dish she keeps on her desk, which \nis always stocked with chocolates. It is no secret that Cathy has a \nsweet tooth, and she has been so kind to share her candy with the rest \nof the office.\n  Cathy Myers has served the people of New Hampshire and the Senate \nwith honor and distinction. On behalf of all those whose lives Cathy \nhas touched in the Granite State and on Capitol Hill, I wish her the \nvery best as she starts this new chapter in her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/31/senate-section/article/S1867-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1867-S1868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ZEV YAROSLAVSKY\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Zev \nYaroslavsky, who is retiring at the end of this year, after a \ndistinguished and illustrious career spanning 40 years as a public \nservant in the State of California. We wish to extend to Mr. \nYaroslavsky our sincere\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\ncongratulations for the decades of dedicated service that he has given \nto his Nation, his State, his city, and his county.\n  Mr. Yaroslavsky was first elected to the Los Angeles County Board of \nSupervisors in 1994 and is in the final year of his fifth term on the \nBoard. He has served as chair of the Board, which is rotated annually \namong the supervisors, four times. For the past 20 years, he has \nrepresented the Third Supervisorial District, where he will be \nremembered as a devoted public servant who amassed numerous \naccomplishments and innumerable awards.\n  Mr. Yaroslavsky represents nearly 2 million residents in his \ndistrict. His efforts primarily have focused on fiscal, health care, \ntransportation, the environment, veterans affairs, homelessness, and \nthe arts. Prior to representing the Third Supervisorial District, he \nserved on the Los Angeles City Council from 1975 to 1994 to which he \nwas elected and re-elected six times.\n  As a Los Angeles City councilman, Mr. Yaroslavsky honed his fiscal \nskills as the respected chair of the Council's Finance Committee, and \nhe also earned a reputation as a politician who was willing to take on \nissues that others would not, including the highly controversial \nexcessive use of force and intelligence gathering policies of the Los \nAngeles Police Department. As councilman, he also co-authored two \nlandmark initiatives with his colleague, the late Councilman Marvin \nBraude: Proposition U (1986) which cut by half the commercial \ndevelopment rights adjacent to residential neighborhoods, and \nProposition O (1988) which repealed a drilling permit previously issued \nto the Occidental Petroleum Company.\n  Most notably, a few of his major accomplishments as supervisor \ninclude authoring the 1996 Proposition `A' park bond that resulted in \nthe preservation of rural open space and the development of urban parks \nthroughout the county. He also authored the 2002 Proposition `B' trauma \ntax, approved by over 73 percent of county voters, which is largely \ncredited with stabilizing the county's health care finances.\n  Mr. Yaroslavsky was the driving force behind the Orange Line busway \nacross the San Fernando Valley which opened in 2005 to record ridership \n(22,000 daily boardings). He led the effort to rebuild and modernize \nthe world famous Hollywood Bowl amphitheater which re-opened in 2004, \nand he was instrumental in the development of Walt Disney Concert Hall, \nthe home of the L.A. Philharmonic Orchestra, which opened in 2003. He \nhas also helped fund major investments in the L.A. County Museum of Art \nand the County's Museum of Natural History. He is regarded as the \ncounty's fiscal watchdog, insisting that it live within its means.\n  Since 1991, Mr. Yaroslavsky has also been associated with the \nNational Democratic Institute for International Affairs, NDI, a non-\ngovernmental organization headquartered in Washington, DC, that \npromotes the development of democratic institutions in burgeoning \ndemocracies. He has monitored three international elections for NDI: \nRomania (1990), Mexico (2000), and Ukraine (2004). He also has \nconducted seminars on democratic institution-building in Russia, \nUkraine, Turkey, and Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n  While these are just some of Zev Yaroslavsky's significant \naccomplishments, on behalf of the U.S. Senate and the State of \nCalifornia, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for his inestimable \ncontributions throughout his renowned career. With sincere best wishes, \nwe congratulate Mr. Yaroslavsky upon his retirement from the Los \nAngeles County Board of Supervisors. We are pleased to join his many \nco-workers, family, friends, and associates in wishing him health, \nhappiness, and continued good fortune in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/31/senate-section/article/S1868-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ASSOCIATION OF JEWISH AGING SERVICES\n\n Mr. NELSON.

Mr. President, I wish to commemorate and \ncelebrate the life and contributions of Dr. Joab Langston Thomas of \nTuscaloosa, AL, who served as chief executive officer of three of the \ncountry's well established public universities, including the \nUniversity of Alabama, Pennsylvania State University, and North \nCarolina State University. We too often fail to appreciate the \ncontributions our university leaders make to our State's and Nation's \nprogress. We often think of these leaders as people unconnected to our \nStates and constituents. But as I have known our university leaders in \nAlabama, such is not the case. They are men and women of stability, \ncommon sense, and management skills. Dr. Thomas was no exception.\n  Dr. Thomas was a native of the wonderful small Alabama town of \nRussellville. His integrity, work ethic, and native ability were \noutstanding, and he translated those qualities into three degrees in \nbiological science from Harvard University, where he was a member of \nthe Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi academic honor societies. In 1961, he \nbecame a member of the biology faculty at the University of Alabama.\n  In 1981, Dr. Thomas became the president of the University of \nAlabama. Dr. Thomas is credited with tripling UA's research funding, \nleading a major fund-raising campaign, raising admission and curriculum \nstandards, building economic development initiatives that saved local \njobs and improving relations with the State legislature, resulting in \nincreased State funding for the university. He also established a \nuniversity-wide honors program and initiated the highly successful \nPresidential Scholars program to help recruit top students to \nUniversity of Alabama.\n  In the words of University of Alabama's current chancellor, Robert \nWitt, ``From his days as a teaching fellow at Harvard to his tenure at \nthe helm of three of America's premier public universities, Joab Thomas \nwas at the forefront as a leader in higher education. His research \nfocus and emphasis on excellence inspired all of us who were fortunate \nto follow in his footsteps.''\n  Dr. Thomas was an outstanding university president and was held in \nthe highest esteem and affection by the many people he served so ably. \nI ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Thomas for his \ndedication and many contributions to public universities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/31/senate-section/article/S1868-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1868-S1869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO EDITH MILDRED TAYLOR\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \nto recognize the 102nd birthday of an incredible Virginian, Edith \nMildred Taylor. Edith was born on April Fools' Day in 1912, which could \nhelp explain her lifelong good nature and reputation for well-executed \npranks, including once wrapping a live mouse as a birthday gift for her \nteenaged sister.\n  Edith was born on a farm in Culpeper and has lived there for all of \nher 102 years. As a young widow, she raised Sarah Ellen Taylor while \nworking at the Culpeper Baptist Nursing Home, caring for seniors and \nundoubtedly brightening the days of many. After many decades of service \nto Virginia seniors, she retired to care for her 90-year-old father, \nwho also lived into his 100th year.\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\n  Edith loves animals and plants, and is a vegetarian, although I have \nbeen told she refuses to admit it.

A bill to amend the Act of June 18, 1934, to reaffirm the \nauthority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for \nIndian tribes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ncorrect a historical wrong.\n  My legislation is a necessary amendment to the Indian Reorganization \nAct of June 18, 1934. It addresses a Supreme Court ruling that was, in \nmy opinion, wrong.\n  On February 24, 2009, the Supreme Court issued its decision in the \nCarcieri v. Salazar case. In that decision the Supreme Court held that \nthe Secretary of the Interior exceeded his authority in taking land \ninto trust for a tribe that was not under Federal jurisdiction, or \nrecognized, at the time the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted in \n1934.\n  It has now been 5 years since that decision. This decision has had a \nsignificant impact on tribes in every part of this country, whether it \nis the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, which is facing spurious \nlitigation over its status as a tribe; the Samish Tribe of Washington, \nwhich has been waiting 4 years for a Carcieri determination; or the \nLittle Shell Tribe of my home State of Montana, who could be affected \nby this ruling if they are granted Federal recognition, as they should \nbe.\n  Moreover, the Carcieri decision has spawned more harmful litigation, \nincluding Salazar v. Patchak, where the Supreme Court ruled that \nindividuals have 6 years to challenge a tribe's trust land acquisition, \nand Big Lagoon Rancheria v. California, where the Ninth Circuit \nessentially ruled that there is no time limit on challenging a tribe's \nstatus or its trust land acquisitions.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is a necessary step in the \nprocess to reaffirm the Secretary's authority to take land into trust \nfor tribes, regardless of when they were recognized by the Federal \nGovernment. The amendment ratifies the prior trust acquisitions of the \nSecretary, who, for the past 75 years, has been exercising the \nauthority to take lands into trust, as intended by the Indian \nReorganization Act.\n  Perhaps the most serious impact for tribes if Congress lets this \ndecision stand is the creation of two classes of tribes--those who were \nrecognized as of 1934, whose rights and status are secure, and those \nwho were recognized after 1934, whose rights and status can be \nperpetually challenged. Allowing two classes of tribes is unacceptable \nand is contrary to prior Acts of this Congress. In 1994, Congress \npassed the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act to ensure that \nall tribes are treated equally, regardless of their date of \nrecognition.\n  Finally, I know that there are a number of my colleagues who have an \ninterest in this legislation and would like to see changes to this \nbill. I want to let you know that I stand ready to work with each of \nyou to craft a bill that the\n\n[[Page S1873]]\n\nSenate can enact and that will end this problem of two classes of \ntribes forever.\n  I want to thank Senators Moran, Udall of New Mexico, Begich, \nHeitkamp, Murray, Heinrich, and my fellow Montana Senator Walsh, for \ntheir support on this legislation.

Denton III, \n     William C. Denton, Donald A. Denton, James S. Denton, Michael \n     C. Denton, Madeleine D. Doak, and Mary D.
