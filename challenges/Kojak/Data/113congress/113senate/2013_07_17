Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 124.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 124, S. 1238, a bill to \n     amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend the current \n     reduced interest rate for undergraduate Federal Direct \n     Stafford Loans for 1 year, and to modify required \n     distribution rules for pension plans, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Following my remarks and those of the Republican leader, we \nwill proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Fred \nHochberg to be president of the very important Export-Import Bank. At \n10 a.m. there will be a cloture vote on the Hochberg nomination.\n  Following that, if cloture is invoked, we will have, as a result of \nsome rules changes made earlier this year, 8 hours of debate. I doubt \nseriously if the Democrats will take any of their time, so we should be \nable to finish that sometime soon and have a vote on his confirmation, \nif we invoke cloture.\n  We then have left on the calendar for this week the Secretary of \nLabor and the head of the EPA. So we should be able to finish that \ntomorrow.\n\n\n                           Senate Friendships\n\n  Mr. President, I am so glad to see the Presiding Officer in the \nChair. For those who perhaps are not aware, Senator Levin is a long-\ntime Member of the Senate, and he has decided not to run again, which \nis very sad for the State of Michigan, the Senate, and the country, but \nthat is the decision he made.\n  I had the good fortune--and he has heard me say this before, but I \nwill say it again because I will never forget this--of coming to the \nCongress in 1982, with Senator Levin's brother--his older brother--and \nso the first time I met Senator Carl Levin I was contemplating whether \nI should run for the Senate, after having served in the House. At the \nvery beginning of our visit--a visit in Senator Levin's office--I said \nto him: I know your brother. He and I came to Congress together a few \nyears ago. Carl looked at me so intently and so seriously and said: \nYes, he is my brother, but he is also my best friend. Well, having \nthree brothers of my own, that was something that always stuck with me.\n  Senator Levin is our Presiding Officer today, and it doesn't happen \nvery often, so we appreciate that. Our more senior Members don't \npreside as often as the more junior Members.\n  I also want to say, with this man in the chair, that we just had one \nof those rare occasions where the senior Senator from Michigan and I \ndisagreed. The disagreement we had had nothing to do with us and \neverything to do with positions we had taken. We need not get into what \nthe difference was--it was something dealing with the Senate and had \nnothing to do with our personalities--but I will say, as a result of \nthe efforts of Senator Levin, I am sure he is as pleased as I am with \nwhat happened here in the Senate in the last couple of days.\n  For a number of reasons, not the least of which is the input of the \nSenator from Michigan, we have now started a new era--I hope a new \nnormal era--here in the Senate where Senators, instead of talking past \neach\n\n[[Page S5718]]\n\nother, start talking to each other. So I want to publicly state I \nappreciate the Senator from Michigan for many different reasons.\n\n  Senator Levin has been a long-time protector of our military, as the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. I am not an expert on what is \nhappening in that committee, but I do know that during the more than \nthree decades I have been in Congress no one has been more vigilant and \ncaring about the men and women who serve in our military. So I admire, \nappreciate, and have great affection for the Presiding Officer.\n  The burdens we as leaders here in the Senate have--and I was \nreflecting on this as I was walking in here this morning--whether it is \nthe Armed Services Committee or the things I am called upon to do, are \nso minimal compared to the burdens of the President of the United \nStates--whoever the President of the United States happens to be. But \nlet's focus on Barack Obama. Every day he gets up for a briefing about \nwhat is going on around the world, and there are so many things going \non around the world that are so difficult--for him, for us as a \ncountry, and for the world. The problems we have here at home, as the \nleader of the superpower that we are, he has to deal with every day.\n  I had a visit with the President yesterday on the telephone. After we \nworked out an arrangement here in the Senate that was pleasing to \nvirtually everybody, he called me and said: Thanks. I know it was a lot \nof hard work--and all that stuff. But I commented to him: We all \nrealize the burdens that you bear. And I think we do. If we pause and \nthink for a minute, it is easy to understand the heavy burdens this man \nbears.\n  We all know what a fine human being he is, and we have watched him, \nas we have seen all Presidents change before our eyes, this vibrant \nyoung man who served here in the Senate with us, with his coal-black \nhair, and now, after a few years, that hair is similar to that of \nmyself and Senator Levin. He is still vibrant and strong, but he has a \nlot of burdens on his shoulders. Having worked with him as closely as I \nhave, I have such understanding of what I think he goes through--at \nleast somewhat of an understanding and some empathy for what he goes \nthrough.\n  Maybe somebody at the White House will pass him a copy of this \nexchange between the Presiding Officer and myself and they will tell \nhim how much we in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans--the \nRepublicans may disagree with him politically, but I don't think you \ncan find a Republican who doesn't admire him as a good human being.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Mr. President, would you announce the business of the day?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/17/senate-section/article/S5718-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5718-S5737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF FRED P.

On this vote, the yeas are 82, \nthe nays are 18. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Pursuant to S. Res. 15 of the 113th Congress, there is now 8 hours of \npostcloture debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Who yields time?\n  If no one yields, the time will be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise to speak for a few moments about \nthe cloture vote we just had and the confirmation vote that is \nupcoming.\n  First of all, let me start by saying I think Mr. Hochberg is a good, \ncapable, and competent person. The point I am making is that the \ncandidate for President of the Ex-Im Bank, for whom we just granted \ncloture and are likely to confirm, is a capable individual.\n\n  I voted against cloture, and I am going to vote against this \nconfirmation. It is not about him. I wish to explain what this is about \nfor me and why I think this is a lost opportunity. Precisely, it is \nthis: By invoking cloture, as we have just done, and confirming Mr. \nHochberg, as we are no doubt about to do, I think we are going to miss \na big opportunity to insist on some modest reforms that are necessary \nat the Ex-Im Bank and we are going to miss an opportunity to pressure \nthe administration and the Ex-Im Bank to follow existing law in ways \nthat are not currently being followed. I wish to touch on a couple of \nthese.\n  First of all, just by way of background, a reminder about the Ex-Im \nBank: This is a taxpayer risk. This is a bank that makes taxpayer-\nbacked loans and guarantees to countries and companies that buy \nAmerican products. In 2012 we reauthorized the ongoing existence of the \nEx-Im Bank and increased its lending authority to $140\n\n[[Page S5719]]\n\nbillion. Now, not only are taxpayers taking a risk every time a loan is \nmade by the Ex-Im Bank, but the taxpayers are systematically being \nundercompensated for that loan. The pricing on these loans is \nnecessarily not reflective of the full risk to the taxpayer. How do we \nknow that? Because if they were fully pricing in the risk, then the Ex-\nIm Bank wouldn't have a competitive advantage over other private banks. \nThey would be more than happy to finance exports. In fact, the export \nbank exists for the purpose of subsidizing these exports, and they do \nit in the form of consciously and intentionally underpricing the loans \nso that the taxpayers do not get an adequate compensation and certainly \nnot a market compensation for the risk they take. That is just the \nreality. That is the nature of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  I would also point out that Ex-Im Bank's inspector general issued a \nreport in September about some of the issues they discovered in the \nmanagement of the Ex-Im Bank. They recommended that the Ex-Im Bank \nundergo stress testing. We require this of all of the big private \nfinancial institutions. They require that they go through all kinds of \nanalyses about what would happen to their institutions under different \neconomic and market circumstances that could occur, and then we \nevaluate how well they hold up to the stress of changes in interest \nrates, changes in economic conditions, and so on. The Ex-Im Bank has \npromised they will do this, but we haven't seen any results.\n  The inspector general also suggested some at least soft limits on \nconcentration because the Ex-Im Bank is massively concentrated in a \nsingle industry. Almost all of the financing it provides is in a single \nindustry, and that creates a risk to the taxpayers, of course, if there \nis a problem in that industry. The Ex-Im Bank has rejected considering \nany concentration limits.\n  The third thing I would point out is that the inspector general's \nreport suggested that the board have more oversight authority. The Ex-\nIm Bank has not agreed to increase the board's oversight authority.\n  There is another problem with the Ex-Im Bank, it seems to me; that \nis, by its very nature it picks winners and losers in ways that are \ninappropriate. I will give a few examples. Because it is a government \nentity, it is ultimately controlled by the political class and its \nactivities ultimately get politicized. It has already happened. For \ninstance, in an entity that is supposed to be all about subsidizing \nexports for job creation purposes, there are mandates that a certain \namount of their business has to be green activity. It has to be what \nsome people think is acceptable or preferable in the energy space. That \nis a judgment which has nothing to do with maximizing overall exports. \nIt is a political decision that is imposed on the Ex-Im Bank because \npoliticians can. There is also a mandate on small business, which is to \nfavor one sector over another.\n  There was an amendment when we were considering this bill. One of our \ncolleagues offered an amendment that would force the Ex-Im Bank to make \nsure a certain amount of their business was subsidized loans to African \ncompanies and countries. I am sure this Senator has a very sincere \ninterest in supporting Africa in various ways. That is fine if he has \nthat interest, but is the Ex-Im Bank the vehicle we are supposed to use \nto do that? Let's keep in mind that when we establish a minimum \nstatutory lending hurdle for some geographical area and Ex-Im is not \nthere, they have to lower their standards to reach that goal, so it \nincreases taxpayer risk for this political goal.\n  My point is that it is inevitable, it is guaranteed, it is already \nhappening that this process becomes politicized, and that is not a good \nidea.\n  There is another problem with the activity of the Ex-Im Bank, which \nis that taxpayer-backed loans and guarantees also inevitably help some \nAmerican companies at the expense of others. That is the nature of \nthis, and that is a problem. One clear example is commercial air \ncarriers. We have American companies that are airlines, they are \ncommercial carriers, and then there are foreign companies that do this \nas well, and they compete directly against American carriers. Well, if \nyou are a foreign airline, you get the Ex-Im Bank subsidy loan to buy \nyour aircraft, and if you are an American airline, you don't. This \nhappens. It happened recently. Air India got a $3.4 billion loan \nsubsidy from Ex-Im Bank so they can buy their aircraft, and Air India \ncompetes directly with American companies that are not eligible for the \nloans because it is not considered an export.\n  These are the sorts of unintended consequences that occur when the \ngovernment creates these mechanisms for meddling in the markets.\n  By the way, under current law the Ex-Im Bank is required to provide \nan analysis and make the analysis public about any adverse impact on \nAmerican companies when they engage in this sort of activity, and we \nhaven't seen that analysis. In fact, we have a court decision that \ncriticizes the Ex-Im Bank. The court of appeals found that they had, in \nfact, failed to comply with this law about assessing the negative \nfinancial impact on U.S. companies; nevertheless, they are continuing \nto make these loan guarantees in this context.\n  All of these problems have been discussed in the past. We have had \nthis debate before. One of the very constructive things we did in the \n2012 reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank was that we said: What \nis the reason--why do we do all of this? The proponents always give the \nsame argument--it is always the same--and it is that other countries \naround the world do this to subsidize their exports, and if we don't \nsubsidize ours we will be at a competitive disadvantage and we can't \nhave that.\n  That is the justification we always get. One can question the wisdom \nof that justification. We could have a big debate about that. But let's \nput that aside for a second because there is a potential solution to \nthat problem. It is that in global trade talks and bilateral and \nmultilateral trade talks, we, the United States--the world's biggest \ntrading country, the world's biggest economy--could insist on a process \nby which we have a mutual wind-down of this economically unhealthy \nactivity. The countries of the world that have these export-subsidizing \nbanks could mutually agree to phase them out. Then we wouldn't have to \ndo it because they do it, taxpayers wouldn't have this risk, and we \nwouldn't be unfairly benefiting some companies at the expense of \nothers. We could phase this out.\n  In fact, that is exactly what the 2012 authorization bill requires. \nIt requires the administration to begin negotiating with our trading \npartners for a mutual phaseout of all export subsidies. I believe that \nis the right solution to this admittedly difficult problem. Let's all \nagree we are going to phase out this activity.\n  Well, despite the fact that this mandate is in the reauthorization \nbill we passed a year ago--it is the law of the land--it is not \nhappening. It is just not happening. There are no such discussions \nunder way. There are no such negotiations. This is certainly not a \npriority of the administration's trading activity. I am not sure it \nexists at all as a priority. This is the main reason I came to the \nfloor this morning and voted against cloture.\n  Cloture--the requirement to get the 60 votes to cut off debate to \nthen consider the vote on the underlying nominee--is a very important \ntool. If we had held 41 votes, 41 Senators who refused to agree to cut \noff debate, the administration would have been in a little bit of a \npickle because by the end of this month, in the absence of a newly \nconfirmed President, the Ex-Im Bank couldn't do any business. So what \nwould have happened? Would the Ex-Im Bank have just shut down? No. That \nwasn't ever going to happen. But what might have happened is we might \nhave had a discussion: Can we get the administration to actually begin \nthe negotiating they are supposed to do under existing law? Could they \nplease begin to observe the law? Could the Ex-Im Bank actually begin to \nrespond to the inspector general's reports? And in the pressure, \nfrankly, of this moment, I think we would have had progress. Instead, \nwe have voted for cloture. I think later today we are going to vote to \nconfirm the nominee, who, as I said, is a very capable, very competent \nindividual. So none of this is going to happen. What we are going to do \nis confirm the status quo, continue business as usual, business as it \nhas been.\n\n[[Page S5720]]\n\n  This, of course, occurs in a context, right? It occurs in the context \nof this argument we have been having about whether Republicans have \nbeen obstructing nominees, and I think, frankly, it infects the \njudgment about how Senators might consider voting on something such as \na cloture measure. I would just remind everybody that going into this \ndiscussion earlier this week, the Senate had confirmed 1,560 of the \nPresident's nominees and was blocking 4--1,560 to 4. Some are \nsuggesting that is an outrageous activity on our part because it denies \nthe President the opportunity to assemble his team. Really? He has \n1,560 confirmed, and there are 4 we are holding. That works out to 99.7 \npercent of the President's nominees confirmed, and we are portrayed as \npreventing the President from assembling his team. I completely reject \nthat characterization. I think the President has enjoyed a tremendous \nopportunity and reality of getting his team in place, getting them \nconfirmed.\n  We ought not relinquish the power the Constitution gives to the \nSenate to advise and consent. Remember, the Constitution doesn't just \nsay that the Senate shall advise, it says advise and consent. \n``Consent'' has a very specific meaning. If we do this automatically \nand routinely and we think that--I guess those who object to our \napproving 1,560 and objecting to 4--it seems to me the implication is \nthat we are supposed to simply routinely rubberstamp everyone, there \ncan't be any objections ever, whatsoever. That is not what the \nConstitution calls for. As a matter of constitutional principle, that \nis a very flawed analysis.\n  I wanted to speak this morning because this is a very real, specific \ncase of where, had we exercised more fully, in my judgment, our \nopportunity to deny cloture, we would have made a little bit of \nprogress in better observation of existing law, further reducing risk \nthe taxpayers take, and getting the Ex-Im Bank to comply with some of \nthe recommendations in the inspector general's report. I wanted to \nshare that.\n  I know how this vote is going to go. I know Mr. Hochberg is going to \nbe confirmed. I hope we will be able to make progress anyway, but I am \nsure we would have had a better chance of making meaningful progress if \nwe had used this moment.\n  As we consider future nominees, I hope we will remember that this is \na fundamental and important role for the Senate to play--to use \nconfirmation as a moment to focus the attention of the administration \non what is important to our constituents, to our taxpayers, and I hope \nwe won't relinquish that opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, 2 weeks ago, while most Americans were busy \ngetting ready for the Fourth of July holiday, the Obama administration \nmade a stunning announcement about the President's signature \nlegislative accomplishment, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct.\n  The President admitted to the American people that because ObamaCare \nwas so poorly crafted, he was delaying the enforcement of the employer \nmandate and would not assess fines and penalties to big companies that \nrefused to provide insurance to their employees. The President \nexplained that businesses could not handle ``the complexity of the \nrequirements,'' and government bureaucrats would spend the next year \nsimplifying the reporting rules so companies could comply.\n  I expected that in the next paragraph he would acknowledge that \nAmerican families also deserve relief because, as polls consistently \nreflect, they have very big problems with the requirements as well. \nThey have concerns about the government-run health care scheme known as \nthe exchanges.\n  Henry Chao, the chief technical officer in charge of implementing the \nObamaCare exchanges, has said:\n\n       I'm pretty nervous. . . . Let's just make sure it's not a \n     third-world experience.\n\n  American families also have very grave concerns about how much \nObamaCare is going to add to our national debt. The Congressional \nBudget Office now estimates that the cost to taxpayers over the next 10 \nyears will be $1.8 trillion. Young Americans are particularly concerned \nabout ObamaCare because it is becoming clear that they will see the \nhighest increases in health care premiums.\n  One study published in the magazine of the American Academy of \nActuaries shows that middle- and low-income single adults between 21 \nand 29 years of age will see their premiums rise by 46 percent even \nafter they take the ObamaCare subsidy.\n  A joint report by Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce, \nSenate Finance, and Senate HELP Committees that looked at over 30 \ndifferent studies concluded that:\n\n       Recent college graduates with entry-level jobs who are \n     struggling to pay off student loan debt could see their \n     premiums increase on average between 145 and 189 percent. \n     Some studies estimate young adults could experience premium \n     increases as high as 203 percent.\n\n  In my State, the State of Utah, premiums for young people will jump \nanywhere from 56 to 90 percent. As I read this statement from the \nTreasury Department, I was shocked to find no mention of these people. \nParents, families, students, employees, taxpayers, hard-working \nAmericans in general were totally left out, along with their concerns \nabout the complexity of the requirements imposed by ObamaCare.\n  A senior adviser to the President took to the White House blog to \nspin the administration's announcement before long. She said:\n\n       In our ongoing discussions with businesses, we have heard \n     that you need time to get this right.\n\n  But why aren't American families part of these same ongoing \ndiscussions? Isn't the White House obligated to get this right for them \ntoo, before assessing fines and penalties and forcing them into a \ngovernment-run third-world experience?\n  We knew ObamaCare would be unaffordable, but now we know it is also \ngoing to be unfair. It is fundamentally unfair for the President to \nexempt businesses from the onerous burdens of his law while forcing \nAmerican families and individuals into ObamaCare's unsound and unstable \nsystem. It is unfair to protect the bottom lines of big business while \nmaking hard-working Americans pay the price through higher premiums, \nstiff penalties, cutbacks in worker hours, and job losses.\n  It is unfair to give businesses more time to figure out complex \nregulations but force everyone else to figure out equally complex \nmandates and requirements applicable to individuals. This \nadministration has chosen to put its own political preferences and the \ninterests of various government cronies ahead of those of the American \npeople.\n  Republicans in Congress must now stand up for the individuals and \nfamilies who do not have the money, who do not have the lobbyists, who \ndo not have the connections to get this administration's attention on \nthis important issue. We should do so using one of the few \nconstitutional powers that Congress still carefully guards: its power \nof the purse.\n  As long as President Obama selectively enforces ObamaCare, no annual \nappropriations bill and no continuing resolution should fund further \nimplementation of this law. In other words, if the President will not \nfollow it, the American people should not fund it.\n  Last week's admission by the administration means that after more \nthan 3 years of preparation and trial and error, the best case scenario \nfor ObamaCare will be rampant dysfunction, waste, and injustice to \ntaxpayers and working families. Even the President himself is now \nadmitting that ObamaCare will not work. It is unaffordable and unfair.\n  If he will not follow it, we should not fund it. The only reasonable \nchoice now is to protect the country from ObamaCare's looming disaster, \nstart over, and finally begin work on real health care reform that \nworks for everyone.\n\n  I would like to shift topics and speak briefly in opposition to the \nconfirmation of Fred Hochberg to continue as Chairman and President of \nthe Export-Import Bank. By confirming Mr. Hochberg, we would perpetuate \nthe existence of an organization whose sole purpose is to dispense \ncorporate welfare and political privileges to well-connected special \ninterests.\n  The Export-Import Bank, or Ex-Im as it is commonly known, is an \nexample of everything that is wrong with Washington today. It is big \ngovernment\n\n[[Page S5721]]\n\nserving the interests of big corporations at the expense of \nindividuals, families, and small businesses throughout America.\n  I am, of course, not alone in this view. I have good company. In \n2008, while campaigning for the office of President of the United \nStates, then-Senator Barack Obama referred to Ex-Im as ``little more \nthan a fund for corporate welfare.'' So it is. After all, in fiscal \nyear 2012, $12.2 billion of Ex-Im's $14.7 billion in loan guarantees \nwent to a single company--one company. Our free enterprise system may \nnot be perfect, but it is fair. Crony capitalism which is promoted by \nthe Export-Import Bank is neither.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said that the leading object of government was \nto ``lift artificial weights from all shoulders, to clear the paths of \nlaudable pursuit for all, to afford all an unfettered start and a fair \nchance in the race of life.''\n  Crony capitalism is the opposite of this noble vision. It lays on \nartificial waste, obstructs paths of laudable pursuit, and makes the \nrace of life fettered and unfair. We may have honest disagreements \nabout when and whether and to what extent and under what circumstances \nit is a good idea for the government to redistribute wealth from the \nrich and give it to the poor, but can't we all agree it is always a bad \nidea to redistribute wealth from the poor and the middle class and give \nit to large corporations?\n  The saddest part is it is not even clear the bank actually helps U.S. \nfirms to outperform their foreign competitors. Ex-Im's convoluted \nfinancing has been accused of pricing at least one U.S. airline out of \nbeing able to compete with foreign firms, and at least one court has \nagreed.\n  Cronyism is a cancer. It undermines public trust in our economy and \nin our political system. Ordinary Americans who have the gnawing sense \nthat the game seems rigged against them unfortunately have good reason \nto feel that way. It is not the free market that serves the middle men \nat the expense of the middle class. It is the crony cartels of big \ngovernment, big business, and big special interests conspiring against \nthe American dream, helping each other to American taxpayers' money. \nThe Ex-Im Bank is part of this graft.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in opposing this nominee and \nthe crony capitalist organization that he leads.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of Fred \nHochberg and his nomination to the second term as Chairman of the \nExport-Import Bank. I have heard now two speeches on the other side of \nthe aisle from my colleagues who not only seem to take exception with \nMr. Hochberg's nomination but the Export-Import Bank in and of itself.\n  I think they are wrong. I think they are wrong because they do not \nunderstand Washington's need to focus on the fact that we have an \nexport economy. We want U.S. products to be bought and sold in \ncountries and markets all over the world. We are here today to talk \nabout a critical vote to support 225,000 jobs that are part of our \nexport economy. If we fail to confirm Fred Hochberg for a second term \nas Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, businesses across the United \nStates will lose a key tool in job creation.\n  This is because his term expires, runs out, on July 20.\n  What would that mean? It would mean the Export-Import Bank, which \nneeds at least three of its five board members to have a quorum, would \nnot have a quorum and would not be able to issue any new loans. This \nmeans the transactions that U.S. companies depend on, the guarantees \nand the transactions to finance the sale of U.S. products and services \noverseas, would not be able to move forward.\n  If we don't confirm Mr. Hochberg this week, the bank cannot approve \nloans and it would take away a job-creating tool that American \ninnovators and businesses count on. This is why I am calling on my \ncolleagues, in a bipartisan fashion, to confirm Mr. Hochberg as the \nExport-Import Bank Chairman for a second term.\n  His nomination is supported by the Chamber of Commerce and by the \nNational Association of Manufacturers. He has proven to be a solid \nleader in his organization by listening, implementing, innovating, and \nadministering a very critical job-creation tool.\n  When I visited businesses across my State in 2012 to talk about the \nExport-Import Bank, I heard the American people wanted us to focus on \njob creation and supporting business. The Export-Import Bank helps \nAmerican-made products to be shipped all around the world.\n  I saw a company in my State, Yakima, WA, the Manhasset music stand \ncompany, use the Export-Import Bank to make sure sales go all around \nthe globe, including China.\n  I saw a grain silo manufacturer called SCAFCO in Spokane, which also \nwould testify to the fact that they have been able to sell their grain \nto many countries around the globe because of the financing the Export-\nImport Bank guarantees.\n  Airline cockpit hardware made by the Esterline Corporation factory in \nEverett, WA, also testified to the same effect; that when you are \nlooking around the globe to secure financing of U.S. products into more \ndeveloping countries, it is hard to get the financing to work.\n  The United States can be left at the starting line or the United \nStates can use this vital tool that I call a tactic for small business \nto get access to make sure their products get a final sale.\n  The Export-Import Bank supports 83,000 jobs in my State alone, which \nbenefits from the finance mechanism. Over the last 5 years, it has \nsupported many jobs throughout the United States. Overall, it \nsupported, as I said, 225,000 jobs and more than 3,000 businesses in \n2012.\n  In the small business area, 2,500 of those are small businesses. The \nnotion that this is somehow crony capitalism--and maybe he is talking \nabout the shenanigans that happened on Wall Street, but he is certainly \nnot talking about the Export-Import Bank.\n  I am advocating that we keep the very positive results of this bank, \nkeep Mr. Hochberg, and make sure we continue to sell our products from \nEverett, WA, or Auburn, KY, all over the globe.\n  Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers live outside our \nborders. The question is: are we going to make sure that U.S. products \nget into the hands of the growing middle class around the globe? In \n2030, China's middle class will be 1 billion people, 1 billion middle-\nclass people in China, up from 150 million today. India's middle class \nwill grow 80 percent, from 50 million to 475 million.\n  We need our businesses, large and small, to have the tools to reach \nthis new, growing tool of consumers. Not only does this help \nbusinesses, the Ex-Im Bank also helps taxpayers.\n  I don't know where the idea that this is crony capitalism comes from, \nbut this program is a very good deal for the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury. In fact, it returned nearly $1.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury \nsince 2005. It actually is helping us return money to the Treasury and \nit helps our businesses continue to grow in export markets.\n  As we speak, there are almost $4 billion in transactions awaiting \napproval for the bank; that is, if we don't approve the chairman, these \ndeals might not go through. There are many American businesses counting \non their transaction so they can compete in an international market.\n  The international competitor is not going to wait until we approve \nMr. Hochberg if we delay this. They are going to go ahead, cash in on \nthe business deals, and our competitors will win.\n  I think the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it best in a 2011 letter to \ncongressional leaders: The Export-Import Bank enables U.S. companies, \nlarge and small, to turn export opportunities into real sales that help \ncreate real jobs in the United States of America.\n  I was proud that Mr. Hochberg came to Seattle last year for the \nopening of a regional Ex-Im office, focusing on small businesses to \nmake sure they can get the financing for end products to get to these \nmarkets. We should be moving more toward policies to help businesses, \nthe small businesses, grow with confidence into these international \nmarkets.\n  I ask my colleagues to do the right thing, follow through, and \nconfirm this chairman.\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\n  Since its creation in 1934, the Export-Import Bank was approved by \nunanimous consent or voice vote 24 times. For 24 times no one called \nthis crony capitalism. No, they were supporting it. The last time we \nauthorized it, it had 78 votes. It ended up in the House of \nRepresentatives with 330 votes.\n  I am pointing this out because all of the delay in Mr. Hochberg's \nconfirmation hurts business in the end, when the majority of my \ncolleagues do agree this is a vital tool to help boost products made in \nAmerica.\n  In the last reauthorization we did make improvements to strengthen \nthe Ex-Im Bank. Quarterly reports are delivered on the default rates, \nwhich now can't go above 2 percent.\n  The Government Accountability Office also is required to work with \nrisk management structures to make sure loans and businesses are not \ntoo risky. Transactions above a certain dollar amount receive public \ncomment, and they deliver a yearly report on those transactions.\n  I know my colleagues have mentioned this issue about aviation, and I \ncan guarantee, as the chair of the Aviation Subcommittee, I want U.S. \nairline industries to be competitive in international markets. \nCertainly, the world community on financing of airplane sales is \nworking together to make sure those are closer to market-based rates \nand working on the same page so these financing schemes work together.\n  The 2011 Aircraft Sector Understanding sets out the terms and \nconditions on how airlines can finance aircraft purchases using \nGovernment-backed financing. The Understanding requires a closer \nalignment with commercial market borrowing rates. This agreement covers \nall major trading partners except China.\n  All of these improvements we continue to make in the Ex-Im Bank are \nimportant. As I said, Mr. Hochberg has been open to many discussions as \nto how we move ahead. Let us not deny the fact that in developing \nmarkets, a financial tool such as the Export-Import Bank, that actually \ndelivers on helping job creation in the United States by getting the \nsales of many different products into these developing countries and \ngrowing middle class, is very good for the United States. The fact that \nit returns to the taxpayer is very positive.\n  Let's not let this slip another moment. Let's get Mr. Hochberg back \nto the task at hand, which is approving these transactions so U.S. \ncompanies can continue to grow jobs here by accessing new markets \noverseas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this last Monday night we had a \nremarkable occurrence in the Senate. Democrats and Republicans actually \nmet together, as the Presiding Officer knows, in the Old Senate \nChamber, a historic location where the Senate used to meet before we \nbecame so large and expanded to 100 Members. What was so good about \nthat, from my perspective, was that we actually had some communication \ngoing on and we learned there were a lot of Senators who were actually \nfrustrated by the way the Senate has been operating. It gave us all an \nopportunity, there in a confidential setting, to speak our mind and to \nshare our frustrations.\n\n  But I think one of the things we have forgotten--maybe not forgotten, \nbut need to be reminded of from time to time--is what makes the Senate \nunique, not just here in America and our form of government but \nthroughout the world. Sometimes the Senate is referred to as the \nworld's greatest deliberative body. As we all know, it has become less \nso in recent years. But we all remember the story of the constitutional \nconvention in Philadelphia when they were at loggerheads in trying to \nfigure out how to create the legislative branch. There were some who \nwanted a single unicameral legislative body, and there were discussions \nthen about whether there actually needed to be a Senate in addition to \nthe House of Representatives, which, of course, would literally be \nrepresentative of the people based on their numbers as opposed to \nrepresenting the respective States, which is the function of the \nSenate.\n  Late in the convention there was a compromise proposed by the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Roger Sherman, on behalf of the small States. Of \ncourse, the small States were worried the big States would gang up on \nthem. Ironically, under this compromise, it is now the small States \nthat gang up on the big States, but that is another story for another \nday.\n  Under this Connecticut Compromise, the Senate came to be comprised of \ntwo Senators representing each State, no matter how big or how small \nthe State. My State of 26 million people only gets two Senators. The \nPresiding Officer's State, a smaller State, also gets two Senators. \nThat was part of the Connecticut Compromise back when the country was \nfounded.\n  The Constitution could not have been ratified without this \ncompromise. It initially failed, but Benjamin Franklin later found a \nbetter time to reintroduce it and it passed. But here is the real \nfunction of the Senate, and it comes from a story told of a \nconversation between Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Of course, \nWashington had presided over the constitutional convention. Jefferson \nwas in Paris. When he returned, he asked Washington why he allowed the \nSenate to be formed, because Jefferson had considered it unnecessary. \nOne body based on proportional representation, Jefferson thought, \nshould be enough. Washington then asked Jefferson if he cooled his tea \nby first pouring it in the saucer, which was the custom of the day. \nSure, responded Jefferson. And Washington said: So it is that the \nSenate must cool tempers and prevent hasty legislation by making sure \nit is well thought out and fully debated.\n  I mention that story and recite a little bit of history to remind us \nthe Senate was created not just to be another House of Representatives \nbut for another purpose altogether. That is the other reason why \nSenators are elected for 6-year terms from a whole State as opposed to \njust a congressional district where our colleagues across the Capitol \nrun every 2 years from smaller areas. Of course, they are supposed to \nbe much more closely tied to their constituents. We are supposedly \ngiven a little more flexibility to take the long view and not the \nshort-term view in how we decide matters.\n  That is the reason why so many of us were concerned at the threat of \nthe majority leader to invoke the so-called nuclear option. I know for \nmost Americans this is not something that is at the top of their list \nto be concerned with, but from an institutional and constitutional \nperspective it is absolutely critical the Senate remain true to the \ndesign of the Founders of our country as framed in our Constitution.\n  As a rationale to invoking the so-called nuclear option and turning \nthe Senate into a purely majority-vote institution, there were claims \nthis side of the aisle had been obstructing too many of President \nObama's nominations. But the facts tell a far different story. Thus \nfar, the President has nominated more than 1,560 people for various \npositions, and only 4--only 4--of them have been rejected by the \nSenate.\n  Since 2009, this Chamber has confirmed 199 of President Obama's \narticle III judicial nominees and rejected 2 of them, and 80 of those \nnominees were confirmed by voice vote, which is essentially a unanimous \nvote. Another 64 were confirmed by unanimous rollcall votes. Does that \nsound like a crisis? Does that sound like obstructionism? I think not.\n  I would like to suggest it is another problem that has caused the \nSenate to become, in a way, a nondeliberative body and quite \ndysfunctional. For example, during Senator Reid's tenure as majority \nleader, an unprecedented number of bills have come to the floor \ndirectly from the majority leader's office. Any of us who remember our \nhigh school civics lessons know that, ordinarily, committees of the \nCongress are supposed to write legislation. Then once the committees \nvote that legislation out, it comes to the Senate floor. Obviously, the \npurpose for that is to give everyone in the committees an opportunity \nto vent their concerns, to offer amendments, to debate them, and then \nto mark up a bill before it comes to the Senate floor so we do a better \njob and deal with all of the unintended\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\nconsequences and the like. But during the tenure of the current \nmajority leader an unprecedented number of bills have simply sprung to \nlife out of the majority leader's office.\n  Many of my colleagues, including Members of Senator Reid's own party, \nhave been left wondering why it is the committees actually even exist \nin a world where bills simply come to the Senate floor under rule XIV \nwithout the sort of deliberation and consideration they should get in \ncommittees before arriving here. When legislation arrives on the floor, \nSenators are routinely denied an opportunity to offer the amendments \nthey see fit and to have debate and votes on those amendments.\n  To give some perspective--and I know some people will say the \nAmerican people are not interested in the process, they are interested \nmore in the policy, but this demonstrates why the process is so \nimportant to getting the right policies embraced--during the 109th \nCongress, when this side of the aisle, Republicans, controlled this \nChamber, Senate Democrats offered more than 1,000 separate amendments--\n1,043 separate amendments--to legislation. During the 112th Congress, \nwhen our Democratic colleagues were in charge, Republicans were only \nallowed to offer 400 amendments--1,043 to 400, a big difference.\n  During the 109th Congress, when Republicans controlled this Chamber, \nthere were 428 recorded votes on Senate amendments--428. In the 112th \nCongress, there were 224--a little more than half of the number.\n  Since becoming majority leader, Senator Reid has blocked amendments \non bills on the floor no fewer than 70 times. In the language of Senate \nprocedure, we call that filling the amendment tree, but what it means \nis the minority is effectively shut out of the ability to shape \nlegislation by offering amendments on the Senate floor. And that is no \nsmall thing. Again, I represent 26 million people in the State of \nTexas. Being a Member of the minority, when Senator Reid blocks any \namendment I wish to offer to a bill, he has effectively shut out of the \nprocess 26 million Texans. And it is not just my State, it is every \nState represented by the minority.\n\n  As a comparison, the previous Senate majority leader, Senator Bill \nFrist of Tennessee, a Republican, filled the amendment tree only 12 \ntimes in 4 years. So 70 times under Senator Reid, 12 times for Senator \nFrist. And before him, Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a Democrat, filled \nthe tree only once in 1\\1/2\\ years--once in 1\\1/2\\ years. When Trent \nLott was the majority leader, a Republican, he did it 10 times in 5 \nyears. George Mitchell, a Democratic majority leader, did it three \ntimes in 6 years. Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, who was an \ninstitution unto himself here in the Senate, did it three times in 2 \nyears. And finally, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, a \nRepublican, did it seven times in 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  My point is not to bore people with statistics but to point out the \nSenate has changed dramatically under the tenure of the current \nmajority leader in a way where Members of the Senate are blocked from \noffering amendments to legislation in the interest of their \nconstituents. As majority leader, Senator Reid has denied those rights \nto the minority and the rights of the people we represent. When he \nrefuses to let us offer amendments and debate those amendments, he \nrefuses to let us have real debate and he is effectively gagging \nmillions of our constituents.\n  One more time I would like to remind Senator Reid of what he promised \n6 years ago. He said: As majority leader, I intend to run the Senate \nwith respect for the rules and for the minority the rules protect. The \nSenate was established to make sure that minorities are protected. \nMajorities can always protect themselves but minorities cannot. That is \nwhat the Senate is all about.\n  I would also like to remind our colleagues what President Obama said \nin April of 2005, when he was in the Senate. He said: If the majority \nchooses to end the filibuster, if they choose to change the rules and \nput an end to democratic debate, then the fighting, the bitterness, and \nthe gridlock will only get worse.\n  My point is to say the Senate has been transformed in recent years \ninto an image of an institution the Founders of our country would \nhardly recognize, nor would previously serving Senators who operated in \nan environment where every Senator had an opportunity to offer \namendments to legislation and to get a vote on those amendments; where \nthe minority's rights were protected by denying the majority the right \nto simply shut out the minority, denying them an opportunity to offer \nor debate important pieces of legislation.\n  That is what has happened under the current majority leader, and that \nis why I believe those meetings, such as the one we had in the Old \nSenate Chamber this past Monday night, are so important. But we do have \nto rely on the facts. Facts can be stubborn, but I think our debate \nought to be based on the facts and on a rational discussion of what the \nFramers intended when they created the Senate and its unique role--\nunique not just here in America but to all legislative bodies in the \nworld.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Madam President, I would like to turn to another topic. Now that we \nhave gotten past the nuclear option, at least for a time, I think it is \nimportant we return to important issues that actually affect the lives \nof the American people in very direct ways, and health care is one of \nthem.\n  During the Fourth of July recess, the administration unilaterally \ndelayed several provisions of the so-called Affordable Care Act, \notherwise sometimes known as ObamaCare. What they did specifically is \nthey delayed enactment of the employer mandate.\n  It was an implicit acknowledgement by the administration that \nObamaCare is actually stifling job creation and prompting many \nbusinesses to turn from full-time employment to part time. In fact, \nthere are now 8.2 million Americans working part-time jobs for economic \nreasons when they would like to work full time. That number is up from \n7.6 to 8.2 million since March. And a new survey has found that 74 \npercent of small businesses are going to reduce hiring, reduce worker \nhours, or replace full-time employees with part-time employees in part \nin response to ObamaCare.\n  The House of Representatives has drafted a bill that would codify the \nemployer mandate delay that the administration announced earlier this \nmonth. In other words, they want to uphold the rule of law. Yet the \nPresident is now threatening to veto the very legislation that enacts \nthe policy that he himself announced, which is truly surreal. The House \nbill on the employer mandate would do exactly what the President has \nalready announced he would do unilaterally. There is no conceivable \nreason that I can think of for the administration to oppose this \nlegislation--unless, of course, President Obama thinks he can pick and \nchoose which laws to enforce for the sake of his own convenience. I am \nafraid he does believe that, and the evidence goes well beyond \nObamaCare.\n  Yesterday afternoon I listed several examples of the administration's \npersistent contempt for the rule of law.\n  I mentioned the government-run Chrysler bankruptcy process in which \nthe company-secured bondholders received far less for their loans than \nthe United Auto Workers pension funds.\n  I mentioned the subsequent Solyndra bankruptcy in which the \nadministration violated the law by making taxpayers subordinate to \nprivate lenders.\n  I mentioned the President's unconstitutional appointments to the \nNational Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau. You don't have to take my word for it; that is the decision of \nthe court of appeals. The case has now been taken up by the U.S. \nSupreme Court to define what the President's powers are to make so-\ncalled recess appointments. But one thing that is absolutely clear is \nthat the President--the executive branch--can't dictate to the Senate \nwhen we are in recess, thus empowering the President to make those \nappointments without the advice and consent function contained in the \nConstitution; otherwise, the executive branch will have no checks and \nno balances on its power, and there will be no power on the part of the \nSenate to do the appropriate oversight and to confirm the President's \nnominees.\n  In addition to his recess appointments, I mentioned yesterday his \ndecision to unilaterally waive key requirements in both the 1996 \nwelfare reform\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\nlaw and the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act, and I also mentioned his \nrefusal to enforce certain immigration laws.\n  What the House of Representatives is trying to do with its employer \nmandate bill is to make sure that the same rules apply to everyone and \nthat the executive branch and the White House in particular don't just \npick winners and losers when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, \nObamacare.\n  If this President or any President is allowed to selectively enforce \nthe law based on political expediency, our democracy and adherence to \nthe rule of law will be severely weakened.\n  The principle at stake is far more important than the particular \nlegislation we are talking about. It is about the constitutional \nseparation of powers between the executive and the legislative branches \nof government. By assuming to be able to unilaterally suspend laws that \nprove inconvenient, the President is showing disdain for those checks \nand balances on executive authority as well as his oath, where he \npledges to faithfully execute the laws of the United States.\n  Those of us who support repealing ObamaCare in its entirety and then \nreplacing it with real health care reforms that reduce costs and expand \npatient choice and access to quality care, while protecting Americans \nwith preexisting conditions and saving programs such as Medicaid and \nMedicare, believe ObamaCare ought to be repealed in its entirety and \nreplaced with commonsense reforms that will actually bring down the \ncosts, increase the quality, and preserve the patient-doctor \nrelationship when it comes to making health care choices.\n  Our preference would be to repeal the entire law, but we would like \nto work with the President and our friends across the aisle now that it \nappears, according to the administration's own actions, that they \nactually believe ObamaCare is not turning out as it was originally \nintended in 2010. Indeed, one of the principal architects in the \nSenate, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Max \nBaucus of Montana, has told Secretary Kathleen Sebelius of Health and \nHuman Services that the implementation of ObamaCare is turning out to \nbe a train wreck. And indeed it is.\n  Unfortunately, the President is still refusing to acknowledge the \ngrowing evidence that ObamaCare cannot perform as was originally \npromised. We know that the promise that if you like the health care \ncoverage you have, you can keep it that the President so famously \nmade--that is not true. Seven million Americans have lost their health \ncare coverage as ObamaCare is being implemented and many more as \nemployers are incentivized to drop their employer-provided coverage, \nleaving American families to find their health insurance elsewhere. The \npromise the President made that the average cost of health care \ninsurance for a family of four would go down by $2,400--we know it has \ngone up by $2,400 since then.\n  Unfortunately, it appears the wheels are coming off of ObamaCare, and \nthe people who will suffer the most are hard-working American families \nwe are pledged to protect and help. What we ought to be doing rather \nthan denying the obvious is working together to try to enact \ncommonsense reforms.\n  It is not an answer for the President to discard the politically \ninconvenient portions of ObamaCare and kick off implementation until \nafter the next election. To me, that is one of the most amazing things \nabout the way ObamaCare has been implemented. It passed in 2010, but \nvery little of it actually kicked in before the Presidential election \nof 2012. So there is no real political accountability, no real \nopportunity for the voters to voice their objection once it had been \nimplemented, if it had been implemented on a timely basis. And now, \nbecause it has proven to be politically inconvenient, the President has \nproposed to kick off implementation of the employer mandate until after \nthe 2014 midterm congressional elections. That is no way to have \naccountability for the decisions we make here. That is the opposite.\n  We are simply urging the President to support the rule of law and to \nmake sure the same rules apply to everyone--apply to Members of \nCongress and apply to everyone in this great country of ours. But when \nthe administration chooses to selectively enforce or not enforce \nprovisions of the law or issue waivers for the favored few and the rest \nof us end up with the harsh reality of this law that is not working out \nas originally intended, it undermines the rule of law and the public's \nconfidence that the same rules will apply to everyone. That shouldn't \nbe too much to ask.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, there has been a lot of news over the \nlast 24 hours about the nuclear option and how that has been averted \nhere in the Senate and what good news that is for the institution. I do \nvalue the Senate, and I do value the ability of individual Senators--\nand particularly the minority, which I hope I won't be a part of \nforever--and of the minority to speak and to be heard. That is one of \nthe things that make this institution unique.\n  But I think we have to answer a fundamental question about why we \nhave these rules in place and in particular why we have these rules in \nplace when we are dealing with nominees, people who are nominated to \nthe Cabinet and other executive positions. It is because the \nConstitution gives the Senate the power to advise and consent, to \nbasically review these nominees and find out information about them and \nthen decide whether they should be confirmed.\n  There are two different standards with regard to that. The first \nstandard is whether the nominee should be able to go forward, and that \nrequires a supermajority vote--60 votes--to continue debate. It is kind \nof arcane and I don't want to do a tutorial on the Senate, but let me \nsay that if you can't get those 60 votes, then you have to continue to \ndebate that nominee. That is an important tool--not to obstruct but \nshould be used judiciously. It is a tool that should be used to make \nsure that this process is being respected and that people are answering \ncritical and valid questions. It is an important tool to use. It needs \nto be used judiciously. It needs to be used in a limited way. You can't \ndo that on everybody. You shouldn't do that on everybody. Quite \nfrankly, the minority has not done it on everybody, nor have I. I have \nbeen very careful in its use and have tried to ensure that when we do \nuse it and when I do use it, I use it for reasons that are valid.\n  It is with that in mind that I am very concerned about a nominee who \nwill be before this body as early as today on a 60-vote threshold about \nwhether to cut off debate on this individual and proceed to final \nconfirmation, and that is this nominee for the Secretary to head the \nLabor Department, which is a significant agency of our government that, \nquite frankly, has a direct impact on the ability of businesses to grow \nand hire people and so forth. This is an important nomination and one \nthat I think deserves careful scrutiny.\n\n  Now, let me be frank and up-front. I have significant objections to \nthis nomination on the basis of public policy, and I have stated that \nin the past. I believe this individual, Thomas Perez, who is currently \nan Assistant Attorney General, is a liberal activist who has used his \nposition--not just in the Department of Justice but in other roles he \nhas played--to advance a liberal agenda that, quite frankly, is out of \ntouch with a majority of Americans and that I believe would be bad for \nour economy, hence the reason I don't think it is a good idea for him \nto head the Labor Department. But the President has a right to his \nnominees.\n  So that is a reason to vote against this nomination. That in and of \nitself may not always be a reason to block a nomination from moving \nforward. Where I do think there is a valid reason to block someone's \nnomination from moving forward is when that individual has refused to \ncooperate with the process that is in place to review their nomination.\n  When you are nominated to serve in the Cabinet or in the executive \nbranch, you get asked questions about things you have done in the past, \nthings you\n\n[[Page S5725]]\n\nhave said in the past, and you are expected to answer those fully and \ntruthfully so that the Members of this body can make a decision about \nyour nomination based on the facts. I don't know of anyone here who \nwould dispute that, including people in the majority. Irrespective of \nhow you feel about the nominee, every single Senator here--and through \nus, the American people--has a right to fully know who it is we are \nconfirming, whether it is to the bench or to the Cabinet or to some \nother executive position. That is a right that is critically important.\n  When a nominee refuses to cooperate with that process, I believe that \nis a valid reason to stand in the way of their confirmation and to \nblock it from moving forward until those questions are fully and \ntruthfully answered. I do believe that is a reason not to vote for what \nthey call cloture around here. I think that is a case in point when it \ncomes to this Labor nominee, Mr. Perez, and I want to take a few \nmoments to argue to my colleagues why it is a bad idea for both \nDemocrats and Republicans to allow this nomination to move forward \nuntil this nominee answers the questions he has been asked by the \nCongress. Let me give the background.\n  There was a case filed by the City of St. Paul in Minnesota, and this \ncase had to do with a legal theory called disparate impact. It is not \nreally on point per se, but it basically says that you look at how some \npolicy is impacting people, and even if there wasn't the intent to \ndiscriminate against people, if the practical impact of it was that it \nwas discriminating against people--let's say a bank was giving out \nloans, and although the loan officer wasn't looking to deny loans to \nminorities, if the way they had structured the program meant that fewer \nminorities were getting loans than should be under a percentage basis, \nthen under this theory you would be allowed to go after whatever \ninstitution did that. That is the theory which is out there in law.\n  The City of St. Paul had a challenge to that in court that chose to \ndefine exactly what that meant, and it got all the way to the Supreme \nCourt. It was on the Supreme Court's docket. At the same time, the \nJustice Department was being asked to intervene in a whistleblower case \nregarding Housing and Urban Development. Again, it would take too long \nto describe exactly why that is important, but the bottom line is that \nthe case against the City of St. Paul, the separate case--the \nwhistleblower case--because of the way the law is written, they \ncouldn't move forward on that case unless the Department of Justice \nintervened. And that is where the nominee, Mr. Perez, stepped in. He is \nan enormous fan of the disparate impact theory. In fact, he had used it \nto go after banks, of all things, in his time at the Department of \nJustice.\n  At some point in the future I will come to the floor and detail why I \nobject to his nomination, appointment, and confirmation, but today I am \njust making the argument as to why it is a bad idea to move forward on \nthis nomination until certain questions are answered.\n  This is where Mr. Perez steps in. What he did is he basically went to \nthe City of St. Paul and said: Look, if you drop your Supreme Court \ncase, we will not intervene in the whistleblower case. It is what is \nknown in Latin as a quid pro quo--you do this for me, I will do that \nfor you. In essence, City of St. Paul, drop your Supreme Court case and \nI will not intervene on behalf of the Department of Justice.\n  He argues reasons why he did that were based--he told the House \ncommittee the reason why I did that is because I thought it was a bad \ncase, I had bad facts and I didn't want to move forward on the HUD \nwhistleblower case anyway. He claimed that. But, in fact, a subsequent \ninvestigation found that a career attorney in the Department of Justice \nactually did not feel that way at all. A career attorney who was \ninvolved in this case believed it was a good case and, in fact, at a \nmeeting about the case he expressed concern that this looked like we \nwere ``buying off'' the City of St. Paul.\n  Right away the nominee had, frankly, misled the congressional \ncommittee when he argued it was a bad case, everybody agreed that the \nfacts were bad. In fact, that is not true. The career prosecutor who \nwas looking at this case wanted to move forward and was concerned that \nthe way this looked was that it was a buy-off.\n  Then the nominee was asked: By the way, did you use your personal e-\nmail to conduct this deal? Did you e-mail with people about it? We \nunderstand your Federal account, we have access to that, but did you \nuse your personal accounts?\n  You know, we all have business accounts and we all have personal \naccounts. The question was did you use your personal accounts to cut \nthis deal or negotiate this deal or even talk about it with anybody? \nHis answer was he could not recall, he had no recollection of that.\n  Subsequently, however, it was discovered that, in fact, on at least \none occasion initially, he had used his e-mail to discuss something \nwith someone at the City of St. Paul. That is when the House oversight \ncommittee stepped in and it asked him voluntarily and the Justice \nDepartment voluntarily to produce any e-mails from his private account \nthat had to do with his official capacity.\n  Understand the request. It wasn't: Send us e-mails between you and \nyour children or between you and your family or about you planning your \nvacation. What they asked for were any e-mails from your private \naccounts that have to do with your official capacity.\n  The Justice Department responded to that request by saying: We have \nfound 1,200 instances of the use of his personal e-mails for official \nbusiness. We found at least--the number at least was 34, but then 35--\ninstances where it violated the open records laws of the Federal \nGovernment. So he was voluntarily asked to produce these e-mails to the \nHouse. He refused.\n  The House then subpoenaed these records, a subpoena which has the \npower of Congress behind it basically compelling you: You must produce \nit now. Again, he refuses to produce these e-mails.\n  What we have before the Senate today is a nominee to head the Labor \nDepartment of the United States of America who refuses to comply with a \ncongressional subpoena on his e-mail records regarding his official \nbusiness conduct. He refuses to comply; will not even answer; ignores \nit.\n  Here is what I will say to you. How can we possibly vote to confirm \nsomebody if they refuse to produce relevant information about their \nofficial conduct? Think about that. This is an invitation for any \nofficial in the executive branch to basically conduct all their \nbusiness in their private accounts because they know they will never \nhave to produce it, they can ignore the Congress.\n  The nominee, Mr. Perez, hides behind the Department of Justice and \nsays: They are handling this for me. But the problem is the Department \nof Justice doesn't possess these e-mails. These are his e-mails from \nhis personal account that he refuses to produce.\n  If, in fact, there is nothing to worry about--and I am not claiming--\nI have not seen the e-mails. I don't know what is in them. None of us \ndo. That is the point. The fact is we are now being asked to vote to \nconfirm someone--not just to confirm someone, to give him 60 votes to \ncut off debate on the nomination of someone who is in open contempt of \na congressional subpoena and repeated requests, including a bipartisan \nrequest. I have it here with me, a bipartisan request signed by Mr. \nIssa of California and Mr. Cummings, the ranking minority member, dated \nMay 8, 2013:\n\n       We write to request you produce all documents responsive to \n     the subpoena issued to you by the committee on April 10, \n     2013, regarding your use of a non-official e-mail account to \n     conduct official Department of Justice business. The \n     Department [Justice Department] has represented to the \n     Committee that roughly 1,200 responsive e-mails exist. To \n     allow the Committee to fully examine these e-mails, please \n     produce all responsive documents in unredacted form to the \n     Committee no later than Friday, May 20, 2013.\n\n  The answer: Nothing, silence, crickets.\n  This is wrong. How can we possibly move forward on a nominee--I don't \ncare what deal has been cut--how can we possibly move forward on \nsomeone until we have information that they have been asked for by a \ncongressional committee? This is outrageous. If ever there was an \ninstance where someone's nomination should not move forward, this is a \nperfect example of it.\n\n[[Page S5726]]\n\n  I am not standing here saying deny this nominee 60 votes because I \nthink he is a liberal activist--I do, and I think that is the reason \nwhy he should not be confirmed. What I am saying to my Republican \ncolleagues is: I don't care what deal you cut, how can you possibly \nagree to move forward on the nomination when the nominee refuses to \ncomply with a congressional subpoena to turn over records about \nofficial business at the Justice Department?\n  By the way, we are not confirming him to an Ambassador post in some \nobscure country halfway around the world. This is the Labor Department. \nThis is the Labor Department.\n  I am shocked that there are members of my own conference who would be \nwilling to go forward, go ahead on a nomination like this, who are \nwilling to give 60 votes on a nomination like this on a nominee who \nhas, frankly, flat out refused to comply with a congressional subpoena \nand answer questions that are legitimate and important. We are about to \nmake someone the head of one of the most powerful agencies in America, \nimpacting the ability of businesses to grow and create jobs at a time, \nfrankly, when our economy is not doing very well, we are about to \nconfirm someone to chair that agency, head up that agency when that \nindividual has refused to comply with a legitimate request. How can we \npossibly go along with that?\n  I understand how important it is to protect the rights of minorities \nhere. I understand how important it is to protect the right of the \nminority party to speak out and block efforts to move forward. But, my \ngoodness, what is the point of even having the 60-vote threshold if you \ncannot use it for legitimate reasons? This is not me saying I am going \nto block this nominee until I get something I want. This is a nominee \nwho refuses to cooperate, who flat out has ignored Congress and told \nthem to go pound sand. And you are going to vote for this individual \nand move forward before this question is answered?\n  I implore my colleagues, frankly on both sides of the aisle--because \nthis sets a precedent. There will not be a Democratic President forever \nand there will not be a Senate Democratic majority forever. At some \npoint in the future you will have a Republican President and they are \ngoing to nominate people and those people may refuse to comply with a \nrecords request. You are not going to want those records? In fact, you \nhave in the past blocked people for that very purpose.\n\n  So I ask my colleagues again, how can you possibly move forward a \nnominee who refuses to comply with giving us the information we need to \nfully vet that nomination? This is a serious constitutional obligation \nwe have. Do we have an obligation to the Senate and to this \ninstitution, being a unique legislative body? Absolutely. But we have \nan even more important obligation to our Constitution and to the role \nthe Senate plays in reviewing nominations and the information behind \nthat nomination, and we are being blatantly denied relevant \ninformation. We have colleagues of mine who say it doesn't matter, move \nforward. This is wrong. It is not just wrong, it is outrageous.\n  Again, I do not think that we should use--nor do I think we have, by \nthe way, used the 60-vote threshold as a way to routinely block \nnominees from moving forward. You look at the record. This President \nhas done very well with his nominations, across the board--judiciary, \nCabinet, executive branch. But, my goodness, can we at least agree that \nI have a right as a Senator from Florida--as all of you have a right as \nSenators from your States--to have all the relevant information on \nthese nominees before we move forward?\n  I am telling you, if you are going to concede that point, then what \nis the point of having the 60-vote threshold if you can never use it \nfor legitimate purposes?\n  I would argue to my colleagues today, let's not have this vote today. \nLet's not give 60 votes on this nominee until he produces these e-mails \nand we have time to review them so we can fully understand what was \nbehind not just this quid pro quo deal but behind his public service at \nthe Justice Department as an assistant attorney general, frankly \nconfirmed by this Senate with the support of Republicans.\n  This is not an unreasonable request. For us to surrender the right to \nask these questions is a dereliction of duty and it is wrong. If ever \nthere was a case in point for why the 60-vote threshold matters, this \nis an example of one. I am telling you, if this moves forward, there is \nno reason why any future nominee would not decide to give us the same \nanswer; that is, you get nothing. I tell you nothing. I will tell you \nwhat I want you to know. Then we are forced to vote up or down on \nsomeone on whom we do not have information. And that is wrong.\n  There is still time to change our minds. I think this is a legitimate \nexercise--not forever. Let him produce these e-mails. Let us review \nthese e-mails. Then bring him up for a vote and then you can vote on \nhim, whether you like it or not based on all the information. But to \nallow someone to move forward who is basically telling an oversight \ncommittee of Congress: I don't have to answer your questions, I don't \nhave to respond to your letters, I ignore you?\n  I want you to think about the precedent you are setting. I want you \nto think about how that undermines the constitutional--not just the \nright, the constitutional obligation of this body to produce advice and \nconsent on Presidential nominees, and I think this is especially \nimportant when someone is going to be a member of the Cabinet and \noverseeing an agency with the scope and the power of the Labor \nDepartment.\n  I still hope there is time to convince as many of my colleagues as \npossible. I do not hold great hopes that I will convince a lot of my \nDemocratic colleagues, but I hope I can convince a majority of my \nRepublican colleagues to refuse to give the 60 votes to cut off debate \non this nominee until Chairman Issa and the oversight committee get \nanswers to their questions that frankly we would want to know. They \ntake leadership on asking these questions but we are the ones who have \nto vote on the nominee. They are doing us a favor asking these \nquestions. We should, at a minimum, stand here and demand that these be \nanswered before we move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Republican leader.\n\n\n                               Obamacare\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As I mentioned yesterday, I am glad the majority saw \nthe light and stepped back from committing a tragic mistake. It is good \nnews for our country and good news for our democracy. Now that that is \nbehind us, we can get back to debating the issues our constituents are \nthe most concerned about, and for a lot of my constituents they are \nconcerned about ObamaCare.\n  This is a law that was basically passed against their will and it is \na law that is now being imposed upon them by a distant bureaucracy \nheadquartered here in Washington. If the folks in DC are to be \nbelieved, its implementation is going just swimmingly. The Democratic \nleader in the House of Representatives called it ``fabulous.'' The \nPresident said the law is ``working the way it's supposed to.'' And my \nfriend the majority leader said the other day that ``ObamaCare has been \nwonderful for America.''\n  Fabulous? Wonderful? These are not the kinds of words one normally \nassociates with a deeply unpopular law, or one that media reports \nsuggest is already having a very painful impact on Americans we \nrepresent. Which sets up an important question for Senators to \nconsider: Just who are we prepared to believe here when it comes to \nObamaCare: the politicians who have developed it or the people who are \nreacting to it?\n  The politicians in Washington who forced this law on the country say \neverything is fantastic. They spent millions on slick ads with smiling \nactors and sunny-sounding scripts that blissfully--I am being kind \nhere--blissfully dismiss what the reality of this law will actually \nlook like to so many Americans, or what the reality of the law has \nalready become for some of them. That is why the people have taken an \nentirely different view. They are the ones worried about losing the \ncoverage they like and want to keep, which is understandable given the \ngrowing number of news stories about insurance companies pulling out of \nStates and markets altogether. They are the ones worried about their \njobs and pay checks.\n\n[[Page S5727]]\n\n  Each anecdote we hear about a college cutting hours for its employees \nor a restaurant freezing hiring or a small business already taking the \nax to its workforce at such an early stage--each of them is a testament \nto just how well this law has been working out for the people we were \nsent to represent.\n  According to the chamber of commerce's small business survey released \njust yesterday, anxiety about the requirements of ObamaCare now surpass \neconomic uncertainty as the top worry for small business. The impact of \nObamaCare now surpasses economic uncertainty as the top worry for small \nbusiness owners.\n  Here is another thing: When even cheerleaders for the law start to \nbecome its critics, that is when we know there is something to this \ntrain wreck everybody keeps talking about.\n  Unions are livid--even though they helped pass the law--because they \nsee their members losing care and becoming less competitive as a result \nof it. That is why they fired off an angry letter to Congress just this \nweek.\n  The California Insurance Commissioner is troubled too--even though he \nhas been one of ObamaCare's biggest boosters. He is so worried about \nfraud that he warned we might ``have a real disaster on our hands.'' \nWell, it is hard to argue with him.\n  The President was so worried about some of this law turning into a \ndisaster that he selectively delayed a big chunk of it, but he only did \nthat for businesses. He just delayed it for businesses.\n  A constituent of mine was recently interviewed by a TV station in \nPaducah, and here is what she said about the President's decision: ``It \nain't right.'' Well, she is not alone.\n  We can argue about whether the President even had the power to do \nwhat he did, but here is the point today: If businesses deserve a \nreprieve because the law is a disaster, then families and workers do \ntoo. If this law isn't working the way it is supposed to, then it is a \nterrible law. If it is not working as planned, then it is not right to \nfoist it on the middle class while exempting business.\n  That is why the House will vote this week to at least try to remedy \nthat. It is an important first step to giving all Americans and all \nbusinesses what they need, which is not a temporary delay for some but \na permanent delay for everyone.\n  The politicians pushing ObamaCare might not like that, but they are \nnot the ones who are having to live with this thing the same way most \nAmericans will have to live with it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized as if in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            EPA Regulations\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, last Wednesday I came to the floor and \nspoke about the President's global warming speech and all that the \nWhite House is doing to help frame the debate with his talking points \nmemo which we happened to intercept, and it is very interesting.\n  They also had a secret meeting that took place with alarmist \nSenators. That is the term used over the past 12 years of those \nindividuals who say the world is coming to an end with global warming.\n  First, they changed the name from global warming because it was not \nacceptable. Then they tried climate change. The most recent is carbon \npollution. One of these days they will find something that sells, but \nso far they haven't.\n  The first thing they don't want to talk about is cost. We have had \nseveral global warming and cap-and-trade bills over the past 12 years. \nWhen the first bills came out and the Republicans were in the majority, \nI was the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and \nhad responsibility for defeating them, and we did.\n  In the beginning, with the Kyoto treaty 12 years ago, and when Al \nGore came back from Rio de Janeiro, a lot of people believed this was \ntaking place. Then a group out of the Wharton School did a study and \nsaid if we regulate emissions from organizations emitting 25,000 tons \nor more of CO2 a year, the cost would be between $300 \nbillion and $400 billion a year. As a conservative, I get the most \nrecent information I can from my State of Oklahoma in terms of the \nnumber of people filing Federal tax returns and I do the math. At that \ntime, it meant it would cost each person about $3,000 a year if we had \ncap-and-trade.\n  This kept going throughout the years. The most recent one was \nauthored by now-Senator Markey, who up until yesterday was Congressman \nMarkey. I have a great deal of respect for him, but he had the last \ncap-and-trade bill regulating those with emissions of 25,000 tons a \nyear or more.\n  The cost has never been debated much, because Charles River \nAssociates later came out and said it would be between $300 billion and \n$400 billion a year and MIT said about the same. So we know that cost \nis there.\n  To my knowledge, while no one has actually calculated this, keep in \nmind the President is trying to pass a cap-and-trade policy for \nAmericans through regulation because he was not able to pass it through \nlegislation. If you do it through regulation, it has to be under the \nClean Air Act.\n  The Clean Air Act requires us to regulate any source that puts the \nemissions at over 250 tons. So instead of 25,000 tons being regulated, \nit would be 250 tons. That would mean every hospital, apartment \nbuilding, school, oil and gas well, and every farm would come under \nthis. No one knows exactly what it would cost the economy, but it would \nbe staggering.\n  To pull this off, the EPA alone would have to spend $21 billion and \nhire an additional 23,000 bureaucrats. Those are not my figures; those \nare their figures. So you have to stop and think, if the cap-and-trade \nbills cost $400 billion regulating the emitters of 25,000 tons a year \nor more, imagine what it would be when you drop it down to 250 tons.\n  The second thing the President doesn't want to talk about is the fact \nthat it is a unilateral effort. If you pass a regulation in the United \nStates of America, it is going to only affect the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I have always had a lot of respect for Lisa Jackson. Lisa Jackson was \nthe Administrator of the EPA under the Obama administration. While she \nis liberal and I am conservative, she was always honest in her answers.\n  I asked her this question: If we pass, by either legislation or any \nother way, cap-and-trade in the United States, is that going to reduce \nworldwide CO2 emissions? Her answer was: No. Because if you \ndo that, you are doing it just on the brightest sectors of our economy. \nWithout China, without Mexico, without India and the rest of the world \ndoing it, then U.S. manufacturers could have the reverse effect, \nbecause they could end up going to other countries where there are not \nrestrictions on emissions, and so they would actually be emitting more. \nSo there goes our jobs, overseas, seeking energy in areas where they \nare able to afford it.\n  Lisa Jackson's quote exactly: ``I believe . . . that U.S. action \nalone will not impact CO2 levels.''\n  What the President doesn't want to talk about in his lust for \noverregulation in this country is, one, the fact it is going to cost a \nlot of money and would be the largest tax increase in the history of \nAmerica, without question. The second is even if you do it, it doesn't \nlower emissions.\n  A lot of people say, Why do they want to do it? And I lose a lot of \npeople when I make this statement, but there are a lot of liberals who \nbelieve the government should control our lives more. I had this \nobservation back when I was first elected in the House. One of the \ndifferences between liberals and conservatives is that liberals have a \nbasic philosophy that government can run our lives better than people \ncan.\n  Dr. Richard Lindzen with MIT, one of the most outstanding and \nrecognized scientists in this country and considered to be maybe the \ngreatest source in terms of scientific knowledge, said, ``Controlling \ncarbon is a bureaucrat's dream. If you control carbon, you control \nlife.''\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\n  Tomorrow the Environment and Public Works Committee is going to \nconduct a hearing on climate change--or whatever they call it. I think \nthey are starting out with global warming and may call it carbon \npollution. That is the new word because that is more sellable. A lot \naround here is done with wordsmithing. Republicans and Democrats both \ndo it. Global warming didn't work, climate change didn't work, so now \nit is CO2 pollution. They are going to have a hearing, and \nthe chairman of the committee, Barbara Boxer, is going to have people \ncome in and talk about the world coming to an end. However, the \ninteresting thing is that the administration is sending alarmists to \ntalk about how bad global warming is and how we are going to die, but \nthey are not taking the process seriously enough to send any real \nofficial. We have no government officials as witnesses. This is highly \nunusual. This doesn't happen very often, but that is what we are going \nto be having.\n  It is important for Members to understand that greenhouse gas \nregulations are not the only EPA regulations that are threatening our \neconomy. Again, it is all the regulations by government getting \ninvolved in our lives.\n  If you look at this chart, these are the ones they are actually \nworking on right now in either the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee or the Environmental Protection Agency:\n  Utility MACT. MACT means maximum achievable control technology. So \nwhere is our technology right now? How much can we control? The problem \nwe are having is they are putting the emissions requirements at a level \nthat is below where we have technology to make it happen. So utility \nMACT would cost $100 billion and 1.56 million jobs. That is in the law \nalready. There are a lot of coal plants being shut down right now.\n  But, you might ask, how can they do that when right now we are \nreliant upon coal for 50 percent of the power it takes to run this \nmachine called America?\n  Boiler MACT. Again, maximum achievable control technology. Every \nmanufacturer has a boiler, so this controls all manufacturers. That is \nestimated to cost $63.3 billion and 800,000 jobs.\n  The NAAQS legislation would put a lot of counties out of attainment. \nWhen I was the mayor of Tulsa County and we were out of attainment, we \nwere not able to do a lot of the things in order to recruit industry. \nSo this would put 2,800 counties out of attainment, including all 77 \ncounties in my State of Oklahoma. That causes emissions to increase, \nand then the company would be required to find an offset.\n  We are kind of in the weeds here, but the simple outcome would be \nthat no new businesses would be able to come to an out-of-attainment \narea, and existing businesses wouldn't be allowed to expand.\n  The President is also issuing a new tier 3 standard that applies to \nrefineries as they manufacture gasoline. This rule would cause gasoline \nto rise by 9 cents a gallon.\n  The EPA is also working tirelessly to tie groundwater contamination \nto the hydraulic fracturing process so they and the Federal Government \ncan regulate this. They have tried that in Wyoming in the Pavilion \ncase, they tried it in Pennsylvania in the Dimock case, and in Texas \nthey tried several times.\n  I know something about that, because hydraulic fracturing started in \nthe State of Oklahoma in 1949. Since then, there have been more than 1 \nmillion applications for hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is \na way of getting oil and gas out of tight formations. There has never \nbeen a confirmed case of groundwater contamination, but they still want \nto have this regulated by the Federal Government and the Department of \nInterior is pressing ahead with regulations which would apply to \nFederal lands.\n  President Obama has had a war on fossil fuels now for longer than he \nhas been President of the United States. If they could stop hydraulic \nfracturing and regulate that at the Federal level, then they can stop \nthis boom that is going on in the country. We have had a 40-percent \nincrease in the last 4 years in our production of oil and gas, but that \nis all on private and State land. We have actually had a reduction in \nour production on Federal lands.\n  The EPA has been developing a guidance document for the waters of the \nUnited States which would impose the Clean Water Restoration Act on the \ncountry. They tried to introduce and pass it 2 years ago. Senator \nFeingold from Wisconsin and Congressman Oberstar were the authors. Not \nonly was it defeated, but they were both defeated in their next \nelection. That effort is something the President is again trying to do, \nwhich they were not able to do through regulations.\n  What it means is this: We have rules saying that the Federal \nGovernment is in charge of water runoff in this country only to the \nextent it is navigable. That is the word written into the law. If you \ntake the ``navigable'' out, then if you have standing water after a \nrain, that would be regulated by the Federal Government. That is a \nmajor problem that our farmers have--not just the Oklahoma Farm Bureau \nbut farm bureaus throughout America. The Water Restoration Act and the \ncap-and-trade are the two major issues they are concerned with.\n  A lot of what the EPA has done is done through enforcement. About a \nyear ago, one of our staff persons discovered that a guy named Al \nArmendariz, who was a regional EPA administrator, talking to a bunch of \npeople in Texas, said:\n\n       We need to ``crucify'' the oil and gas industry. Just like \n     when the Romans conquered the villages . . . in Turkish towns \n     and they'd find the first five guys they saw and crucify them \n     . . .\n\n  . . . just to show who was in charge.\n  This is a perspective not just of Armendariz but the entire EPA to \nthe fossil fuel industry.\n  By the way, Armendariz is no longer there. He is with one of the \nenvironmental groups I know, and I am sure he is a lot happier there.\n  The EPA is also dramatically expanding the number of permits they are \nrequired to obtain under the Clean Air Act by counting multiple well \nsites as though they were one site, even though they may be spread out \nin as many as 42 square miles.\n  All of this is so they can regulate more of what goes on at the wells \nand underscores how adversarial they have been to us having the fuel we \nneed to run this country. The EPA was eventually sued and lost the case \nover this issue, the issue of what they are doing right now throughout \nAmerica to try to force all the multiple well sites into one site as \nthey did. They lost in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. But \neveryplace outside of the Sixth Circuit the EPA is still using their \nown regulation. This is one we have been talking to them about.\n  The EPA is also targeting the agricultural community. We talked about \nwhat their top concerns are, but in addition to that, the EPA recently \nreleased the private sensitive data of pork producers and the \nconcentrated animal feeding operations, that is CAFOs, to environmental \ngroups. The environmental groups hate CAFOs and the EPA knows this, so \nby doing this the EPA has enabled the environmental groups to target \nCAFOs and put them out of business.\n  Those are our farmers. It seems to me when people come into my office \nand they talk about the abuses of this overregulation, all these \nthings, it seems the ones who keep getting hit worse and worse are the \nfarmers. I can remember when they tried to treat propane as a hazardous \nwaste. We had a hearing. This was some years ago. I was at that time \nthe chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I can \nremember when they said this only costs the average farmer in Oklahoma \nanother $600 or $700 a year. We went through this thing and were able \nto defeat that.\n  Farmers have been hit hard, but they are not alone. All these \nregulations have been devastating to the entire economy and they are \npreventing us from achieving our economic recovery. The President is \nengaged in all-out war on fossil fuels, and he is intent on completing \nthis until his assault on the free enterprise system is completed. The \nbusiness community knows how bad the regulations are. They have been \nfighting them tooth and nail since the beginning of Obama's first term.\n  This chart shows the rules that were approved during the President's \nfirst term. This is what he did. If you look at it, take some time--\nthese will be printed in the Record so you need to be looking them up \nand realizing how\n\n[[Page S5729]]\n\nserious it is. The greenhouse gas, we talked about that, the EPA, on \nthe diesel engines. All of these regulations are costing fortunes.\n  The second chart--those are the ones that were approved during the \nPresident's first administration. The second is more alarming because \nit shows several of the major rules the President began developing \nduring his first term but delayed their finalization until after the \nelection. They waited until after the election, knowing the American \npeople would realize how costly this was and that could cost his \ncampaign. He is gaming the system using his administration to advance a \ncritical agenda but hiding the truth from the American people and he is \ndoing it with secret talking points and doing it with the secrecy that \nshrouds bad rules.\n  These are the rules that were delayed until after the election. You \ncan get a good idea of the cost. We take down the cost of each one. It \nis just an incredible amount.\n  The third chart is--that is what he is doing right now with no \naccountability to the electorate because he can do anything he wants to \nright now. Groups are on record opposing this. We have all these groups \nthat are on record opposing this: U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, NFIB, American Railroads--all the way \ndown through all the agricultural groups and including a lot of labor \nunions. Historically, the labor unions go right along with the \nDemocrats and with the liberals, but they realize this is a jobs bill \nand consequently we have the United Mine Workers and others who are \nbeing affected by this and are trying to do something about \noverregulation. All these groups have opposed the rules being put out \nby the EPA.\n  Even the unions have opposed the rules because they kill all kinds of \njobs, union and nonunion jobs alike. Cecil Roberts, the president of \nthe United Mine Workers, said his organization supported my \nCongressional Review Act.\n  Let me explain what that was. You may have noticed in the first chart \nwe had the first MACT bill that was passed. That would put coal out of \nbusiness. What we have in this body is a rule that nobody uses very \noften--it has not been used very successfully--but it says if a \nregulator passes something that is not in the best interests of the \npeople, if you get past the Congressional Review Act with just 30 \ncosponsors in the Senate, get a simple majority, you can stop that from \ngoing into effect.\n  I had a CRA on that Utility MACT, and Cecil Roberts, president of the \nUnited Mine Workers, said his organization supported my CRA to overturn \nthe Utility MACT rule because the rule poses loss of jobs to United \nMine Workers Association members.\n  We also had something recently about Jimmy Hoffa that came out.\n  These are jobs. These are important. The national unemployment rate \nis 7.6, but guess what. In Oklahoma we are at full employment. All \nthroughout America, people used to think of the oil belt being west of \nthe Mississippi. That is not true anymore. With the Marcellus chain \ngoing through--you have New York, Pennsylvania--in Pennsylvania I \nunderstand it is the second largest employer up there. If we were able \nto do throughout America what we do in Oklahoma, we would solve the \nproblem we have right now. But the Obama rules are there and Obama \nwants to pursue more that are even worse.\n  I mention this. We are going to have a very fine lady, Gina McCarthy, \nwho has been the Assistant Director of EPA in charge of air regulations \nfor about 4 years. While we get along very well, she is the one who \npromotes these regulations. I will not be able to support her \nnomination. I understand the votes are all there, and we will be having \na good working relationship.\n  But I think it is a wake-up call to the American people. They are \ngoing to have to realize the cost. The total cost of these regulations \nis well over $600 billion annually, which will cost us as many as 9 \nmillion jobs. The EPA is the reason our Nation has not returned to full \nemployment. All of this is done intentionally by the Obama \nadministration to cater to their extreme base--right now moveon.org, \nGeorge Soros, Michael Moore, and that crowd from the far left \nenvironmentalists, Hollywood and their friends.\n  This is going to have to change through a major education endeavor. \nWe have a country to save.\n  I know there is a lot of partisan politics going on. In this case, \nthe least known destructive force in our country now is overregulation \nand all of these organizations that are going to pose it are going to \nhave to pay for it. It is going to be paid for in American dollars and \nAmerican jobs.\n  I see my colleague from Iowa is on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to talk about \nthe President's nominee for Secretary of Labor Tom Perez. I have \nalready spoken about Mr. Perez over the last few weeks. I will not \nrepeat everything I said, but it is important for my colleagues to \nunderstand the basis of my opposition. We have had a lot of debate \naround here over the last few days about what grounds are appropriate \nto oppose an executive branch nominee. Many of my colleagues have \nsuggested that Senators should not vote against such a nominee based on \ndisagreement over policy. That may or may not be the appropriate view, \nbut I am not going to get into that debate today.\n  I am quite sure I would disagree with Mr. Perez on a host of policy \nissues, but I wish to make clear to my colleagues those policy \ndifferences are not the reason I am vigorously opposed to this nominee. \nI am opposed to Mr. Perez because the record he has established of \ngovernment service demonstrates that he is willing to use the levers of \ngovernment power to manipulate the law in order to advance a political \nagenda.\n  Several of my colleagues cited examples of his track record in this \nregard, but in my view perhaps the most alarming example of Mr. Perez's \nwillingness to manipulate the rule of law is his involvement in the \nquid pro quo between the City of St. Paul and the Department of \nJustice. In this deal that the Department of Justice cut with the City \nof St. Paul, the Department agreed not to join two False Claims Act \ncases in exchange for the City of St. Paul withdrawing its case before \nthe Supreme Court in a case called Magner v. Gallagher.\n  Mr. Perez's actions in this case are extremely troubling for a number \nof reasons. At this point, no one disputes the fact that Mr. Perez \nactually orchestrated this entire arrangement. He manipulated the \nSupreme Court docket so that his favored legal theory, called disparate \nimpact theory, would evade review by the High Court. In the process, \nMr. Perez left a whistleblower twisting in the wind. Those are the \nfacts and even Mr. Perez doesn't dispute them.\n  The fact that Mr. Perez struck a deal that potentially squandered up \nto 200 million taxpayer dollars in order to preserve a disparate impact \ntheory that he favored is, of course, extremely troubling in and of \nitself. But in addition to that underlying quid pro quo, the evidence \nuncovered in my investigation revealed Mr. Perez sought to cover up the \nfacts that the exchange ever took place.\n  Finally, and let me emphasize that this should concern all of my \ncolleagues, when Mr. Perez testified under oath about the case, both to \ncongressional investigators and during confirmation hearings, in those \ntwo instances, Mr. Perez told a different story. The fact is that the \nstory Mr. Perez told is simply not supported by the evidence.\n  Let me begin by reviewing briefly the underlying quid pro quo. In the \nfall of 2011, the Department of Justice was poised to join a False \nClaims Act lawsuit against the City of St. Paul. That is where the $200 \nmillion comes in. That is what was expected to be recovered. The career \nlawyers in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota were recommending \nthat the Department of Justice join the case. The career lawyers in the \nCivil Division of the Department of Justice were recommending the \nDepartment join the case. And the career lawyers in the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development were recommending that Justice join the \ncase. At that point, all of the relevant components of government \nbelieved this case was a very good case.\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\nThey considered the case on the merits, and they supported moving \nforward, or as one of the line attorneys wrote in an e-mail in October, \n2011: ``Looks like everyone is on board.'' But of course this was all \nbefore Mr. Perez got involved.\n  At about the same time, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case \ncalled Magner v. Gallagher.\n  In Magner, the City of St. Paul was challenging the use of the \ndisparate impact theory under the Fair Housing Act. The disparate \nimpact theory is a mechanism Mr. Perez and the Civil Rights Division \nwere using in lawsuits against banks for their lending practices. For \ninstance, during this time period Mr. Perez and the Justice Department \nwere suing Countrywide for its lending practices based upon disparate \nimpact analysis. In fact, in December 2011 the Department announced it \nreached a $355 million settlement with Countrywide. Again, in July 2012 \nthe Department of Justice announced a $175 million settlement with \nWells Fargo addressing fair lending claims based upon that same \ndisparate impact analysis. Of course, there are a string of additional \nexamples, but I don't need to recite them here.\n  What is clear is that if that theory were undermined by the Supreme \nCourt, it would likely spell trouble for Mr. Perez's lawsuits against \nthe banks. Mr. Perez approached the lawyers handling the Magner case, \nand, quite simply, he cut a deal. The Department of Justice agreed not \nto join two False Claims Act cases in exchange for the City of St. Paul \nwithdrawing Magner from the Supreme Court. Now we have an interference \nin the agenda of the Supreme Court at the same time that a deal is \ngoing to cut the taxpayers out of winning back $200 million under the \nFalse Claims Act.\n  In early February 2012 Mr. Perez flew to St. Paul, and he flew there \nsolely to finalize the deal. The next week the Justice Department \ndeclined to join the first False Claims Act, called the Newell case. \nThe next day the City of St. Paul kept their end of the bargain and \nwithdrew the Magner case from the Supreme Court.\n  There are a couple of aspects of this deal that I wish to emphasize \nfor my colleagues. First, as I mentioned, the evidence makes clear that \nMr. Perez took steps to cover up the fact he had bartered away the \nFalse Claims Act cases and the $200 million.\n  On January 10, 2012, Mr. Perez called the line attorney in the U.S. \nAttorney's Office regarding the memo in the Newell case. Newell was the \ncase that these same career attorneys I referred to and quoted \npreviously were strongly recommending the United States join before Mr. \nPerez got involved. Mr. Perez called the line attorney and instructed \nhim not to discuss the Magner case in the memo that he prepared \noutlining the reasons for the decisions not to join the case. Here is \nwhat Mr. Perez said on that call:\n\n       Hey, Greg. This is Tom Perez calling you at--excuse me, \n     calling you at 9 o'clock on Tuesday. I got your message. The \n     main thing I want to ask you, I spoke to some folks in the \n     Civil Division yesterday and wanted to make sure that the \n     declination memo that you sent to the Civil Division--and I \n     am sure it probably already does this--but it doesn't make \n     any mention of the Magner case. It is just a memo on the \n     merits of the two cases that are under review in the qui tam \n     context.\n\n  It is pretty clear they didn't want anything in writing that led \npeople to believe there was any deal being made.\n  After that telephone message was left, approximately 1 hour later Mr. \nPerez sent Mr. Brooker a followup e-mail, writing:\n\n       I left a detailed voicemail. Call me if you can after you \n     have a chance to review [the] voicemail.\n\n  Several hours later Mr. Perez sent another followup e-mail, writing:\n\n       Were you able to listen to my message?\n\n  Mr. Perez's voicemail was quite clear and obvious. It told Mr. \nBrooker to ``make sure that the declination memo . . . doesn't make any \nmention of the Magner case. It is just a memo on the merits of the two \ncases.'' It is so very clear. In fact, it couldn't be more clear that \nthis was an effort--that there was no paper trail that there was ever \nany deal made.\n  Yet, when congressional investigators asked Mr. Perez why he left the \nvoicemail, he told an entirely different story. Here is what he told \ninvestigators:\n\n       What I meant to communicate was, it is time to bring this \n     to closure, and if the only issue that is standing in the way \n     is how you talk about Magner, then don't talk about it.\n\n  Anyone who actually listens to the voicemail knows this is plainly \nnot what he said in that voicemail. He didn't say anything about being \nconcerned with the delay. He said: Make sure you don't mention Magner. \nIt is just a memo on the merits. His intent was crystal clear.\n  Mr. Perez also testified that Mr. Brooker called him back the next \nday and refused to omit the discussion of Magner. Let's applaud that \ncivil servant because he chose not to play that game. According to Mr. \nPerez, he told Mr. Brooker during this call to follow the normal \nprocess. Again, this story is not supported by the evidence.\n  One month later, after Mr. Perez flew to Minnesota to personally seal \nthe deal with the city, a line attorney in the Civil Division e-mailed \nhis superior to outline the ``additional facts'' about the deal.\n  Before I begin the quote, I want to give the definition of ``USA-\nMN,'' which stands for ``U.S. Attorney, Minnesota.''\n  Point 6 reads as follows:\n\n       USA-MN considers it non-negotiable that its office will \n     include a discussion of the Supreme Court case and the policy \n     issues in its declination memo.\n\n  If Mr. Perez's story were true and the issue was resolved on January \n11, why 1 month later would the U.S. Attorney's Office need to \nemphatically state that it would not hide the fact that the exchange \ntook place?\n  As I just mentioned, Mr. Perez flew to Minneapolis to finalize the \ndeal on February 3. You would think, wouldn't you, that a deal of this \nmagnitude would be written down so the parties understood exactly what \neach side agreed to. But was this agreement written down? No, it \nwasn't. After Mr. Perez finalized the deal, the career attorneys asked \nif there was going to be a written agreement. What was Mr. Perez's \nresponse? He said: ``No, just oral discussions; word was your bond.''\n  So let me just review. At this point Mr. Perez had just orchestrated \na deal where the United States declined to join a case worth up to $200 \nmillion of taxpayers' money in exchange for the City of St. Paul \nwithdrawing a case from the Supreme Court. When the career lawyers \nasked if this deal will be written down, he said: ``No . . . [your] \nword was your bond.''\n  Of course, the reason you make agreements like this in writing is so \nthat there is no disagreement down the road about what the parties \nagreed to. As it turns out, there was, in fact, a disagreement about \nthe terms of this unwritten deal.\n  The lawyer for the city, Mr. Lillehaug, told congressional \ninvestigators that on January 9, approximately 1 month before the deal \nwas finalized, Mr. Perez had assured him that ``HUD would be helpful'' \nif the Newell case proceeded after the Department of Justice declined \nto intervene. Mr. Lillehaug also told investigators that on February 4, \nthe day after they finalized the deal, Mr. Perez told him that HUD had \nbegun assembling information to assist the city in a motion to dismiss \nthe Newell complaint on ``original source'' grounds. According to Mr. \nLillehaug, this assistance disappeared after the lawyers in the Civil \nDivision learned of it.\n  Why is that significant? Mr. Perez represents the United States. He \nrepresents the American people. Mr. Newell, the whistleblower, is \nbringing a case on behalf of the United States and indirectly the \npeople. Mr. Perez is talking to the lawyers on the other side, and he \ntells the people, in essence: After the United States declines to join \nthe case, we will give you information to help you defeat Mr. Newell, \nwho is bringing the case on behalf of the United States.\n  Let me say that a different way. In effect, Mr. Perez is offering to \ngive the other side information to help defeat his own client. Is that \nthe way you represent the American people? Mr. Perez was asked about \nthis under oath. Mr. Perez told congressional investigators, ``No, I \ndon't recall ever suggesting that.''\n  So on the one hand, we have Mr. Lillehaug, who says Mr. Perez made \nthis offer first in January and then again on February 4 but the \nassistance disappeared after the lawyers in the\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\nCivil Division caught wind of it. On the other hand, it was Mr. Perez \nwho testified under oath: ``I don't recall'' ever making such an offer. \nWhom should we believe? The documents support Mr. Lillehaug's version \nof the event.\n  On February 7, a line attorney sent an e-mail to the director of the \nCivil Fraud Section and relayed a conversation a line attorney in \nMinnesota had with Mr. Lillehaug. The line attorney wrote that Mr. \nLillehaug stated that there were two additional items that were part of \nthe deal. One of the two items was this:\n\n       HUD will provide material to the City in support of their \n     motion to dismiss on original source grounds.\n\n  Internal e-mails show that when the career lawyers learned of this \npromise, they strongly disagreed with it, and they conveyed their \nconcern to Tony West, head of the Civil Division. During his \ntranscribed interviews, Mr. West testified that it would have been \n``inappropriate'' to provide this material outside of the normal \ndiscovery channels. Mr. West said:\n\n       I just know that that wasn't going to happen, and it didn't \n     happen.\n\n  In other words, when the lawyers at the Civil Division learned of \nthis offer, they shut it down.\n  Again, why is this important? It is important because it demonstrates \nthat the documentary evidence shows the events transpired exactly as \nMr. Lillehaug said they did.\n  Mr. Perez offered to provide the other side with information that \nwould help them defeat Mr. Newell in this case on behalf of the United \nStates. In my opinion, this is simply stunning. Mr. Perez represents \nthe United States. Any lawyer would say it is highly inappropriate to \noffer to help the other side defeat their own client.\n\n  This brings me to my final two points that I wish to highlight for my \ncolleagues. Even though the Department traded away Mr. Newell's case \nand $200 million, Mr. Perez has defended his actions, in part by \nclaiming that Mr. Newell still had his ``day in court.'' What Mr. Perez \nomits from his story is that Mr. Newell's case was dismissed precisely \nbecause the United States would not continue to be a party and would \nnot be a party.\n  After the United States declined to join the case, the judge \ndismissed Mr. Newell's case based upon the ``public disclosure bar,'' \nfinding that he was not the original source of information to the \ngovernment.\n  I will remind my colleagues, we amended the False Claims Act several \nyears ago precisely to prevent an outcome such as this. Specifically, \nthe amendments made clear that the Justice Department can contest the \n``original source'' dismissal even if it fails to intervene, as it did \nin this case.\n  So the Department didn't merely decline to intervene, which is bad \nenough, but, in fact, it affirmatively chose to leave Mr. Newell all \nalone in this case. And, of course, that was the whole point. That is \nwhy it was so important for the City of St. Paul to make sure the \nUnited States did not join the case. That is why the city was willing \nto trade away a strong case before the Supreme Court, and when the \nNewell case didn't go forward, they cut the taxpayers out of $200 \nmillion. The city knew if the United States joined the action the case \nwould almost certainly go forward. Conversely, the city knew if the \nUnited States did not join the case and chose not to contest the \noriginal source, it would likely get dismissed.\n  The Department traded away a case worth millions of taxpayers' \ndollars. They did it precisely because of the impact the decision would \nhave on the litigation. They knew as a result of their decision, the \nwhole whistleblower case would get dismissed based upon ``original \nsource'' grounds since the Department didn't contest it. Not only that, \nMr. Perez went so far as to offer to provide documents to the other \nside that would help them defeat Mr. Newell in his case on behalf of \nMr. Perez's client, the United States.\n  That is really looking out for the taxpayers. How would a person like \nto have a lawyer such as Mr. Perez defending them in some death penalty \ncase? Yet when the Congress started asking questions, they had the guts \nto say: ``We didn't do anything improper because Mr. Newell still had \nhis day in court.'' Well, Mr. Newell didn't have his day in court \nbecause the success of that $200 million case was dependent upon the \nUnited States staying in it.\n  Now, this brings me to my last point on the substance of this matter, \nand that has to do with the strength of the case. Throughout our \ninvestigation, the Department has tried to defend Mr. Perez's action by \nclaiming the case was marginal and weak. Once again, however, the \ndocuments tell a far different story.\n  Before Mr. Perez got involved, the career lawyers at the Department \nwrote a memo recommending intervention in the case. In that memo, they \ndescribed St. Paul's actions as ``a particularly egregious example of \nfalse certifications.''\n  In fact, the career lawyers in Minnesota felt so strongly about the \ncase they took the unusual step of flying to Washington, DC, to meet \nwith officials in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, of course, agreed the \nUnited States should intervene in this false claims case. But, of \ncourse, that was all before Mr. Perez got involved.\n  The documents make clear that career lawyers considered it a strong \ncase, but the Department has claimed that Mike Hertz--the Department's \nexpert on the False Claims Act--considered it a weak case. In fact, \nduring his confirmation hearing, Mr. Perez testified before my \ncolleagues on the Senate HELP Committee that Mr. Hertz ``had a very \nimmediate and visceral reaction that it was a weak case.''\n  Once again, the documents tell a much different story than was told \nto Members of the Senate. Mr. Hertz knew about the case in November of \n2011. Two months later, a Department official took notes of a meeting \nwhere the quid pro quo was discussed. The official wrote down Mr. \nHertz's reaction. She wrote:\n  Mike--odd--Looks like buying off St. Paul. Should be whether there \nare legit reasons to decline as to past practice.\n  The next day, the same official e-mailed the associate attorney \ngeneral and said:\n\n       Mike Hertz brought up the St. Paul disparate impact case in \n     which the Solicitor General just filed an amicus brief in the \n     Supreme Court. He's concerned about the recommendation that \n     we decline to intervene in two qui tam cases against St. \n     Paul.\n\n  These documents appear to show that Mr. Hertz's primary concern was \nnot the strength of the case, as Mr. Perez led my Senate colleagues to \nbelieve. Mr. Hertz was concerned the quid pro quo Mr. Perez ultimately \narranged was improper. Again, in his words, it ``looks like buying off \nSt. Paul.'' Yet, Mr. Perez led my colleagues on the HELP Committee to \nbelieve that Mr. Hertz believed it was a bad case on the merits.\n  Let me make one final point regarding process and why it is premature \nto even be having this debate. As of today, when we vote on Mr. Perez's \nnomination, we will be voting on a nominee who, to date, has not \ncomplied with a congressional subpoena compelling him to turn over \ncertain documents to Congress. I am referring to the fact that the \nHouse Committee on Oversight and Government Reform subpoenaed e-mails \nfrom Mr. Perez.\n  During the course of our investigation, we learned that Mr. Perez was \nroutinely using his private e-mail account to conduct government \nbusiness, including business related to the quid pro quo. In fact, the \nDepartment of Justice admitted that Mr. Perez had used his private e-\nmail account approximately 1,200 times to conduct government business. \nAfter Mr. Perez refused to turn those documents over voluntarily, then \nthe House oversight committee was forced to issue a subpoena. Yet, \ntoday, Mr. Perez has refused to comply with the subpoena.\n  Here we have a person in the Justice Department doing all of these \nbad things. People want him to be Secretary of Labor, and we are \nsupposed to confirm somebody who will not respond to a subpoena for \ninformation to which Congress is constitutionally entitled. We have \npeople come before Congress who say, yes, they will respond to letters \nfrom Congress; they will come up and testify; they are going to \ncooperate in the spirit of checks and balances, and then we have \nsomebody before the Senate who will not even respond to a subpoena.\n  So I find it quite troubling that this body would take this step and \nmove forward with a nomination when the\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\nnominee simply refuses to comply with an outstanding subpoena. Can any \nof my colleagues recall an instance in the past when we were asked to \nconfirm a nominee who had flatly refused to comply with a congressional \nsubpoena? Why would we want somebody in the Cabinet thumbing their nose \nat the elected representatives of the people of this country who have \nthe constitutional responsibility of checks and balances to make sure \nthe laws are faithfully executed? That is what they take an oath to do. \nIt is quite extraordinary and should concern all of my colleagues, not \njust Republicans.\n\n  My colleagues are well aware of how I feel about the Whistleblower \nProtection Act, and my colleagues know how I feel about protecting \nwhistleblowers who have the courage to step forward, often at great \nrisk to their careers. But this is about much more than the \nwhistleblower who was left dangling by Mr. Perez. This is about the \nfact that Mr. Perez manipulated the rule of law in order to get a case \nremoved from the Supreme Court docket. And this is about the fact that \nwhen Congress started asking questions about this case, and when Mr. \nPerez was called upon to offer his testimony under oath, he chose to \ntell a different story.\n  The unavoidable conclusion is that the story he told is not supported \nby the facts. This is also about the fact that we are about to confirm \na nominee who, even as of today, is still thumbing his nose at Congress \nby refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena.\n  I began by saying that although I disagree with Mr. Perez on a host \nof policy issues, those disagreements are not the primary reason my \ncolleagues should reject this nomination. We should reject this \nnomination because Mr. Perez manipulated the levers of power available \nto few people in order to save a legal theory from Supreme Court \nreview.\n  Perhaps more importantly, when Mr. Perez was called upon to answer \nquestions about his actions under oath, I do not believe he gave us a \nstraight story.\n  Finally, we should reject this nomination because Mr. Perez failed--\nand refuses still--to comply with a congressional subpoena.\n  For these reasons, I strongly oppose the nomination, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I have completed my statement and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to my \nfriend from Iowa, and I couldn't disagree with him more. I know he has \nvery strong views about the nomination of Tom Perez, but let me go \nthrough the record.\n  I wish to spend a little bit of time speaking first about Tom Perez. \nI know him very well. We have served together in government in \nMaryland. He served on the county council of Montgomery County. I will \nmention that he was the first Latino to serve on the county council of \nMontgomery County. Montgomery County, which is very close to here, is \nlarger than some of our States. It is a large government. It has very \ncomplex problems. He served with great distinction on the county \ncouncil.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, it is a very difficult responsibility \nto serve local government. One has to deal with the day-to-day problems \nof the people in the community. He served with such distinction that he \nwas selected to be the president of the county council, the head of the \ncounty council of Montgomery County.\n  He then went on to become the Secretary of the Department of Labor, \nLicensing and Regulation under Governor O'Malley in the State of \nMaryland, which is a very comparable position to which President Obama \nhas appointed him as Secretary of Labor in his Cabinet.\n  It is very interesting that as Secretary of Labor, Licensing and \nRegulation, he had to deal with very difficult issues--issues that can \ndivide groups. But, instead, he brought labor and business together and \nresolved many issues.\n  It is very interesting, in his confirmation process, business leaders \nand labor leaders came forward to say this is the right person at the \nright time to serve as Secretary of Labor in the Obama administration.\n  I held a press briefing with the former head of the Republican party \nin Maryland and he was very quick to point out that Tom Perez and he \ndid not agree on a lot of policy issues, but he is a professional, he \nlistens, and tries to make the right judgment. That is why he should be \nconfirmed as Secretary of Labor. That was the former head of the \nRepublican party in Maryland who made those statements a few months \nago.\n  Tom Perez has a long history of public service. He served originally \nin the Department of Justice in many different capacities. He started \nin the Department of Justice. He served in the Civil Rights Division \nand, of course, later became the head of the Civil Rights Division. He \nhelped us in the Senate, serving as a staff person for Senator Kennedy.\n  I think the greatest testimony of his effectiveness is how he has \ntaken the Civil Rights Division from a division that had lost a lot of \nits glamour, a lot of its objectivity under the previous \nadministration, and is returning the Department of Justice to that \ngreat institution to protect the rights of all Americans.\n  Look at his record in the Department of Justice: Enforcement of the \nShepard-Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The division convicted 141 \ndefendants on hate crimes charges in 4 years. That is a 74-percent \nincrease over the previous 4 years. The division brought 194 human \ntrafficking cases. That is a 40-percent increase.\n  You could talk a good deal about what happened between 2004 and 2008 \nwith Countrywide Financial Corporation, one of the Nation's largest \nresidential mortgage lenders, engaging in systematic discrimination \nagainst African-American and Latino borrowers by steering them into \nsubprime loans or requiring them to pay more for their mortgages. I \nknow the pain that caused. I met with families who should have been in \ntraditional mortgages who were steered into subprime loans, and they \nlost their homes. Tom Perez represented them in one of the largest \nrecoveries ever. The division's settlement in 2011 required Bank of \nAmerica--now the owner of Countrywide--to provide $335 million in \nmonetary relief to the more than 230,000 victims of discriminatory \nlending--the largest fair lending settlement in history.\n  That is the record of Tom Perez as the head of the Civil Rights \nDivision.\n  The division investigated Wells Fargo Bank, the largest residential \nhome mortgage lender in the United States, alleging that the bank \nengaged in a nationwide pattern or practice of discrimination against \nminority borrowers placed, again, in subprime loans. The division's \nsettlement--the largest per-victim recovery ever reached in a division \nlending discrimination case--required Wells Fargo to pay more than $184 \nmillion to compensate discrimination victims and to make a $50 million \ninvestment in a home buyer assistance program.\n  I could go on and on and on about the record Tom Perez has in his \npublic service--at the county level, at the State level, and at the \nFederal level. He has devoted his career to public service and has \ngotten the praise of conservatives and progressives, Democrats and \nliberals, and business leaders and labor leaders. That is the person we \nneed to head the Department of Labor.\n  So let my spend a few minutes talking about Senator Grassley's two \npoints that he raises as to why we should deny confirmation of the \nnomination of Tom Perez, the President's choice for his Cabinet.\n  He talked about the fact that Tom Perez has not answered all the \ninformation Senator Grassley would like to see from a House committee--\na partisan effort in the House of Representatives. It is not the only \ncase. There is hardly a day or a week that goes by that there is not \nanother partisan investigation in the House of Representatives. That is \nthe matter the Senator from Iowa was talking about--not an effort that \nwe try to do in this body, in the Senate, to work bipartisanly when we \nare doing investigations. This has been a partisan investigation.\n  Thousands of pages of documents have been made available to \ncongressional committees by the Department of Justice. So let's get the \nrecord straight as to compliance. The Department of Justice, Tom Perez, \nhas complied with the reasonable requests of\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\nthe Congress of the United States and spent a lot of time doing that. \nIt is our responsibility for oversight, and we have carried out our \nresponsibility for oversight. Any balanced review of the work done by \nthe Department of Justice Civil Rights Division will give the highest \nmarks to Tom Perez on restoring the integrity of that very important \ndivision in the Department of Justice.\n  Let me talk about the second matter Senator Grassley brings up, and \nthat deals with the City of St. Paul case--one case. It dealt with the \ncity of St. Paul in the Supreme Court Magner case.\n  Senator Grassley points out, and correctly so, this is a disparate \nimpact case. It not only affects the individual case that is before the \nCourt, it will have an impact on these types of cases generally. When \nyou are deciding whether to litigate one of these cases, you have to \nmake a judgment as to whether this is the case you want to present to \nthe Court to make a point that will affect not only justice for the \nlitigant but for many other litigants. You have to decide the risk of \nlitigation versus the benefit of litigation. You have to make some \ntough choices as to whether the risk is worth the benefit.\n  In this case, the decision was made, not by Tom Perez, not by one \nperson. Career attorneys were brought into the mix, and career \nattorneys--career attorneys--advised against the Department of Justice \ninterceding in this case. HUD lawyers thought this was not a good case \nfor the United States to intercede.\n  Senator Grassley says: Well, this was a situation where there was a \nquid pro quo. It was not. There was a request that the United States \nintercede and dismiss. Tom Perez said: No, we are not going to do that. \nThe litigation went forward. So a professional decision was made based \nupon the best advice, gotten by career attorneys--attorneys from the \nagency that was directly affected by the case that was before the \nCourt--and a decision was made that most objective observers will tell \nyou was a professional judgment that is hard to question. It made sense \nat the time.\n  I understand Senator Grassley has a concern about the case. People \ncan come to different conclusions. But look at the entire record of Tom \nPerez. I think he made the right decision in that case. But I know he \nhas a proud record of leadership on behalf of the rights of all \nAmericans, and that is the type of person we should have as Secretary \nof Labor.\n\n  Tom Perez has been through confirmation before. He was confirmed by \nthe Judiciary Committee to serve as the head of the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Department of Justice. Thorough vetting was done at \nthat time. Questions were asked, debate was held on the floor of the \nSenate, and by a very comfortable margin he was confirmed to be the \nhead of the Civil Rights Division.\n  Now the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has held a \nhearing on Tom Perez to be Secretary of Labor. They held a vote several \nmonths ago and reported him favorably to the floor. It is time for us \nto have an up-or-down vote on the President's nomination for Secretary \nof Labor. I hope all my colleagues would vote to allow this nomination \nto be voted up or down.\n  I was listening to my distinguished friend from Iowa. I heard nothing \nthat would deny us the right to have a vote on a Presidential \nnomination. That is the first vote we are going to have on whether we \nare going to filibuster a Cabinet position for the President of United \nStates and a person whose record is distinguished with a long record of \npublic service--and a proven record.\n  Then the second vote is on confirmation, and Senators may disagree. I \nrespect every Senator to do what he or she thinks is in the best \ninterests. But I would certainly hope on this first vote, when we are \ndealing with whether we are going to filibuster a President's \nnomination for Secretary of Labor, that we would get the overwhelming \nsupport of our colleagues to allow an up-or-down vote on Tom Perez to \nbe the next Secretary of Labor.\n  I started by saying I have known Tom Perez for a long time, and I \nhave. I know he is a good person, a person who is in public service for \nthe right reasons, a person who believes each individual should be \nprotected under our system, and that as Secretary of Labor he will use \nthat position to bring the type of balance we need in our commercial \ncommunities to protect working people and businesses so the American \neconomy can grow and everyone can benefit from our great economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this nomination and certainly to \nsupport moving forward on an up-or-down vote on the nomination to be \nSecretary of Labor.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by concurring with the \nremarks of Senator Cardin. Tom Perez will make an excellent Secretary \nof Labor, and I strongly support his nomination.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. President, it is no great secret that the Congress is currently \nheld in very low esteem by the American people, and there are a lot of \nreasons for that. But I think the major reason, perhaps, is, in the \nmidst of so many serious problems facing our country, the American \npeople perceive that we are not addressing those issues, and they are \nright.\n  Regardless of what your political point of view may be, we are \nlooking at a middle class that is disappearing. Are we addressing that \nissue? No. Poverty is extraordinarily high. Are we moving aggressively \nto address that? No, we are not. We have the most expensive health care \nsystem in the world, enormously bureaucratic and wasteful. Are we \naddressing that? No, we are not. But the issue I want to talk about \ntoday--maybe more clearly than any other issue in terms of our \nneglect--is the issue of global warming.\n  At a time when virtually the entire scientific community--the people \nwho spend their lives studying climate change--tells us that global \nwarming is real, that it is significantly caused by human activity, and \nthat it is already doing great damage, it is beyond comprehension that \nthis Senate, this Congress, is not even discussing that enormously \nimportant issue on the floor of the Senate. Where is the debate? Where \nis the legislation on what might be considered the most significant \nplanetary crisis we face? I fear very much that our children and our \ngrandchildren--who will reap the pain from our neglect--will never \nforgive us for not moving in the way we should be moving.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues, including my good friend Jim \nInhofe from Oklahoma--whom I like very much--that some of my Republican \nfriends, especially, believe global warming is a hoax. They believe \nglobal warming is a hoax perpetrated by Al Gore, the United Nations, \nthe Hollywood elite. This is what people such as Jim Inhofe actually \nbelieve.\n  Well, I have to say to my good friend Mr. Inhofe that he is dead \nwrong. Global warming is not just a crisis that will impact us in years \nto come, it is impacting us right now, and it is a crisis we must \naddress. In fact, global warming is the most serious environmental \ncrisis facing not just the United States of America but our entire \nplanet, and we cannot continue to ignore that reality.\n  Science News reports that cities in America matched or broke at least \n29,000 high-temperature records last year.\n  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n2012 was the warmest year ever recorded for the contiguous United \nStates. It was the hottest year ever recorded in New York, in \nWashington, DC, in Louisville, KY, and in my hometown of Burlington, \nVT, and other cities across the Nation.\n  Our oceans also are warming quickly and catastrophically. A new study \nfound that North Atlantic waters last summer were the warmest in 159 \nyears of record-keeping. The United Nations World Meteorological \nOrganization in May issued a warning about ``the loss of Arctic sea ice \nand extreme weather that is increasingly shaped by climate change.''\n  Scientists are now warning that the Arctic may experience entirely \nice-free summers within 2 years. Let me repeat that. The Arctic may \nexperience entirely ice-free summers within 2 years. Scientists are \nalso reporting that carbon dioxide levels have reached a dangerous \nmilestone level of 400 parts per\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\nmillion, a level not seen on the planet Earth for millions of years.\n  In fact, the world's leading scientists unequivocally agree. A recent \nreview of the scientific literature found that more than 98 percent of \npeer-reviewed scientific studies on climate change support the \nconclusion that human activity is causing climate change. The American \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, one of the most important \nand prestigious scientific organizations in our country and the world, \nthis is what they say:\n\n       Among scientists, there is now overwhelming agreement based \n     on multiple lines of scientific evidence that global climate \n     change is real. It is happening right now. It will have broad \n     impacts on society.\n\n  That is from the American Association for the Advancement of Science. \nWe are not into speculation. We are not into debate. The conclusion is \nthere. Global warming is real. It is happening right now. It is \nimpacting the United States of America and the world right now. It will \nonly get worse if we do not act.\n  The examples of that are so numerous that one can go on hour after \nhour. But let me give you just a few. Extreme weather events are now \noccurring with increased frequency and increased intensity; that is, \nextreme weather disturbances. In 2011 and 2012, the United States \nexperienced an extraordinary 25 billion-dollar disasters--25 separate \nbillion-dollar disasters, so called because they each caused more than \n$1 billion worth of damage.\n  That is unprecedented. NOAA's Climate Extreme Index, which is a \nsystem for assessing a wide range of extreme weather that includes \nextreme temperatures, extreme drought, extreme precipitation, tropical \nstorms--NOAA's Climate Extreme Index tells us that 2012 was \ncharacterized by the second most extreme climate conditions ever \nrecorded.\n  A number of colleagues make the point--they come up and say: Senator \nSanders and others, dealing with climate change is going to be \nexpensive. Transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels is \ngoing to be expensive. They are right. It is going to be expensive.\n  But the question we have to ask is, compared to what? Compared to \ndoing nothing? Compared to conducting business as usual? Compared to \nallowing a significant increase in drought, in floods, in extreme \nweather disturbances? Compared to that, acting now and acting boldly is \ncost-effective. Yes, it will be expensive. But it will be a lot less \nexpensive, cause a lot less human pain and less human deaths than \nallowing global warming to continue unmitigated.\n  The cost--and this is an interesting point, especially for my \nconservative friends who look to the business community for information \nand for analysis. The cost of catastrophe and extreme weather events \nhas been trending upward for 30 years. This is very much a budget and \neconomic issue. Munich Re, the largest reinsurance company in the \nworld, the company that insures the insurance companies, has already \ndocumented a fivefold increase in extreme weather events in North \nAmerica since 1980.\n  They keep track of this stuff pretty closely because for them this is \na dollars-and-cents issue. They are the ones who help others pay out \nthe benefits when there is extreme damage as a result of storms and \nfloods, et cetera. Munich Re calculated that the economic cost of \ndamages due to natural catastrophes in the United States exceeded $139 \nbillion in 2012 alone.\n  So when you talk about money and you talk about expense and you talk \nabout cost, let's understand that we already are racking up \nrecordbreaking costs in terms of dealing with the extreme weather \ndisturbances we have seen in recent years.\n  The Allianz insurance company noted bluntly last fall, ``Climate \nchange represents a threat to our business.'' That is an insurance \ncompany. But it is not just the insurance companies; it is the \nbusinesses that are seeing insurance become unaffordable when they are \nhit with floods and other disasters. That comes right out of their \nbottom line.\n  Global warming, of course, is closely tied to drought and fire as \nwell. Last year's drought affecting two-thirds of the United States was \nthe worst in half a century. But the United States is not the only \ncountry on Earth being impacted.\n\n  We obviously pay attention to what is happening within our borders. \nBut global warming is having huge impacts all over this planet. Brazil \nis experiencing its worst drought in 50 years. It is directly affecting \nover 10 million people in that country. Because of impacts to wheat \nfarms, the price of flour rose over 700 percent.\n  Australia just experienced a 4-month heat wave with severe wildfires, \nrecord-setting temperatures and torrential rains and flooding causing \nover $2 billion in damage in that country.\n  In recent years, other parts of the world--Russia, China, Southern \nEurope and Eastern Europe--have also suffered severe heat waves and \ndroughts, with substantial impacts to agricultural communities and \ntheir economic well-being.\n  Just weeks ago, as everybody in America knows, we watched as fires \nraged across parts of the Western United States, including the massive \nand dangerously explosive West Fork fire in southwestern Colorado. Let \nme take a moment now to acknowledge the deaths of 19 unbelievably brave \nfirefighters from Prescott, AZ, who lost their lives trying to protect \ntheir neighbors and property near Phoenix.\n  Wildfires such as these appear to be increasingly common. In fact, \nthe Chief of the U.S. Forest Service Thomas Tidwell reported to \nCongress that America's wildfire season lasts 2 months longer than it \ndid 40 years ago and burns twice as much land as it did then because of \nthe hotter, drier conditions from climate change.\n  Last year's extraordinary wildfires burned more than 9 million acres \nof land, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Chief \nTidwell also warned of the increasing frequency of monster fires. When \nwe are talking about drought, it is not just some kind of abstraction. \nWhen drought occurs, agriculture suffers. When agriculture suffers, the \ncost of food goes up. In parts of the world where people have very \nlittle money, this is catastrophic.\n  That is one of the points made by the CIA, the Department of Defense, \nmany of our intelligence agencies. When they talk about national \nsecurity issues, they often put at the top of the list or close to the \ntop of the list global warming because they understand that drought and \nfloods mean people do not have the food they need, people do not have \nthe water they need, people are going to migrate from one area to \nanother. It is going to cause tension. It is going to cause conflict. \nSo global warming is also a major national security issue.\n  One of the issues we do not talk enough about--I know Senator \nWhitehouse of Rhode Island does talk about it--is the impact that \nglobal warming is having on our oceans that is driving fish to deeper, \ncooler waters, threatening the fishing industry and food security. In \nthe Pacific Northwest, for example, according to NOAA and as reported \nby USA Today, just this spring shellfish farmers on the west coast are \nincreasingly experiencing collapses in both hatcheries and natural \necosystems.\n  Extreme weather and rising sea levels also threaten people across the \nplanet. More than 31 million people fled their homes just last year \nbecause of disasters related to floods and storms tied to climate \nchange. According to a number of sources, climate change will create, \nin years to come, even larger numbers of what we call climate refugees \nas low-lying countries lose land mass to rising seas and to \ndesertification, consuming once-fertile territory.\n  In northern India, nearly 6,000 people are dead or missing from \ndevastating floods and landslides just last month. Closer to home, \nHurricane Sandy alone displaced three-quarters of a million people in \nthe United States and is costing us up to 60 billion Federal dollars in \nhelping those communities rebuild.\n  Permanent displacement is already occurring in the United States. In \nother words, people are permanently losing their residences. The Army \nCorps of Engineers predicted that the entire village of Newtok, AK, \ncould be underwater by 2017, and more than 180 additional Native \nAlaskan villages are at risk. Parts of Alaska are literally vanishing.\n  Scientists believe that entire U.S. cities or parts of coastal cities \nare in danger of being flooded as well. In fact,\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n\nexperts are telling us that cities such as Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, New \nYork, New Orleans, and others will face a growing threat of partial \nsubmersion within just a few decades as sea levels and storm surge \nlevels continue to climb and that entire countries--small island \nnations such as Micronesia and the Maldives and large nations such as \nIndonesia face similar risk.\n  Ironically, rising sea levels are even threatening key oil industry \ninfrastructure. For example, scientists at NOAA are estimating that \nportions of the Louisiana State Highway 1 will be inundated by rising \nhigh tides 30 times per year. Highway 1 provides the only access to a \nport servicing nearly one out of every five barrels of the U.S. oil \nsupply.\n  What is my point? My point is that we are facing a horrendous \nplanetary crisis. We cannot continue to ignore it. We must act, and we \nmust act now.\n  In my view, the first thing we must do is we must not make a terribly \ndangerous situation--i.e., global warming and greenhouse gas \nemissions--even worse than it is right now. We must break our \ndependence on fossil fuels, not expand it. We must modernize our grid \nand transform our energy system to one based on sustainable energy \nsources, and we must move aggressively toward energy efficiency.\n  In that process, we must reject the Keystone XL Pipeline proposal, \nwhich would dramatically increase carbon dioxide emissions, according \nto the EPA, by the equivalent of 18.7 million metric tons per year, \nreleasing as much as 935 million metric tons over 50 years. In other \nwords, the planet faces a crisis right now. Why would we think for one \nsecond about making that crisis even worse?\n  Further, Congress needs to end wasteful subsidies for the industries \nthat are causing climate change. According to a report by DBL \nInvestors, between 1918 and 2009, the oil and gas industry received \ngovernment subsidies to the tune of $446 billion, to say nothing of \nState subsidies which have benefited from decades' worth of backroom \npolitical deals. In other words, why are we continuing to subsidize \nthose industries that are helping to bring devastating damage to our \nplanet.\n  Thirdly, even though fossil fuels are the most expensive fuels on \nEarth, the fossil fuel industry for too long has shifted these enormous \ncosts onto the public, walking away with billions in profits while the \nAmerican people have to bear the real costs of rising seas, monster \nstorms, devastating droughts, heat waves, and other extreme weather. \nWhen people tell you that coal or oil is cheap, what they are \nforgetting about are the social costs in terms of infrastructure damage \nand in terms of human health. These fuels are not cheap.\n  As we transform our energy system away from fossil fuels, we must \nfinally begin pricing carbon pollution emissions so the polluters \nthemselves begin carrying the costs instead of passing them on to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  I am proud to have joined with Senator Barbara Boxer, the chairperson \nof the Environment Committee in the Senate, to introduce the Climate \nProtection Act earlier this year. Our bill establishes a fee on carbon \npollution emissions, an approach endorsed by people all across the \npolitical spectrum, including conservatives such as George Shultz, \nNobel Laureate economist Gary Becker, Mitt Romney's former economic \nadviser Gregory Mankiw, former Reagan adviser Art Laffer, former \nRepublican Congressman Bob Inglis, and others.\n  Our bill does a number of things. One of the things it does is return \n60 percent of the revenue raised directly back to taxpayers in order to \naddress increased fuel costs. It puts money, substantial sums of money, \ninto supporting sustainable energy research, weatherizing homes, job \ncreation, and helping manufacturing businesses save money through \nenergy efficiency and deficit reduction.\n  This begins the process of transforming our energy system by imposing \na fee on carbon. It deincentivizes fossil fuel by putting money into \nenergy efficiency and sustainable energy. It helps us move in a very \ndifferent and healthier direction.\n  Let me conclude by going back to the point that I made when we \nstarted. The American people are shaking their heads at what goes on in \nWashington.\n  This country is facing enormous problems, economic problems, social \nproblems, and I would argue that in global warming we face a planetary \ncrisis. The American people want us to act. It is incomprehensible that \nweek after week, month after month, year after year, we are not \naddressing the issue of global warming.\n  I hope sooner rather than later we will bring serious legislation to \nthe floor of the Senate, that we have that debate, and we do what the \nplanetary crisis requires; that is, transform our energy system, move \naway from fossil fuel, and move to energy efficiency and sustainable \nenergy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                            Perez Nomination\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concerns over \nthe President's nomination of Thomas Perez to be Secretary of the \nDepartment of Labor.\n  When executing its advice-and-consent role, which, of course, is \nensconced within the Constitution itself, it is the duty of the Senate \nto ensure that the people the President appoints to positions of power \nare of the highest caliber. It is our duty to examine their record and \nto determine whether each nominee ought to be granted the public trust.\n  While no one can deny that Mr. Perez has spent his career in public \nservice, I am afraid his record raises serious concerns over his \nability to fairly and impartially lead the Department of Labor. Mr. \nPerez has a documented record of acting with political motivation and \nbeing a partisan, selective enforcer of the law. He has been misleading \nin his sworn testimony and ethically questionable in some of his \nactions.\n  For example, during his tenure at the Department of Justice, Mr. \nPerez has been in charge of the Civil Rights Division, which includes \nthe voting rights section. One would hope that if any part of the \nDepartment of Justice would be apolitical, it would be the Civil Rights \nDivision. But under Mr. Perez's watch, the voting rights section has \ncompiled a disturbing record of political discrimination and selective \nenforcement of the law.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. All you have to do is take a \nlook at the 258-page report issued by the Department of Justice \ninspector general earlier this year.\n  The report cites a ``deep ideological polarization'' of the voting \nrights section under Mr. Perez. It goes on to say this polarization \n``has at times been a significant impediment to the operation of the \nSection and has exacerbated the potential appearance of politicized \ndecisionmaking.''\n  Instead of upholding and enforcing all laws equally, Mr. Perez \nlaunched politically motivated campaigns against commonsense \nconstitutional provisions such as voter ID both in Texas and in South \nCarolina.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, in an opinion written by John \nPaul Stevens, who was, by all accounts, an independent member of the \nSupreme Court, the Supreme Court of the United States held that \ncommonsense voter identification requirements are not an undue burden \non the right to cast one's ballot and, indeed, are a reasonable means \nby which voter fraud is combated and protection of the integrity of the \nballot is ensured.\n  Yet Thomas Perez, working at the Department of Justice, targeted the \nvoter ID requirement passed by the Texas Legislature and blocked it \neffectively, and the same thing in South Carolina, based on nothing but \npolitics--certainly not based on U.S. Supreme Court precedent that \nstates it was not an undue burden on the right to vote, and it was a \nlegitimate means to protect the integrity of the ballot and to combat \nfraud.\n  The inspector general goes on to describe misleading testimony that \nMr. Perez gave before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in 2010 about \na prominent voting rights case, stating that it ``did not reflect the \nentire story regarding the involvement of political appointees.'' This \nis why, when you are sworn in as a witness in court, you are asked to \ntell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. When what \nyou say is the truth but you leave out other information, it can, in \neffect, by\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\nits context, not be truthful. This is part of the problem with the \ntestimony Mr. Perez gave before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.\n  Going further back, we can see Mr. Perez's ideological roots started \nas a local official in Montgomery County, MD. During his tenure on the \ncounty council, he consistently opposed the proper enforcement of our \nimmigration laws. In fact, he went so far as to testify against \nenforcement measures that were being considered by the Maryland State \nLegislature.\n  Finally, there is the matter of Mr. Perez's quid pro quo dealings \nwith the City of St. Paul, MN. Of course, I am referring to the well-\npublicized decision of Mr. Perez to withhold Department of Justice \nsupport for a lawsuit against the City of St. Paul. He did so in \nexchange for the city withdrawing a case that it had before the Supreme \nCourt, a case that many would have believed would have resulted in the \nCourt rejecting an aggressive interpretation of the Fair Housing Act \nthat guided Mr. Perez and the Department of Justice.\n  In fact, that is the reason he did it. He was afraid the Supreme \nCourt would rebuke the Department of Justice's aggressive \ninterpretation of the Fair Housing Act. While this may not have been a \ndirect violation of any laws, it is, at best, ethically dubious.\n  In summation, we have a nominee for the Department of Labor who has a \nrecord of ideological, polarizing leadership; giving incomplete and \nthereby misleading testimony before official tribunals; and of \nenforcing the law in a partisan and selective manner--in essence, a \n``you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours'' way of going about the \npublic's business.\n  As citizens we should ask, Is this the type of person we would want \nto serve in the President's Cabinet? As Senators, we ought to ask, Is \nthis the best we can do for the Secretary of the Department of Labor?\n  I believe Mr. Perez's record disqualifies him from running this or \nany other executive agency of the Federal Government. I fear his \nleadership would needlessly politicize the Department and impose top-\ndown ideological litmus tests. For all these reasons, I oppose his \nnomination and encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of Fred Hochberg to be the President and Chairman of the \nExport-Import Bank of the United States.\n  Despite taking the helm of the Bank in the midst of the worst \nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression, Mr. Hochberg's leadership \nexpanded financing for American exporters when private financing was \nnearly impossible to acquire. In 2012, the Export-Import Bank helped to \nsupport an estimated 255,000 American jobs at 3,400 companies, and 85 \npercent of Export-Import Bank transactions directly benefited small \nbusinesses.\n  The Export-Import Bank is self-sustaining, charging fees to cover its \nexpenses and creating no cost to U.S. taxpayers. Furthermore, since \n2008, the Bank has been able to send nearly $1.6 billion in profits to \nthe U.S. Treasury.\n  Mr. Hochberg was first nominated to be President and Chairman of the \nExport-Import Bank on April 20, 2009, and he was confirmed unanimously \nby this body on May 14, 2009. Mr. Hochberg was renominated by President \nObama on March 21, 2013, and he was approved 20-2 in the Senate Banking \nCommittee on June 6, 2013. I urge my colleagues to once again confirm \nMr. Hochberg without delay.\n  If we fail to confirm Mr. Hochberg before July 20, we run the risk of \nleaving the Bank without a quorum to act on many of the transactions \nbefore it--creating an uneven playing field for American workers and \nexporters.\n  Mr. Hochberg's nomination is supported by both labor and business \ngroups. These two groups understand the importance of the United States \nnot unilaterally disarming against our global competitors. The Bank \nplays a very important part in this country's efforts to expand exports \nand create good, high-paying jobs in America. Mr. Hochberg has been \ninstrumental in this effort and should be confirmed.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support President Hochberg's nomination \ntoday.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the \nconfirmation of the Hochberg nomination occur at 3:40 p.m. today; that \nif the nomination is confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that \nno further motions be in order; that any related statements be printed \nin the Record; and that President Obama be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action.\n  What time is it right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 3:33 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. I wish to modify my request to reflect a voting time of \n3:35.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Senators should expect two votes; the vote on confirmation \nof the Hochberg nomination to the Ex-Im Bank and the vote on the motion \nto invoke cloture on the Perez nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Fred P. \nHochberg to be president of the Export-Import Bank of the United \nStates?\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Then I ask for 1 minute following the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Florida? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Before we vote on this, especially to my colleagues on the \nRepublican side, we are about to give 60 votes to a nominee who is not \nin compliance with a congressional subpoena.\n  I have in my hand a letter sent to me moments ago by Darrell Issa, \nthe chairman of the Oversight Committee in the House, where he writes \nin part that ``Mr. Perez has not produced a single document responsive \nto the Committee's subpoena. I am extremely disappointed that Mr. Perez \ncontinues to willfully disregard a lawful subpoena issued by a standing \nCommittee of the United States House of Representatives. . . . This \ncontinued noncompliance contravenes fundamental principles of \nseparation of powers and the rule of law. Until Mr. Perez produces all \nresponsive documents, he will continue to be noncompliant with the \nCommittee's subpoena. Thank you for your attention to this matter.''\n  He goes on to note, by the way, that Mr. Perez has not produced a \nsingle document to the committee; therefore, he remains noncompliant.\n  Members, you are about to vote to give 60 votes to cut off debate on \na nominee who has ignored a congressional subpoena from the House on \ninformation relevant to his background and to his qualifications for \nthis office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. The Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the contentions made by the Senator are \nabsolutely wrong. We had a hearing on this. We explored it in our \ncommittee. Instead of the 1,200 e-mails they cite, we are talking about \nthat over a 3\\1/2\\-year period there were 35 e-mails located on his \npersonal emails that touched Department of Justice business and were \nnot forwarded to the Department of Justice, and those have been looked \nat, and none of them demonstrate that he acted improperly or \nunethically. When they were discovered, the e-mails were immediately \nforwarded to the DOJ server and are now part of the DOJ record \nretention system.\n  I might add that the 35 e-mails were made available to the House \nOversight Committee staff prior to Mr. Perez's confirmation hearing, \nand the Senate HELP Committee staff have also been offered access to \nreview all of those e-mails.\n  The contentions made by the Senator from Florida are just absolutely \nwrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate \nthat debate on the nomination of Thomas Edward Perez, of Maryland, to \nbe Secretary of Labor shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 60, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 177 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Alexander\n     Baldwin\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Chiesa\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Lee\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--S. Con. Res. 25\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased that yesterday the Senate \nwas able to come together and work out a bipartisan agreement to make \nsome progress on approving President Obama's nominees. This is a great \nexample of the kind of work I hope we can do more of going forward, \nbecause gridlock is getting in the way of progress on far too many \nissues that affect the families and communities we have a \nresponsibility to serve.\n  One of the most egregious examples that still remains is the \nRepublican leadership blocking a bipartisan budget conference--and the \nregular order they called for--in order, it appears, to gain leverage \nby manufacturing a crisis come this fall.\n  Democrats have come to the floor to talk about this a lot over the \npast few weeks. Unfortunately, it seems to be getting worse and not \nbetter.\n  We have heard from more and more tea party Republicans about their \nlatest brinkmanship threat. They are now saying: Defund health care \nreform or we are going to shut down the government.\n  I wish I were making this up, but it is real. The House has already \ntried to repeal this law 37 times. In fact, just for good measure, they \nare voting on it again this week.\n  We all know that is not serious. It is certainly not governing. It is \npointless pandering, and it does absolutely nothing to help the \nfamilies and communities we represent.\n  There are so many real problems we all need to be focused on. We need \nto protect our fragile economic recovery and get more of our workers \nback on the job. We need to replace sequestration and we need to tackle \nour long-term deficit challenges responsibly. We have to stop this \nlurching from crisis to crisis and return to regular order and give \nfamilies and communities the certainty they deserve. The only way we \ncan do that is if we all work together, and the last thing we need to \ndo right now is to rehash old political fights.\n  Based on what I am hearing more and more of in recent days, not only \nare tea party Republicans willing to push us toward a crisis this fall, \nbut they will do that to cut off health care coverage for 25 million \npeople and end the preventive care for our seniors that is free, and \ncause our seniors to pay more for prescriptions.\n  These political games may play well with the tea party base, but here \nis the reality: ObamaCare is the law of the land. It passed through \nthis Senate with a majority. The Supreme Court upheld it. It is already \ntoday helping millions of Americans stay healthy and financially \nsecure. We should all be working together right now to make sure it is \nimplemented in the best way possible for our families and our \nbusinesses and our communities. Instead, what we are hearing is some \nempty political threats and a push for more gridlock here in the \nSenate.\n  I don't think it is a coincidence that the very people who are now \npushing\n\n[[Page S5738]]\n\nfor a government shutdown to defund the health care law are the ones \nwho are blocking a budget conference. If the goal is to simply push \nthis country into a crisis, as it now seems to be for the tea party and \nthe Senate Republican leadership, then those both are ways to do it.\n  When the Senate budget passed, I was optimistic. We worked here for a \nvery long time--hours and hours, well into the night, well into the \nhours of the morning--and we allowed everyone the opportunity to vote \non their amendments. They were voted up or down, agreed to or not \nagreed to, and we passed a bill, because both Republicans and Democrats \nsaid they wanted to return to regular budget order, and they said if we \ndid that, we would get back to a responsible process. I took them at \ntheir word.\n  At that time, we had 192 days to reach a bipartisan budget agreement. \nThree months later, Democrats have come to the floor 16 times to move \nto the next step of the process: to get us to a bipartisan budget \nconference with the House. Each time we have asked to do that, a tea \nparty Republican or a Member of the Senate Republican leadership has \nstood up and said, No, I am not going to let us work out the \ndifferences with the House. We are not going to do a budget. We are \ngoing to allow things to plod along here until we have a crisis in the \nfall.\n  There are now less than 3 weeks before we are scheduled to return \nhome--all of us--to our States for constituent work. If we can't get an \nagreement by then, we are going to return in September with very little \ntime before a potential government shutdown on October 1.\n  We still have a window of opportunity to reach an agreement before we \nare in crisis mode. I will tell all of my colleagues, it is closing \nquickly.\n  My colleagues should ask their constituents. They are sick and tired \nof hearing about gridlock and partisanship coming out of Washington, \nDC. It has to end.\n  This body had a great conversation on Monday night in the Old Senate \nChamber. Everybody had an opportunity to have their say. A group of \nRepublicans, led by Senator McCain, who are very interested in ending \nthe gridlock, worked together with us to solve the problem. In fact, I \nhave to say it has been very heartening to hear from the many \nRepublicans who agree with the Democrats that despite our differences--\nand they are many--we should at least--at the very least--sit down in a \nbipartisan conference committee with the House and try to solve this \nproblem and get an agreement.\n  It started with just a few who were willing to stand up to their \nleadership, but I think we all should know that chorus is getting \nlouder. Senator Moran, for example, said yesterday: ``I too hope we can \nhave a budget conference because the process needs to work.''\n  I am sure Senator Moran would agree with me that getting a bipartisan \ndeal is not going to be easy. We know that. We know it is going to be \ndifficult. But we all know it won't be easy unless we get to work now, \nrather than risking our economic recovery and hurting our families and \ncommunities by manufacturing a crisis this fall.\n  I am hopeful the bipartisan spirit we have seen this week will carry \nover into this budget debate, and that rather than listening to a few, \nRepublicans will listen to the Republican Members who prefer a \nbipartisan, commonsense approach over brinkmanship and chaos.\n  We still have an opportunity to govern the way the American people \nrightly expect us to and to come together and try and reach an \nagreement. I am ready to sit down and go to work with the conservative \nHouse majority to try and solve the problem that all of us have come to \nCongress saying we want to work on, and that is a budget agreement.\n  A budget agreement means certainty for our constituents. It means the \nability, no matter how tough the choices for us--and none of us are \ngoing to love any of them--to be able to give them certainty so they \nknow how to move forward.\n  Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. \nCon. Res. 25; that the amendment which is at the desk, the text of S. \nCon. Res. 8, the budget resolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in \nlieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to; the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that \nthe Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House \non the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees on the part of the Senate; that following the \nauthorization, two motions to instruct conferees be in order from each \nside--a motion to instruct relative to the debt limit and a motion to \ninstruct relative to taxes and revenue; that there be 2 hours of debate \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees prior to the \nvotes in relation to the motions; further, that no amendments be in \norder to either of the motions prior to the votes; and all of the above \noccurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, in a spirit of \nbipartisanship, I would like to ask my friend and colleague from \nWashington to make a very simple modification to her request. I am not \nobjecting to a budget. I am not even objecting to the idea of having a \nconference. I just want the debt limit left out of the budget \nconference. The debt limit is a separate issue, one that warrants its \nown debate, its own discussion, its own legislation. My request is a \nsimple one: no backroom deals on the debt limit.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Washington \nmodify her request so that it not be in order for the Senate to \nconsider a conference report that includes reconciliation instructions \nto raise the debt limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nexplain so that the Senator understands. We are offering in this \nunanimous consent request to allow the Senate to speak on the very \nissue the Senator is requesting, to do it in what a democracy does, and \nto allow an amendment on it and let the Senate speak. That is what we \ndo here.\n  I object to his request, and I reask our unanimous consent request \nthat would allow an amendment on his issue of the debt ceiling and \nallow this body to speak on it before we go to conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the Lee unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The question is on the unanimous consent request from the Senator \nfrom Washington. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, in that case, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          McCarthy Nomination\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Gina McCarthy \nnomination to head the EPA and in particular efforts I have led with my \nRepublican colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee to \nbring a whole lot more sunshine and transparency to EPA--something that \nhas been sorely, sorely lacking for a long time and has been a \nparticular problem, really reached new depths in terms of a problem in \nthe last 4 years. When this important nomination first came up, I \nfocused specifically on these important transparency, openness issues.\n  I have disagreed with the Obama administration EPA on all sorts of \nsubstantive issues, including, for instance, to take the most obvious, \ntheir war on coal. I disagree with both the past Administrator and this \nnominee, Gina McCarthy, on all of those key substantive issues, such as \nthis war on coal, but I specifically chose not to focus on that in the \nnomination. I knew President Obama won the election. I knew he had a \nfundamentally different view than I do on those key\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\nenvironmental and economic issues. What I focused on with other \nRepublican members of our committee was something that should be beyond \ndispute, beyond partisanship, really beyond debate--the need for \nopenness and transparency with regard to what EPA does and why they do \nit. This has been a battle I have been waging for a long time, \nincluding on the EPW Committee. I think this is a crucial issue.\n  For a long time, EPA, under multiple administrations, has lost the \nconfidence of Congress and the American people. It used to be, \nincluding when EPA was first founded, in the first decade of its \nexistence, that it was viewed as a nonideological group of experts. It \nwas viewed as being led by real scientists and real science--peer-\nreviewed expert science--not by ideology, not by political agendas, not \nby partisanship. Unfortunately, I think EPA--and a lot of Federal \nagencies, but EPA is perhaps the worst example--has gotten far afield \nfrom that, and it is viewed by most Americans, myself included, as led \nby ideology, motivated by partisanship and a political agenda, not \nsober, sound science.\n  That is why we need to get back to complete openness and transparency \nso that we see what EPA is doing, why they are doing it, and try to \nhold them accountable so their decisions are based on objective \nscience, not cherry-picking science, not partisan science, not what I \nwould call New York Times or tabloid science.\n  Again, those are what all of my key requests of EPA and the nominee \nover this Gina McCarthy nomination went to. Over many, many weeks--in \nfact, months--I went back and forth with Ms. McCarthy and EPA over \nthese very basic, sound, reasonable requests. The good news is, \nalthough it took a lot of back and forth, in each of the five key \ncategories I identified on behalf of all of the Republican members of \nEPW, we were able to secure real, meaningful, and substantial \ncommitments in terms of moving the ball forward in at least four of \nthose categories, and we are going to move the ball across the goal \nline in the fifth category as well. So let me briefly outline those \nfive important categories that all relate to openness and transparency \nand where we are getting with regard to our agreements with the EPA \nover the last several weeks.\n  Request No. 1 had to do with FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act. As \nanybody knows who has followed it in the news, EPA has really dragged \nits feet and frustrated a lot of legitimate FOIA requests by private \ncitizens, by States affected, by other stakeholders.\n  The Freedom of Information Act was designed to put sunshine on the \nFederal Government, to allow everyday citizens--anyone--the ability to \nget basic, important information from any Federal agency. Yet, as news \nreleases and certain incidents have illustrated over the last several \nyears, EPA has really tried to frustrate that process. In fact, in \ncertain documents we were able to obtain, we even got an e-mail from \nwithin the General Counsel's Office at EPA instructing all of the \nsatellite offices of EPA around the country on how to frustrate \nlegitimate FOIA requests--how to delay, how to frustrate, how to \nobfuscate. It was not about a particular FOIA request that they may \nhave thought was out of bounds or inappropriate, it was just about how \nto frustrate in general. That is completely inappropriate. That is \nbeyond the bounds of the law. So we talked in great detail to EPA about \nhow they have to change that, and this basically summarizes the \nagreements we reached:\n  First, EPA agreed to mandate the retraining of all of their \nworkforce--17,000-plus people--to tell them not how to frustrate FOIA \nrequests but what FOIA is about, how to live by the law, how to honor \nFOIA requests in an open and timely way.\n  Secondly, EPA committed to issuing new guidance on records \nmaintenance and the use of personal e-mail accounts. One way a lot of \nfolks said EPA clearly was frustrating FOIA requests is they would do \nofficial business on personal e-mail accounts. So when a FOIA request \nwas made, their EPA e-mails were produced, but lo and behold, the \nreally important stuff, the stuff they wanted to hide, was on their \npersonal accounts. That is clearly a pattern that has been used at EPA \nand other Federal agencies to frustrate openness and transparency and \nFOIA. So EPA is specifically going to issue new guidance to say that is \nabsolutely illegal, that is absolutely off limits, and, most \nimportantly, trust but verify, and here is the verify: The independent \nEPA inspector general will complete an audit about all of this stuff.\n  So we are going to put an end to FOIA abuse, and we are going to make \nsure every American has FOIA as a legitimate tool for information, for \nopenness, and for transparency, as was intended when Congress passed \nthat law.\n  The second category I focused on in my discussions with EPA was e-\nmails and communications--exactly what I was talking about before. \nThere has been a pattern--and several high-ranking officials were \ninvolved, including Lisa Jackson, the former Administrator--there has \nbeen a pattern of using personal e-mail accounts and also fake e-mail \nnames, to, in my opinion, hide important information from the public. \nThe clearest example is what I said a minute ago. If you do the really \nimportant business on your personal account and somebody sends in a \nFOIA request and then the agency produces your official e-mails, guess \nwhat. The really important stuff is not produced. It is hidden. That \nhas to stop.\n  So we demanded a lot of things in this category.\n  First of all, the nominee herself--we asked her to review her \npersonal e-mail accounts and report back that she had not used it for \nagency-related matters. She did that. She confirmed that.\n  Secondly, EPW continues to coordinate with the House Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee to obtain further information. We do not \nhave--and let me be crystal clear about this--Republicans on the EPW \nCommittee have not obtained everything we have asked for or everything \nwe deserve with regard to e-mails and communications. So we are working \nwith the House committee with subpoena power, and we are working \nclosely with them, and we are going to get, even if it takes using \ntheir subpoena power, what we deserve. And then both committees \nrecently put the EPA on notice that they are considering issuing \nsubpoenas with regard to just that.\n  So this is the category where we have gotten the least from the EPA \nwith regard to our discussions regarding the Gina McCarthy nomination, \nbut I want to make very clear, so no one is surprised, that we are \ngoing to get what we deserve, including through House subpoenas if it \ntakes that.\n  The third category I focused on in my discussions with Gina McCarthy \nand the EPA is underlying research data. EPA has done a lot of really \nimportant rules, rulemaking in the last several years. In each of those \ncases they based that rulemaking on specific research. One big problem \nis that the world, the public, even including Members of Congress, has \nnot had availability of that research data so we can simply sort of \ncompare notes and enlist outside experts to say: Look, does this data \nreally lead to that rule? Does it really lead to that conclusion?\n  Well, this has been an ongoing argument for a long time. Finally, in \nthe midst of these discussions related to the Gina McCarthy nomination, \nwe have scored a breakthrough. EPA has absolutely, categorically \ncommitted to obtaining the requested scientific information--that data \nfrom the researchers, from the institutions that did the research. They \nwill absolutely request that and follow up on that.\n  Secondly, EPA has already reached out to relevant institutions for \ninformation on how to de-identify and code personally identifying \ninformation that may be in the data. None of us want personally \nidentifying information. None of us want versions of the data that make \nit clear who the individuals involved in the studies were. We do not \ncare about that. We want the overall data. So EPA is already talking to \nthe institutions about how to scrub the data so they do not give us \nwhat we were never interested in--personal identifying information.\n  Third, for the first time we should be able to determine if there is \nany way of independently reanalyzing the science and benefits claims \nfor these major regulations, which are mostly the major air regulations \non which the nominee Gina McCarthy led the way.\n  So this really is a breakthrough because it is a path forward to get \nthe\n\n[[Page S5740]]\n\nunderlying data so we can examine--independently examine--have experts \nlook at the data and ask: Does it really lead to this regulation? Does \nit really justify this regulation?\n  The fourth category I focused on in terms of my discussions with the \nEPA over the Gina McCarthy nomination is economic analysis. By law, \nEPA, like other Federal agencies, is supposed to do a cost-benefit \nanalysis before they do a big rulemaking. So part of their rulemaking \nis supposed to be a cost-benefit analysis to see if the rule is \njustified.\n  In my opinion, that cost-benefit analysis is done in such a way as to \nbe laughable in some cases, to be ludicrous. It is designed to reach a \nparticular result, not designed to be an objective cost-benefit \nanalysis. So we wanted EPA to go back to the drawing board, do a fair \nand open-ended cost-benefit analysis, not designed to reach a \nparticular conclusion but just designed to truly, objectively compare \ncost and benefits.\n  As a result of our discussion, EPA has committed to convene an \nindependent panel of economic experts with experience in whole economy \nmodeling at the macro and micro level. They are going to review EPA's \nmodeling and the agency's ability to measure full regulatory impacts.\n  That is sort of a bunch of gobbledygook, particularly with whole \neconomy modeling. But that is where we need to do a true cost-benefit \nanalysis, to look at all of the macro impacts, all of the impacts of a \nrule on the whole economy, not very narrowly defined--the analysis--in \norder to get to a certain conclusion.\n  A good example is when they are doing rulemaking, we need to \nunderstand the impact on energy prices throughout the entire economy. \nThat is often a huge impact of their rulemaking, particularly in their \nrecent air rulemaking in the so-called war on coal. We need to see how \nmany jobs that really cost us in the whole economy; otherwise, this \nidea of cost-benefit is not meaningful.\n  So they have committed to convene this independent panel. This panel \nwill be tasked with making recommendations to the agency so that the \nEPA does it right; so that it is a significant, objective, meaningful \ncost-benefit analysis, not just an exercise they have to go through and \nthat they have designed to reach a certain result.\n  The fifth and final category on which I focused in terms of my \ndiscussions with the EPA over the Gina McCarthy nomination was the so-\ncalled sue and settle. Sue and settle is a tool the environmental left \nand their allies at EPA have used with increasing frequency in the last \nseveral years--the last 5 years in particular.\n  When the environmental left wants to reach an objective, what they \noften do is sue the EPA under environmental legislation and \nenvironmental statutes. So they are the plaintiff; the Obama EPA is the \ndefendant. They have a lawsuit. Then after a few months they agree to \nsettle the lawsuit. The judge signs off on it. Usually the judge is \nmore than willing to do that because it gets a big and time-consuming \nand complicated case out of his hands, off his docket.\n  What is the matter with that? Well, what is the matter with that is \nessentially the environmental left and the EPA are on the same side of \nthe issue. They usually agree on the fundamentals of the issue. The \nfolks truly on the other side, who often include stakeholders, \nlandowners, businesses, State and local government, they never have a \nseat at the table with regard to the settlement.\n  So this is a behind-closed-doors negotiation, which is one-sided and \ndoes not include anyone on the true other side of the issue. It does \nnot include landowners. It does not include other stakeholders. It does \nnot include State and local governments, which are often directly \naffected, which often have their role in some of these matters taken \naway.\n  So we need to make that sue-and-settle process more fair. We need to \ntake the abuse out of it because we discussed this with EPA, and we got \nthe following important concession.\n  First, to help resolve some of the challenges with lack of public \ninput in closed-door settlement agreements, otherwise referred to as \nsue and settle, EPA will publish on two Web sites the notices of intent \nto sue and petitions for rulemaking upon receipt, so at least the world \nout there will know what is going on at the front end. At least the \nstakeholders, the landowners, State and local governments, other \naffected parties will know what is going on.\n  Secondly, the Web address for the petitions for rulemaking are that, \nand the web address for the notices of intent to sue is that. It is \nvery important to know this with regard to potential sue-and-settle \nagreements so that affected parties can begin to have input. They \ncannot possibly have input if they do not even know there is a \ndiscussion going on, and they do not find that out until the final \nresult is announced.\n  Those are the results of our discussions with EPA. As I said at the \nbeginning, I do not agree with Barack Obama or Gina McCarthy's \npositions on most of the big issues at EPA, including the war on coal. \nI do not agree with their actions that are costing millions of jobs \naround the country, that are increasing significantly the price of \nAmerican energy. But I am not going to be able to fix that given the \nlast election. President Obama was reelected.\n  What we attempted to do is talk to EPA about things that we should be \nable to agree on, things that should be beyond dispute, beyond \nideology, beyond argument. That is giving the American people, \nincluding their representatives in Congress, full and adequate \ninformation about what is going on, having people get the information \nthey deserve, having that give-and-take which is supposed to be there \nand assured, cleaning up abuses in FOIA, cleaning up abuses in private \nand hidden and fake e-mail accounts.\n  Those are abuses that have gone on at EPA for a long time and have \nbeen particularly problematic in the last 5 years. Those are the sort \nof things we are going to fix through these agreements. I think that \nwill get us down the road to having a real discussion about the true \nfacts behind proposed EPA regulations--the true science, the true cost \nand benefits, and not allowing EPA to do so much that is so important \nbehind closed doors without that full and open discussion of the true \nfacts.\n  I think it is an important step forward. That is why I agreed, as I \npromised to at the beginning of the process, to vote for cloture on the \nGina McCarthy nomination if we made this important progress. I set that \nmetric. I made that commitment at the beginning of the process. I did \nnot think we would get nearly as far as we did in terms of commitments \nout of EPA. But since we did, since we made all of that substantive \nprogress, I am certainly going to honor that commitment with regard to \nthe cloture vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today the Senate is now considering the \nnomination of Thomas Perez to serve as Secretary of Labor. It has been \na long road to get here. I am pleased that we finally have the \nopportunity to consider Mr. Perez's nomination on its merits.\n  Tom Perez's life is a story of the American dream. The child of \nimmigrants from the Dominican Republic, he lost his father at a young \nage. He worked very hard at not very glamorous jobs to put himself \nthrough Brown University, working at a warehouse as a garbage collector \nand the school dining hall.\n  His incredible work ethic helped him graduate with honors from the \nHarvard Law School and the Kennedy School of Government. With such an \nimpressive resume, Tom Perez could have done pretty much anything with \nthose degrees and accomplishments. He could have made a lot of money in \nthe private sector. But, instead, Mr. Perez chose to become a public \nservant.\n  He has dedicated his career to ensuring that every American has the \nsame opportunity he had to pursue the American dream. From his early \nyears at the Department of Justice, where he helped to prosecute \nracially motivated hate crimes and chaired a task force to prevent \nworker exploitation, to his time at the Maryland Department of Labor, \nwhere he helped struggling families avoid foreclosure and revamped the \nState's adult education system, Mr. Perez has demonstrated his \nunwavering commitment to building opportunity for all Americans.\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\n  It is this commitment to building opportunity for all that makes Tom \nPerez an ideal choice for Secretary of Labor. Of all the executive \nagencies, it may be the Department of Labor that touches the lives of \nordinary Americans the most on a day-to-day basis. The Department of \nLabor ensures that every American receives a fair day's pay for a hard \nday's work and can come home from work safely in the evening.\n  It helps ensure that a working mother can stay home to bond with her \nnewborn child and still have a job to return to. It helps workers who \nhave been laid off, veterans returning from military service, others \nwho face special employment challenges to build new skills and build \nopportunities for a lifetime.\n  It helps guarantee that hard-working people who have saved all of \ntheir lives for retirement can enjoy their golden years with security \nand peace of mind. As our country continues to move down the road to \neconomic recovery, the work of the Department of Labor will become even \nmore critical. The Department will play a vital role in determining \nwhat kind of recovery we have, a recovery that benefits only a select \nfew or one that rebuilds a strong American middle class where everyone \nwho works hard and plays by the rules can build a better life.\n  Now more than ever we need a dynamic leader at the helm of the \nDepartment of Labor who will embrace a bold vision of shared prosperity \nand help make that vision a reality for American families. I am \nconfident that Tom Perez is up for that challenge.\n  Without question, Tom Perez has the knowledge and experience needed \nto guide this critically important agency. Throughout his professional \nexperiences and especially during his work as the secretary of the \nMaryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation--that would be \nMaryland's equivalent of our Secretary of Labor. During that time, he \nhas developed strong policy expertise on the many important issues for \nAmerican workers and businesses that come before the Department of \nLabor each day. He also clearly has the management skills to run a \nlarge Federal agency effectively. Perhaps most importantly, Tom Perez \nknows how to bring people together to make progress on even \ncontroversial issues.\n  He knows how to hit the ground running, how to quickly and \neffectively become an agent of real change. That is exactly the kind of \nleadership we need at the Department of Labor. The fact is, Tom Perez \nis an extraordinary nominee to serve as Secretary of Labor. I hope the \nSenate will overwhelmingly confirm him to this vital position.\n  This is not the first time this body has considered Mr. Perez's \nqualifications. In October 2009, on a bipartisan 72-to-22 vote, the \nSenate confirmed Mr. Perez to serve as Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Rights. In more than 3\\1/2\\ years in that position, Mr. Perez has \nskillfully and vigorously enforced our Nation's civil rights laws and \nhas revitalized the Civil Rights Division.\n  As has been documented by numerous inspector general and Office of \nProfessional Responsibility reports, as well as congressional \ninvestigations, the Bush administration had decimated the Civil Rights \nDivision, failed to properly enforce our most critical civil rights \nlaws, and politicized hiring and decisionmaking. That has changed \ndramatically under Mr. Perez.\n  As Attorney General Holder has said, Mr. Perez made it clear from the \nmoment he was confirmed that the Civil Rights Division was ``once again \nopen for business.'' During Mr. Perez's tenure as head of the Civil \nRights Division, he stepped up enforcement of civil rights laws and \nrestored integrity and professionalism.\n  I wish to review some of the successes under Mr. Perez's leadership \nat the Civil Rights Division.\n  That division settled the three largest fair lending cases in the \nhistory of the Fair Housing Act. Let me repeat that--three largest \ncases in the history of the Fair Housing Act.\n  As a result, the division in 2012 recovered more money for victims \nunder the Fair Housing Act than in the previous 23 years combined. In \ntotal, $660 million in monetary relief has been obtained in lending \nsettlements.\n  Later in my remarks I will go over some of the allegations made by \nSenators on the other side about Mr. Perez's handling of another \nsituation of the Civil Rights Division that was also covered by the \nFair Housing Act.\n  I wish to make this clear, that Mr. Perez, as I said, settled the \nthree largest fair lending cases in the history of the Fair Housing \nAct. This shows he was vigorous in enforcing the Fair Housing Act.\n  The Civil Rights Division has been involved in 44 Olmstead matters in \n23 States, matters that ensure that people with disabilities have the \nchoice to live in their own homes and communities, rather than only in \ninstitutional settings. These efforts included four settlement \nagreements the division has signed with the States of Georgia, \nDelaware, Virginia, and North Carolina.\n  The Civil Rights Division obtained a $16 million settlement, the \nlargest ever, to enforce the Americans With Disabilities Act. Reached \nin 2011, the settlement requires 10,000 bank and financial-related \nretail offices to ensure access for people with speech or hearing \ndisabilities. Imagine that, almost 20 years after the passage of the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act, we had banks and financial offices \nthat were not making their services available to people with \ndisabilities. The division had to go after them and, as I said, \nobtained a settlement, $16 million, the largest ever in the history of \nthe Americans With Disabilities Act.\n  The Civil Rights Division handled more new cases under the Voting \nRights Act in 2012 than in any previous year ever. The division \nincreased the number of human trafficking prosecutions by 40 percent \nduring the past 4 years, including a record number of cases in 2012.\n  The division, since 2009, brought 46 cases to protect the employment \nrights of servicemembers, a 39-percent increase over the previous 4 \nyears of the Bush administration.\n  Based on his stellar record of achievement at the Department of \nJustice alone, Mr. Perez deserves to be confirmed. But despite these \naccomplishments, some of my Republican colleagues have claimed Mr. \nPerez should not be confirmed. In fact, we had about 40 who voted \nagainst Mr. Perez to move to cloture. Now they are trying to say we \nshould not confirm him.\n  As the chairman of the committee with oversight jurisdiction, and as \nchairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that funds the Department \nof Labor, I can assure you I have looked carefully into Mr. Perez's \nbackground and record of service. I can assure everyone that Tom Perez \nhas the strongest record possible of professional integrity and that \nany allegations to the contrary are totally unfounded.\n  What is clear is that Tom Perez is passionate about enforcing civil \nrights laws and protecting people's rights. In my view, that passion \nmakes him not only qualified but the ideal person to be Secretary of \nLabor.\n  I do wish to address some of the specific claims we have heard and \nprobably will continue to hear about Mr. Perez.\n  First, some have harped on the Justice Department's enforcement \ndecision involving the New Black Panther Party. I hope my colleagues \ndon't choose to rehash this matter. Mr. Perez had no involvement in \nthis case, zero. Mr. Perez was not at the Department of Justice when \nthe decision concerning the Black Panthers occurred. The charges were \ndismissed in May of 2009. Mr. Perez was not confirmed until October of \n2009.\n  Second, some have questioned several enforcement actions related to \nthe Voting Rights Act and the motor voter law, most notably in \nLouisiana, Texas, and South Carolina. They have pointed to these cases \nto claim that Mr. Perez is somehow biased in his enforcement of the \nlaw.\n  Again, I hope my colleagues don't try to rehash these meritless \nclaims. The Department of Justice inspector general, an independent \ninspector general, investigated these claims and recently concluded: \n``The decisions that Division or Section leadership made in \ncontroversial [voting] cases did not substantiate claims of political \nor racial bias.''\n  The inspector general specifically noted that ``allegations of \npoliticized decisionmaking . . . were not substantiated.'' Anybody can \nmake allegations, but you have to substantiate\n\n[[Page S5742]]\n\nthem. The allegations that he was acting in a politically motivated or \nbiased manner were never ever substantiated.\n  In fact, in the election-related cases Mr. Perez's critics have \nfocused on, the courts ended up agreeing with the Department of \nJustice's conclusions that the law had been broken. This means that \nsome oppose Mr. Perez's confirmation precisely because he did his job \nby enforcing newly enacted laws and by pursuing meritorious cases.\n  Is our confirmation process here so broken that the act, that act of \nenforcing duly enacted laws, becomes grounds for opposing a nominee?\n  Third, some Republicans assert Mr. Perez masterminded an improper \ndeal whereby the City of St. Paul dropped an appeal in a case related \nto the Fair Housing Act in a case called Magner. In return, the \nDepartment of Justice decided not to intervene in a False Claims Act \nbrought by a St. Paul resident in another case called the Newell case.\n  During this debate, I expect we will hear a lot about the alleged \nmillions of dollars Mr. Perez himself personally cost the Federal \nGovernment in lost damages because the government did not intervene and \nprevail in the Newell case.\n  It is clear from all of the investigations we have done that rather \nthan being the scandal as some Republicans claim, the evidence shows \nthat Mr. Perez acted ethically and appropriately at all times. I wish \nto go through this because it is important to set the record straight \nfrom these kinds of phony allegations that have been made by some here \nabout Mr. Perez.\n  The Magner case was a case involving the Fair Housing Act. In 2011, \nthe Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider whether that act \npermits a disparate impact claim. This is a claim challenging actions \nthat are not intentionally discriminatory but, in essence, having a \ndiscriminatory effect, called the disparate impact claim.\n  The case involved an unusual set of facts. Instead of minorities and \nlow-income persons using the Fair Housing Act to challenge improper \nlending practices, zoning laws, or real estate practices, as is typical \nwith the case with most Fair Housing Act litigation, this specific case \ninvolved slumlords--not low-income renters or people being taken \nadvantage of. This case involved slumlords in St. Paul using the Fair \nHousing Act to challenge the city's efforts to better enforce their \nhousing codes against those slumlords.\n  Let's look at this case. Lawyers make strategic judgments all the \ntime about which cases should be appealed. Here it is clear why the \nDepartment of Justice had a strong interest in this matter. As they \nhave often said, as we all learned in law school, bad facts make bad \nlaw. The Justice Department did not want the Supreme Court to consider \nthe viability of the disparate impact principle in a case where \nslumlords were trying to abuse the law to their advantage. There was \ntoo much at stake here.\n  The Civil Rights Division, under Mr. Perez, had used, applying \ndisparate impact principle, a standard of law recognized under the Fair \nHousing Act by each of the 11 courts of appeal to address the issue. \nThey had used this, as I mentioned earlier, to reach settlements \ntotaling $644 million against lenders who discriminated against \npotential homebuyers in violation of the Fair Housing Act. As I said \nearlier, that is more money for victims under the Fair Housing Act than \nin the previous 23 years combined. I think it is very clear that Mr. \nPerez led his division in applying the disparate impact principle to \ngain a lot of settlements and to help people who were discriminated \nagainst.\n  It was vital to preserve this valuable enforcement tool. Civil rights \nleaders, as well as Mr. Perez, encouraged the City of St. Paul to \nwithdraw the appeal. Mr. Perez encouraged the City of St. Paul not to \nappeal the case to the Supreme Court against something entirely \nappropriate and entirely in the interests of the United States.\n  When Mr. Perez reached out to the city, the City of St. Paul raised \nthe Newell matter, another case. This was the first time Mr. Perez had \nheard about the case. At that time the city suggested, the City of St. \nPaul, suggested it would drop its Magner appeal if the Department of \nJustice did not intervene in Newell, an unrelated False Claims Act case \nin which a St. Paul resident, Mr. Newell, had alleged--had alleged--\nthat the City of St. Paul had not met its obligation to provide \nsufficient minority job-training programs despite certifying to HUD \nthat it was doing so. As I said, it is a little complicated.\n  At this point, the evidence further demonstrates that Mr. Perez acted \nwith the highest integrity and ethics. After this became known to him, \nMr. Perez consulted two ethics and professional responsibility experts \nat the Department of Justice. It was made clear to him that because the \nUnited States is a unitary actor, the two matters could be considered \ntogether as long as the Civil Division, which deals with False Claims \nAct matters, retained the authority over the Newell case, which was a \nfalse claims matter, not a civil rights matter.\n  A written response Mr. Perez received said--this again is from the \nethics people at the Department of Justice--``There is no ethics rule \nimplicated by this situation and therefore no prohibition against your \nproposed course of action''--your proposed course of action, which was \nto get the City of St. Paul to drop its appeal. At all times, Mr. Perez \nacted appropriately within the ethical guidance he received.\n  Further, contrary to some Republican claims, Mr. Perez was not \nresponsible for the Department's decision not to intervene in Newell. \nIn fact, the decision not to intervene in Newell was made by career \nattorneys and experts on the False Claims Act within the Civil \nDivision--not by Mr. Perez, who was head of the Civil Rights Division. \nThe head of the Civil Division Tony West at all times retained the \nauthority to make the decision regarding the Newell case.\n  At the time the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Magner case, both \nHUD--Housing and Urban Development--and the Minnesota U.S. Attorney's \nOffice had recommended intervening in the Newell matter.\n  After learning of the Department of Justice concerns with regard to \nthe Magner appeal, the general counsel for HUD--Department of Housing \nand Urban Development--told the House that she reversed her \nrecommendation, stating:\n\n       If the decision had been totally mine in October, and there \n     weren't any dealings with the Department of Justice that I \n     needed to worry about in terms of a relationship with the \n     Department of Justice, we never--we never would have \n     recommended intervening, and if it were my decision whether \n     to intervene or not, I never would have intervened.\n\n  At the same time, the person who led consideration of the case in the \nCivil Division was a very senior career attorney and an expert on the \nFalse Claims Act, Mr. Mike Hertz. Although Mr. Hertz has since passed \naway, colleagues testified that he told them after meeting with the \nCity of St. Paul that Mr. Hertz said, ``This case sucks,'' meaning the \nNewell case. Again, this was the view of the Newell matter by Mr. Mike \nHertz, the leading career expert on the False Claims Act.\n\n  So upon learning that HUD had reversed its position, the U.S. \nAttorney's Office became concerned about the ability to proceed with \nthe case. Staff in the U.S. Attorney's Office told staff at the \nDepartment of Justice they were also likely to change their position on \nintervening in the Newell case.\n  As the ultimate decisionmaker in the Newell matter, the head of the \nDepartment of Justice Civil Division, Tony West, told the House:\n\n       [B]y early, mid-January, there was a consensus that had \n     coalesced in the Civil Division that we were going to decline \n     the Newell case. . . . My understanding is that certainly was \n     Mike Hertz' view, it was Joyce Branda's view, and that \n     represented the view of the branch, U.S. Attorney's Office. \n     Also, I think around that time period would be included in \n     that consensus, it was my view too. It was the view of the \n     client agency, HUD.\n\n  So what he is saying is, when we looked at this, we found the Newell \ncase was not a very good case. Earlier today, it was suggested Mr. \nPerez tried to cover up the fact that the Magner appeal played a role \nin the Department's decision not to intervene. This is not correct.\n  Despite indicating that they intended to change their recommendation, \nby mid-January the U.S. Attorney's Office formal decision memo \nrecommending not intervening in the Newell case had not been received. \nMr. Perez reached\n\n[[Page S5743]]\n\nout to an assistant U.S. attorney, leaving a voice message suggesting \nthat the Magner case should not be included in that formal \nrecommendation.\n  When he was asked about the voice mail, Mr. Perez explained to the \nHouse his concern was not with the specifics of what was in the memo \nbut rather was directed at trying to resolve an issue he thought might \nbe the source of the delay. Mr. Perez told the House that when he \nultimately spoke to the U.S. attorney:\n\n       [He] promptly corrected me and indicated that the Magner \n     issue would be part of the discussion. I said fine, follow \n     the standard protocols. But my aim and my goal in that \n     message and in the ensuing conversations was to get him to \n     communicate that, so that we could bring the matter to \n     closure.\n\n  In early February, the Civil Division formalized the decision not to \nintervene in the Newell case with a written memo. Unsurprisingly, that \nmemo was completely transparent and clearly indicates that the Magner \nappeal was a factor in the decision not to join the Newell matter, but \nthat the decision is largely based on the flaws in the Newell case.\n  As Mr. West noted:\n\n       [Declining to intervene] was a view we had all arrived to \n     having taken into consideration the numerous factors, \n     including the Magner case, as really as reflected in our \n     memo. I think the memo--the declination memo that I signed, \n     really does encapsulate what our view was.\n\n  Republicans claim Mr. Perez singlehandedly cost the United States \nmillions of dollars. But the damage award received from a losing case \nis zero--zero. According to the Justice Department's leading expert on \nthe False Claims Act, that is likely what the Newell matter was worth--\nzero. So Republicans say we lost millions of dollars. How can you lose \nmillions when the experts say their chances of succeeding at it were \nzero?\n  When the general counsel of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment was asked about HUD's interest in recovering funds from the \nCity of St. Paul, she said:\n\n       As a hypothetical matter, sure. Did we actually think that \n     there was the capability to do that in this case? No.\n\n  To summarize, Mr. Perez consulted with two ethics and professional \nresponsibility experts. Those experts made clear it was appropriate to \nadvance a global resolution of the two cases as long as the Civil \nDivision retained authority over the Newell matter, which it did at all \ntimes. Senior career Civil Division attorneys believed the Newell case \nlacked merit, and the lack of merit to that case was the primary reason \nfor the Civil Division's decision not to intervene.\n  Based on these facts, I do not know what the controversy is. Mr. \nPerez acted appropriately and ethically to advance the interests of the \nUnited States.\n  It is no surprise that experts in the legal community have made clear \nMr. Perez acted appropriately. As Professor Stephen Gillers, who has \ntaught legal ethics for more than 30 years at New York University \nSchool of Law, wrote, the Republican report issued last month \nsuggesting that Mr. Perez acted improperly ``cites no professional \nconduct rule, no court decision, no bar ethics opinion, and no \nsecondary authority that supports'' this argument. In fact, no \nauthority supports it.\n  So you can make all kinds of allegations, and the House majority \nreport made allegations, but they have no professional conduct rule, no \ncourt decision, no bar ethics opinion, and no secondary authority that \nsupports their allegation. No authority supports it.\n  So the confirmation process has been thorough. Mr. Perez has been \nthoroughly vetted. He has been fully responsive, forthcoming, and \ncooperative, including during a thorough confirmation hearing in my \ncommittee, the Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee. Mr. \nPerez's nomination was officially received on March 19, nearly 5 months \nago. In contrast, Ms. Elaine Chao was confirmed as Secretary of Labor \nthe very same day her nomination was received in the Senate--I might \nadd under a Democratically led committee.\n  These allegations are simply that--allegations made of whole cloth. \nQuite frankly, Mr. Perez has acted ethically and appropriately at all \ntimes. Perhaps that is why some are opposed to him. He has been \nvigorous in enforcing our civil rights laws, vigorous in going after \nslum landlords and lending agencies that abuse poor people who are \ntrying to get decent housing. Yes, he has been vigilant at that--very \nvigilant, as I said, getting some of the biggest settlements ever in \nthe history of this division.\n  Perhaps they are afraid Mr. Perez will be vigilant and strong in his \ntenure as the Secretary of Labor. We can only hope so. We can only hope \nhe will continue in the tradition set down by the former Secretary \nHilda Solis, who did an outstanding job as our Secretary of Labor. A \nformer Member of the House of Representatives, Hilda Solis turned that \ndepartment around from a department that had been moribund for 8 years.\n  I can assure everyone that Mr. Perez will always act appropriately \nand ethically, but he will always act forcefully to defend the rights \nof people to make sure our laws are enforced--those laws that protect \nthe health, the education, the labor, and the pensions of the American \npeople.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, earlier today my colleague Senator Rubio \ncame to the floor to talk about the very serious matter of the \nnomination of Thomas Perez that will be before us. Senator Rubio \nspecifically addressed Mr. Perez's refusal to comply with a bipartisan \ncongressional subpoena into the investigation of his orchestration of a \ncontroversial quid pro quo with the City of St. Paul in a very \nimportant legal matter. Senator Rubio talked about that ably and \neloquently, and it is a very serious matter.\n  I was in the Department of Justice for a number of years. I am very \nuneasy about the way that matter was done. I don't believe that is \nnormal business at all.\n  In the course of his tenure, Mr. Perez has identified approximately \n1,200 personal e-mails that were related to his official duties and are \nresponsive to the subpoena from the House, some of which reportedly \ndisclosed nonpublic information about publicly traded companies. Yet he \nstill refuses to turn them over to Congress despite what appears to be \na clear obligation to do so. The failure to comply with a subpoena is a \nvery serious matter.\n  First, he wants to go for the Department of Justice, which issues \nsubpoenas all the time and demands that people comply with them. It \ndoesn't matter if the subpoena is issued to a poor person or small \nbusiness, they are expected to comply with the subpoena. Congress has \nthe ability to issue subpoenas. A member of the Department of Justice \nought to respond to those subpoenas. In my opinion, he has a high duty \nto respond to them.\n  I believe the Senate was incorrect in allowing his nomination to go \nforward to a full vote when we have not gotten the information. The \nfailure to vote for cloture and moving to a vote on a nomination is not \na rejection of a nomination. Fundamentally, it is a statement to say we \nare not ready to vote on it yet. We are not ready to have this matter \nbefore us because we need more information. He is not answering a \nsubpoena issued to him by the House of Representatives.\n  I will not talk about that anymore, but I think it is a big deal. \nThis is not the first problem Mr. Perez has had in abusing the legal \nprocess. Frankly, I wish to share some thoughts about other issues. I \nhate to do this. I was concerned about the nomination when he came \nforward.\n  Senator Tom Coburn and I met with Mr. Perez at some length, and I \ncame away uneasy about it. I had a feeling his ideological political \nagenda was so strong and his legal commitment was not strong enough. I \nwas concerned he would use this position in the Department of Justice \nto advance an agenda rather than enforce the law. I am afraid that is \nwhat has happened.\n  Many of my colleagues will recall that on election day in 2008 three \nmembers of the New Black Panther Party\n\n[[Page S5744]]\n\nstood at the entrance of a polling station in Philadelphia brandishing \nnightsticks and threatening voters. What more intimidation can you have \nthan that at the voting place? They wore military-style uniforms, \ncombat boots, battle dress pants, military-style insignia, and used \nracial slurs and insults to scare away would-be voters.\n  One of the men was Jerry Jackson, a member of Philadelphia's 14th \nWard Democratic Committee and credentialed poll watcher for the \nDemocratic Party on election day. This is not acceptable. This is \nclearly voter intimidation, dramatic voter intimidation.\n  A video of the incident was widely distributed on the Internet, made \nnational news and headlines. The Justice Department, under the Bush \nadministration, secured an affidavit from Bartle Bull, a long-time \ncivil rights activist and a former aide to Robert F. Kennedy in his \n1968 Presidential campaign. Mr. Bull called the conduct ``an outrageous \naffront to American democracy and the rights of voters to participate \nin an election without fear.''\n  None of the defendants in the case even filed a response to the \ncomplaint against him or appeared in the Federal district court in \nPhiladelphia to answer the lawsuit. Maybe they didn't feel like they \nhad a defense. It appeared almost certain that the Justice Department \nwould have prevailed in their case.\n  According to a May 2009 article in the Washington Times, the Justice \nDepartment had been working on the case for months and had already \nsecured a default judgment against the defendants by April 20, 2009--3 \nmonths after President Obama took office. However, President Obama's \npolitical appointee, Mr. Thomas Perrelli, then acting head of the Civil \nRights Division, overruled career prosecutors and voluntarily dismissed \nthe charges against two of the men with no penalty. He obtained an \norder against the third member that merely prohibited him from bringing \na weapon to the polling place in future elections, which was already \nagainst the law. What a sad end of that case, and to me it is \nunthinkable.\n  In a 2009 memo, career Appellate Chief Diana K. Flynn wrote that the \nJustice Department could have made a ``reasonable argument in favor of \ndefault relief against all defendants, and probably should.'' That is \nwhat the career attorney said about the matter.\n  The Justice Department's highly unusual dismissal of the case of \ndramatic voter intimidation was the subject of a year-long \ninvestigation by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. This is an \nindependent commission that is set up by our government and has \nappointees from both parties and they are focused on ensuring that \ncivil rights are protected. They were trying to examine how it was this \ncase was handled in this fashion.\n  On April 1, 2010, Chairman Gerald Reynolds sent a letter to Attorney \nGeneral Holder asking whether the Department of Justice would fully \ncooperate with the Civil Rights Commission's investigation and allow \ntwo Department attorneys to testify in their investigation. The letter \nalso pointed out that the Department failed to turn over requested \ndocuments. The Commission asked for requested documents. They have a \nright to do that.\n  According to Civil Rights Commissioner Peter Kirsanow, in total, the \nCivil Rights Division of the Department of Justice refused to answer 18 \nseparate interrogatories, refused to provide witness statements for 12 \nkey witnesses, refused to respond to 22 requests for production of \ndocuments, and refused to produce a privilege log. This happened in \nspite of the fact that the Justice Department has a statutory \nobligation to fully comply with the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and \ntheir investigations. Does the Department of Justice think they are \nabove the law?\n  I spent 15 years in the Department of Justice. I loved the Department \nof Justice. I never saw some of the things that have happened in recent \nyears. I believe the public needs to know more about it. I will try not \nto be too critical of Attorney General Holder, but I am concerned about \nthis.\n  Later, two attorneys from the Department of Justice defied the \nDepartment and actually agreed to testify against the Department's \nrecommendation before the Commission on Civil Rights at considerable \nrisk to their careers--J. Christian Adams and Christopher Coates. Mr. \nCoates was the former chief of the voting rights section. Mr. Adams and \nMr. Coates stated that political appointees declined to prosecute the \nNew Black Panther case because they were interested only in civil \nrights cases that involved equality for racial and ethnic minorities \nand would not prosecute civil rights cases in a race-neutral way.\n  Adams called the actions in the New Black Panther case--this is what \nthe attorney at the Department of Justice said about the case--``the \nsimplest and most obvious violation of federal law'' that he had ever \nseen in his career at the Justice Department. He resigned as a result \nof the dismissal of the obviously justified case.\n  In his sworn testimony before the Commission, Mr. Perez unequivocally \ndenied the allegations. Commissioner Peter Kirsanow asked him:\n\n       Was there any political leadership involved in the decision \n     not to pursue this particular case any further than it was?\n\n  The answer by Mr. Perez:\n\n       No. The decisions were made by [Justice Department career \n     attorneys] Loretta King in consultation with Steve Rosenbaum \n     who is the acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  In a recent letter to Members of the Senate regarding Mr. Perez's \nnomination, Commissioner Kirsanow stated Mr. Perez's testimony ``should \nbe a tremendous concern to all Senators regardless of party.'' Indeed \nit should.\n\n  In fact, it was not until a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed \nby Judicial Watch that the Justice Department finally produced a \nprivileged log identifying more than 50 e-mails between high-level \nJustice Department political appointees and career attorneys regarding \nthe government's ``decision-making process'' in this case, all around \nthe time the Department's otherwise bewildering decision to drop a case \nit had already won by default.\n  Judge Reggie Walton, an African-American Federal judge in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia stated in his opinion that \nthe internal documents ``appear to contradict Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Perez's testimony that political leadership was not involved.''\n  Let me repeat that. This is a Federal judge in the District of \nColumbia who said the internal documents ``appear to contradict \nAssistant Attorney General Perez's testimony that political leadership \nwas not involved.'' Indeed it does. We have a Federal judge finding \nthis in his opinion.\n  Judge Walton further said, ``Surely the public has an interest in \ndocuments that cast doubt on the accuracy of government officials.'' He \nwas referring to the fact that they weren't producing documents and \nthat they ought to--the public was entitled to have documents that cast \ndoubt on the accuracy of the testimony of government officials, and, he \nsays, ``representations regarding the possible politicalization of the \nagency decision-making.''\n  Mr. Walton himself at one time was in the Department of Justice. I am \nsure he had to have an opinion of the Department of Justice. He is not \ntrying to abuse them. He is just saying Department of Justice officials \nhave an obligation to tell the truth, and if they don't, they ought to \nbe found out.\n  The handling of the case was so extraordinary that the Justice \nDepartment's inspector general, appointed by President Obama, initiated \nan investigation of the matter. The inspector general's report \nconfirmed testimony of Mr. Adams and Mr. Coates and, importantly, it \nconcluded this:\n\n       Perez's testimony did not reflect the entire story \n     regarding the involvement of political appointees in the [New \n     Black Panther Party] decisionmaking. In particular, Perez's \n     characterizations omitted that [political appointees] \n     Associate Attorney General Perrelli and Deputy Associate \n     Attorney General Hirsch were involved in consultations about \n     the decision as shown in testimony and contemporaneous e-\n     mails. Specifically, they set clear outer limits on what \n     [career attorneys] could decide on the . . . matter, \n     (including prohibiting them from dismissing a case in its \n     entirety) without seeking additional approval from the Office \n     of the Associate Attorney General.\n\n  So the Department's own inspector general looked at the matter and \nconcluded Mr. Perez's testimony that the political appointees didn't \nhave anything to do with it--it was all career attorneys who decided on \nthe merits not to prosecute this case--was not accurate. And he went on \nto explain why.\n\n[[Page S5745]]\n\nThis isn't a House committee having a hearing on it; this is the \ninspector general of the Department of Justice, the inspector general \nbasically appointed by President Obama and selected by the Attorney \nGeneral himself.\n  Basically, the political appointees put a fence around the case and \nsaid you can't take any real action on it until we get our approval.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       In his . . . interview, Perez said he did not believe that \n     these incidents constituted political appointees being \n     ``involved'' in the decision.\n\n  Give me a break.\n\n       We believe these facts evidence ``involvement'' in--\n\n  Well, let me go back and get this precisely correct. This was the \ninspector general's report. The inspector general found:\n\n       In his interview . . . Perez said he did not believe that \n     these incidents constituted political appointees being \n     ``involved'' in the decision. We believe these facts evidence \n     ``involvement'' in the decision by political appointees \n     within the ordinary meaning of that word, and that Perez's \n     acknowledgment, in his statements on behalf of the \n     Department, that political appointees were briefed on and \n     could have overruled this decision did not capture the full \n     extent of that involvement.\n\n  That is what the inspector general said. To me, that sounds like a \nbureaucratic way of saying Mr. Perez did not tell the truth to the \ninspector general during the course of an official investigation of his \nconduct. So now we are going to promote him. Apparently, that is what \ngoes on around here.\n  True, the original decision to dismiss the case predated Mr. Perez's \nappointment to the Civil Rights Division. He was not there at that \ntime. That is true. But instead of reinstating the case--which would \nhave been the correct decision--he became directly involved in and \nmanaged--according to the inspector general--what was, in fact, a \ncoverup of the processes that occurred. That in and of itself should \ndisqualify him for this position.\n  This is not good, to be found by your own inspector general in the \nU.S. Department of Justice to not respond truthfully; to have a Federal \njudge find that; to have their own inspector general find that. We are \nfar too blase about high officials in this government not telling the \ntruth. He should not be rewarded with a promotion for his work \nprotecting political appointees in the Department of Justice.\n  The inspector general's report also confirmed Mr. Perez has overseen \nmost of the unprecedented racial polarization and politicalization of \nthe Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. There has been a lot \nof turmoil there over the disagreement about what is the right thing to \ndo. There has been a consistent theme of his, which is to advance \ncertain political and ideological agendas, it seems to me. I will \nexplain what I mean. I want to be fair to him, but I am not--I have \nbeen around a lot of litigation for a long time and I am not \ncomfortable with his actions.\n\n  He has sued States for implementing voter identification laws--sued \nthe States for that which has been rejected by Federal courts--to \nintimidate them and stop them from saying you have to have an \nidentification of some kind before you are allowed to waltz in and say \nyou are John Jones and you are entitled to vote. What if you are not \nJohn Jones? States have passed laws such as that and the Federal court \nhas rejected his view, including a three-judge panel on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia in Washington, including \nJudge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who was a Clinton appointee.\n  Mr. Perez's arguments have been rebuked by courts in Arkansas about \nthe Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act; in New York in an \neducation case, U.S. v. Brennan; in a Florida case where Perez's team \nwas abusively prosecuting peaceful pro-life protesters; and in a major \nloss in court in Florida when he was trying to force the State not to \nremove noncitizens from the voter rolls. Apparently, Florida, in his \nmind, was violating civil rights by saying nonvoters--noncitizens--\nshouldn't be on the voting rolls.\n  Is this who is running the Department of Justice? Is this the \nphilosophy they are having in Washington?\n  The Department has filed and is considering lawsuits against a \ngrowing list of States that have enacted immigration legislation, \nincluding Alabama, Arizona, Utah, Indiana, Georgia, and South Carolina. \nAlthough Mr. Perez was not involved in the Department's lawsuit against \nAlabama--my State--he has issued threats and engaged in intimidating \ntactics against Alabama law enforcement officials who reported to me \nshock at the nature of those events.\n  For example, he took the unprecedented action of creating a toll-free \nhotline for people to report allegations of discrimination due to \nAlabama's immigration law, although the Attorney General of Alabama \nsaid he will prosecute anybody who violates people's right to vote. \nAlso, Mr. Strange said, tell me who has made complaints, that you say \nhave made complaints, about not being treated fairly and I will \ninvestigate it. Mr. Perez said there were bullying and harassment \ncomplaints out there, but when asked to produce some of them he refused \nto provide the information. Alabama officials have been questioned \nwhether reports of complaints were, in fact, true. They won't say what \nthey are.\n  In October of 2011, Mr. Perez sent a letter to the superintendent of \nevery school district in Alabama requesting the names of all students \nwho had withdrawn from school and the date, without any apparent \nauthority to do so. He just wanted to snoop into that, I guess.\n  In December of 2011, he sent a letter to all Alabama sheriffs and \npolice departments that receive Federal funds--many of them through the \nDepartment of Justice where he was--warning them, I think without \nbasis, not to infringe on constitutional rights in enforcing Alabama's \nimmigration law. There is no proof anybody had violated constitutional \nrights in enforcing that law. Mr. Perez actually threatened to withdraw \nFederal funding from any of the 156 offices that implement ``the law in \na manner that has the purpose or effect of discriminating against \nLatino or any other community.''\n  He also warned that the Civil Rights Division is ``loosely monitoring \nthe impact of [the law].''\n  On January 20, Mr. Perez met in Tuscaloosa with Tuscaloosa County \nSheriff Ted Sexton and other high public safety officers in the Federal \nGovernment in Washington, and several other sheriffs around the \ncountry. Sheriff Sexton told Mr. Perez that he perceived his letter as \na threat in asking whether he should expect any lawsuits against him or \nany other law enforcement officials. Mr. Perez wouldn't comment.\n  Sheriff Sexton also pressed for examples of reports of discrimination \nin Alabama that Mr. Perez had purportedly received, but he again \nrefused to comment or provide evidence. According to Sheriff Sexton, a \nsheriff from Georgia was present and asked another Justice Department \nrepresentative who was present with Mr. Perez whether States such as \nAlabama and Georgia were ``being penalized for the sins of our \ngrandfathers'' and the official reportedly responded, ``More than \nlikely.''\n  I received a letter from Sheriff Huey Mack of Baldwin County, a fine \nsheriff who responded after 9/11 in New York and did forensic work \nthere, and Sheriff Mack states in opposition to this nomination:\n\n       Following the issuance of this letter, several law \n     enforcement officers met with Mr. Perez in Mobile, Alabama . \n     . . During this meeting, Mr. Perez made several false \n     allegations relating to law enforcement's handling of \n     Alabama's Immigration Law. This continued for a short period \n     of time during which it became evident Mr. Perez was not \n     interested in the truth, but wanted to rely strictly upon his \n     biased and preconceived notions regarding the State of \n     Alabama. Mr. Perez should not be confirmed to any cabinet \n     level post. In my opinion, Mr. Perez should be relieved of \n     all of his duties as it relates to the U.S. Federal \n     Government and seek employment outside of serving the \n     citizens of this Nation.\n\n  Well, I wasn't there, but I know Sheriff Mack and something was wrong \nfor him to write such a strong letter. Sheriff Sexton was in another \nmeeting that he was referring to, a very able sheriff.\n\n  When Mr. Perez was nominated to lead the Civil Rights Division, I had \nserious concerns about whether he would work to protect the civil \nrights of all Americans regardless of race, and whether he would ensure \nthat the division remained free from partisanship and not be used as a \ntool to further an agenda or some ideology.\n  These concerns had a basis in fact from looking at his prior record. \nThat was the concern I had. When he ran for the Montgomery County, MD, \ncouncil,\n\n[[Page S5746]]\n\nhe responded to a question asking ``What would you like the voters to \nknow about?'' with: ``I am a progressive Democrat and always was and \nalways will be.'' Well, that is OK. But when you get to be in the \nDepartment of Justice, you have to put that aside. So I asked him about \nthat in our meetings.\n  In an April 3, 2005, Washington Post article, he was described as \n``about as liberal as Democrats get.'' Well, there is nothing wrong \nwith that. But you have to be able to put it aside if you are going to \nserve in the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  As a councilman, he expressed disdain for Republicans, at one point \ngiving ``a 5-minute speech about how some conservative Republicans do \nnot care about the poor.'' Well, that is his opinion, but it should not \naffect his duties as an official in the Department of Justice.\n  From 1995 to 2002, while employed as an attorney in the Civil Rights \nDivision, he served on the board of CASA de Maryland. He later became \npresident of that organization. CASA--which is actually an acronym for \nCentral American Solidarity Association--is an advocacy organization \nwith some extreme views, funded in part by George Soros, that opposes \nenforcement of immigration laws. They are just flat out there active \nabout it.\n  In the Department of Justice, you need somebody who favors enforcing \nthe law, not not enforcing the law. What are the prosecutors supposed \nto do in the Department of Justice? Undermine law or enforce law? When \nI was in the Department of Justice, we understood our job was to \nenforce the law, not make it.\n  For example, this CASA de Maryland group issued a pamphlet \nencouraging illegal aliens not to speak to police officers or \nimmigration agents. It promoted day labor sites. That is where illegal \nworkers go out and get jobs. So they promoted that. It fought \nrestrictions on illegal immigrants receiving driver's licenses. And it \nsupported in-State tuition for illegal immigrants. This is the \norganization he was president of.\n  I talked to him about that, and I was not convinced that he could set \nthat aside when he became an official in the Department of Justice who \nwould be required to enforce those kinds of laws passed by the Congress \nand the States.\n  Mr. Perez has spoken in favor of measures that would assist illegal \naliens in skirting immigration laws. While a councilman in 2003, he \nsupported the use of the matricula consular ID cards issued by Mexico \nand Guatemala as a valid form of identification for local residents who \nworked and used government services, without having any U.S.-issued \ndocuments to prove they are lawfully here. Notably, no major bank in \nMexico accepts these identification documents. They are not a valid \nidentification document.\n  Unfortunately, my initial concerns about Mr. Perez's nomination have \nbeen confirmed, I hate to say. I do not feel like--and I have to say I \ndo not doubt--that he will continue, if confirmed as the Secretary of \nLabor, to do all that he can within his power to hamstring the \nenforcement of immigration laws and to advance his political agenda. \nThat is what his background is, that is what he has done, as I have \ndocumented here.\n  His misleading testimony before the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, as \nMr. Kirsanow pointed out--the veracity of which was questioned by a \nU.S. Federal judge here in the District of Columbia--his false \nstatements to the inspector general of the Department of Justice--who \nwrote about it in his analysis and report on the incident--his refusal \nto comply with a congressional subpoena by the House of \nRepresentatives, and, really, his abysmal record at the Department of \nJustice disqualifies him, in my view, for this position.\n  Frankly, we should not have closed debate on his nomination and moved \nit forward until we got the information that is out there. What if this \ninformation is produced next month and it is very incriminating or \nunacceptable? Are we then going to ask him to quit? That is not the way \nyou should do business here. We have hearings. We ask questions of \nnominees. If they do not answer questions, normally they do not move to \nthe floor for confirmation.\n  I think this is a legitimate concern that the American people ought \nto know about. I believe the American people have a right to know all \nthe information about Mr. Perez's tenure in office, the criticisms of a \nvery serious nature that he has received, and the fact that he seems to \nhave a strong bent toward allowing his own ideological and political \nviews to affect his decisionmaking process--all of which is \nunacceptable for a high position in this government of the United \nStates of America.\n  I appreciate the Chair's indulgence and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                          McCarthy Nomination\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nnomination of Gina McCarthy to be this Nation's next EPA Administrator.\n  Mr. President, you and I know Gina McCarthy's work firsthand because, \nprior to joining the EPA, she was our commissioner in the State of \nConnecticut of the Department of Environmental Protection, where she \nserved under a Republican Governor and worked with both parties to \nadvance the environmental and business interests of the State.\n  So first I want to very briefly share with my colleagues why I \nsupport Gina McCarthy. But then I, frankly, want to talk about why I \nbelieve my Republican colleagues--who may not be supportive every \nsingle day of the year of the mission of the EPA--should support her as \nwell.\n  I support Gina McCarthy because for her entire career she has been a \nchampion of public health. A lot of people who rise to lead Federal \nagencies spend the majority of their career here in Washington, and \nthere is nothing wrong with that, but there is something special that \ncomes with somebody like Gina McCarthy, who started her career as a \nlocal public health official in Canton, MA. She learned public health \nat the ground level, and she understood very early on that the \ngovernment, working together with the business community, can have an \nenormously positive effect on the health of our Nation.\n  I support her because she has come up the right way, through the \ngrassroots of America's public health infrastructure. I support her \nbecause of the great work she did in Connecticut when she was, as I \nmentioned, our Republican-appointed commissioner of the Department of \nEnvironmental Protection.\n  One of the things she did is work with States all throughout the \nNortheast on something called RGGI, which is a voluntary association of \nStates throughout the Northeast region to try to reduce carbon \nemissions.\n  There is nothing but success when you tell the story of RGGI. She did \nthis under a Republican Governor. There are a number of Republican \nGovernors along with Democrats who participated in this plan. But over \ntime, the plan was to reduce carbon emissions from northeastern States \nby 10 percent, moving toward 2018. Through this mechanism, what we have \nseen is not just a reduction in carbon emissions from Connecticut and \nthe States that participate, but a pretty amazing reduction in the \namount ratepayers are paying. Why? Because through this rather modest \ncap-and-trade regime, we were able to take the money gleaned through \nthe system and put it right back into efficiencies so that ratepayers \nwere paying less, so much so that the estimates are that consumer bills \nwill be $1.1 billion less because of the work Gina McCarthy did. It is \nan average of about $25 off the bill of a residential homeowner, and \nabout $181 off the bill of commercial consumers.\n  I support her because of what she has done since she has come to the \nEPA, leading the air quality initiatives at the EPA. She has made a \nhuge difference. You take a look at the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule \nalone, and the estimates are almost hard to comprehend. Mr. President, \n11,000 premature deaths will be prevented because of work she did on \nthat one effort alone; 4,700 heart attacks will be prevented because of \nthese toxins disappearing from our air; and maybe most importantly to \nthose of us with little kids at home, 130,000 asthma attacks will not \nhappen in this country, largely to children, because we will have \ncleaner air to breathe.\n  I support Gina McCarthy because of the work she has done her entire \ncareer\n\n[[Page S5747]]\n\nto be a great steward of the environment and a resolute champion of \nclean air.\n  But I want to talk for a few minutes about why I think our Republican \ncolleagues should support her as well.\n  We had a breakthrough this week on the issue of how this body will \ntreat at least this set of nominees. I think there was agreement \nbetween Republicans and Democrats that the President, of whatever party \nhe or she may be, should get his or her team in place, and that this \nbody should work to make sure that occurs, and maybe with the one \ncaveat that there should be a responsibility of the President to put \npeople with a pragmatic mind in charge of agencies that might be ones \nin which there is disagreement here over their mission. I might not \nexpect my Republican colleagues to support somebody going to the CFPB \nor to the EPA who is a rigid ideologue. But I think there is agreement \nthat if the President does choose a pragmatist--somebody who is willing \nto reach out across the aisle, who is willing to build coalitions--then \nthis body should support the President's team.\n  I want to make the case to my Republican colleagues, as they make \ntheir final decision as to how they are going to vote on Gina McCarthy, \nthat is exactly who she is. Lots has been made of the fact that she, \nwith the exception of her appointment to the EPA during her tenure \nunder President Obama, has been a Republican appointee. It was not just \nGovernor Jodi Rell, a Republican--who I disagreed with on a lot of \nthings back in Connecticut--who appointed her to head up our DEP, but \nshe also, of course, got her start in the higher ranks of environmental \nprotection from Mitt Romney in Massachusetts. So she has clearly \ndemonstrated that she is someone who is able to work across the aisle.\n  But what I think Republicans want to know is, as she presides over an \nEPA that is going to move forward with new regulations for proposed \npowerplants and, we hope, will move ahead with new clean air \nregulations for existing powerplants, is she going to do that in a \nrigid, arbitrary fashion or is she going to be willing to listen to \nindustry as well?\n  I want to give you a couple quotes that come from people who work in \nthe industry, people, frankly, whom I do not agree with, that the \nPresident does not agree with, and, frankly, that Gina McCarthy is not \ngoing to agree with all the time, but people who have worked with her \nwho have at worst a begrudging respect for the work she has done and at \nbest, frankly, an admiration.\n  William Bumpers, who is a partner at a law firm in town and \nrepresents powerplants and other industry clients, says:\n\n       [Gina McCarthy] is one of these avid environmental program \n     managers who is exceptionally competent but practical. My \n     experience with her in the past four years, I can meet with \n     her. She's very forthright. There's no guile with her. While \n     I haven't always agreed with the rules that come out of \n     there, there's never been any guess work about what comes out \n     of there.\n  Gloria Berquist, who is the vice president of the Alliance of \nAutomobile Manufacturers, says:\n\n       She is a pragmatic policymaker. She has aspirational \n     environmental goals, but she accepts real world economics.\n\n  Charles Warren, who was a top EPA official in the Reagan \nadministration and who now represents a lot of people in the industry, \nsays:\n\n       At EPA, as a regulator, you're also asking people to do the \n     things they don't want to do. But Gina's made an effort to \n     reach out to industries while they're developing regulations. \n     She has got a good reputation.\n\n  Even the spokesman for the National Mining Association--this might \ncome under the category of ``grudging respect,'' but he says:\n\n       She is very knowledgeable. I don't think anyone is \n     questioning her understanding or ability. She will not be \n     caught off-guard in any defense of what they have done. I \n     would expect her to be well-informed. She just doesn't strike \n     me as an ideologue.\n\n  This is what the industry says. We know the Republicans support her \nbecause that is how she got the jobs that led to her position at the \nEPA. But even within industry, they recognize that they are going to \ndisagree with her. They are not going to come down to the EPA in a \nparade of support for some of the things she may do. But they \nacknowledge that she is going to listen and that to the extent possible \nshe is going to work with them.\n  I think that is what we want at the EPA. I think that is who Gina \nMcCarthy will be. I do not think that just because of speculation, I \nthink that because as the junior Senator from Connecticut, I watched \nher walk the walk and talk the talk in Connecticut. I know she did it \nin Massachusetts because that is why we picked her in Connecticut. I \nhave certainly seen her do it in her years heading clean air policy at \nthe EPA.\n  For my friends who want a strong, passionate advocate for clean air, \nyou got one in Gina McCarthy. For my friends who want a pragmatist who, \nthough they may disagree with her, is going to at least be practical in \nhow she implements the policies of this administration, you have that \nvoice too. Gina McCarthy will be a great pick at the EPA. I urge my \ncolleagues to support her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to see both Senators \nfrom Connecticut here, one speaking and one presiding. To reflect on \nthe junior Senator's comments about the EPA nominee Gina McCarthy, who \nhas not only worked in Connecticut but in Massachusetts, she has \nsurrounded my State of Rhode Island. We have had plenty, I would say, \nindirect exposure to her. I think she is terrific. I could not agree \nmore with the Senator's comments. I look forward to a swift \nconfirmation for her to get to work rapidly on the issue that brings me \nto the floor again for the 39th time, which is to try to get this body \nto wake up to the threat of climate change.\n\n\n                             Senator Markey\n\n  Speaking of Massachusetts, I will also welcome our new Senator from \nMassachusetts, my New England neighbor Ed Markey. For decades Ed has \nbeen a passionate leader in Congress on energy and environmental \nissues. He has been a true champion on climate change. He and I serve \nas cochairs of the Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change, along with \nour colleagues Representative Waxman and Senator Cardin. So I really \nlook forward to continuing to work alongside now-Senator Markey to \nforge commonsense solutions to the crisis of climate change.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  We need common sense in a place where the barricade of special \ninterest influence has blocked action on climate change and where even \nthe debate itself is polluted--polluted with falsehood and fallacy and \nfantasy. Look no further than the Republican response to the \nannouncement last month of President Obama's national climate action \nplan.\n  The President described in his speech some of the overwhelming \nevidence that our planet is changing. The 12 warmest years in recorded \nhistory have all come in the last 15 years, he said. Last year \ntemperatures in some areas of the ocean reached record highs, and ice \nin the Arctic sank to its smallest size on record faster than most \nmodels had predicted it would. These are the facts. That is what the \nPresident said.\n  Here in the Senate, the President's facts were challenged. Those are \nnot the facts, Mr. President, flatly replied one of my Republican \ncolleagues. It is not even true. So let's look. Where were the facts \nand where were the falsehoods?\n  Well, according to NASA, the President had the facts right on \nwarming. Indeed, he may actually have understated the severity of \nglobal warming. In fact, the 13 hottest years on record--the red ones--\nhave all occurred in the last 15 years. The 13 hottest years on record \nhave been in the last 15 years.\n  I remind my colleagues that NASA is the organization that right now \nis driving a rover around on Mars. We might want to consider that these \nare scientists who know what they are talking about.\n  As to ocean temperatures--the other part of the President's \nassertion--NOAA says that ``sea surface temperatures in the northeast \nshelf's large marine ecosystem during 2012 were the highest recorded in \n150 years.'' The President's facts were right again. This chart from \nthe National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado \nshows, just as the President said, that ``the 2012 early sea ice melt \nin the\n\n[[Page S5748]]\n\nArctic smashed previous records.'' Furthermore, the data center \nconfirms that--and I will quote them again--``ice extent has declined \nfaster than the models predicted.''\n  So in the contest between fact and falsehood, the President was \ncompletely accurate on his facts. Facts, as John Adams said, are \nstubborn, not to be easily brushed aside for convenient falsehoods.\n  Falsehoods, fallacies, and fantasies. Let's go on to a fallacy. My \nSenate colleague warned against accepting what he called ``the extreme \nposition of saying that carbon dioxide is the cause of climate change \nor of global warming.'' He suggested that carbon dioxide cannot be a \nthreat because it is found in nature. We exhale it. Well, that is a \nfallacy, an incorrect argument in logic and rhetoric resulting in a \nlack of validity or, more generally, a lack of soundness. That is the \ndefinition of a ``fallacy.'' Arsenic is found in nature, but in the \nwrong concentration and in the wrong places, it is nevertheless still \ndangerous. And the principle that carbon dioxide warms the atmosphere \ndates back to the time of the American Civil War. It is not late-\nbreaking news. It is sound, solid, established science.\n  Quite simply, the position that carbon dioxide is not causing climate \nchange is the extreme one. The overwhelming majority of climate \nscientists--at least 95 percent of them--accept that global climate \nchange is driven by the carbon pollution caused by our human activity.\n  We are having a hearing this week on climate change in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. Even the witnesses invited by \nthe minority to that EPW hearing acknowledge the effects of carbon on \nour climate. In a recent interview, minority witness Dr. Roy Spencer of \nthe University of Alabama-Huntsville said:\n\n       I don't deny that there's been warming. In fact, I do not \n     even deny that some of the warming is due to mankind.\n  In another interview, he said:\n\n       I'm one of those scientists that think adding carbon \n     dioxide to the atmosphere should cause some amount of \n     warming. The question is, how much?\n\n  Another minority witness, Dr. Roger Pielke of the University of \nColorado, testified before the House Committee on Government Reform \nback in 2006. Here is what he said:\n\n       Human-caused climate change is real and requires attention \n     by policy makers to both mitigation and adaptation--but there \n     is no quick fix; the issue will be with us for decades and \n     longer.\n\n  These are statements by the witnesses invited by the Republican side.\n  It is simply not credible any longer to just deny climate change. The \nview that carbon emissions have caused climate change is shared by \nvirtually every major scientific organization, from the American \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, to the American Geophysical \nUnion, to the American Meteorological Society.\n  But, of course, to the polluters, this is not about the facts. It is \nabout political power. They bought this clout and they are going to use \nit, facts be damned.\n  The Republican response to the President's climate plan even served \nup the old climategate fantasy; that is, the faux scandal in which \nhacked e-mails between climate scientists were selectively quoted to \ntry to throw doubt on years of peer-reviewed research. The scientists, \nmy colleague said, ``were exposed for lying about the science for all \nthose years.'' Nothing of the kind is true. None of it. Because of the \nkerfuffle about this, eight groups, including the Office of the \nInspector General of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National \nScience Foundation, reviewed those whipped-up allegations against the \nresearchers and found no evidence of fraud--none.\n  It turns out the so-called climategate scandal is pure fantasy, but \neven that fantasy flies in low orbit compared to the high-flying \nRepublican fantasies about what regulating carbon pollution would do. \nAccording to my colleague, putting a price on carbon pollution will \ncost ``about $3,000 a year for each taxpayer.'' There is some history \nhere. This scary misleading number has been kicked around by \nRepublicans since 2009. As the colleague noted, the $3,000-per-year \nfigure is derived from a 2007 MIT assessment of cap-and-trade \nproposals. But there is more. When Politifact asked one of the study's \nauthors what he thought of the Republican characterization of his work, \nhere is what he said:\n\n       It is just wrong. It is wrong in so many ways, it is hard \n     to begin.\n\n  That is the assertion that is being quoted on the Senate floor--one \nthat is wrong, according to the authors, wrong in so many ways, it is \nhard to begin.\n  Politifact rates political statements generally from true to false, \nbut it reserves a special designation for fantasies. Politifact, all \nthe way back in 2009, gave these comments that very special \ndesignation: ``Pants On Fire.''\n  The fact, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, \nis that the cap-and-trade bill's actual costs were modest, about 48 \ncents per household per day. Further, it is worth noting that these \nenvironmental rules, such as the Clean Air Act--let's use that as an \nexample--actually save money overall. In the case of the Clean Air Act, \nit has been documented, $40 saved for every $1 spent. There is a 40-to-\n1 return on the cost of the Clean Air Act for the benefit of all of us.\n  Just as fantastical, our colleagues claim that new Environmental \nProtection Agency greenhouse gas regulations would cover ``every \napartment building, church, and every school.'' Here is another good \none: `` . . . that EPA will need to hire 230,000 additional employees \nand spend an additional $21 billion to implement its greenhouse gas \nregime.''\n  That may be true in fantasyland, but in reality EPA has specifically \nissued a rule limiting the regulation of greenhouse gases to only the \nlargest sources such as powerplants, refineries, and other large \nindustrial plants while exempting smaller sources such as restaurants, \nschools, and other small buildings. In fact, EPA filed a court brief, a \nsigned court brief, a representation to the courts of the United \nStates, that regulating ``every apartment building, church and every \nschool,'' as my colleague put it, is wholly unrealistic.\n  EPA has fewer than 18,000 employees. To add 230,000 new employees, it \nwould have to increase its workforce by 1,300 percent. Really?\n  If EPA had 230,000 employees, it would be equivalent to the 20th \nlargest corporation in the United States. It would be larger than \nGeneral Motors and Walgreens. In fact, back here on Earth, this claim \nhas been evaluated by PolitiFact when it was made by other Republicans. \nThose similar statements received a rating of ``false.''\n  I applaud the President for courageously taking the lead on \nprotecting the American people and the American economy from the \ndevastating effects of carbon pollution on our oceans and our \natmosphere.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues would consider the differences \nbetween the administration's regulatory approach and the market-based \nsolutions we could implement through bipartisan legislation. I hope \nthey will decide if they are content to holler from the back seat about \nthis or whether they are willing to come forward and join with us, put \nhands on the wheel, and design commonsense solutions for a very real \nproblem.\n  Unfortunately, instead of seizing this opportunity, the other side of \nthis debate can't let go of the falsehood, the fallacy, and the \nfantasy. We were together the other night, Monday night, as a Senate. \nWe joined together, and we went to the Old Senate Chamber to discuss a \nlot of issues related to the filibuster and to the Senate. A lot of \nhigh-minded things were said that Monday night, a lot of good things \nabout the traditions and the institution of the Senate.\n  Traditions of the Senate worth preserving include that we don't \ntraffic in falsehoods, fallacies, and in ``pants on fire'' fantasies, \nthat we face even unpleasant facts squarely--that is our job--and that \nwe do our job. We have received credible and convincing warnings. We \nhave received compelling calls to act. The denial position has shown \nitself to be nonsense, a sham. It is time to wake up and for us to do \nthe work necessary to hold back, to mitigate, and to adapt for the \nclimate change that our carbon pollution is causing.\n  Yet we sleepwalk in this Chamber. We sleepwalk in Congress.\n  It is time to shelve the falsehood, fallacy and fantasy and have an \nhonest discussion about how we are going to address the very real \nthreat of climate change.\n\n[[Page S5749]]\n\n  It is time to wake up.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich).

Mr. President, yesterday was a good day for the Senate. I \nwant to praise the majority leader, who brought the Senate back from \nthe brink, and the hard work of Senators from both parties who listened \nto each other during a lengthy discussion. In particular, I thank \nSenator Wicker for suggesting Monday night's bipartisan caucus, which \nallowed for a much needed dialogue among all Senators, and Senator \nMcCain for his efforts to bring both sides together. The last time we \nheld a bipartisan caucus meeting, in April, it was to hear Senator \nMcCain discuss his experience as a prisoner of war. In all my time in \nthe Senate, that was a particularly memorable evening for me. It is my \nhope these kinds of bipartisan discussions, like the one we had Monday \nnight, will lead to better communication in the Senate and help us work \ntogether more effectively so we can address the problems that Americans \nface.\n  Until yesterday, Senate Republicans had been blocking votes on \nseveral important Executive nominations, including Richard Cordray to \nbe Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; Gina McCarthy \nto be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; Tom Perez \nto be Secretary of Labor; and three of the five nominees to the \nNational Labor Relations Board. Rather than arising from substantive \nopposition to these individual nominees, this obstruction was a \npartisan attempt to sabotage and eviscerate these agencies which \nprotect consumers, the clean air and water that the American people \nwant and deserve, and American workers. For example, I am unaware of \nany personal opposition to Richard Cordray, but Senate Republicans \nsimply refused even to allow a confirmation vote for the director of an \nagency that they dislike. His confirmation last night, 2 years after he \nwas first nominated, means that the CFPB is now truly empowered to \nprotect American consumers.\n  During my 38 years in the Senate, I have served with Democratic \nmajorities and Republican majorities, during Republican administrations \nand Democratic ones. Whether in the majority or the minority, whether \nthe chairman or ranking member of a committee, I have always stood for \nthe protection of the rights of the minority. Even when the minority \nhas voted differently than I have or opposed what I have supported, I \nhave defended their rights and held to my belief that the best \ntraditions of the Senate would win out and that the 100 of us who \nrepresent over 310 million Americans would do the right thing.\n  Yet over the last 4 years, Senate Republicans have changed the \ntradition of the Senate with their escalating obstruction, and these \nactions threaten the Senate's ability to do the work of the American \npeople.\n  Instead of trying to work across the aisle on efforts to help the \nAmerican people at a time of economic challenges, Senate Republicans \nhave relied on the unprecedented use of the filibuster to thwart \nprogress. They have long since crossed the line from use of the Senate \nrules to abuse of the rules, exploiting them to undermine our ability \nto solve national problems.\n  Filibusters that were once used rarely have now become a common \noccurrence, with Senate Republicans raising procedural barriers even to \nconsidering legislation or to voting on the kinds of noncontroversial \nnominations the Senate once confirmed regularly and quickly by \nunanimous consent. The majority leader has been required to file \ncloture just to ensure that the Senate makes any progress at all to \naddress our national and economic security, and a supermajority of the \nSenate is now needed even to allow a vote on basic issues.\n  That is not how the Senate should work or has worked. The Senate has \na tradition of comity, with rules that function only with the kind of \nconsent that previously was almost always given. The rules are not \ndesigned to encourage Senators to obstruct at every turn. The Senate \ndoes not function if an entire caucus takes every opportunity to use \nobscure procedural loopholes to stand in the way of a vote because they \nmight disagree with the result. Without serious steps to curtail these \nabuses, the approach taken during the Obama administration by Senate \nRepublicans risks turning the rules of the Senate into a farce and \ncalls into question the ability of the Senate to perform its \nconstitutional functions.\n  I was hopeful that the agreement reached earlier this year by the \nmajority leader and the Republican leader represented a serious step \ntoward restoring the Senate's ability to work for the American people. \nI was hopeful that the Republican Senators who joined with Senate \nDemocrats in January would follow through on their commitment to \ncurtail the abuse of Senate rules and practices that have marred the \nlast 4 years.\n  That is why I was so disappointed by the continued obstruction \nPresident Obama's nominees have been facing. This obstruction has \nserious consequences for the American people. The harm being done is no \nmore readily apparent than with the Republican effort to shut down the \nNational Labor Relations Board. It was critical that we reach a \nworkable agreement with Senate Republicans to confirm nominees to the \nNLRB to ensure it will be able to function--rather than leave it in its \ncurrent situation of facing a shutdown due to lack of quorum at the end \nof next month. Shutting down the NLRB would deny justice to American \nworkers, stripping them of their right to organize and to speak out in \nfavor of fair wages and decent working conditions without fear of \nretaliation. It would also prevent employees from creating a union, or \nfor that matter, voting to end union representation. Without an NLRB, \nemployers will also be hurt because they will be unable to stop \nunlawful activities by unions, including unlawful strikes. Workers and \nemployers depend on the NLRB, and Senate Republicans should allow votes \non the President's nominees so that the Board can do its job.\n  Last week, some Senate Republicans declared that they could never \nallow a vote on the NLRB nominees who had received recess appointments \nto those positions, because the recess appointments have been \ndetermined by the DC Circuit to be illegal. However, according to that \nruling by the DC Circuit, a total of 141 of President Bush's recess \nappointments were illegal. I do not recall any Senate Republicans \narguing that those nominees should not be allowed a vote.\n  Senate Republicans should have considered President Obama's NLRB \nnominees on their own merits, and, even if they would ultimately have \nopposed them, they should have allowed the Senate to hold an up-or-down \nvote. I have no doubt that if considered on their own merits the two \npreviously recess-appointed NLRB nominees would have been confirmed and \nwould have continued to serve the Nation well.\n  These filibusters have been damaging to the Senate and our Nation. \nWhen it comes to Executive nominations, a President should have wide \ndiscretion to staff his or her administration.\n  Our form of representative democracy requires a degree of self-\nrestraint from all of us for the legislative system to work for the \ngood of the Nation and for the well-being of the American people. I \nbelieve that the strong cloture and confirmation votes on Richard \nCordray's nomination yesterday reflect an acknowledgement of this \nprinciple by some Senate Republicans. While this deal leaves in place \nboth the majority's ability to pursue further rules reform and the \nminority's ability to filibuster executive branch nominations, I hope \nthat neither tool will be used. If the Senate Republicans who voted \nwith us yesterday to invoke cloture on Richard Cordray continue to \ncooperate and work with us to allow\n\n[[Page S5750]]\n\nfair consideration of President Obama's, or any President's, executive \nbranch nominations, the deal reached yesterday will rightfully be seen \nas an important step in restoring the Senate's ability to function.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/17/senate-section/article/S5750-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5750-S5751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SAFE ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the following seven letters expressing support for S. 1270, \nthe Secure Annuities for Employee (SAFE) Retirement Act of 2013: \nFidelity Investments, National Benefit Services, LLC, National Rural \nElectric Cooperative Association, Principal Life Insurance Company, \nSmall Business Council of America, Transamerica Retirement Solutions, \nand the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Fidelity Investments,\n\n                                                    July 11, 2013.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: On behalf of Fidelity Investments, I \n     would like to thank you for advancing the discussion on \n     retirement security. The private employer pension system has \n     been a great success; however, we share your concerns that \n     more needs to be done to ensure that millions of Americans \n     are ready for retirement.\n       The SAFE Retirement Act of 2013 includes several provisions \n     that will improve retirement security. For example, the bill \n     would enhance the use of automatic enrollment--a tool that \n     has proven to increase participation in workplace savings \n     plans. We recordkeep over 20,000 corporate defined \n     contribution plans, representing over 12 million \n     participants. Our data and analysis reveal that participation \n     rates in plans with automatic enrollment is on average 90%. \n     Currently 60% of those defined contribution plans that offer \n     automatic-enrollment have elected the safe harbor default \n     deferral of three percent. A higher minimum default rate, \n     such as six percent in the bill, may result in more \n     participants saving at higher rates sooner.\n       The bill also facilitates electronic delivery and includes \n     other provisions that would simplify plan administration, \n     making it easier for small businesses to adopt plans. Our \n     data show that participants who receive electronic statements \n     and notices are more likely to take actions than participants \n     who receive paper statements and communications. We find that \n     electronic mail yields response rates three times higher than \n     print (13.7% vs. 3.8%).\n       We applaud your leadership on retirement security and \n     appreciate your efforts to advance needed reforms to the \n     private retirement system. We look forward to working with \n     you on these important issues.\n           Regards,\n                                               Pamela D. Everhart,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  National Benefit\n\n\n                                                Services, LLC,\n\n                                        Jordan, UT, June 24, 2013.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing to you to express my \n     support for the Pension Reform Bill, a New Pension Plan for \n     State and Local Governments. The Pension Bill proposes many \n     improvements and needed changes to the pension/retirement \n     system. Among its many proposed improvements, it supports and \n     strengthens the need to work through employers to promote \n     retirement savings programs. In my opinion, the proposal \n     would make it easier and less costly for an employer to \n     implement and maintain a retirement plan for either \n     employees. The Multiple Employer Plan proposals are \n     particularly encouraging, as many employers and \n     administrators are discouraged with the current statute of \n     the law in this area. As you may know, National Benefit \n     Services, LLC (``NBS'') is committed to helping employers \n     design and maintain productive retirement savings programs. \n     As a whole, the Pensions Bill is important to NBS because we \n     have experienced firsthand how positive legislation can help \n     small employers offer a full-fledged retirement program to \n     employees at a fraction of the cost.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to share my views on the \n     Pension Bill. I support and appreciate your offices efforts \n     in improving the retirement system. If there is anything I \n     can do to help in your further pension reform efforts, please \n     let me know. Thank you again for your time and interest.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Scott F. Betts,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     National Benefit Services, LLC.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Rural Electric\n\n\n                                      Cooperative Association,\n\n                                      Arlington, VA, July 3, 2013.\n     Re SAFE Retirement Act of 2013.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Republican Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on Finance, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Thank you for your consistent \n     leadership on so many issues affecting rural electric \n     cooperatives in Utah, and throughout the country.\n       NRECA members are committed to preserving and enhancing the \n     voluntary employer-sponsored retirement system and the tax \n     policies that support it. We applaud your consistent \n     leadership on private retirement plan issues, and look \n     forward to working with you on your most recent bill, the \n     ``SAFE Retirement Act of 2013'', which would help address \n     many critical challenges facing the private retirement plan \n     system.\n       NRECA is proud that the vast majority of its members offer \n     comprehensive retirement benefits through a traditional \n     defined-benefit plan (the NRECA Retirement Security Plan) and \n     a defined-contribution plan (the NRECA 401(k) Plan). Both of \n     these critical ``multiple-employer'' benefit plans (under \n     Sec. 413(c) of the Internal Revenue Code) are operated to \n     maximize retirement savings for employees, retirees and their \n     families and provides each co-op employee the financial means \n     to enjoy a comfortable and secure retirement.\n       Your support for rural electric cooperatives has been \n     critical to our success, and we look forward to continuing \n     our work with you on the important issues that impact our \n     dedicated employees and our consumer-owners.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kirk D. Johnson,\n     Senior Vice President, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Principal Life Insurance Company,\n\n                                     Des Moines, IA, July 2, 2013.\n     Re Title II of ``Secure Annuities for Employee Retirement Act \n         of 2013''.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Employer sponsored 401(k) plans and \n     other worksite retirement plans have helped millions of \n     workers save trillions of dollars. These plans have proven to \n     be resilient even in challenging times but more is needed to \n     expand access to worksite retirement plans. By removing \n     barriers to new retirement plan formation and encouraging \n     plan designs that increase participation and savings, more \n     Americans can gain access to retirement plans and be \n     encouraged to save more effectively through them.\n       On behalf of Principal Financial Group, I want to thank you \n     for furthering this discussion through the inclusion of Title \n     II, ``Private Pension Reform'' as contained in ``Secure \n     Annuities for Employee Retirement Pension Act of 2013.'' In \n     our view, the key challenges that need to be addressed to \n     expand retirement savings are: expand coverage of employees \n     in voluntary, employer-sponsored retirement plans; increase \n     retirement savings to adequate levels; and secure income to \n     last through retirement. Each of these areas is addressed in \n     the proposed legislation.\n       Thank you for your leadership in this area. We are still \n     reviewing the specifics of the bill and look forward to \n     working with you as the process continues. Seeking solutions \n     to these important policy considerations to expand the \n     current employer based retirement system is vital to the \n     economic wellbeing of millions of future retirees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Gregory J. Burrows,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Small Business Council of America,\n\n                                                     July 2, 2013.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Hatch: On behalf of the members of the \n     Small Business Council of America (``SBCA'') and its advisory \n     boards, we want to thank you for all of your efforts in \n     support of the private retirement system and express our \n     strong support for the private retirement system provisions \n     in Title II and 111 of the SAFE Retirement Act of 2013.\n       The Small Business Council of America (SBCA) is a national \n     nonprofit organization which has represented the interests of \n     privately-held and family-owned businesses solely on federal \n     tax, health care, pension and other employee benefit matters \n     since 1979. The SBCA, through its members, represents well \n     over 20,000 enterprises in retail, manufacturing and service \n     industries, virtually all of which provide health insurance \n     and retirement plans. SBCA's Advisory Boards contain many of \n     the nation's leading small business advisors in the legal, \n     actuarial, accounting and plan administration fields. The \n     expertise of these board members in the small business \n     retirement plan area is unmatched in the small business \n     world.\n       Longer life expectancies are requiring increased retirement \n     savings. The present qualified retirement plan system, which \n     is largely dependent on federal tax laws, has been very \n     successful in providing retirement security. However, there \n     is still room for significant improvement. By simplifying the \n     administrative requirements of sponsoring a qualified \n     retirement plan and providing employers with new options, the \n     private pension reform provisions of the SAFE Retirement Act \n     will encourage employers to both maintain existing plans as \n     well as to establish new plans.\n       The existing notice and other administrative requirements \n     of sponsoring a plan are costly and burdensome. For small \n     business owners, the decision of whether to sponsor a \n     qualified retirement plan is largely based on the balance \n     between the burdens of sponsoring a plan and the benefit to \n     its key employees. By simplifying the operation of\n\n[[Page S5751]]\n\n     qualified retirement plans, the SAFE Retirement Act will make \n     it easier for small business owners to rationalize sponsoring \n     plans.\n       The SBCA believes that this bill will increase the \n     retirement security of small business employees throughout \n     the nation and we will make ourselves available to fully \n     support your efforts to protect America's retirement system.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                            Paula Calimafde, Esq.,\n     SBCA, Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Transamerica',\n\n                                       Harrison, NY, July 3, 2013.\n     Re Discussion Draft SAFE Retirement Act of 2013.\n\n     Hon.

In particular, removing \n     impediments to the adoption of multiple employer plans, \n     expanding the auto enrollment safe harbor, facilitating the \n     use of in-plan annuities and providing annuities as a \n     distribution option are matters in which Transamerica has \n     been extremely active, both from a policy and market \n     development standpoint. I and others at Transamerica look \n     forward to working with you and your staff as you finalize \n     these and other provisions of the SAFE Retirement Act of \n     2013.\n       The Transamerica companies market life insurance, \n     annuities, pensions and supplemental health insurance, as \n     well as mutual funds and related investment products \n     throughout the U.S. and in selected countries worldwide. \n     Transamerica Retirement Solutions provides and services \n     workforce retirement savings plans in the small and mid-large \n     employer markets. Transamerica helps more than three million \n     retirement plan participants save and invest wisely to secure \n     their retirement dreams.

'' Retirement \n     security is a critical issue facing all Americans, and our \n     members support your efforts to encourage participation in \n     retirement savings plans.\n       The SAFE Retirement Act includes several provisions that \n     the Chamber believes are important reforms to the retirement \n     system: enhancing the start-up credit for small businesses; \n     eliminating barriers to the use of multiple employer plans; \n     reducing discrimination testing and other administrative \n     burdens; reducing administrative restrictions on hardship \n     distributions; and simplifying notice requirements. Overall, \n     the Chamber believes that the SAFE Retirement Act would \n     provide meaningful reform and encourage participation by both \n     plan sponsors and plan participants in the employer-provided \n     retirement system.\n       The Chamber appreciates your leadership on this issue, and \n     looks forward to working with you and your colleagues to \n     enact this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R.

We also appreciate your \n     long history of support for state-based insurance regulation.\n       We note that the draft bill would rely on state insurance \n     regulators' oversight of the life insurance and annuities \n     industry.

Annuities are an important option that should be \n     considered as part of the solution for meeting this need. \n     Annuities historically have proven to be safe and prudent \n     components of a sound financial plan, thanks to the efforts \n     of a financially conservative insurance industry, effective \n     regulation, and an established consumer safety net system.\n       You and your colleagues are to be lauded for encouraging \n     the consideration of annuities to help Americans meet their \n     overall retirement security objectives.\n       In my personal opinion, facilitating the consideration of \n     annuities to help achieve secure, lifetime retirement income \n     will redound significantly to the benefit of both individual \n     retirees and the overall American economy, and I appreciate \n     your leadership on this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Peter G. Gallanis,\n     President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/17/senate-section/article/S5751-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CORDRAY CONFIRMATION\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, 3 years ago this week, \nthe Senate passed the Wall Street reform act to address the historic \ninstability of our financial system. Turmoil in our financial system \nhad revealed that many Americans were trapped with financial products \nthey did not fully understand, and that no Federal agency was looking \nout for consumers. This act created the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau--the first Federal agency tasked with putting consumers first--\nand over the past 2 years, the Bureau has taken significant steps to \nimprove the consumer experience in many parts of the financial \nmarketplace.\n  The Senate has taken a crucial step for consumers in confirming the \nfirst Director of the CFPB, Richard Cordray, to a 5-year term. I am \nglad that the Senate set aside partisan politics and allowed this vote \non Mr. Cordray's merits to go forward. Mr. Cordray has done excellent \nwork at the CFPB, first as its first head of enforcement, and as \nPresident Obama's first nominee to head the Bureau. I am confident that \nthe CFPB will continue to flourish under Mr. Cordray's leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/17/senate-section/article/S5751-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5751-S5752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH CHING\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a very \nspecial person who has served the people of Montana for 37 years: \nElizabeth Ching. Our Liz retired from the U.S. Senate on June 30, 2013. \nOf course, she started her new job the very next day, on July 1. Her \nso-called retirement lasted less than 24-hours. That is the kind of \nwork\n\n[[Page S5752]]\n\nethic that has made Liz famous. When she has a task to accomplish, she \nsimply doesn't rest until it is done.\n  She is a workhorse and one of the kindest, most dedicated people I \nknow.\n  Liz was a staff assistant on the Select Committee for Presidential \nCampaigns and the Budget Committee before joining my team in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives in 1975. Liz continued her career in the U.S. \nSenate. As one of the first members of my team, Liz has literally \nhelped thousands of Montanans over the years.\n  She has also worn many hats over the last thirty-seven years proving \nthat no job is too small or too large for her to tackle with heart and \nsoul.\n  In many ways, Liz and I grew up together learning the ropes of \nCongress. Little did we know back in 1975 when I first hired her how \nmuch we would be able to accomplish for Montanans. She has helped \nsupport Montana outreach efforts on three farm bills, four highway \nbills, four major rural water project bills, and the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  In her early years in my Washington, DC office, she was my office \nmanager. In 1995, she moved to Montana to be assistant to the state \ndirector. Her titles from 1996 through today include grants \ncoordinator, State casework director, agriculture issues eastern \nMontana and director of constituent services, and Montana economic \ndevelopment director. As our economic development director, Liz has \nplayed a key role in making our Montana Economic Development Summits a \nsuccess--helping make connections that have resulted in hundreds of \nMontana jobs. More recently, she has been an ambassador to energy-\nimpacted communities in the Bakken region helping them to understand \nand access the myriad of Federal programs available to absorb the \npressures of the Bakken oil and gas boom. While we will all miss having \nher on staff, I am thrilled to know that she will have the opportunity \nto continue serving Montanans through her passion for economic \ndevelopment.\n  Liz has worked on more than 17,000 cases for Montanans on issues such \nas small business, labor, agriculture, veterans, appropriations, \ntransportation, housing, postal services, health, environment, energy, \nbanking, and economic issues. I have always been thankful to have Liz \nin my corner. I can only imagine how each and every one of those 17,000 \nindividuals felt knowing that Liz answered the call when they needed \nhelp.\n  In addition to her legislative achievements and impressive \nconstituent work, Liz mentored thousands of interns and young staff \nassistants over the years, gently educating them in all facets of \nprotocol, policy, and poise.\n  Always on the road, working tirelessly on individual casework and \nlarger community issues, often I received e-mails and notes from \nMontanans sharing their gratitude for Liz's support and knowledge of \nthe issues that matter most to them. One of her greatest talents is \nbringing key people together for discussions and setting the table for \nmeaningful teamwork.\n  While she is known statewide for her work, Liz is truly a pillar of \nthe Billings community. Whether there is a road to build, a bridge to \nfix, a new store opening, or a building burnt down, Liz has always been \nthere to uplift those in need or help with the groundbreakings, ribbon-\ncuttings, dedications, and donations. I cannot fully express how \namazing Liz has been as a liaison for our office.\n  While I could go on and on about Liz's professional accomplishments, \nI know she is most proud of her wonderful marriage to Kevin Dowling and \nthe beautiful family they have raised together. Her amazing family is \ntruly a testament to the type of person she is. Liz and Kevin have \nthree terrific children: Tierney, Aidan, and Seanan, and one grandson \nKaiven.\n  Everyone privileged to know Liz is touched by her contagious zest for \nlife and endless energy. Her colleagues in Washington, DC, and Montana \nhave the highest regard and appreciation for her many years of service, \nfriendship, and determination to do everything she can for all \nMontanans in need of any kind of assistance.\n  I personally owe her a big thank-you. Liz, you are truly one of a \nkind. We are all rooting for you on your new adventures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/17/senate-section/article/S5752-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING STAFF SERGEANT JEFFREY KEAS\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, as we confront the many challenges facing \nthis institution, it can be easy to lose sight of what is so unique and \nspecial about America. From time to time, though, we are reminded of \nthe America we all know and love--a Nation filled with men and women of \ncharacter and a remarkable ability to put the interest of others ahead \nof self.\n  I was recently reminded of the true American character in reading the \nstory of an Oklahoman and true American patriot, SSG Jeffrey Keas, who \nrecently succumbed to cancer at the age of 44.\n  As the Tulsa World recently reported, Jeff's journey to military \ncareer began at an age when others are usually leaving the service. At \nthe age of 38, Jeff attended a local baseball game that paid tribute to \nactive duty military and veterans. He later told family members that he \nfelt ashamed that he could not stand with his son that day, a recent \nenlistee, as service men and women were asked to rise for recognition. \nSo Jeff signed up for a long-term commitment with the Army and went on \nto serve our Nation in Iraq and Korea and most recently at Fort Hood, \nTX.\n  At the time of his enlistment, Jeff's dad asked him, ``Why in the \nworld, at your age, would you do this, Jeff, when the military is \ndesigned for a 19-year-old?''\n  Jeff's answer says a lot about him and the country he loved so \ndearly. He said, ``If I can go to Iraq or Afghanistan, and that can \nallow some 19-year-old to come home to his mom and dad or girlfriend, \nthen that's what I want to do.''\n  Tragically, SSG Jeffrey Keas passed from this world earlier this \nmonth, but not before he inspired countless Americans with his \nselflessness, his courage, and his service.\n  With men and women like SSG Jeffrey Keas, we should never count \nAmerica out. We face many challenges, but this land of freedom and \nopportunity was built and is defended by men and women like Staff \nSergeant Keas. I am in awe of the example he set for his own family, \nhis neighbors and all those who came in contact with him.\n  This is the America I know.\n  On behalf of my fellow Oklahomans, I want to thank Staff Sergeant \nKeas for this remarkable example and to share our great sadness with \nthe Keas family. Thank you for your sacrifices, and for sharing Jeff, \nas he served so honorably.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/17/senate-section/article/S5752-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5752-S5753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             375TH ANNIVERSARY OF PORTSMOUTH, RHODE ISLAND\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, \nSenator Whitehouse, to help mark the 375th anniversary of the \nsettlement of Portsmouth, RI.\n  Portsmouth is predominantly located on Aquidneck Island in \nNarragansett Bay, and also encompasses a number of smaller islands \nincluding Prudence, Hog, Patience, and Hope. It is the second oldest \ncommunity in Rhode Island and is home to over 17,000 people. With over \n50 miles of coastline, Portsmouth enjoys beautiful views of the \nsurrounding bay and islands.\n  Portsmouth has a long and rich history. In 1638, Roger Williams \nconvinced religious dissenters from the Boston Colony to settle the \narea now known as Portsmouth. One of these dissenters, Anne Hutchinson, \nperhaps the most well-known of the founders of Portsmouth, rebelled \nagainst the Puritanical lifestyle in Massachusetts Bay, undergoing a \nrigorous trial before being banished and excommunicated from the Boston \nChurch. Hutchinson founded the town of Portsmouth with fellow colonists \nwho were also searching for religious freedom. Portsmouth is believed \nto be the first town in the New World that was established by a woman. \nThe signing of the Portsmouth Compact in March of 1638 created the \nfirst true democracy in America.\n  The town played a role in our Nation's fight for independence. The \nBattle of Rhode Island, which took place in 1778, was significant to \nthe history of the Revolutionary War because it was the first joint \noperation of American and French forces and also was the only battle in \nwhich black Americans fought as their own unit as part of the First \nRhode Island Regiment, alongside Native Americans. The site\n\n[[Page S5753]]\n\nof the battle is designated as a National Historic Landmark by a plaque \nand monuments at Patriots Park. Portsmouth was also home to a general \narmy hospital that treated thousands of wounded Union soldiers and \nConfederate prisoners during the Civil War.\n  With its vast shoreline, Portsmouth's maritime legacy is historically \nnoteworthy. It was the site of the Navy's first PT-boat training \nfacility, the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Training Center in Melville, \nwhere President John F. Kennedy trained. Portsmouth is now fittingly \nthe home of US Sailing, which is the governing body for the sport of \nsailing in the United States.\n  As we celebrate the 375th anniversary of Portsmouth's settlement, I \nwould like to recognize the residents of Portsmouth for all of their \nefforts to preserve one of our country's most treasured places. Like \nthe town's motto for this anniversary celebration proclaims, Portsmouth \nhas a proud heritage and a bright future. Congratulations to the Town \nof Portsmouth on its 375th anniversary.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, in 1638--375 years ago--a small, brave \ngroup of free thinkers banded together to establish an independent \ndemocratic community founded upon civil liberty and religious \ntoleration.\n  The settlers were followers of Anne Hutchinson, a highly educated \nmidwife and controversial figure in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where \nideological conformity was enforced by the gallows and the lash. \nHutchinson and many of her allies were banished from Massachusetts for \nchallenging the orthodoxy of the Puritan establishment. At the urging \nof Roger Williams, who had founded the colony of Providence Plantation \njust 2 years earlier, they settled on nearby Aquidneck Island in \nNarragansett Bay. The group called themselves the freemen of Pocasset, \nafter the Native American name for the area. Eventually the new \ncommunity settled on the name of Portsmouth.\n  With the signing of the Portsmouth Compact on March 7, 1638, these \nreligious dissenters, including John Clarke and William Coddington, \nformed a ``Bodie Politick'' that held forth the freedom to worship \naccording to one's own conscience. Together with Roger Williams and his \nProvidence colony, they blazed the path for American freedom of \nreligion, one of our enduring national blessings.\n  Their bold declaration would echo 25 years later in the Royal Charter \ngranted in 1663 by King Charles II to establish the colony of Rhode \nIsland and Providence Plantations in New England, which provided the \nworld's first formal establishment of freedom of religion. Their \nprinciples of tolerance are the foundation upon which our State, and \nafterwards our Nation, were built.\n  Portsmouth, RI, was also the first community in the New World to be \nfounded by a woman. It was in Portsmouth in 1778 that the First Rhode \nIsland Regiment, with its complement of over 100 African-American \nsoldiers, valiantly repulsed British forces in the Battle of Rhode \nIsland. And it was Portsmouth abolitionist and suffragist Julia Ward \nHowe who penned the patriotic poem, ``The Battle Hymn of the \nRepublic,'' in 1861. The history of Portsmouth is a legacy of America.\n  I am proud to join with our State's senior senator, Jack Reed, and \nall Rhode Islanders in congratulating the people of Portsmouth on this \nhistoric milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/17/senate-section/article/S5753-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE BUFFALO SOLDIERS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing the 9th and 10th (Horse) Cavalry Association of \nthe Buffalo Soldiers, who on July 22-28, 2013, will celebrate their \n147th Anniversary Reunion in New Orleans, LA. The cavalry association \nwill honor allied members who have demonstrated tremendous work and \nleadership in the association, their community, or the United States \nthrough their exceptional service.\n  On July 28, 1866, the 29th Congress passed the Army Organization Act, \ncreating two cavalry and six overall regiments of African-American \ntroops. The 9th Cavalry was activated in New Orleans, LA, and the 10th \nwas called into service at Fort Levenworth, KS, beginning the Buffalo \nSoldiers' rich heritage of professional service to their communities \nand the Nation. The cavalry units of the Buffalo Soldiers played an \nintegral role in the settlement and development of the West in the \ncrucial years that followed the Civil War, serving courageously and \nvictoriously on the frontier from Texas to Montana.\n  Buffalo Soldiers wear the name proudly and respectfully, sharing a \ncommon passion for the historical significance and contributions of \nthose who have served before them. The Buffalo Soldiers performed \nadmirably in and out of battle, assisting in the economic growth and \ncultural development of Western territories and communities. Today, the \nBuffalo Soldiers honor their heritage through mentorship, community \nservice, and volunteerism. In this capacity, the soldiers work \ntirelessly to provide education and support services in numerous \ncommunities throughout the Nation. Their outstanding leadership in \nthese endeavors and services they perform continue to provide \nunparalleled contributions to the citizens and communities impacted and \nwill benefit generations to come.\n  In 2001, at the 135th Anniversary Reunion of the 9th and 10th Cavalry \nAssociation, Mr. George Jones, along with nine members of the cavalry \nassociation, was awarded a national charter to form the Greater New \nOrleans Area Chapter #22. This chapter was the first in the State of \nLouisiana to receive a chapter charter from the national office. The \nGreater New Orleans Area Chapter has embodied the values and mission \nembraced by the 9th and 10th Cavalry for 147 years, and has \ncontinuously educated Louisiana's communities on the invaluable \ntraditions and contributions of the Buffalo Soldiers in the service of \nthe United States.\n  The 9th and 10th (Horse) Cavalry Association of Buffalo Soldiers has \nbeen and continues to be an inspiration to all those who have been \nimpacted by their tireless service. It is with my greatest sincerity \nthat I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the hard work, \ndedication, and many accomplishments of these incredible leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/17/senate-section/article/S5753-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5753-S5754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n   RESPECT TO THE FORMER LIBERIAN REGIME OF CHARLES TAYLOR THAT WAS \n      ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13348 ON JULY 22, 2004--PM 16\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent the enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication \nstating that the national emergency and related measures dealing with \nthe former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor are to continue in effect \nbeyond July 22, 2013.\n  Although Liberia has made advances to promote democracy, and the \nSpecial Court for Sierra Leone recently convicted Charles Taylor for \nwar crimes and crimes against humanity, the actions and policies of \nformer Liberian President Charles Taylor and other persons, in \nparticular their unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and their \nremoval from Liberia and secreting of Liberian funds and property, \ncould still challenge Liberia's efforts to strengthen its democracy and \nthe orderly development of its political, administrative, and economic \ninstitutions and resources.
