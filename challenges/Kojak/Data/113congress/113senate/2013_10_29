Mr. President, today the Senate will proceed to consider \nthe motion to proceed to a resolution of disapproval filed by the \nRepublican leader, which would cause the country to default on its \ndebts for the first time in its history. The Democrats will oppose this \nmotion and vote to preserve the full faith and credit of our great \ncountry. I remind my Republican friends that every Democrat and 27 \nRepublicans in the Senate, as well as 285 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, already voted to do the right thing and pay the \nNation's debts.\n  I look forward to quickly dispensing with this Republican resolution, \nwhich would risk America's economic security, as well as a global \ndepression. This vote will take place this afternoon, after our weekly \nbusiness meetings.\n  I want to spend a little bit of time talking about nominations. \nDirectly after the vote on the default legislation, we will have the \nvote to break a filibuster of President Obama's nomination of Richard \nGriffin to serve as general counsel of the National Labor Relations \nBoard.\n  There have already been 67 of President Obama's nominations \nfilibustered. Let's just vote on these nominations. I cannot imagine \nwhy it would be a good thing for this country, or the Senate, to not \nallow us to go forward on the nomination. If you don't like him, vote \nagainst him, but don't stop the debate from going forward.\n  If cloture is invoked, there will be up to 8 hours of debate under \nthe new rules we have established in the Senate. We will have 4 hours \nand the minority will have 4 hours. So I think that would be \nappropriate.\n  Few Americans are aware of the job that the National Labor Relations\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\nBoard does. It looks out for the rights of millions of U.S. workers \nevery day--Democratic workers, Republican workers, independents, tea \nparty workers--regardless of whether they are in a union.\n  Mr. Griffin has extensive experience in employment law. He is highly \nrespected by his fellow labor lawyers on both the union and the \nbusiness sides. As general counsel for the NLRB, he will safeguard fair \ncompensation and working conditions for all American workers.\n  This week the Senate will also vote on a number of other crucial \nexecutive nominations, some of which have been stalled for more than a \nyear. The Senate will consider the nomination of Katherine Archuleta to \nserve as Director of the Office of Personnel Management. That is an \nextremely important position. She started her career in public service \nas an elementary school teacher. She will be the agency's first \nHispanic director. Her desire to serve is earnest. This is what she \nsaid:\n\n       You do it [as a public service] because you have a deep \n     passion for public good, for civic engagement.\n\n  She has worked in both the Transportation and Energy Departments \nunder President Clinton. She served as chief of staff to Labor \nSecretary Hilda Solis for 3 years. She is eminently qualified. Yet Ms. \nArchuleta is the first OPM Director to be filibustered in the entire \nhistory of this agency.\n  This week the Senate will also consider the stalled nomination of \nAlan Estevez to be Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense. This \nman's nomination has been stalled for 402 days. He will be responsible \nfor a $170 billion logistics budget--$170 billion. That is a year. This \nbudget supports our men and women in uniform as well as millions of \nmachines that take them where they want to go. He specialized in \nmilitary logistics for more than 10 years. It is unfortunate that \nRepublicans will hold up confirmation of such a crucial Defense \nDepartment nomination.\n  I am told most of it is that it is held up for an unrelated matter, \ndealing with some other issue. It is just wrong. If you do not like \nthis guy, stand and say why you don't like him and vote against him. \nDon't stop us from moving forward on the nomination.\n  Most of the opposition to this man, who has been held up for 200 \ndays, is, I am told, by the senior Senator from Texas.\n  The junior Senator from Texas has placed a hold on another \nnomination, a man by the name of Tom Wheeler to be Democratic member of \nthe Federal Communications Commission, FCC, a very important agency. In \naddition to writing two books, Mr. Wheeler has founded several \ntechnological companies--important companies. He cofound the largest \nonline targeted news service and helped develop the U.S. Government's \ntelecommunications policy.\n  President Obama nominated Tom Wheeler as well as Republican Michael \nO'Rielly to fill two vacant seats on the FCC; so what is stopping us \nfrom filling these vacancies with a bipartisan pair of nominees? Listen \nto this. The Senator from Texas has stalled the nomination because he \nopposes legislation proposed by Democrats in Congress that would \nrequire shadowy groups that spend millions on political advertising to \ndisclose their donors.\n  This next one is really a doozy: the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. \nIt is an extremely important job. This man is qualified. He has run the \nOffice of Management and Budget. He has been the President's Chief of \nStaff. He is now Secretary of the Treasury. What a fine, fine man--Jack \nLew. Jack Lew, even though he is the Secretary of the Treasury of this \ngreat country, cannot go to meetings that other finance ministers from \naround the world can go to. Why? Because Republicans are holding up his \nnominations to all these important bank boards, finance boards, the \nInternational Monetary Fund. He is supposed to be there. He cannot go.\n  He is a talented and dedicated public servant. He has already been \napproved by the Senate, confirmed by the Senate. Every Treasury \nSecretary serves as the U.S. representative on the international bank \nboards and offers input on America's position on global financial \nmatters. That is his job. He cannot do that because of what I have just \nsaid. It is an embarrassment that we have not acted more swiftly to \nconfirm him in this role. To think that we have to file cloture on \nthis. Yet the junior Senator from Kentucky has subjected this \nnomination to partisan wrangling--and others have joined with him, I \nassume--as he threatens to do with the nomination of Janet Yellen to \nserve as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n  The Presiding Officer and others who serve in this body and have \nserved in the House of Representatives have served with a fine public \nservant by the name of Mel Watt. I got to know Mel Watt when he was \nchairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. He would come over and \nvisit with me every month or so--a fine man. He has represented North \nCarolina's 12th Congressional District since 1993, and as senior Member \nof the House Financial Services Committee he understands the mistakes \nthat led to the housing crisis.\n  He also has proposed legislation to crack down on the worst abuses in \nmortgage lending and helped to pass the Dodd-Frank bill to prevent \npredatory lending. By any measure Congressman Watt is qualified to help \nstruggling homeowners recover from the worst downturn in generations. \nMy Republican colleagues should give him the up-or-down vote he \ndeserves, not filibuster him.\n  I know some Republicans do not like Dodd-Frank. Obviously, they \ndidn't mind the abuses that took place that led to the crashing of Wall \nStreet. But he should not be punished for that.\n  At a time when America faces difficult economic times at home and \nvarious threats abroad, it is crucial the Senate confirm these talented \nand dedicated individuals to serve in the executive branch of \ngovernment. Let us vote on these nominations. These normally easily \nconfirmable positions should not have a filibuster. Not long ago I can \nremember Republicans who, in this body, were concerned because they \ncould not get the votes they wanted on their nominees for President \nBush. They spread on this record, clearly, that it is a right of the \nPresident to choose the players on his team. We should return to that \ncustom, remove partisanship from the confirmation process and ensure \nhighly qualified nominees receive the fair and speedy confirmation they \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7584-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I think at this point Senators from \nboth parties can agree that healthcare.gov is a rolling disaster. Every \nday seems to bring more near-comic calamities. We hear about visitors \nbeing told things like their wife is really their daughter or that they \nhave multiple spouses or that they are unable to apply ``due to current \nincarceration.''\n  Unsurprisingly, just 12 percent of Americans think the rollout has \ngone well. That is less than the 14 percent of Americans who believe in \nBigfoot. Those who have succeeded in actually enrolling in a plan are \nvastly outnumbered by those who have lost their plan. The real tragedy \nis that many who have succeeded are finding out the product is actually \nworse than the Web site.\n  The only thing the Web site seems to be good at right now is creating \npunchlines for late-night comedians. It is almost as though Americans \nare being forced to live through a real-life ``Saturday Night Live'' \nsketch. If you caught last week's opener, it is getting harder to tell \nthe ObamaCare headlines from the ObamaCare punchlines these days.\n  Paper applications, 800 numbers, applying by fax--ObamaCare appears \nto be leading us boldly into the 1980s. Remember, before this thing \nlaunched, the administration swore up and down that ObamaCare was ready \nto go. Democratic leaders in Congress told Americans that the law's \nimplementation was fabulous and that ObamaCare was wonderful. The \nPresident reassured everyone it was working the way it was supposed to, \nand of course Washington Democrats bragged about their fancy new Web \nsite, the Web site that cost taxpayers--$100 million? $200 million? \n$300 million? No one is quite sure. That is just one of the unanswered \nquestions we hope they will clarify soon.\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\n  To be fair, the President likes to say that ObamaCare is about more \nthan just a Web site. He is absolutely right, and that is why fixing a \nWeb site will not solve the larger problem. The larger problem is \nObamaCare itself. The larger problem is what the few people who \nactually have signed up for coverage have discovered about this law. \nThe larger problem is how ObamaCare is hurting people out there.\n  It is about college graduates and middle-class families getting hit \nwith massive premium increases they cannot afford. It is about workers \nseeing their hours cut and their paychecks shrink because of this law. \nIt is about millions of Americans who will lose their current health \ncoverage because of ObamaCare, despite the President's promises.\n  According to news reports, the Obama administration knew for at least \n3 years that millions of Americans would not be able to keep their \nhealth care coverage. The President's press secretary basically \nadmitted yesterday that Americans would lose coverage too. Remember, \nthis is the same President who said:\n\n       If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep \n     your health care plan, period . . . No one will take it away, \n     no matter what.\n\n  This is just one of the many reasons Americans feel betrayed. One \nwoman who was quoted in the Los Angeles Times put it this way:\n\n       All we have been hearing for the last 3 years is if you \n     like your policy, you can keep it . . . [well] I'm infuriated \n     because I was lied to.\n\n  Here is how one North Carolinian put it to NBC News:\n\n       Everybody's worried about whether the website works or not, \n     but that's fixable. That's just the tip of the iceberg. This \n     stuff isn't fixable.\n\n  That was after he lost a $228-a-month plan and was faced with a \nchoice of taking a comparable plan for $1,208 or the best option he \ncould find on the exchanges, one for $948 a month.\n  After looking at all of that, he said: ``I'm sitting here looking at \nthis, thinking we ought to pay the fine and get insurance when we're \nsick.''\n  Americans up and down the country are beginning to experience the \ncost of ObamaCare firsthand, and they are realizing they are the ones \nstuck with the bill. It is not fair, it is not right, and Republicans \nare going to keep fighting to get our constituents relief from this \npartisan law.\n  Of course, the most logical course would be to stop this train wreck \nand start over, but Washington Democrats still appear more interested \nin protecting the President's namesake and legacy than protecting their \nconstituents from this law. I hope that will change because we cannot \nmove forward without Democrats.\n  We have seen some signs that at least some Democrats are coming \naround slowly--slowly--much more slowly than we would like. I am happy \nto engage in discussions to see where we might find common ground. \nHopefully, we will eventually get to the increasingly obvious endgame: \nRepeal, followed by true bipartisan health care reform. It may be \nuniversally accepted that healthcare.gov is a disaster, but as the \nPresident reminds us, that disaster does not exist in a vacuum. The \nfailure of the ObamaCare Web site is emblematic of the larger failure \nof ObamaCare itself and of the kind of problems we can expect if \nWashington Democrats continue their stubborn defense of this partisan \nlaw.\n\n\n                         Fiscal Responsibility\n\n  Politicians regularly come to Washington promising fiscal \nresponsibility, but too often they can't agree to cut spending when it \ncounts, and that is why the Budget Control Act is such a big deal. \nSince Congress passed the BCA with overwhelming bipartisan majorities \nin 2011, Washington has actually reduced the level of government \nspending for 2 years running. That is the first time this has happened \nsince the Korean war.\n  The BCA savings are such a big deal, in fact, that the President \ncampaigned on it endlessly in 2012. He bragged about the bipartisan \ncuts in Colorado and in Iowa. He trumpeted the reductions from coast to \ncoast, telling audiences from California to Baltimore that he ``signed \n$2 trillion of spending cuts into law.''\n  As our Democratic friends like to say these days, elections matter, \nand the President explicitly staked his reelection on the back of these \nbipartisan spending cuts.\n  Look at the exit polls from November. A majority of Americans said \nthe government was doing too much. About two-thirds said raising taxes \nto cut the deficit was a nonstarter. Compared to ObamaCare, which more \nvoters said they wanted to repeal, these levels of support are \nstriking.\n  If our friends on the other side want to keep trying to claim an \nelectoral mandate for retaining ObamaCare--contradicted by the facts as \nthat might be--using their own logic, we would then have to call the \nmandate for reducing the size of government a supermandate. That is why \ntheir new plan to undo the cuts the President campaigned on and \nincrease the debt is so outrageous.\n  We hear that the senior Senator from New York will soon announce a \nproposal to give the President permanent power to borrow more; in other \nwords, he wants to extend the debt ceiling permanently by going around \nCongress. Let me repeat that. The so-called Schumer-Obama plan is a \nplan to permanently hand the President a credit card without spending \nlimits and without lifting a finger to address the national debt. It is \ntruly outrageous, especially when we consider that our debt is now $17 \ntrillion, which makes us look a lot like a European country. We have to \nget our debt under control before we move any further down the road to \nGreece or Spain, and time is not on our side.\n  I hear the Senator from New York is going to try and sell his \nproposal as a ``McConnell'' plan. I appreciate the attempt at a PR \ngimmick, but there are two huge differences between the Schumer-Obama \nplan and what I have proposed in the past.\n  First, Schumer-Obama would raise the debt ceiling permanently. I \nreject that idea entirely. Second, unlike Schumer-Obama, I believe that \nincreases in the debt ceiling should be accompanied by reforms. That is \nwhat we did in 2011 when Congress raised the debt ceiling in return for \nenacting $2 trillion in bipartisan spending control--the spending \ncontrol the President endlessly campaigned on last year. That is the \nreal ``McConnell'' plan.\n  If the Senator from New York is interested in working with me to \nenact another $2 trillion in bipartisan cuts, then let's get down to \nbrass tacks. The American people would love to see us working in a \nbipartisan way to actually help them. If he insists on pushing the \nSchumer-Obama plan, he is not going to find any dance partners on this \nside of the aisle. Handing the President a permanent blank check, \nincreasing the size of government, and trying to overturn the most \nsignificant bipartisan accomplishment of the Obama years is a \nnonstarter.\n  Our debt is a serious problem. I know Kentuckians think so. Similar \nto Americans all across the country, they understand it is completely \nunsustainable over the long run, and they understand it is standing in \nthe way of jobs and economic growth today.\n  Let's shelve the gimmicks and the blank checks and get to work on \nbipartisan plans to get spending under control. That is what our \nconstituents expect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7585-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7585-S7595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DISAPPROVAL OF THE PRESIDENT'S EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY TO SUSPEND THE \n                     DEBT LIMIT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

As a result, the White House had to \nannounce last night that the key enforcement mechanism to their \nindividual mandate--a $95 fine that increases every year--will be \nwaived until the end of March of next year. That may be fine for those \ncurrently without insurance, but for the millions being forced into the \nexchanges and losing their current insurance, there is no relief, just \nhigher prices, a likely lapse in insurance coverage, a broken Web site, \nand broken promises.\n  We already know of 1.5 million Americans who are losing their \npolicies because starting January 1, many insurance policies they now \nhave will not be legal under ObamaCare, and because the exchange will \nnot be working, they will not be able to choose another policy. This \nchart gives an example of what is going on. Just in three States--\nCalifornia, Florida, and New Jersey--there are 1.4 million insurance \npolicies that will not be valid after January 1 because they are not \nlegal under ObamaCare.\n  Compare that number, 1.4 million, to the number of Americans in those \nthree States who have reportedly applied or enrolled on the Web site \nfor insurance, 7 or 8 percent of all the people who will lose their \ncurrent policy have applied for a different policy through the \nexchange. That is what is going on with families across this country as \npeople worry about health care.\n  These are policies in the individual market. There are 19 million \nAmericans in the individual market. We also heard on NBC News over the \nlast couple of days that the Obama administration knew that 47 to 60 \npercent of the policies in the individual market would not be legally \noffered under ObamaCare. Yet they still said to people: ``If you like \nyour insurance, you can keep it.''\n  At some point there has to be accountability. Expecting this \nSecretary to be able to fix what she has not been able to fix during \nthe last 3\\1/2\\ years is unrealistic. It is throwing good money after \nbad. It is time for her to resign and for someone else to take charge. \nNo private sector chief executive would escape accountability after \nsuch a poor performance. The principle of accountability is not and \nshould not be foreign to the public sector.\n\n  Admiral Hyman Rickover, father of the nuclear navy, told his \nsubmarine captains they were not only accountable for their ships, they \nwere also accountable for the nuclear reactors on their ships. If \nanything went wrong with the reactor, their career in the Navy was \nover, the Admiral said. As a result of that dose of accountability, \nsince the 1950s, there has never been a death as a result of a problem \nwith a nuclear naval submarine reactor.\n  Americans deserve that kind of accountability in the implementation \nof the new health care law. Instead, the Secretary appears not even to \nhave told the President about known problems with the ObamaCare Web \nsite in the months and days leading up to the launch. Despite repeated \nrequests, she has refused to tell Congress or the public the reasons \nthe ObamaCare Web site continues to fail, while insisting on more time \nand an undisclosed amount of money to fix it.\n  Before the Internet, RCA knew how many records Elvis was selling \nevery day, Ford knew how many cars they were selling every day, and \nMcDonald's could tell us how many hamburgers they were selling each \nday. Yet, here we are in the advanced stages of the Internet age and, \nunder Secretary Sebelius's leadership, the Obama administration will \nnot tell us how many Americans have tried to sign up for ObamaCare, or \nhow many have actually signed up, or what level of insurance they have \npurchased, or in what ZIP Code they live. Not only will they not tell \nus, they have done their best to keep us from finding out.\n  With WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden spilling our beans every day, what \nis happening on the ObamaCare exchanges is the best kept secret left in \nWashington, DC. The National Security Agency could learn some lessons \nfrom Secretary Sebelius.\n  Later today I will ask unanimous consent to approve a six-page bill I \nintroduced yesterday to require the administration to answer these \nquestions every week. Secretary Sebelius is not responsible for \nenacting ObamaCare, but she has been responsible for 3\\1/2\\ years for \nimplementing it. Now many Americans have only a few weeks to purchase \nnew insurance or be without health insurance. To expect the Secretary \nto correct in a few weeks what she has not been able to do in 3\\1/2\\ \nyears is unrealistic.\n  It is time for the President to ask the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to resign.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, during the debt limit impasse in 2006, \nthen-Senator Obama stated:\n\n       The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's \n     debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. Leadership means \n     the buck stops here. Instead, Washington is shifting the \n     burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children \n     and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure \n     of leadership, and Americans deserve better.\n\n  That was former Senator Barack Obama.\n  At that time our gross debt was $8.3 trillion. It is now well above \ntwice that, currently standing at $17.1 trillion, which is over 100 \npercent of the size of our economy.\n  During that same 2006 debt limit debate, then-Senator Biden said:\n\n       My vote against the debt limit increase cannot change the \n     fact that we have incurred this debt already and will no \n     doubt incur more. It is a statement that I refuse to be \n     associated with the policies that brought us to this point.\n\n  That was then-Senator Biden. Things have certainly changed since \n2006.\n  Now President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden preside over an \nadministration which tells us that raising the debt limit is merely a \nmatter of paying our bills and is a reflection of decisions made in \nCongress. Yet while it is ostensibly true that the Congress has the \npower to raise the debt limit, it is not true that Congress makes \nspending decisions unilaterally, with no role being played by the \nexecutive branch. No amount of spending can be enacted without the \nPresident signing it into law.\n  In addition, the President submits a budget every year. The White \nHouse also issues policy statements and veto threats on spending bills \non a more or less frequent basis. And, of course, every administration \nworks with Congress to enact its domestic agenda which inherently \nincludes setting priorities on Federal spending. So, in short, the \ncommonly repeated notion that questions surrounding spending and the \ndebt limit are Congress's and Congress's alone to answer is simply an \nattempt by this administration to avoid accountability on these issues.\n  Ultimately, regardless of what President Obama and those in his \nadministration are saying now, both Congress and the executive branch \nare to blame for our current predicament.\n  The President has exercised his authority to suspend the debt limit \nunder the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2014, which he signed into \nlaw on October 17. On October 16, public debt subject to the limit was \naround $16.7 trillion. On October 17--the very next day--public debt \nsubject to the limit was over $17 trillion. In one day, Treasury \nincreased the debt subject to the limit by over $328 billion. Let me \nrepeat that. The debt increased by over $328 billion in a single day. \nThat brings the increase in total public debt under this administration \nto more than $6.4 trillion, an amount that is, by all accounts, \nunprecedented.\n\n[[Page S7587]]\n\n  Echoing earlier sentiments of then-Senator Biden, I refuse to be \nassociated with the policies that brought us to this point.\n  The debt limit debate provides us with an opportunity to reexamine \nour Nation's fiscal course and take steps to correct it. Sadly, we have \na President who appears unwilling to have that conversation. Instead, \nhe apparently wants to press forward, full steam ahead, on our already \nunsustainable course, saddling future generations with unheard-of debts \nand broken entitlement promises in the process. Unfortunately, as the \nCongressional Budget Office has made clear, over the course of \nPresident Obama's administration, the Federal Government has recorded \nthe largest budget deficits relative to the size of the economy since \n1946, causing our debt to soar, as we all know. Federal debt as a \npercent of the economy's annual output is higher than at any point in \nU.S. history, except for a brief period around World War II.\n  CBO makes three other points equally clear. No. 1, our debt path is \nunsustainable, threatening our economy and putting us at risk of a \nfiscal crisis. No. 2, the root of our fiscal problem is Federal \nspending, not a lack of revenue. No. 3, the main source of our spending \nproblem is our unsustainable entitlement programs. That being the case, \nany serious talk about raising the debt limit must include a real, \nconcrete discussion about entitlement reform.\n  As every credible analyst tells us, we need to face the fiscal facts \nand enact serious structural reforms to our entitlement programs. So \nfar, President Obama has been unwilling to even engage in this \ndiscussion. These days, every fiscal discussion with the White House \nbegins and ends with demands for additional tax hikes to fuel even more \nspending. I guarantee it will be spending, not paying down the national \ndebt or paying down what we owe; it will be to spend more.\n  Of course, the President will occasionally resurrect offers he has \nmade in past failed fiscal negotiations to include small entitlement \nchanges, including, for example, movement to a different price index \nfor certain cost-of-living adjustments, but at the same time the \nPresident and his administration have made clear that even those small \nentitlement changes will only be on the table if tax hikes are \ndelivered first. That is the President's precondition for even \nentertaining tax reform or entitlement reform, even on the heels of a \nmore than $630 billion tax hike at the beginning of this year and \nanother $1 trillion in revenue delivered courtesy of ObamaCare.\n  Entitlement reform is not an option, it is a necessity.\n  Structural reforms to our health care entitlements should not hinge \non another tax-and-spend operation. And structural reforms to Social \nSecurity should not be held hostage to another tax hike.\n  Earlier this year I personally presented to the President, in detail \nand in writing--again, I emphasize I personally gave him this--five \nreform proposals relating to Medicare and Medicaid that have received \nbipartisan support--Democratic and Republican support--in the past. I \nasked him to consider the proposals and have since asked members of his \nadministration to likewise give the proposals consideration.\n  By the way, when we had our supper at the White House in the family \ndining room, I brought it up again. By the way, I brought it up with \nthe Secretary of the Treasury over and over. I did not wait until an \nimpending debt limit debate. Rather, I put my proposals forward in a \ngood-faith effort to begin timely discussions. Unfortunately, thus far, \nI have not received even the slightest response, while the clock on \nMedicare and Medicaid keeps ticking, and both of them are running more \nand more deficits as we speak. By the way, the five points were \nbipartisan. They were bipartisan measures that both Democrats and \nRepublicans supported.\n  The situation with Social Security isn't much better. The trustees of \nthe trust funds embedded in the Social Security system, including top \nadministration officials such as the Treasury Secretary, have, in no \nuncertain terms, urged Congress to act quickly on reforming the \nretirement and the disability insurance programs to move them toward \nsustainability. Quite simply, it would be folly to approve of yet \nanother debt limit increase without also working to address these \nprograms, which are the main drivers of our debts and deficits.\n  Therefore, I disapprove of the President's exercise of an authority \nto suspend the debt limit, and I urge all of my colleagues to similarly \ndisapprove.\n  The recent debt limit impasse and the impasse of 2011 also provided a \ngood deal of information about lack of accountability of the Treasury \nDepartment and of our regulatory agencies.\n  I currently serve as the ranking member on the Senate Finance \nCommittee which has oversight responsibility toward the Treasury \nDepartment. To fulfill those responsibilities, I have been asking \nquestions of Treasury about debt and cash management procedures, and I \nhave repeatedly been stonewalled by the Treasury Department. I don't \nknow that I have ever seen this happen before in either Republican or \nDemocratic administrations.\n  For example, when we have approached the debt limit, I have asked \nquestions about how much cash our Nation has in the till, only to find \nthat Treasury won't tell me and that they prefer the Congress rely on \nestimates from think tanks and Wall Street firms.\n  Furthermore, during the most recent debt limit impasses, \nadministration officials were busy frightening seniors, our troops, and \nfinancial market participants about whether they would be paid in the \nevent the Treasury were to run out of cash. Officials also identified \nthreats of massive financial instability stemming from a breach of the \ndebt limit and of potential disruption from a downgrade of the rating \non U.S. Government securities.\n  So, naturally, I asked Treasury and, in fact, every voting member of \nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, to provide Congress \nand the American people information regarding the plans they had in \nplace to respond to such catastrophes. Out of close to 20 letters I \nsent to FSOC members, I received only 3 responses. Apparently, the \nFSOC, which was empowered by the so-called Dodd-Frank Act to monitor \nand respond to merging threats to financial stability, does not \nidentify or share response plans with respect to any threat that could \nemerge as a result of government policies.\n  That being the case, I believe we should strip FSOC of any notional \noversight of financial stability and call it what it really is: another \nunrestrained regulatory agency created only to enact additional \nregulations.\n  After the fact, we have found that Treasury and some financial \nregulators had plans for how to respond to a debt limit breach or a \nratings downgrade. Yet none of these plans were shared with Congress.\n  Put simply, if we are going to empower a Federal regulatory body such \nas the FSOC to develop contingency plans to respond to threats to \nfinancial stability, then that body should be required to share those \nplans with the American people. Sadly, thus far that has not been the \ncase.\n  Another thing I have learned from our recent debt limit impasses is \nthat we need to take a closer look at the Treasury Department's use of \nso-called extraordinary measures, which have become all too ordinary. \nThese ``extraordinary measures'' are merely ways for the Treasury \nDepartment to temporarily delay facing a debt limit increase by issuing \nshadow debt. For example, Treasury can simply declare a debt issuance \nsuspension period and stop issuing debt that it normally would issue \nwhile instead effectively telling the lender: Don't worry, I will pay \nyou back later with interest. I believe the authority to use these \ntypes of extraordinary measures needs to be reexamined.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, there are a number of problems that \nneed to be confronted with regard to our Nation's ever-growing debt. As \nI said, we need to work together to address our Nation's unsustainable \nentitlement programs; otherwise, any effort to rein in our debts and \ndeficits will amount to little more than tinkering around the edges.\n  In addition, we need to improve information sharing between Congress \nand the executive branch on issues relating to our debt. The Treasury \nDepartment and our financial regulators\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\nhave a lot to do with maintaining the depth, liquidity, and efficiency \nof the market for Treasury securities, and Congress has a duty to \nexercise oversight over these functions. Unfortunately, the \nadministration, far more often than not, opts to keep Congress in the \ndark on these issues. And, the Treasury and financial regulators choose \nto keep their plans secret. This has to stop.\n  By using his authority to suspend the debt limit through February 7, \n2014, President Obama has opted not to confront any of these serious \nissues. Instead, he is leading us even further down a path that we \nalready know is unsustainable. That being the case, I plan to vote in \nfavor of the resolution of disapproval of this debt limit suspension, \nand I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Having said all this, we are in a really big mess on ObamaCare--or if \nyou want to call it the ``Affordable Care Act'' that nobody believes is \naffordable at all. They know it is going to lead us right into even \nmore unsustainability than we have right now. I suspect that over time \nour brilliant people in the IT world, the information technology world, \nmany of whom I know personally, will find some way to resolve what \nreally has been a horrible, horrible situation with the broken \nintroduction of the ObamaCare website. We all know it is horrible, and \nI hope they can resolve that. I think it is going to be hard because it \nis such a mess. I hope Mr. Zients is successful in his efforts to try \nto cure the broken system, but that does not cure the faults or \nproblems with ObamaCare as a whole.\n  What about the 30-hour rule? A lot of people, a lot of businesses, \nespecially small businesses today, are making sure their employees do \nnot work more than 30 hours because if they do, it triggers their \nhaving to pay what appear to many to be outrageous health care costs. \nThat is just one thing, and that is not going to be easily resolved \nbecause the bill is such a stupid bill. It was stupid to begin with. We \nknew it would not work to begin with. We made the case that it would \nnot work, and frankly we are here in this really ridiculous posture \nwhere we have been stymied because of an ineptly implemented \nintroduction of a flawed law, and there is certainly some incompetency \nhere. I hope they can resolve that, but that still does not resolve the \n30-hour rule, which is very important.\n  How about the 50-employee rule? A lot of businesses that would have \nexpanded, small businesses that would have grown, that would have \ntested the market and really gotten going, do not want to employ more \nthan 49 people and trigger a massive sudden cost to their businesses.\n  These are problems that basically are unsolvable under the bill, and \nthey may be even larger problems than those we have with regard to the \nwebsite problems I have been mentioning.\n  ObamaCare is full of cliffs: to implicit tax rates; to hours of work; \nto numbers of employees. And those cliffs have led and will lead to \nmore economic damage.\n  That is just the beginning. I could speak for hours about what is \nwrong with this lousy Act called ObamaCare. I wish some of my \ncolleagues on the other side would start saying what they actually \nknow. They know it is a lousy Act. They know it is something that is \nnot going to work. And if it does--if they continue to maintain that it \nhas to work--it is going to be a massive cost to society, with less \neffective health care than we have ever had before.\n  It is not just these technical problems that we have to solve; it is \nthe economic problems that arise from ObamaCare. And I know what is \ngoing to happen. Within the next year or two, our friends on the other \nside--or should I say the White House in particular--President Obama is \ngoing to throw his hands in the air and say: It is not working. We have \nto go to a single-payer system, meaning socialized medicine. Anybody \nwho believes that is the way to go--it sounds easy, but anybody who \nbelieves that is the way to go has not looked at socialized medicine \naround the world. They can point to some instances where it has worked \nfor a short time, but over time it results in less health care, higher \ncosts, and stultification of what really could be a great health care \nsystem.\n  I want to solve these problems in health care, but I believe they \nought to be solved on a bipartisan basis and not just a partisan basis, \nwhich is where we are with regard to ObamaCare--or should I say the \n``Affordable Care Act.''\n  There are a number of people in this body and in the other body who, \nlike me, have worked in health care areas and on health care issues \never since they have been in the Congress who would be willing to sit \ndown and get this resolved. But I have to say there was no real \nconsultation, there was no real effort to work in a bipartisan way, as \nfar as I could see, even at the lower levels in Congress, in developing \nthe partisan product called ObamaCare. It was just they were going to \npass this and that is the way it will be. Now they are stuck with it--\nshould I say they are not really the ones who are stuck with it; it is \nthe American people and the American taxpayers who are stuck with it. \nWe have to, sooner or later, get together to resolve this problem \nwithout going to socialized medicine.\n  I have talked to a number of doctors, health care providers, who are \ngoing to get out of the profession. They do not want to be governed by \nthis type of governance. Frankly, you are going to find that if we go \nto socialized medicine, doctors are not going to work more than 6 or 8 \nhours a day, where today they will work as long as it takes to serve \npeople who need their help. We are going to find a real dearth of \ndoctors. We are going to find a real dearth of the ability to provide \nthe health care people need. We are going to start doing what that \npayment advisory board really is set up for, and that is rationing. \nOnce that starts, the American people are going to rebel.\n  It is going to happen sooner or later if we do not get our friends on \nthe other side to at least work with us on finding some resolution. I \nhave to say that we are working on our side to come up with a \nresolution, and I hope I can interest our colleagues on the other side. \nI admit that we can do a lot better than we are doing around here. We \ncan do it in a much better bipartisan way than we are doing it. I think \nsome people get a joy out of creating battles around here when we \nshould get a joy out of resolving problems.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah and \nappreciate his very eloquent remarks. He has been a great leader on \nhealth care issues for a lot of years around here and was a fierce \nopponent of ObamaCare when it passed and laid out very compelling \narguments at the time about why we should not adopt this law. \nUnfortunately, for the people of this country, many of the predictions \nhe made are coming out to be true. I appreciate the leadership he \nprovides for us as a member of the Finance Committee and his continued \nadvocacy for policies that are good for consumers in this country when \nit comes to the issue of health care.\n  This Friday marks a full month since healthcare.gov went live. This \nis the Web site that, in conjunction with the new health care law, was \npromised as a solution to all of the problems in the delivery and cost \nof health care in this country.\n  To be frank, I do not think anybody on either side of the political \naisle would deny this fact: These past 29 days have been nothing short \nof a disaster. The administration will not disclose how many Americans \nwere actually able to enroll in plans. They are not forthcoming when it \ncomes to disclosing exactly what the problem is with the Web site, \nother than calling the problems glitches. Well, glitches refer to \ntemporary problems that are easily remedied. The problems with the \nhealth care law cannot merely be called glitches. The problems go \ndeeper than technical problems on a Web site which, by the way, cost \n$400 million to develop.\n  As the President said last week, ObamaCare `` . . . is not just a \nwebsite. It's much more.'' Well, that is true. It is much more. It is a \nfundamentally flawed piece of legislation that is resulting in real-\nlife consequences for middle-class Americans.\n  My colleagues and I, the Senator from Utah and others, have been \nspeaking about the broken promises of this\n\n[[Page S7589]]\n\nlegislation since it came to the floor of the Senate almost 4 years \nago. We know this law will not work as promised. Unfortunately, \nthousands of Americans are realizing it too as they face higher costs \nand canceled insurance plans.\n  Many Americans are experiencing sticker shock when it comes to their \nhealth care costs. Middle-class Americans already struggling to make \nends meet are now facing steep premium increases in the ObamaCare \nexchanges.\n  Last month, Avik Roy of Forbes reported on a recent study that said:\n\n       ObamaCare will increase insurance rates for younger men by \n     an average of 97 to 99% and for younger women by an average \n     of 55 to 62%.\n\n  In my home State of South Dakota, that is more than just a statistic; \nthat is a grim reality facing thousands of young men and women.\n  By comparing a typical low-cost plan for a healthy 30-year-old person \nin my State of South Dakota this year with a bronze plan that they \nwould be able to get in South Dakota's health care exchange next year, \nthe premium increases are nothing short of staggering. Younger women \nare going to face a 223-percent premium increase and younger men are \ngoing to face a 393-percent premium increase when you compare data from \nHHS with data from GAO about premiums in South Dakota in January of \nthis year. That is more than a $1,500 annual increase for women and a \n$2,000 increase in health care premiums each year for 30-year-old men \nin my State of South Dakota.\n  But it is not just South Dakota. It is not confined to South Dakota \nalone, and people in my State are not alone in their experience of \nsticker shock. Look at what is happening in the State of Nebraska where \npremium increases are 143 percent or in Georgia where premium increases \nare 198 percent. Money that could be used to pay off student loans, \nsave for a home, or start a family is now going to be used to pay for \nObamaCare.\n  According to a new analysis by Avalere Health, Americans could face \nsteep cost-sharing requirements--such as copayments, co-insurance, and \ndeductibles--layered on top of their monthly premiums.\n  It is clear that health care costs are going up--they are not going \ndown--particularly for younger Americans.\n  Additionally, President Obama promised that health care premiums \nwould go down by an average of $2,500 per family. Well, if you look at \nwhat family premiums have done, they have actually jumped by more than \n$2,500 since ObamaCare became law.\n  While costs continue to increase despite the President's promises to \nthe contrary, household income has fallen by over $3,700 since \nPresident Obama first took office. No IT specialist can fix the problem \nof increased health care costs due to ObamaCare. The only fix is to \nrepeal this law and to start over.\n  In addition to higher costs, families are discovering other grim \nnews. For example, they cannot keep the plan they like, despite the \nfact that the President promised they would be able to. Over and over \nthe President told Americans they would be able to keep the insurance \nthey have.\n  Well, millions are now facing health insurance cancellation notices \ndue to ObamaCare. That number is expected to increase up to nearly 10 \nmillion by the end of this year. In fact, just this morning, CBS News \npublished a story. The headline read, ``More than 2 million people \ngetting booted from existing health insurance plans.'' These are \nAmericans who had coverage they liked and now cannot continue to \npurchase.\n  Finally, after dozens of media reports of Americans who are losing \nplans they like, the White House spokesman said, it is true that some \nAmericans will not be able to keep the health care plan that they like \nunder ObamaCare. Well, you do not have to tell people in this country, \nas Deborah from Westchester, CA, said in an article last week in the \nLos Angeles Times:\n\n       All we've been hearing the last three years is if you like \n     your policy you can keep it . . . I'm infuriated because I \n     was lied to.\n\n  CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield is being forced to cancel plans that \ncover 76,000 individuals in Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, DC, due \nto changes made by President Obama's health care law. That represents \nmore than 40 percent of the 177,000 individuals covered by CareFirst in \nthose States.\n  President Obama said on July 21, 2009: If you like your current plan, \nyou will be able to keep it. Let me repeat that. He said: If you like \nyour plan, you will be able to keep it. That is from 2009.\n  But he also went on to say, ``I won't sign a bill that somehow would \nmake it tougher for people to keep their health insurance.'' That is \nfrom another conference he had with bloggers back in 2009. It is \nabundantly clear that this is not a simple misstatement or a glitch in \nthe law, it is another broken promise that reveals serious underlying \nproblems with the core principles of this law.\n  No IT specialist can fix the problem of canceled plans due to \nObamaCare. The only fix is to repeal this law and to start over. The \nPresident promised the people could keep a health care plan they liked. \nBut an NBC News article published yesterday shows that the \nadministration knew as early as 2010 that this was not going to be the \ncase.\n  NBC is reporting that 50 to 70 percent of the 14 million consumers \nwho buy their insurance individually--in the individual marketplace--\ncan expect to receive a cancellation letter or the equivalent over the \nnext year, because their existing policies do not meet the standards \nmandated by the new health care law. One expert predicts that number \ncould reach as high as 80 percent. All say that many of those forced to \nbuy pricier new policies will experience ``sticker shock.'' You do not \nhave to look any further than George Schwab, a 62-year-old man from \nNorth Carolina who said he was ``perfectly happy'' with the plan from \nBlue Cross Blue Shield, the plan he currently had, which also insured \nhis wife for a $228 monthly premium. But this past September he was \nsurprised to receive a letter saying his policy was no longer \navailable. The comparable plan the insurance company offered him \ncarried a $1,208 monthly premium and a $5,500 deductible. The best \noption he has found on the exchange so far offered a 415-percent jump \nin premiums, to $948 a month.\n\n       The deductible is less--\n\n  He said.\n\n       But the plan doesn't meet my needs. Its unaffordable. I am \n     sitting here looking at this, thinking we ought to just pay \n     the fine and just get insurance when we're sick.\n\n  That is what Schwab said.\n\n       Everybody's worried about whether the website works or not, \n     but that's fixable. That's just tip of the iceberg. This \n     stuff isn't fixable.\n\n  That is from Mr. Schwab of North Carolina. That is just one of many \nstories out there about how this law is affecting average Americans, so \nmuch so that now even Democrats have come out criticizing parts of the \nhealth care law. Most recently there were 10 Senate Democrats who asked \nthe administration to delay the deadline to sign up for ObamaCare \nbefore the tax on the individual mandate kicks in.\n  While I agree that Americans should not be expected to pay a fine for \nnot having a product they cannot even access, delaying implementation \ndoes not solve the underlying problem that this bill is simply bad \npolicy. It was a partisan bill. It was rushed through without adequate \nforethought in the implementation problems and the serious adverse \neffect it would have on Americans' daily lives.\n  Giving people more time to try to navigate a broken Web site with \nglitches is not going to fix this underlying fundamental flaw in this \nlaw. A majority of Americans, 56 percent, believe the Web site glitches \nare part of a broader problem with the health care law. ObamaCare is \nmore than a Web site. Its real-life consequences squarely hit middle-\nclass Americans.\n  Americans are facing sticker shock discovering they are being dropped \nfrom an insurance plan they like. As one woman said: I was all for \nObamaCare until I found out I was paying for it. That too was a story \nthat the LA Times ran over the weekend. ObamaCare is not ready for \nprime time. The President has got a new healthcare.gov czar, Jeffery \nZients, who has been tasked with coming in and trying to fix the Web \nsite by the end of November. But a fix to the Web site by the end of \nNovember does not rectify the underlying problems with this law. The \nproblems with this law\n\n[[Page S7590]]\n\nare more than just problems with a Web site. We need to continue to \nwork to repeal the onerous parts of this law and replace it with \nsolutions that actually lower the cost of health care and give \nAmericans continued access to a doctor they choose at a cost they can \nafford.\n  Republicans here at the time when this law was being debated and \npassed in the Senate several years ago and subsequent to that time have \nconsistently put forward solutions to the health care challenges that \nwe face in this country that do not entail having government take over \nliterally one-sixth of the American economy. As we can see from the \nrollout, the government does not do complicated things very well.\n  This is a disaster at the rollout, but it is a train wreck in terms \nof substance and what it is going to do and the harm it will cost \nmiddle-class Americans. There are so many better solutions. We should \nallow people to buy insurance across State lines, create \ninterstate competition, allow market forces to drive insurance costs \ndown, allow people and businesses to join groups so they can get the \nbenefit of group purchasing power, do away with the issue of defensive \nmedicine by getting rid of a lot of the junk lawsuits that are clogging \nup our legal system in this country, allowing people to have a tax \ncredit where they can buy their own insurance and use their judgment \nand allow for transparency when it comes to pricing and outcomes so \nthat the market in the competition that exists out there works in a way \nthat makes insurance rates come down for everybody and improves the \nquality of health care in this country.\n\n  There are so many good ideas out there that do not involve a \ngovernment takeover of health care and the results we have seen that \nhas caused. So I hope that not only will the American people who I \nthink are quickly coming to the conclusion that this is a bad law, it \nis a flawed policy to start with, but Members of Congress here in \nWashington, DC, Members of the Senate will also come to that conclusion \nand will decide it is time to not only delay this but to repeal it and \nstart over.\n  We need a do-over. The American people need a do-over. We need an \nopportunity to put policies in place that actually put downward \npressure on insurance rates in this country, rather than increasing \nthem, which is what we have seen with ObamaCare, dramatic increases for \nmany people across this country, loss of coverage that people like. \nThey were told by the President repeatedly, over and over the President \nwent out there and said: If you like the insurance you have, you can \nkeep it. We now know that is not true. We know that the administration \nknew that was not true.\n  So it is time we acknowledge we need a do-over. The American people \nneed a do-over. We need health care policies in this country that drive \ndown costs for people, for families, middle-class Americans, that \nimprove the quality of health care delivery in this country, and that \ndo not create costly harm to the economy.\n  We hear over and over that the mandates and the requirements and the \ncosts associated with ObamaCare are making it more difficult and more \nexpensive to create jobs in this country. We are seeing an economic \ngrowth rate that is sluggish, in the 1-percent to 2-percent range. We \nare seeing the lowest labor participation rate literally in the last 35 \nyears, since Jimmy Carter was the President of the United States, \nchronically high unemployment, lower take-home pay, an economy that is \nsuffering from too much cost and too many policies that actually make \nit more difficult and more expensive to create jobs.\n  We need to be looking at health care policies that improve coverage, \nlower costs, and make it less difficult and less costly to create jobs \nin this economy so we can get Americans back to work, we get our \neconomy growing and expanding at a more robust rate and improve the \nstandard of living and the quality of life for people all across this \ncountry.\n  This policy, the ObamaCare health care policy, was ill-fated, was \nmisguided from the beginning. Now we are seeing the effects and the \nresults of that. Hopefully, politicians in Washington, DC, on both \nsides of the aisle will come to the correct conclusion; that is, it is \ntime to start over and do this the right way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Superstorm Sandy\n\n  Mr. CARPER. As many of us recall, on October 29, 2012, Superstorm \nSandy made landfall in my part of the United States. Its impacts up and \ndown the east coast were devastating and heartbreaking. New York, New \nJersey, and parts of New England were hit particularly hard. In \nDelaware we did not experience the level of devastation that was \ninflicted on our neighbors to the north and to the east, but our State \ndid receive significant damage. In total there were over 200 deaths \nattributed to Superstorm Sandy. Today we remember the lives lost and \nthose forever impacted by this storm.\n  As I traveled through Delaware during and after the storm, I saw some \nof the massive impacts of that storm firsthand, but I saw something \nelse as well. I saw people from all walks of life pulling together, \nhelping one another, and taking care of their neighbors. The impacts of \nthat superstorm are still fresh in my mind today as we continue to \nrebuild in Delaware, New Jersey, in New York, and in other places up \nthe East Coast.\n  But not only are the impacts of the superstorm still fresh in my \nmind, something else is as well, and that is this: the extraordinary \nefforts of ordinary people who left the comfort of their own homes in \nDelaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and \nin other States as well to help people they had never met and will \nprobably never see again. They did so not because they were paid to do \nit, not because someone told them to do it, but because they wanted to \ndo it.\n  This morning I met a handful of Delawareans who were called to action \nby the Red Cross to volunteer in the shelters and communities in \nDelaware and New Jersey and New York. Those volunteers included \nCharlotte and Richard Duffy, Joe Miller, and Glenn Sholley, who are \njoining us today in the Senate, and we welcome them. In the days and \nweeks following Sandy, they stopped their lives to help others, and for \nthat we are truly grateful. I thank you all for your extraordinary \nservice.\n  As our rebuilding efforts continue, I am so thankful for the first \nresponders, for the volunteers, and for the Good Samaritans who pulled \ntogether not only in Delaware but in our States to the north to ensure \nthe safety and health of our neighbors.\n  A few minutes ago I told the folks who gathered in my office for some \nlight refreshments before we came over here--the same group that is \njoining us here today--that last night I had heard a speech from Paul \nBegala, who our Presiding Officer will remember was a key member of \nPresident Clinton's team during his Presidency. He was on television a \nmillion times and widely known for his wit. We saw another side of Paul \nBegala last night. We saw his wit as well, but we also heard from him a \nrecounting or retelling of the story of the Old Testament and of the \nquestion that was asked in the Bible. He asked the audience: Who asked \nthe first question? Nobody knew. He said, actually, the first question \nwas asked by Abel, who had slain his brother Cain. The Heavenly Father, \nof course, knew what had happened. He tracked down Abel and said: \nWhere's Cain? And Cain said: Am I my brother's keeper? Am I my \nbrother's keeper?\n  That story is retold in the Bible in a number of places as the Golden \nRule, to look out and help other people the way we would like to be \nhelped, treat other people the way we would want to be treated. Not \nonly does that show up in the Old and New Testaments, including in the \nparable of the Good Samaritan, but it shows up in the sacred scriptures \nwhether you happen to be Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist or Hindu. \nIt shows up in the scriptures of virtually every major religion on \nEarth--the idea that we have an obligation to\n\n[[Page S7591]]\n\nhelp our neighbors, whoever they may be.\n  In the parable in the New Testament, Jesus is asked by some of the \nPharisees: Who is my neighbor? And that is when he tells the story of \nthe Good Samaritan, who ultimately was helped not by someone from his \ncommunity, not by a clergyman who walked by, but he was helped by \nsomebody from another part of that country who didn't care at all for \nthe fellow who was beaten and left for dead.\n  The financial costs of Superstorm Sandy were also severe and \nestimated to be in not just the hundreds of millions of dollars but \nbillions of dollars. It will take years to recover from devastation \nsuch as this. As my colleagues and I know, it is important we get that \nrecovery right.\n  I want to take a look at a few pictures of Seaside Heights, NJ, \nbefore Sandy and after. Before I turn to the photographs on my left \nhere, I would just say to the Presiding Officer that a lot of people \nwho might be watching this across the country on C-SPAN may wonder \nwhere Seaside Heights, NJ, is. I wondered that myself, and I am from \nDelaware, less than 100 miles away. A lot of people have heard of \nAsbury Park, where Bruce Springsteen is from. Asbury Park is just a \nlittle bit north of Seaside Heights, NJ. About 50 miles south of \nSeaside Heights is a place called Atlantic City that a lot of us have \nheard of.\n  This is a shot taken in May of 2009 in Seaside Heights, NJ. This is a \nbefore shot. This is a little more than 3 years before the hurricane. \nThere are a couple of buildings here where we have these yellow arrows. \nThey are there for a purpose--so that when we look at the after shot we \ncan figure out what happened to those structures. Here is a red arrow \non this building.\n  This is about 3\\1/2\\ years later when Sandy came a-calling. Here we \ngo. These buildings aren't in the same place. They do not look the \nsame. What looked to have been a pier along through here is gone. There \nused to be roads through here and now there are what appear to be sandy \ntrails. Virtually every house here is badly damaged, many of them \nabsolutely totally destroyed.\n  We have another shot here, same town, Seaside Heights. This is \nobviously the beach, the boardwalk, and this is an amusement park. A \nlot of people went there over the years, for decades, and had a great \ntime with their families. They had a roller coaster here. There were a \nlot of rides here. I must admit I like rides. My wife says: Are you \never going to grow up? I say: I hope not, because this stuff is still \nfun to me. But here is the roller coaster. Again, this is taken in late \nMay 2009. There is the roller coaster.\n  Let's see what it looks like after Hurricane Sandy. Here is the \nroller coaster. Here is the roller coaster. It is in the ocean. And \nhere is what is left of the pier and of the amusement park.\n  The power of that storm is demonstrated graphically by these photos, \nwhich I said earlier destroyed not just this amusement park, the \nbeaches and the homes in this community, but wreaked havoc throughout \nthe mid-Atlantic and northeastern seaboard and took the lives of over \n200 people.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we saw many problems during \nthe recovery phase that held communities back and created great \nsuffering, and not only great suffering, also a lot of anger in terms \nof the inadequate response, the untimely response, the inept response. \nMoney was not always well spent, the efforts were not well coordinated, \nand the recovery moved slowly as a result.\n  Thanks in part to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of \n2006, which was shepherded through the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and through Congress by Senators Susan \nCollins and Joe Lieberman, many of the problems we saw during Katrina's \nrecovery efforts have been fixed, and we have seen a great deal of \nimprovement in the emergency response efforts as a result.\n  I have a friend who, when you ask him ``How are you doing?'' he \nalways says, ``Compared to what?'' So when speaking of how are we doing \nwith respect to the recovery after Superstorm Sandy, I say: Well, \ncompared to what? Compared to Katrina, we are doing great. Can we do \nbetter? You bet we can. We have learned a lot, and 7 years later you \ncan tell we have learned not all our lessons but certainly a number of \nthem.\n\n  That act that was passed about a half dozen years ago required FEMA \nto bolster their regional offices in order to build strong \nrelationships with State, local, and tribal governments. As an old \nrecovering Governor--and the Presiding Officer is a recovering \nLieutenant Governor--we know the Federal Government can't do \neverything, particularly in responding to emergencies. It is the \nrelationships with the State and the local folks, in some cases with \ntribal units, with the emergency responders, with the National Guard, \nand all of the above, that is critical. Those strong relationships not \nonly improve the ability of the Federal Government to respond to \ndisasters, but they also enhance FEMA's capability to support State, \nlocal, and tribal governments as they rebuild.\n  That law also required FEMA to coordinate with other Federal \ndepartments to write a national disaster recovery strategy. This \neventually lead to the National Disaster Recovery Framework, which has \nhelped to organize and coordinate recovery efforts to Hurricane Sandy.\n  A key question we need to ask, however, after a storm such as this, \nis whether it was an aberration or a harbinger of things to come. I \nwould like to think it was an aberration. There is a good chance it was \nnot. Just a few short years ago, hurricanes hitting the areas along the \nnortheastern half of the East Coast were relatively uncommon. Hurricane \nSandy is actually the third major hurricane to threaten or strike the \nnortheastern coast of our country in the last 3 years. Fortunately, we \nare almost through this hurricane season--knock on wood--without a \nmajor storm hitting our coast. Unfortunately, the Northeast, mid-\nAtlantic, and other vulnerable areas are expected to see more frequent \nand larger storms such as Sandy in the future.\n  Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office, \naffectionately known as GAO, added a new area to its recently updated \nHigh Risk List--the impact of climate change on the Federal Government \nand on our country. GAO explained that, among other things, climate \nchange ``could threaten coastal areas with rising sea levels, alter \nagricultural productivity, and increase the intensity and frequency of \nsevere weather events.''\n  The GAO also argued the Federal Government is not prepared to deal \nwith the impacts of climate change. I might add State governments and \nlocal governments as well are not prepared to deal with the impacts of \nclimate change. They recommended we take a strategic look at them and \nstart to prepare accordingly.\n  The costs associated with responding to and recovering from a \nhurricane such as Sandy, both in human and financial costs, are so \nsevere we simply cannot afford to face this devastation over and over \nagain.\n  It might have been Einstein who defined the definition of sanity as \ndoing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. We \ncan't do the same thing over and over. It is a different world in which \nwe live, and we have to respond to those changes.\n  Fortunately, we have seen States take promising steps toward \naddressing some of the issues GAO has identified. In particular, the \nStates of New York and New Jersey have begun to plan to mitigate \nagainst future disasters. We know all too well that an ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure.\n  In fact, a few years ago the National Institute of Building Sciences \nissued a report that concluded that for every $1 we spend on various \nmitigation measures we can save $4 in response and recovery costs. For \n$1 of investment we end up saving $4. Through mitigation, then, we can \nget better results--save money and, most importantly, we can save \nlives.\n  We must ensure that sound and effective mitigation policies are \nthoroughly incorporated into this recovery effort. This is especially \nimportant as climate change drives the sea level to rise and increases \nthe severity and frequency of coastal storms. By working together, we \ncan rebuild and become stronger by better protecting ourselves from \nfuture storms. But in doing so, we can't ignore what I and many experts \nbelieve may be the underlying cause of storms such as Hurricane Sandy. \nIt is not\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\nenough to just address the symptom--that is the storm, the wind, the \nsea level rise, the surge--we need to address the underlying cause or \ncauses.\n  As we recover from Sandy and put in place the protections, we need to \nreduce the impact of the next big one. We would make a mistake if we \ndidn't think about what we need to do to address not just the symptoms \nof climate change but the underlying cause itself.\n  We have been joined on the floor by my colleague Senator Menendez \nfrom New Jersey. Through the Presiding Officer, let me just say to my \ncolleague, we have some folks here today from Delaware who ended up, as \nI said earlier, in New Jersey, and I think in New York. Our State was \nhit, but nothing like the Senator's State. These folks, serving in the \nspirit of the Good Samaritan, with the encouragement and actually the \norganizational skills of the Red Cross, came to his State, across the \nDelaware River, in order to lend a hand to people they didn't know, had \nnever met, and will probably never see again.\n  Someday the tables will be turned, someday it will be our State, \nsomeday it will be Delmarva that is reeling from the impact of such a \nstorm. We know when that happens, the Senator will be there for us as \nwell.\n  I am pleased to yield the floor for my friend from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, let me start by thanking my \ndistinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Delaware, for his \nremarks, and the people of Delaware who came to New Jersey to help us. \nThat is the essence of why we call this great country the United States \nof America. In moments of challenge and adversity we come together. We \nappreciate the Delawareans who came to help us. We hope we never have \nto repay the kindness, but if perchance it comes, we will.\n  I come to the floor on this anniversary of Superstorm Sandy a year \nago. We all remember what has now become an iconic photo. It is hard to \nbelieve that it has been 1 year since Sandy, but it has. For a year, \nunder difficult and trying circumstances, New Jerseyans have pulled \ntogether, worked together, and helped each other to recover. I rise \ntoday in praise of their tenacity, their resilience, their spirit of \ncommunity, and remembering all of the hard work of the many first \nresponders, Federal, State, and local officials, community leaders, and \nvolunteers who helped in those recovery efforts.\n  Just yesterday I was with Secretary Donovan in New Jersey to announce \nanother $1.4 billion in community development grant disaster relief \nfunding. This is $1.4 billion in flexible-use funding that comes in \naddition to the $1.8 billion we have already received from the hard-\nfought $60 billion disaster relief package we secured a year ago. We \nsecured that funding after a long debate over whether we as a nation \nand the Congress were prepared to provide disaster relief to the people \nof my State and others who suffered devastating losses. Standing with \nme in that effort were many in this Chamber, and one who is no longer \nwith us, our late colleague and friend Senator Frank Lautenberg. He and \nI worked against many who did not want to provide New Jersey the \ndisaster relief we needed. We were in the midst of a debt ceiling \ndebate, a fiscal cliff at the end after a congressional session, and \neven after Sandy relief had passed the Senate with bipartisan support, \nthe House Republican leadership chose not to immediately bring the \nrelief package to a vote, unnecessarily delaying our recovery from \nSandy by 6 weeks.\n  There were those in Congress who believe that even in times of \ndisaster and crisis we are on our own. I don't believe that. I believe \nwe are all in this together and in times of crisis we come together as \na community.\n  That is why when the State of New Jersey submitted its application \nlast March to use $1.83 billion in Federal Sandy relief to help \nthousands of homeowners and small businesses rebuild, the Obama \nadministration, through HUD Secretary Donovan, approved the application \nin April, the following month.\n  We have come a long way since October 29th when Sandy made landfall \nin southern New Jersey. One hundred and fifty-nine people lost their \nlives, 8.5 million customers lost power, more than 650,000 homes were \ndamaged and 40,000 in our State were severely damaged or destroyed.\n  Here is a perfect example of how far we have come. You can see here \nthe damage Sandy brought on this home one year ago today. And, as you \ncan see in this second photo, today it is well on its way to being \nfully restored. But we have a long way yet to go in every community to \nfully recover from the extent of the damage and to make families and \nbusinesses whole again.\n  A year ago, this headline ran in the Record: ``Business losses mount; \nSome choosing to close rather than rebuild.'' Hundreds of thousands of \nbusinesses were forced to close, causing an estimated $65 billion in \neconomic loss and resulting in emergency declarations or disasters in \n13 States up and down the East Coast.\n  In a matter of minutes, people had lost loved ones, they lost their \nhomes, their property, and their livelihoods, but they stood strong and \nbegan to rebuild. Beyond the headlines of this story, we see the Jersey \nspirit that came through in person after person. Despite the uphill \nclimb, New Jersey rebuilt one home at a time, one business at a time, \none community at a time. That's what makes us Jersey Strong.\n  For 10 days, millions along the East Coast lived without power, \nwithout phones, seniors were stranded on the upper floors of buildings \nwhere elevators were out, and the loss of power led to fuel shortages \nand long gas lines. You can see in this photograph of the PATH Train \nTerminal in Hoboken, the extent of damage to our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  It was a wake-up call to what could happen again in the future and \nthe investment we need to make in our infrastructure to avoid future \ndamage from future storms.\n  The Sandy Recovery package we passed last year included $13 billion \nin critical funding I sought to help restore our transit and highway \nsystems from what they looked like then, as you can see in this \nphotograph.\n  The Port Authority was able to repair the PATH station at Hoboken and \nharden electrical equipment to prevent future damage. NJDOT was able to \nelevate roads that were washed away by Sandy.\n  At the end of the day, the legislation included necessary policy \nreforms that helped streamline recovery efforts and improve FEMA's \nPublic Assistance Programs, allowing us to rebuild what was in place \nbefore the storm and build it stronger and better than before.\n  Since then, almost $400 million in FEMA grants have been approved to \nhelp individuals and families recover. That is over $341 million for \nhousing assistance and more than $54 million for additional needs.\n  Homeowners, renters, and business owners have received over $764 \nmillion in SBA disaster loans and $314 million in FEMA Public \nAssistance grants to help local communities and local non-profits that \nserve the public and provided relief.\n  National Flood Insurance Program payments to New Jersey have amounted \nto $3.5 billion to help people rebuild and get their lives back on \ntrack. In New Jersey alone, more than 261,000 people contacted FEMA for \nhelp and information and over 126,000 homes have been inspected.\n  While these numbers show the progress we have made, the reality is \nthat for thousands of people in New Jersey, recovery is a round-the-\nclock, 24-7 effort.\n  Many New Jersey families have been hit with the ``triple whammy,'' \nhaving been flooded by Sandy, then facing repair and mitigation costs \nand then facing astronomical increases in flood insurance costs built \ninto a flood reform bill that was passed before Sandy hit.\n  Even as we slowly recover from the worst natural disaster in our \nState's history, a manmade disaster is looming in the distance, \njeopardizing our recovery.\n  The combination of updated flood maps and the phaseout of premium \nsubsidies for the National Flood Insurance Program threatens to force \nvictims out of their homes and destroy entire communities.\n  Many homeowners will be forced to pay premiums that are several times \nhigher than the current rate they pay. Those who cannot afford the \nhigher premiums will be forced to either sell\n\n[[Page S7593]]\n\nor be priced out of their home--probably at a fire-sale price. This in \nturn will drive down property values and local revenues at the worst \npossible time.\n  I have heard from countless New Jerseyans, many who have come to me \nin tears, who are facing this predicament. These are hardworking middle \nclass families, who played by the rules, purchased flood insurance, and \nare now being priced out of their home.\n  In order to stop this manmade disaster from doing even more damage, I \nam leaving the floor in a few minutes and going to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation to take a time-out and assess the impact these premium \nhikes will have on homeowners and the flood insurance program as a \nwhole.\n  The Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act, which we will be \nannouncing in a few minutes, would delay flood insurance premium \nincreases imposed in the Biggert-Waters legislation for most primary \nresidences until FEMA completes an affordability study that I had \noffered, and proposes a regulatory framework to address the issues \nfound in the study.\n  This will give current homeowners some breathing room before their \nflood insurance premiums go up. For prospective homebuyers, the \ncertainty that they will not see their rate dramatically increase \nsimply because they purchased a home is critically important to \nmaintaining property values.\n  At the end of the day, we look back at the year since the storm \nstruck and remember those who lost their lives and those who came \ntogether to help their neighbors rebuild. We remember the efforts of \nfirst responders and government and community leaders pulling together.\n  It is often said that ``the hardest steel must go through the hottest \nfire,'' and Sandy tested what we were made of.\n  When we look at this photograph of twisted metal that once was a \nrollercoaster, we associate it with the destruction of Sandy, but we \nalso associate it with how far we have come and what we have learned. \nWe learned that it is not enough to live in a community, we have to be \npart of it. We have to remember that citizenship comes with \nresponsibility not just to ourselves, but to each other.\n  In the face of Sandy--in the aftermath, the tragedy, and the loss--we \npulled together as a community. We worked together, helped each other \nrebuild lives, businesses, homes, our beaches and boardwalks--and, in \ndoing so, we strengthened New Jersey's sense of pride and a belief that \nwe are, in fact, all in this together. It is that spirit, that unity, \nthat has made New Jersey stronger and better than before.\n  Let me conclude by saying that recovery from any disaster depends on \nour continuing cooperation within our communities at every level of \ngovernment. The business of government is people--their lives, their \nhopes, their dreams of a better life for themselves and their families.\n  In New Jersey, we proved that--at every level of government--with \nvarious agencies working together--we all came together. There can be \nno tolerance of partisan division when it comes to the future of my \nState or any State's efforts to help families rebuild from a disaster \nlike Sandy. The storm was extraordinary, but what makes me \nextraordinarily proud is that New Jerseyans rose to the challenge as \nthey always do.\n  There is much work left to do. We have learned that recovery from a \ndisaster is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor. Full recovery from Sandy \nwill take more than a village.\n  But at the end of the day the biggest reason New Jersey has made the \nprogress that it has, and why our State will come back better and \nstronger than before, is because of the people who live there. It \nhasn't been easy. But I have never been more proud to represent the \npeople of New Jersey than I have during this last year since Sandy \nstruck.\n  I have seen the best of who we are and what we can do when we pull \ntogether, each of us working for the recovery of all of us. Looking \nback at the last year, I would say we are all New Jersey proud as well \nas New Jersey strong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Mr. CHIESA. Mr. President, nearly 5 months ago I had the high honor \nto stand in this historic Chamber, surrounded by my family, and be \nsworn in as a Member of the Senate. My service as a Senator will soon \ndraw to a close, so I wish to take this opportunity to share with my \ncolleagues a few thoughts before I leave.\n  I want to begin by thanking Governor Christie for providing me with \nthis incredible opportunity. Our professional relationship, and our \nfriendship, began more than 20 years ago as young lawyers working \ntogether in a New Jersey law firm. We had our entire careers ahead of \nus. If someone had suggested that one day Chris Christie would have \nbeen Governor, I would not have been surprised. I would, however, have \ndismissed out of hand any suggestion that I might someday be the New \nJersey attorney general, let alone a Member of the Senate.\n  To have served here representing the people of New Jersey has to rank \nas the greatest honor of my professional life. I will always be \ngrateful to Governor Christie for the confidence he has shown in me by \nappointing me, and I will always be thankful for the wonderful \nopportunities he has given me, time and again, to serve in public life.\n  I also thank my colleagues in the Senate from both sides of the aisle \nwho have gone out of their way to make me feel welcome, to help me \nnavigate the sometimes confusing rules and traditions of the Senate, \nand for assisting me in making the most of my time here.\n  One thing I did know for certain when I arrived here in June was that \nI wanted to use my time as effectively as possible. To the extent I \nhave, I have so many of my colleagues to thank. The senior Senator from \nNew Jersey, who will have to break in another new Senator from our \nState, has been a supportive colleague. I truly appreciate his \nwillingness to assist me in my time in the Senate. I thank the Senator.\n  The Republican leader has gone above and beyond to give me the \nopportunity to work and make a difference during my tenure here, and I \nthank him very much.\n  I also thank the senior Senator from Delaware and the junior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma for agreeing to my request to hold a hearing on human \ntrafficking in the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. \nEliminating human trafficking or, more directly, abolishing modern-day \nslavery has been a priority for me throughout my career in public \nservice. The chairman and ranking member of the committee could not \nhave been more helpful in my efforts to raise awareness of this evil \ncrime, a crime that robs people of their innocence and dignity, taking \na terrible toll on our victims and society as a whole.\n  The junior Senators from New Hampshire and North Dakota, both former \nattorneys general themselves, stood alongside me in this effort. When I \nfirst spoke with them about my desire to hold a hearing, they \nimmediately agreed to work with me to make it work as productively as \npossible. I am grateful to them for partnering with me and I know they \nwill continue to make this issue a top priority.\n  I also thank the senior Senator from Arizona for attending and \ncontributing to the hearing on a day when no votes were scheduled and \nfor his strong commitment for righting this terrible wrong. These are \nimportant and forceful voices for the victims of human trafficking, and \nI appreciate their support of my efforts.\n  I want all of my colleagues to know I will continue to work to \nabolish this scourge on our Nation and on the entire human family. I \nhope they will feel free to call on me if I can ever be helpful to them \nin their efforts, just as I may call on them from time to time.\n  So many of my colleagues have made this a wonderful experience, and I \nam proud to call all of them my friends.\n  I know I looked pretty lost on more than one occasion here, but I \nalways had someone pointing me in the right direction. I am \nparticularly grateful to my good friends from Utah, Wyoming, Tennessee, \nOhio, and Illinois, who have repeatedly helped me over the past 5 \nmonths both by listening and also providing good advice.\n  As every Senator knows, the work we do here would not be possible \nwithout the work of the people who serve on\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\nour staffs. I have been incredibly fortunate to have an outstanding \ngroup of people on my Senate staff--a group that jumped right in with \nme on very short notice and a group I am so proud to have worked with. \nThey were fully aware that their tenure, like mine, would be short. \nThey interrupted and, in many cases, disrupted their lives to serve \nwith me.\n  My chief of staff Donna Mullins did an amazing job assembling a \ntalented and dedicated group of professionals to serve both here in \nWashington and back in New Jersey. Their willingness to do so reflects \ntheir commitment to the people of New Jersey, the Senate, and to our \nNation. Some of them I have worked with for years, others only for a \nfew short months. All of them have earned my everlasting respect and \nfriendship.\n  I want to acknowledge each of them by name: Donna Mullins, John Lutz, \nTomi-Anne Nolino, Nick DiRocco, Jeannette Larkins, Chip Sinders, Ken \nLundberg, Bob Bostock, Ryan Berger, Krista Powers, Tyler Yingling, \nMarissa Watkins, Michael Rebuck, Chris Mindnich, Taylor Holgate, Nicole \nDube, Jamie Rhoades, Michael Pock, and Shante Palmer. They reflect the \nbest of public service, and I will always be thankful to them and the \nwork we have done together.\n  Of course, the greatest thanks goes to my family. My wife Jenny and \nour children Al and Hannah have always given me their unconditional \nlove and support. I could not have done this without them. I am lucky \nto have them.\n  I was born and raised in New Jersey. It is not just my home State, it \nis my home in every sense of the word. The honor of representing the \npeople of my State--my friends, my neighbors--is almost beyond \ndescription. After all, there could be no greater calling for any \ncitizen than to have the opportunity to represent the people of your \nState in the highest councils of government. Although the past 5 months \nhave passed very quickly, my deep sense of gratitude for the \nopportunity to serve will stay with me for the rest of my life.\n  My experience as a Member of this body has confirmed what I already \nthought was true--every Member of the Senate is a dedicated public \nservant. Every Senator is deeply committed to the work they do. Every \nSenator is here because he or she wants to contribute to the centuries-\nold work of forming a more perfect union. We do not always agree on how \nthis is best accomplished, but vigorous, respectful debate is critical \nin a government such as ours.\n\n  There is so much talent, so much commitment, and so much love of \ncountry here. I urge my colleagues to advance their efforts to find \ncommon ground in pursuit of their common purpose, to continue to \nadvance the success of the country we love and secure the blessings of \nliberty for the people we serve.\n  Soon there will be a new Senator-elect from New Jersey who will stand \nwhere I stood just a few months ago to be sworn in. When he takes his \nplace in this body, he will be joining a long list of dedicated public \nservants who have served New Jersey--stretching back to the very first \nCongress. I urge him to continue to work as hard for the people of our \nState as he did while serving as the mayor of New Jersey's largest \ncity. I know he will always put the people of New Jersey first.\n  New Jersey's new Senator will have a very long list of priorities \nwaiting for him when he arrives in Washington--all of them important. \nThere is one area that will require his immediate and ongoing focus, \nand that is New Jersey's continued effort to recover and rebuild from \nthe devastation of Superstorm Sandy, which struck my State a year ago \ntoday. Working together New Jerseyans have made incredible progress in \ncoming back from what the storm delivered, but our work continues.\n  For those who have suffered so much loss, a year seems like an \neternity. They must know that until all the damage done by the storm is \nundone, and until all the work needed to protect our State and its \npeople and their property from future storms like this is completed, we \nwill not rest.\n  As I prepare to make the transition back to private life, I do so \nwith a deep sense of gratitude to all of those who made my service in \nthe Senate possible, and an even deeper sense of humility for having \nbeen given this opportunity.\n  This has been, for me, a remarkable 5 months. I know I will in the \nyears ahead look back on this time with gratitude and appreciation for \nthe privilege of having served the people of New Jersey and the Senate \nof the United States of America.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while Senator Chiesa is still on the \nfloor, I want to take a moment to say to him how much we have enjoyed \ngetting to know him, work with him, and come away with a wonderful--not \njust a first impression but a lasting impression. Governor Christie did \nthe State of New Jersey well by appointing Senator Chiesa to serve as \nthe interim Senator.\n  We had a similar experience with losing an elected Senator when Joe \nBiden was elected as Vice President and to the Senate at the same time. \nHe had to choose between being the Senator from Delaware or Vice \nPresident. I don't know if he ever regrets it, but he made the choice \nto be our Vice President, as we know. The Governor of our State \nappointed Ted Kaufman to serve as the interim Senator for 2 years, and \nhe was subsequently succeeded by Chris Coons when Chris was elected a \ncouple of years ago.\n  We have a tradition of folks who are appointed as interim Senators \nwho turn out to do an extraordinary job. Sometimes I wonder--with \ntongue in cheek--if maybe that is not a better approach, in some cases, \nfor populating this place with men and women from across the country.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has been here for 5 tumultuous months, \nand he has seen the good, the bad, and the ugly--in some cases the very \nugly. If we had more people who would bring Senator Chiesa's values and \ncommitment to comity--not comedy with a ``d,'' but comity with a \n``t''--communicating, and his willingness to compromise, not on \nprinciples but on policy, this would be a better place and a better \ncountry.\n  As the chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs \nCommittee, I say on behalf of Tom Coburn, ranking Republican--and on \nbehalf of those of us who have the privilege to serve on that \ncommittee--what a privilege it has been for the Senator from New Jersey \nto be one of our members.\n  We are joined on the floor by Senator Barrasso, and it has been my \nprivilege to serve on the Environment and Public Works Committee with \nhim. As Senator Barrasso knows, Jeff Chiesa came early and stayed late. \nHe asked great questions and brought forth good issues--including the \nissue of human trafficking, which has reminded us in extraordinary ways \nof the terrible situation that is faced by millions of women and \nchildren in this country and around the world. That is a gift the \nSenator from New Jersey has brought to this body, and I think \nultimately to our country.\n  Senator Chiesa is going to leave us now and sail off into the \nsunrise, and we look forward to having our paths cross many times in \nthe future--maybe even in Delaware on a summer vacation. My friend can \nbring his wife Jenny and his two kids. He is always welcomed in the \nfirst State.\n  Good luck, God bless, and Godspeed. I thank my friend for serving our \ncountry and his State so well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I wish to add in a bipartisan way my \nthanks to Senator Chiesa for his service and add to the kind words the \nSenator from Delaware has spoken of our friend and our colleague.\n  In Wyoming we talk about the code of the West, and there are 10 parts \nto that code, but No. 1 is live each day with courage; and No. 2 is \ntake pride in your work. Members on both sides of the aisle have seen \nthat sort of code lived day by day by the Senator from New Jersey who \nhas joined us.\n  I join my colleague from Delaware in thanking our friend from New \nJersey. I say that with great admiration, great appreciation, and deep \nrespect for his time in the Senate, and I know we are going to continue \nto hear great things from him in the future.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7595]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for such \ntime as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said:\n\n       Our capacity is limited only by our ability to work \n     together. What is needed is the will.\n\n  I have just returned from a week at home in Montana traveling from \nFort Benton to Billings to Bozeman. I visited with constituents from \nall across our State. At each one of my meetings, the conversation \nwould touch on the first snow of the season or football and the Bobcats \nor the Grizzlies. Those are, in this case, football teams. But \ninevitably every conversation turned to the challenges we face in \nWashington and the standoff we just had over the country's borrowing \nlimit and funding the government.\n  People have lost faith in our ability to serve them. They are worried \nabout what the dysfunction means for the future of our country.\n  For more than 2 weeks, Congress was stuck in a stalemate, unable to \nagree on a course for our Nation. The political standoff shook \nAmerica's confidence and threatened the global economy. Thankfully, \ncompromise was able to overcome conflict. Cooler heads finally \nprevailed. But our Nation didn't emerge from the fight unscathed.\n  The 16-day government shutdown took a $24 billion bite out of the \nU.S. economy, according to Standard & Poor's. The rating agency now \nprojects the U.S. economy will only grow at 2.4 percent in the fourth \nquarter as opposed to the already slow 3 percent predicted prior to the \nshutdown. That is a staggering self-inflicted wound, and defaulting \nwould have been even worse.\n  Thankfully, that didn't happen. Leader Reid and Minority Leader \nMcConnell were able to find the will and come together to provide a \npath that averted default. Their bipartisan legislation, passed on \nOctober 16, pulled us back from the brink. It created a conference \ncommittee to negotiate a budget compromise and it gave the President \nthe power to suspend the debt limit until early February. It also gave \nSenators an opportunity to object and overturn the suspension using \nwhat is called a resolution of disapproval. That is what we are \nconsidering today.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this resolution. For the good \nof our economy, it cannot pass. Passing this resolution would plunge \nthis Nation back into the same economic crisis we were facing just a \nfew weeks ago. With economic confidence still suffering from the \nshutdown, another debt ceiling crisis could drive the Nation--and the \nworld--back into recession. We cannot let that happen. It is time to be \nresponsible leaders. Congress needs to stop governing from one self-\ncreated crisis to another.\n  Tomorrow, the budget conference committee will begin discussions on a \nplan to resolve the fiscal challenges before us. The conference will be \nled by Chairman Murray and Chairman Ryan. They are smart, hardworking \nand solutions oriented and I am confident they can craft a compromise.\n  I began my remarks with a quote from President Roosevelt and I will \nclose with another. Roosevelt once said:\n\n       The great test for us in our time is whether all the groups \n     of our people are willing to work together for continuing \n     progress.\n\n  Today, we face our test. Can we work together for continuing \nprogress?\n  I strongly urge Members of the Senate to reject the resolution before \nus. It is a step backward, a return to shutdowns and showdowns. Enough \nis enough. Instead, we must find the will to work together for \nprogress, for the good of our economy and the good of our country.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, earlier this month, I expressed my \nopposition to S. 1569, which allowed our debt limit to increase through \nFebruary 7, 2014. Today, the Senate considers S.J. Res. 26, which would \nreject the suspension in the debt limit and immediately halt any new \ndebt issuances by the United States. I support this resolution.\n  My position remains unchanged from earlier this month. Our national \ndebt is topping $17 trillion and has nearly doubled since the beginning \nof the Obama administration. If we allow the Nation to continue on its \ncurrent path, it will only lead to economic destruction. Allowing the \ndebt to continue increasing without any commonsense solutions to rein \nin the federal government would be irresponsible and reckless.\n  The recent increase in the debt limit is President Obama's sixth \nsince coming to office. In that time, no significant action has been \ntaken to reduce the long term trajectory of the debt. If we continue to \ndo nothing to rein in spending, the national debt will skyrocket to $25 \ntrillion in the next decade. Even the President agrees with these \nnumbers. We cannot allow this to happen, which is why I support the \nresolution prohibiting a continued suspension of the debt \nlimit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7595-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As I stated \nyesterday, this is an important role for making sure the NLRB can do \nits job.\n  This summer, as we know, we voted to fill the Board with the \nrequisite number of Republicans and Democrats on the Board. I thought \nthat was a good vote. This is the one left over; that is, the general \ncounsel position. Mr. Griffin is very well qualified. He has been \nthoroughly vetted.\n  I have received absolutely not one objection to his qualifications or \nhis background. He has had 30 years' experience as a labor lawyer and \nhe deserves strong bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to vote for \ncloture so we can get to the vote later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I am not going to vote to confirm Mr. \nGriffin because I think his nomination to be general counsel to the \nBoard does not do anything to keep it from moving toward advocacy \ninstead of being an umpire.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and \nsworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Pursuant to Senate Resolution 15 of the 113th Congress, there will \nnow be 8 hours of debate on the nomination equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in the aftermath of the battle over the \ncontinuing resolution and the debt ceiling, I am sure I am not alone in \nhearing from my constituents they are hoping that Democrats and \nRepublicans can now work together on some of the most important and \nchronic problems that challenge our country. But instead of doing that, \nmy friends across the aisle have taken this opportunity to engage in \nwhat can only be described as a power grab that will result in even \nmore polarization and partisan acrimony here in Washington.\n  What I am talking about specifically is the effort of the President \nand Democratic leadership to pack the District of Columbia Court of \nAppeals. For those who may not follow the Federal court system, America \nhas 13 different Federal appellate courts, but the DC court stands out \nas the most powerful in the country. Some have called it the second \nmost important court in the Nation because it has jurisdiction over a \nvariety of regulatory and constitutional matters. Whether it relates to \nDodd-Frank in financial services, to ObamaCare and its implementation, \nor to national security matters, all of those types of cases get heard \nin the DC Circuit Court. No other appellate court in the Nation wields \nsuch vast influence over hot-button issues, ranging, as I said, from \nhealth care to the Environmental Protection Agency and its activities, \nwhich I know are as important to the Presiding Officer as they are to \nme, as well as gun rights and the war on terrorism.\n  President Obama argues the DC Circuit Court needs three more judges \nin order to get its work done, but the facts simply don't bear that \nout. That is not true. For example, between 2005 and 2013, the DC \nCircuit's total number of written decisions per active judge actually \nwent down by 27 percent. The number of appeals filed with the court \nfell by 18 percent. So instead of having more work to do, it has less \nwork to do than it did in 2005.\n  As one commentator has observed: The DC Circuit already has the \nlowest caseload in the Nation and, if anything, trends show their \nworkload is decreasing--decreasing, going down--not up.\n  Indeed, one DC Circuit Court judge recently told the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa that if any more judges were added now, there wouldn't be \nenough work to go around. So one might wonder why then the President \nand Senator Reid would want to pack the DC Circuit Court with three \nadditional judges if there is not enough work to go around today.\n  Let me also note the DC Circuit Court has a unique record in that it \nactually took 4 months off between May and September of this year. That \nis hardly the record of a court that has too much work to do and simply \ncan't get it done.\n  Meanwhile, there are courts across our country, both appellate courts \nand district courts, that are overburdened. Some of these courts are \nlabeled as judicial emergencies because they simply have such a heavy \ncaseload they can't get the work done. Why wouldn't we want to allocate \nmore judicial resources, more help, to those courts that need the help \nrather than to pack the DC Circuit Court with judges it simply doesn't \nneed?\n  Don't just take my word for it. Prominent Democratic leaders have \nactually made no secret of what is happening here. One might wonder \nwhat the rationale is, if there is not enough work to do. Why would \nSenator Reid and other Democratic leaders want to add new judges to a \ncourt that doesn't have enough work to do? Well, back in March, the \nsenior Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, said the following of \nthe DC circuit judges:\n\n       Here's what they have done in the last year: They have \n     overturned the EPA's ability to regulate existing coal plants \n     . . . They have rendered the SEC impotent by saying that the \n     SEC can't pass rulings unless they do what is called a cost-\n     benefit analysis . . . They have ruled that recess \n     appointments couldn't be taken into account.\n\n  Senator Schumer also said:\n\n       We will fill up the DC circuit one way or another.\n\n  Well, I disagree with Senator Schumer's characterization on some of \nthese cases, but it is true the DC Circuit Court has a unique role in \nAmerican jurisprudence in deciding some\n\n[[Page S7597]]\n\nvery important cases for the entire country. There are administrative \nagencies that are part of the executive branch, and when they make \ndecisions--whether it relates to financial services, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, Health and Human Services, or any administrative \nagency--those decisions typically get decided and reviewed by the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  More recently, the majority leader put it this way when he said:\n\n       We're focusing very intently on the DC Circuit. We need at \n     least one more. There's three vacancies. We need at least one \n     more and that will switch the majority.\n\n  So this isn't about the efficient administration of impartial \njustice. This is about stacking the court by changing the majority. \nThat was a quote from the majority leader of the Senate. So there is no \nmystery about what is going on here. The majority leader and his allies \nare attempting to pack the court with judges who will rubberstamp their \nbig-government agenda.\n  The majority leader is also threatening to use the nuclear option \nagain unless Senate Republicans simply snap to attention and salute \nsmartly. Well, that is not going to happen. In simple terms, Democrats \nare prepared to violate the Senate's own rules to help flip the DC \ncircuit in favor of the Obama administration's aggressive \nadministrative overreach. If these tactics succeed, the Senate will be \nweakened as an institution and the Nation's second highest court will \nbe transformed into a far-left ideological body.\n  But I will remind my colleagues that what goes around comes around in \nthe Senate. When Republicans control the Senate and we have a \nRepublican in the White House, I warn my colleagues the same rules they \nput into effect with the nuclear option will be used to their \ndisadvantage then. We shouldn't do it. We shouldn't go there.\n  But it is clear what the motivation is. Again, this is not about the \nefficient administration of impartial justice. This is about getting \nyour way and getting a rubberstamp on the actions of regulatory \noverreach that are far too common here in Washington, DC.\n  It is true the DC Circuit Court has ruled against the Obama \nadministration and its regulatory agencies, but it is also true they \nhave affirmed many of the most important and far-reaching decisions of \nthe Obama administration's regulatory agencies. One example where it \nruled against the administration is in 2011, when it struck down the \n``proxy access'' rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission by \ndeclaring the agency failed to conduct a cost-benefit analysis required \nby law before adopting the regulation.\n  I don't know about anyone else, but I wish the government would do \nmore cost-benefit analyses, not less, and so I am glad the DC Circuit \nCourt struck down that rule because of the failure of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission to conduct a cost-benefit analysis.\n  In another example last year, the court vacated the cross-State air \npollution rule of the Environmental Protection Agency, noting it would \n``impose massive emissions reduction requirements'' on certain States \n``without regard to the limits set by the statutory text.''\n  In other words, they acted beyond their congressional authorization. \nThis was also an example, in Texas--Texas got swept into this cross-\nState air pollution rule without even an opportunity to be heard and to \noffer competing analyses of the models the Environmental Protection \nAgency used. No matter how committed we all are to clean air, we should \nnot sanction an administrative agency run amok, doing what is not \nauthorized by the statutory text.\n  The DC Circuit has also rejected as unconstitutional a pair of \nappointments the President made to the National Labor Relations Board. \nTalk about overreach. This is where the President tried to trump the \nconfirmation powers of the U.S. Senate in the Constitution--the power \nof advice and consent, it is called--by making unconstitutional so-\ncalled recess appointments. The DC Circuit called him on it and held \nthat it was unconstitutional.\n  More recently, the court held that the President's Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission was simply flouting the law. Do we not want a court to call \nthe President when administrative agencies are simply flouting the law \nif we are a nation of laws? In this case, they flouted the law by \ndelaying a decision on whether to use Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste \nrepository.\n  These were all commonsense decisions, and you can probably tell from \nmy comments that I think they were well grounded in the law and the \nfacts and I agree with the decision. In that case, they all went \nagainst the Obama administration's preferred position, but it is true \nthat the DC Circuit has also ruled in favor of the administration's \nposition in a number of cases. Again, here is an EPA decision. Since \n2012, Jeremy Jacobs reports, the Agency has won 60 percent of the cases \nthat have been reviewed by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. In 60 \npercent of the lawsuits where the Environmental Protection Agency has \nbeen taken to court for exceeding its authority, 60 percent of the time \nthe EPA position has prevailed. That is a better performance than the \nEPA had at the circuit during George W. Bush's administration. In \nparticular, the EPA has scored landmark victories related to greenhouse \ngas regulations, ethanol-blended gasoline, and mountaintop-removal coal \nmining. But beyond energy and environmental issues, the DC Circuit \nCourt has upheld President Obama's Executive order regarding embryonic \nstem cell research on two separate occasions, in 2011 and 2012.\n  Again, these are not my preferred outcomes, but I think they \ndemonstrate that the DC Circuit Court has learned to strike a balance \nand certainly is not pro-administration or anti-administration. It \nepitomizes what a court should be, which is an impartial administrator \nof justice. Again, this same court upheld the Affordable Care Act in \n2011, ruling that the individual health insurance mandate was \nconstitutional under the commerce clause. We know what happened when it \ngot to the U.S. Supreme Court. They had a different view.\n  It demonstrates the kind of judicial restraint that the current DC \ncourt, balanced as it is with four nominees by a Republican President \nand four nominees by a Democratic President--how it has administered \nevenhanded justice, which would be destroyed if the President is \nsuccessful and if Senator Reid is successful in packing this court with \nthree more of their liberal allies. As I said, this court is currently \nsplit right down the middle. Four of the active judges were appointed \nby a Republican President and four were appointed by a Democratic \nPresident. Yet it is clear that the DC Circuit Court is in the \ncrosshairs of the majority leader and his Democratic allies, including \nthe President, because they want to tilt the court in their direction--\na more liberal, bigger government direction, one that is more \ndeferential to administrative agencies, such as the Environmental \nProtection Agency and other agencies that refuse to take into account a \ncost-benefit analysis, which we ought to have more of, not less.\n  The truth is that there is an answer to this standoff in terms of the \ncourt-packing President Obama and Senator Reid are attempting. There \nactually is a way to reallocate these unneeded seats from the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals to other courts that actually need the judges, \nunlike this court that has the lightest caseload of any circuit court \nin the Nation.\n  Senator Grassley, the senior Senator from Iowa, has offered a \nreasonable compromise which would allow several of President Obama's \nappellate nominees to be approved for district courts or courts of \nappeals where they are actually needed. In other words, President Obama \nwould still get to pick them; he would just have to pick them for \ncourts where they would actually have enough work to do and where they \nare needed.\n  Again, based on current caseloads, the DC Circuit Court does not need \nnew judges, but other appellate courts really do. I would think that \nduring a time when judgeships are constrained after the Budget Control \nAct, when discretionary spending is down, and when the courts need more \nresources allocated, we would want to allocate the resources to courts \nand to jurisdictions where they are actually needed, not to places \nwhere they are not needed.\n  For all these reasons and more, I hope Members of both parties will \nagree that the reasonable way to do it would be to pass the Grassley \nbill, the Grassley compromise to reallocate\n\n[[Page S7598]]\n\nthese judges to the places where they are really needed and to prevent \nthe stacking of this court and this reckless power grab.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                            Superstorm Sandy\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 1-\nyear anniversary of Superstorm Sandy's landfall in the Northeast and \nthe destruction it brought on a ruinous path through Connecticut, New \nYork, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. I will be joined today on the \nfloor--and I ask unanimous consent that we be permitted to engage in a \ncolloquy--by my colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, and from \nRhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, if there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I can scarcely capture in words the \nawesome, monstrous power of this storm as it hit the Northeast as I \ntraveled there. I was near the coastline of Connecticut, traveling some \nof the roads in the midst of this storm as it ripped through my State, \ntearing apart communities along the coast, destroying homes and \nbusinesses, displacing families, and forever altering the shoreline \nitself. Anybody who questions the power of nature at its most \ndestructive should have seen this storm as it unfolded and the damage \nit left in its wake--in fact, in Connecticut, $770 million in damages.\n  What I remember from touring Connecticut is not only the size and \nmagnitude of the destruction but also the resilience and strength of \nConnecticut's people as they struggled through the pain and anguish of \ncoping with this devastation, wondering how they would ever rebuild. In \nfact, they have rebuilt with the courage and relentless strength and \nfortitude that have so marked the character of Connecticut and New \nEngland and New York as they rallied around one another and exhibited \nthat sense of optimism and hope. It was as important as any material \nresources that were brought to bear. They rallied around each other \nwith gratitude and with hope because they had each other, and they have \nsucceeded in clearing the debris, reconstructing, rebuilding in a way \nthat is inspiring.\n  I only wish Congress's response was as effective and courageous as \nthat of the citizens of Connecticut that I viewed in the storm's \naftermath. The Senate was slow to act, but it was before the House in \npassing the $60 billion recovery package for the Northeast. The effort \nwas stalled in the House, quite bluntly, with bipartisan politics of \nthe worst kind and trivial obstruction.\n  There are lessons to be learned. No. 1 is that partisanship and \npolitics should have no role in our response to disasters, whether in \nOklahoma or Colorado or Louisiana or the Northeast. We are all in this \neffort together when disaster strikes. We should rally around each \nother as the people of Connecticut rallied.\n  Our response has to be quicker, smarter, stronger than it was in this \ninstitution. We owe it to ourselves as well as to the people who \nsuffered the financial and emotional loss. For many of them, there were \nphysical injuries as a result of this natural disaster.\n  Those two lessons are reinforced by a third, which is that these \nsuperstorms have become a new normal. We can no longer regard the once-\nin-a-century storm as once every hundred years. They are coming once \nevery year because climate disruption is increasing their frequency and \nforce in a way that is awesome and alarming and astonishing. So another \nlesson is that there has to be preparation to prevent damage and to \nmitigate the effects of these storms when they strike, and the \ninvestments--and they are investments--have to be smart and strong, \nwith means such as storm barriers, breakers, better shoreline \nresilience.\n  Eventually, the Federal Government provided aid, and Connecticut has \nput to good use the $200 million that was distributed through the \nNational Flood Insurance Program to homeowners and business owners. \nCities and towns around my State have used $42 million in FEMA \nassistance, and more than $10 million has gone toward health services \nand facilities. As our Governor announced yesterday, an additional $65 \nmillion has been granted to the State to supplement the initial $72 \nmillion from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the \nform of community development block grants for disaster relief. These \nnew Federal dollars are critical to the effort of rebuilding, and I \nwill continue to fight not only for additional funds but also against \nthe bureaucratic logjams and redtape that have prevented so many from \nreceiving more timely aid.\n  This aid has come too slowly, it has been too small, and it has been \nbehind the efforts--in time and strength--of the people of Connecticut. \nI will continue to fight for increased aid, including from the $100 \nmillion that was announced yesterday and today--today's announcement of \nthe U.S. Department of Interior of $100 million in the coastline \nresiliency project. I will support all qualified applicants from \nConnecticut securing some of this competitive funding. We will fight \nfor a fair allocation of this money to benefit the important work \nConnecticut is doing to strengthen our coastline so that we can prevent \nand reduce the effects of these storms in the future.\n  I had the privilege to travel the State as a leader of a listening \ntour for the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force this past May, just \nover the half-year mark from the time Sandy hit.\n  The progress made with this help from the Federal Government, \ncombined with the good will, drive, and sense of responsibility toward \none another--exemplified by the people of Connecticut--has been \nremarkable. We must resolve to do better at the Federal level, and I \nhope that not only the storm itself but the shortcomings of the relief \neffort will be a teaching moment for the Nation.\n  The evidence is irrefutable that climate disruption is impacting our \noceans and atmosphere and leading to an increasing number of severe \nweather storm events across the country that we cannot control. We will \nsee more of such monstrous storms here and in other parts of the \ncountry.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Whitehouse and Senator Schumer, who \nhave been strong and steadfast leaders in this effort to recognize the \neffects of climate disruption and prepare for them.\n  Connecticut is in the process of upgrading our infrastructure to \nstrengthen our resiliency among the most vulnerable communities. We are \ninvesting in microgrids, often powered by hydrogen fuel cells \nmanufactured in our State, to provide backup power for hospitals and \nsenior communities in towns such as Preston and Franklin, which I \nvisited in the aftermath of the storm.\n  In Milford, residents are using HUD funding to elevate their homes so \nthey can guard against these storm surges. Other coastal towns are \nemploying green infrastructure with marsh grass to slow surging waters \nduring storms.\n  In Stamford, CT, my hometown, the city is using Federal aid to \nupgrade a 17-foot hurricane barrier by replacing manual pumps to ensure \nagainst damage to the city's communities in future storms. I visited \nthe shoreline of Stamford, as I did up and down the coast of \nConnecticut, and I have since, to see how Connecticut is learning these \nlessons so we can reduce dollar costs as well as human costs. The \nimprovements taking place across Connecticut speak volumes to our \nstrength of will and mind and the determined character of our people in \nConnecticut.\n  I express appreciation to colleagues, such as Senators Schumer and \nWhitehouse and others in this body, who helped us in a time of need. \nThey came forth to provide encouragement and support. They assured the \npeople of Connecticut that they are not alone.\n  No one in the United States--whether it is in the Presiding Officer's \nState of West Virginia or in the western most part of Hawaii--should be \nalone after being struck by a natural disaster. We need to rally \ntogether.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Before I join the colloquy with Senators Blumenthal \nand Schumer, I have two bits of housekeeping.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. \ntoday all postcloture time on the Griffin nomination be yielded back, \nand\n\n[[Page S7599]]\n\nthe Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate; the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; that \nany related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this is my 48th trip to the floor to \nremind Congress that it is time to wake up to the threat of climate \nchange.\n  I am joined by Senators Blumenthal and Schumer because 1 year ago \ntoday Hurricane Sandy struck our States with frightening force. Now, a \nyear later, communities across the Northeast have dug out and are \nrebuilding, but Sandy left a permanent mark on our coasts and on our \nconsciousness.\n  To be sure, we cannot say that this devastating storm was \nspecifically caused by climate change. However, Sandy showed the many \nways we are vulnerable to the undeniable effects of climate change, \nsuch as rising sea levels and warming oceans--effects that can in turn \nload the dice for more damaging storms.\n  As evening fell on October 29, 2012, a storm surge from the largest \nAtlantic hurricane ever recorded swept against Rhode Island's shores \nabout 5 feet above mean sea level. A few hours later, waters peaked \naround New York City--about 9 feet above mean sea level. A harrowing \nnight followed for victims of Hurricane Sandy. It was a night that took \nmore than 150 lives and caused $65 billion in physical damage and \neconomic loss.\n  Hurricane Sandy, or Superstorm Sandy as many remember it, hit 24 \nStates with direct effects. Floodwaters invaded homes and swept out \nroads. High winds knocked out power to 8.5 million homes and \nbusinesses, cutting a swath of darkness that could be seen from space. \nAn entire New York neighborhood was gutted by fires that emergency \npersonnel could not reach through the storm.\n  Sandy flooded nearly the entire coastline with beaches and dunes \ndriven down by the waves and wind. Displaced sand and stone covered \nroads like here on Atlantic Avenue in Misqaumicut, RI. Houses were \nswept off their foundations in Rhode Island's southern coast \ncommunities like Matunuck, shown in this photo. Here we see Governor \nLincoln Chafee, a former Member of this body, surveying the damage to \nthese homes.\n  President Obama granted Governor Chafee's request for a Federal \ndisaster declaration covering four of Rhode Island's five counties. \nMore than 130,000 Rhode Islanders lost power. Eight cities and towns \nimplemented evacuation actions. Nearly one-third of all Rhode Islanders \nwere directly affected one way or another. In a close-knit State such \nas ours, nearly everyone was touched by Sandy.\n  Rhode Islanders are resilient and we are recovering. Over $30 million \nhas been paid out to Rhode Islanders for more than 1,000 Federal flood \ninsurance claims. FEMA has approved more than 260 projects for \nreimbursement. Over $12 million has been put to repairing our State's \nparks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites. Individuals and families \nreceived more than $423,000 in grants to meet their immediate basic \nneeds for housing and other essential disaster-related expenses.\n  The Federal Government will always play a central role for \ncommunities such as ours, picking up after a disaster like Sandy. So it \nwould make sense for the Federal Government to learn from these events \nand be smart as we plan for future risks.\n  The Government Accountability Office recently reported on the risks \nto U.S. infrastructure posed by climate change. Roads, bridges, and \nwater systems are designed to operate for 50 to 100 years. Well, 50 to \n100 years from now, our climate and our coastline will be very \ndifferent. Sandy threw at Rhode Island's shores Atlantic seas that had \nrisen almost 10 inches since the 1930s, against a shoreline that had \nalready retreated more than 100 feet in some locations. As climate \nchange progresses, more and more infrastructure will be exposed to more \nand more risk.\n  Earlier this year GAO added to its High Risk List the United States \nfinancial exposure to climate change. GAO, our congressional watchdog, \nnow warns that it is fiscally irresponsible to ignore the signs of \nclimate change. The President's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, \nand his Climate Action Plan, both call for adaptation to this risk from \nclimate change--particularly for better coastal resiliency and \npreparedness.\n  Here is an example of doing it right. When hurricane Katrina hit the \nI-10 Twin Span Bridge that crosses Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans, \nit twisted and toppled the bridge's 255-ton concrete bridge spans off \ntheir piers and into the lake. The bridge was rebuilt by using Federal \nHighway Administration funding, but they built it stronger, better \nengineered, and in some sections they built it more than 20 feet \nhigher.\n  It makes sense to make sure that our agencies repair American \ninfrastructure to the commonsense standard that it is ready for future \nrisks. Rebuilding to the specs that failed is not common sense. Being \ndeliberately stupid in order to deny climate change is a losing \nproposition.\n  Congress can do something smart right now. We could pass the Water \nResources and Development Act with the resiliency and restoration \nprovisions that were in the Senate-passed bipartisan bill. Congress \ncould support the President's Climate Action Plan, using our wise \nEarth's natural protections for our coastal infrastructure.\n  Of course, even robust climate adaptation won't let us off the hook \nin some places. New England can build levees and dams to hold the \nwaters back, but the vast low areas of southeastern Florida are porous \nlimestone. Even if you built a giant dike, the water would just seep in \nthrough the underlying limestone.\n  A study last year found that 3 feet of sea level rise, which is what \nwe presently expect, will hit more than 1.5 million Floridians, and \nnearly 900,000 Florida homes--almost double the effect on any other \nState in the Nation. So Florida should want to prevent as much climate \nas possible, and that means cutting carbon pollution.\n  Ultimately, for the open market to work, we need to include the full \ncost of carbon pollution in the price of fossil fuels. Anything less is \na subsidy to polluters. What Florida should want is for Congress to \nenact a carbon pollution fee to correct the market, and then return \nthat fee to American families.\n  Ultimately, inaction is irresponsible, and Americans get it. Eighty-\ntwo percent of Americans believe we should start preparing now for \nrising sea levels and severe storms from climate change.\n  Young Americans, in particular, see through the phony climate denial \nmessage. Three-quarters of independent young voters and more than half \nof Republican young voters would describe climate deniers as \n``ignorant,'' ``out of touch,'' or ``crazy.'' Let me repeat that. The \nmajority of Republican voters under 35 would describe climate deniers \nas ``crazy,'' ``ignorant,'' or ``out of touch.'' Continuing the climate \ndenial strategy is not a winning proposition for our friends on the \nother side. Even their own young voters see through it.\n  Congress should wake up to the alarms that are ringing in nature and \nto the voices of the American people. One of the loudest alarm gongs \nwas Hurricane Sandy. Voltaire said: ``Men argue, nature acts.'' Well, \nnature acted, driving epic winds and seas against our shores, and she \nwill continue to act if we continue to tip her careful balances with \nreckless carbon pollution and shameless subsidies to the big polluters.\n  We need to wake up as a Congress and take responsible action to \nprotect our homes and communities. We need to remember Sandy and learn \nher lessons.\n  I yield the floor for my distinguished colleague from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nRhode Island, for calling Senator Blumenthal and me and others together \nand for taking action on climate change. There has been no one in this \nbody who has done more to sound the alarm about climate change.\n  I have enjoyed his regular ``time to wake up'' speeches. I guess this \nis number 49--excuse me, 48. One of them was\n\n[[Page S7600]]\n\nso good I read it twice. He has been relentless on this issue in a \npositive, articulate, and superb way.\n  There could not be a better day to talk about climate change than \ntoday because we are at the 1-year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy. \nSenators Whitehouse and Blumenthal and I remember it vividly. We each \nvisited our communities on the days afterwards and saw the terrible \nblow that Sandy delivered to New York and the whole east coast. It \ncreated such damage and upheaval to communities and lives. Sandy was a \nhorrible event, but the one silver lining in this large awful cloud is \nthat people take climate change more seriously. I think most Americans \nagreed that climate change is real, but there was not a sense of \nurgency about climate change pre-Sandy. People said, well, it is \nhappening 25 years from now or 50 years from now. Unlike Senator \nWhitehouse, who has a sense of passion and a sense of urgency daily and \nimmediately about this, most people said we can let things wait.\n\n  Unfortunately, despite the efforts of the Senator from Rhode Island \nand others, our bodies are not doing enough on climate change. But when \nSandy occurred, a sea change occurred. Americans understood--those of \nus in the Northeast probably more than anybody else--that we cannot \nafford to wait. It took 10 years to get the American people to accept \nthe fact that climate change is real. It took one storm to get them to \nunderstand that we had to move immediately.\n  Sandy was awful. In the days after the storm, I toured places such as \nthe Rockaways and Long Beach, Staten Island, Lindenhurst. Whole \nneighborhoods were leveled and thousands of New Yorkers were homeless. \nTo see an elderly gentleman, Mr. Romano, sitting in front of his lot in \nGreat South Bay in Lindenhurst, his house totally destroyed, sitting in \none of his few possessions left, a little lawn chair, was devastating. \nI asked Mr. Romano: Are you going to move?\n  He said: Look at the view.\n  Two days after Sandy, the skies were peaceful, the Sun was beautiful, \nand it was reflected off of Great South Bay. He said: Every year I have \nhad 364 good days and 1 bad day. I am not moving.\n  That story can be repeated, but the devastation was real. To drive \ndown the streets in the Rockaways or the streets of Long Beach or of \nStaten Island, the South Shore of Staten Island, and see house after \nhouse with piles in front of the houses of not just furniture, although \nthat was a problem--we all have our favorite chair, a favorite place to \nsit. But people's lives were out there: heirlooms that had been in the \nfamily for generations, pictures and albums gone, like that.\n  This is an example of one of the places hurt the worst: Breezy Point, \na hardy community of cops, firefighters, teachers, EMT workers; the \nheart of New York City's middle class. They are the very same people--\nmany did from Breezy Point--who rushed the towers on 9/11, and some \nlost their lives. They were the people who were devastated here. A fire \nerupted, 120 houses--it looked like Dresden after the bombings in World \nWar II--and all that was left was this religious shrine. I will never \nforget that scene and having the local firefighters showing me what had \nhappened.\n  Of course, our local infrastructure was terribly damaged as well. \nHere we have the R train, which Secretary Fox and I just announced is \ngoing to be up and ready in 1 year. The tunnel had millions of gallons \nof water--brackish water, salty water--that not only ruined the \ninfrastructure of the tunnels, but the signals that depended on \nelectric functioning--gone. These scenes are repeated over and over.\n  What Sandy did is make climate change real to New Yorkers in a \nhorrible way. The same is now happening across the country. So what \nSandy did was not alert us to the fact that climate change exists but \nalerted us that it was a call to action. While climate scientists try \nto avoid blaming any single weather event on climate change, we know \nthat a warming planet can load the dice for more frequent and extreme \nstorms. As sure as we all are sitting here, there will be other storms, \nunfortunately, and God forbid but in all likelihood, of Sandy's \ndevastation that will affect different parts of the country. As I and \nothers have said in the days after Sandy, we have had far too many \nevents over the past 3 years in New York, including Irene, Lee, and \nthen Sandy, to think we can ignore the impact of a warming planet and \nthe impact that is having on our communities.\n  Even if one denies the scientific reality of climate change, there is \nlittle dispute over the stark challenge facing our country. The weather \nis more dangerous than ever and threatens our economy. According to \nrecent polling, Americans now support taking action on climate change \nto protect our children and grandchildren.\n  So we need to do two things at once. We need to decrease our reliance \non fossil fuels to slow down the warming of the planet, and we have to \nstart investing in real climate adaptation projects in the most \nvulnerable parts of the country.\n  My colleague from Rhode Island talked about the devastation in \nFlorida. He is right. The Florida delegation should be up in arms. I \nknow some of our colleagues--they tend to be on this side of the \naisle--are, but we hear silence from the other side of the aisle on \nclimate change. In just a generation, a good percentage of Florida will \nbe out of commission. Miami, one of the largest cities in the country, \nis virtually unprotected when it comes to climate change.\n  So we have to do both of these things. One year after Sandy, I am \npleased we have made some progress.\n  First, the Hurricane Sandy relief law we passed earlier this year \nprovided an injection of billions of dollars into mitigation for the \neast coast. When we rebuild this subway line, the signals are going to \nbe higher up so if, God forbid, there is another flood, they will not \nbe out of commission. At the entrances to the various tunnels--hundreds \nof thousands of people take these every week--there will be gates or a \ncertain kind of airbag that can instantaneously prevent the tunnel from \nbeing flooded. We are elevating homes and building new floodwalls and \ndunes to prevent damage from the next Sandy.\n  So one thing we are doing is mitigation. Those of us--Senator \nWhitehouse, Senator Blumenthal, and others from New Jersey and Maryland \nand Pennsylvania and Delaware and New York and Connecticut, \nMassachusetts and Rhode Island delegations made sure in this \nlegislation there is ample money for mitigation, so that if or when, \nGod forbid, another storm such as Sandy occurs, we will be better \nprotected.\n  Second, the President took a bold and important step in releasing his \nclimate action plan, a critical blueprint for reducing carbon \npollution. The plan also lays out a framework for implementing new \nmitigation plans for Federal, State, and local governments by tying \nFederal funding to new standards on climate adaptation. We now know a \nsimple economic truth from many years of investing in mitigation \nprojects: They save money. According to research, for every $1 we \ninvest in mitigation, we save $4 down the road because of what will be \nprotected and taxpayers will not have to shell out the same dollars \nagain and again and again.\n  So it doesn't matter what side of the climate change debate one is on \nwhen it comes to investing in mitigation. Being promitigation makes \ngood fiscal sense for the Federal Government.\n  A recent study found that Federal taxpayers spent $136 billion on \ndisaster relief in just the 3 years of 2011, 2012, and 2013--$400 per \nhousehold. The only way we can shrink this burden for the American \npeople over time is to make critical mitigation investments at the same \ntime we fight climate change by cutting carbon pollution.\n\n  I wish to specifically mention one piece of legislation which my \ncolleague from Rhode Island also mentioned. He is on the EPW Committee \nand he has championed it with many of our colleagues. WRDA, the \nbipartisan Water Resources Development Act, got 83 votes in the Senate \nand will be a real boost for investment in climate adaptation.\n  In this bill, there is a new program called WIFIA. The very \nsuccessful TIFIA Program which, for instance, without the local \ntaxpayers spending a nickel, will bring our subway system all the way \nover to the far west side. I look forward to opening it with the mayor \nsoon. Modeled on that program is WIFIA. It helps local governments\n\n[[Page S7601]]\n\ninvest in mitigation projects by providing low-interest loans and a new \nbanking design to attract private investment into these projects.\n  There are also new authorities that will allow the Army Corps to \nexpedite and prioritize hurricane protection studies and project \nrecommendations. I thank my colleagues, led by Senator Boxer, of the \nEPW Committee for working with us to draft some of this language.\n  These new policies are very important for New York and the States \naffected by Sandy. I urge our colleagues in the House to work with us \nto include these items in the WRDA conference.\n  We need to use the tragedy of Sandy to learn how to make our cities \nand towns stronger for the next storm. We know it is coming. We have to \nwork at the local level in terms of mitigation. We have to work at the \nmacro level to reduce the amount of carbon that has poured into our \natmosphere that will just devastate the planet if we continue to sit on \nour hands.\n  I will close my remarks by borrowing a simple refrain from my friend \nfrom Rhode Island. As his poster says, it is time to wake up. \nSuperstorm Sandy was New York's wake-up call. Let's honor the thousands \nof victims of that event by investing in our future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, before I depart the floor, and while \nSenator Schumer and Senator Blumenthal are still here, I wish to add a \npoint that is a personal observation of mine as a Senator; that is, \nfirst the Senator from New York is widely and properly regarded as one \nof the more formidable presences in the Senate. Having witnessed the \ndifficulties that Senator Blumenthal discussed at getting the Sandy \ndisaster relief out and done, I will say we learned Senator Schumer has \nan even higher gear when it comes to the urgent needs of his home State \nand of his coast. When his New York City lies battered and drowned by \nstorm, the work that he did to make sure a reluctant House passed this \nrelief for us was an exercise in legislative craftsmanship and personal \nvigor that many of us will long remember.\n  Of course, I have seen Senator Blumenthal fighting for his people in \nConnecticut, both after Hurricane Sandy and, of course, after the \nterrible tragedy that Connecticut experienced when a crazed gunman went \ninto an elementary school and began to murder its children. So Senator \nBlumenthal, in responding to those cares, concerns, and crises of his \nhome State of Connecticut, has been truly exemplary. It has been a \nprivilege for me as a Senator to see these two Senators in action in \ntheir causes I just mentioned.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am sure Senator Blumenthal joins me. I wish to say to \nmy dear friend from Rhode Island--and he truly is a dear friend--that \nhis generosity of word and spirit is only equaled by his intelligence, \nhis diligence, and his foresightedness, not only on this issue but on \nso many other issues on which we are working. In fact, we are going to \nmake a call in a few minutes--he and I and a few of our colleagues and \nI think Senator Blumenthal as well--to talk about another of his \nissues. He is just such an intelligent thinker, and he is thinking \nahead of the curve on climate change. But delivery system reform in \nhealth care is another issue on which the Senator from Rhode Island has \ntaken leadership.\n  So I thank him for his kind words and just say ``right back at you, \nbaby.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank both of my colleagues. I am \nnot sure I can match their eloquence in describing their gifts and \ntheir contributions on this issue and so many others, but I hope they \nand others will join me in meeting with the present Sandy task force in \nseeking to remedy or correct perhaps some of the logjams and redtape \nand deficiencies in process that led the people of our States to wait \nfor so long before they saw relief in practical terms.\n  I thank them for their eloquence today and for their truly formidable \ncontribution on the issue of climate change and global warming and to \nthank them also for the very powerful contributions they have made on \nthe response to Superstorm Sandy that affected so many people in \nConnecticut.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Budget Conference\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an opportunity--\nactually something good that this body could do for the American people \nand for our economy and for the taxpayers. Tomorrow, the Senate budget \nconference that was established as part of this recent agreement that \nwas made over reopening the government and extending the debt limit \nwill meet. This will be the first public meeting of the group. We have \nhad some other meetings, including the one I just had with some of the \nMembers of that group, but this is the first opportunity for us to meet \nas House Members and Senate Members, Republicans and Democrats, in this \nbudget conference, and it could not come soon enough.\n  The opportunity we have with this group is that in the wake of what \nhappened at the beginning of this month--which was, again, a government \nshutdown and then a debt limit debate and then pushing right up against \nthe debt limit--the opportunity we have now is to finally deal with \nthis issue of government shutdowns and to deal with the underlying \nproblem of overspending that forces us to extend the debt limit time \nand time again.\n  So let's start with government shutdowns.\n  The agreement opened the government for 3 months. That is right. In \nJanuary, we once again come to this cliff where the government shuts \ndown unless we act. So Merry Christmas and Happy New Year everybody. In \nJanuary we hit this again.\n  It does not have to be that way. Earlier this year I introduced, with \nSenator Tester from Montana, bipartisan legislation that would have \nprevented the last shutdown and would prevent all shutdowns in the \nfuture. It is called, appropriately, the End Government Shutdowns Act. \nIt is pretty simple, and it addresses several critical issues we saw \nfirsthand during this last shutdown.\n  It would end the chaos we saw on Federal services and citizens who \ndepend on them. It would give government agencies the predictability \nthey need to plan their budgets based on these appropriations levels. \nIt would add certainty to the economy, and more certainty in the \neconomy is certainly needed right now as we try to bring back the jobs. \nIt would also take away the pressure for these haphazard, last-minute \nbudget deals, which inevitably have stuck in them little provisions \nthat nobody finds out about because they are all done at the last \nminute to avoid a government shutdown.\n  Here is how this would work: When we do not have spending bills \nagreed to by the time the fiscal year comes to an end--and that would \nbe October 1--then the spending continues just as it was the previous \nyear. So it is the same level of spending, except that automatically it \nwould begin to reduce spending after 120 days and 90 days. So Congress \nwould have 120 days to come together and figure out a budget. That is \nthe carrot. The stick is that after 120 days the spending would be \nratcheted down 1 percent and then again every 90 days another 1 \npercent.\n  I think it has become painfully obvious that Congress needs \nencouragement to get its work done, and this certainly would be \nencouragement. By the same token, we would not have these government \nshutdowns. That gradual decline in spending, by the way, would treat \nall spending equally. So all discretionary spending would be treated \nthe same way--no exceptions for liberal spending priorities or \nconservative spending priorities. It would be the same for everybody. \nBoth sides of Congress would feel the pain, and both sides then might \nbe more willing to actually get the work done.\n  Is this the ideal solution to end government shutdowns? No, it is \nnot. The ideal solution is that Congress actually does its work, which \nis our constitutional duty--the power of the purse--and that is to sit \ndown and have these appropriations bills pass. That requires oversight \nof the agencies and departments which are badly in need of it. It then \nrequires prioritizing spending in\n\n[[Page S7602]]\n\n12 different areas. That is how it should work. This legislation, the \nEnd Government Shutdowns Act, would actually encourage that to work, \nagain, because it would establish this situation where, instead of \ndoing a last-minute deal where you can kind of throw in these \nprovisions that Appropriations Committee members might want, you \nactually have to go through the process; otherwise, it just continues \nthe spending from the previous year and then ratchets it down over \ntime.\n  Sadly, Congress has shown it is pretty much incapable of doing \nappropriations bills without some sort of pressure. The Congress has \nnot completed all regular appropriations bills by the October 1 \ndeadline since 1997. Here in the Senate, actually, over the past 4 \nyears, during the current administration, the Obama administration, and \nunder Democratic control here for the last 4 years, we have passed all \nof one appropriations bill on time. So that is 1 out of 48 that has \nbeen done on time. It was a MILCON bill in about 2011, as I recall.\n  Congress does better with a deadline. Again, we see this with the \ndebt limit and with what we just went through these last few weeks. We \ncan do better. This legislation would keep the impetus for Congress to \nact without including the threat of another costly and destructive \nshutdown. I think it is a good idea. It is one that is already \nbipartisan. It should be adopted by both sides. We had a vote on it \nearlier this year. It got nearly half of this Chamber. I hope others \nwill take a look at it. I think particularly with what we have just \ngone through, it is something our constituents would think would make a \nlot of sense. I hope it gets the support it deserves in this body.\n  Of course, in addition to dealing with government shutdowns in this \nbudget conference that we are meeting on this week, we also have a \nchance to address the debt limit--which is going to come up soon also \nbecause February 7 is the date that was chosen there. Now some say, \nwell, the Treasury Department can use extraordinary measures to shift \nthat beyond February 7. I suppose they could. But instead, why not deal \nwith the underlying problem--why we need to extend the debt limit--\nwhich is the overspending.\n  It is as though you have maxed out on the credit card. It is a lot \nlike that. We can spend only at a certain level in Congress, and then \nwe have to have statutory authority to go beyond that limit. When you \nmax out on the credit card, you do not just go to the bank and say: I \nwould like to extend it. You have to deal with the underlying problem; \notherwise, you cannot keep your credit card and you cannot keep your \ncredit.\n  So dealing with the debt limit is the other part that I think gives \nus an opportunity. Over the past 2 weeks I know the administration has \nsaid repeatedly: Even though we would not negotiate on the debt ceiling \nbefore, even though the President refused to talk to Congress about \nit--which was unprecedented, by the way; no President in history has \never said that--but he said over the last couple weeks: If you all \nextend the debt limit and if you reopen government, then I will talk. \nSo now is the time to talk, and the President should talk. I have \nworked for two Presidents: President Bush 41 and President Bush 43. \nThey did talk to Congress about debt limits. Why? Because it is a tough \nvote, because our constituents get it, because it is akin to maxing out \non the credit card and they want to know we are not just going to \nextend it again without doing something about the underlying problem. \nSo this budget conference gives us the opportunity to do that, and I \nhope the administration will engage with us.\n  It has been 4 years since we have had a budget conference. Think \nabout that. The debt has gone up $5.9 trillion since we had the last \nbudget conference around here. Almost $6 trillion later we are sitting \ndown again, and things are only going to get worse if we do not do \nsomething to deal with the underlying problem.\n\n  The two-thirds of the budget that is on autopilot--the mandatory \nspending--obviously is where not just the biggest part of the budget is \nbut the fastest growing part of the budget. It includes vital programs \nto our seniors, for those in poverty--Medicaid, Medicare, Social \nSecurity--vital but unsustainable. These programs cannot be sustained \nin their current form. By the way, that is not me saying it. That comes \nfrom data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The \nPresident himself has talked about this. By the way, the Congressional \nBudget Office says that Social Security and health care entitlements \nalone are 100 percent of the long-term increase in deficits. Revenues \nare starting to pick up. The discretionary spending is now being \ncapped. The issue is this part that is on autopilot. By the way, it is \n66 percent of spending now. It is 77 percent of spending in 10 years. \nThe health care entitlements alone are going to increase 100 percent \nover the next 10 years based on what the Congressional Budget Office \nhas told us.\n  I have heard rumblings in the press that this upcoming budget \nconference is just going to kick the can further down the road; in \nother words, we are not going to deal with the issue. We are going to \nsay let's just extend the debt limit a little bit further and push off \nthe issue.\n  I think it is time for the can to kick back. If the can kicks back, \nthat means we will actually tackle some of these tough problems. After \nall, that is why the American people hired us. That is why they sent us \nhere. If we are not going to do it now, I do not know when we are going \nto do it. I think divided government is actually an opportunity to do \nit.\n  It is time for leadership in the Senate and the House, and certainly \nfrom the President. It is time to come to the table. As I said earlier, \nthe President has indicated he now is willing to do it. Do so in good \nfaith and try to put our country on a stable fiscal path. If we do \nnothing, by the way, if we allow these annual deficits to continue, \nthey will more than quadruple. Annual deficits will more than quadruple \nto $3.4 trillion within three decades. That is based on the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  We already have a debt that is about $140,000 per household in \nAmerica. We are talking about annual deficits quadrupling. If we let \nmandatory spending reach that point where it becomes 100 percent of the \ndeficit--which is what they project--if we allow our national debt to \nreach two and a half times the entire size of our economy--it is about \nthe size of our economy now, and it would go up to two and a half times \nthe size of our economy--it will be the next generation that will pay, \nand pay dearly, and our legacy will be one of bankruptcy, skyrocketing \ninterest rates, skyrocketing unemployment rates, and the collapse of \nthese vital programs we talked about earlier: Medicaid, Medicare, and \nSocial Security.\n  Again, this is not ideology; this is math. It is fact, and it is fact \nthat has been reiterated by the Congressional Budget Office, the \ntrustees of Social Security, the trustees of Medicare, their trust \nfunds time and time again.\n  This is our opportunity to begin to do something about it--at least \ntake the first steps--both in terms of ending government shutdowns, as \nI talked about, but also dealing with this underlying problem that \neverybody acknowledges and that has to be dealt with if we are not \ngoing to have for future generations these issues of bankruptcy, higher \ninterest rates, lower value of the dollar, higher unemployment.\n  The single greatest act of bipartisanship in this Congress over the \npast few decades has been overpromising and overspending. We created \nthis mess together, and we can only get out of it working together. I \nhave suggested where we can start: $600 billion in the President's own \nbudget. In his own budget he has $600 billion-plus in savings on \nmandatory spending over the next decade. But whatever we do, I think we \ncan call agree that we are tired of the gridlock, we are tired of the \nstalemates, we are tired of getting nothing done.\n  It is time to make some progress, and this is an opportunity to do \nit. These past few weeks have been trying. They have been tough on the \nAmerican people, as they have looked at us and said: Wow. Are these \nguys going to figure it out? And we just kicked the can down the road. \nBut we also set up this process and this structure. Let's take \nadvantage of it. Let's use this opportunity to do something important \nfor the future of our country and for the good of the people we \nrepresent. Let's seize it.\n  I yield back my time.\n\n[[Page S7603]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Deficit Reduction\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I say to the Presiding Officer, former \nGovernor Manchin, I wish to follow on the comments we just heard from \nSenator Portman, who, as he said, served in two administrations--in one \nof them as OMB Director, in the other as Trade Representative. Before \nthat he had a distinguished career in the House of Representatives. He \nis someone I am fortunate to serve with on the Finance Committee. I \nhave a lot of respect for his intellect and for his intellectual \nhonesty.\n  Before I talk about the real reason I came to the floor, I feel \ncompelled to say something. As former Governors, the Presiding Officer \nand I have made tough decisions on spending, we have made tough \ndecisions on revenues, and they are not always well received by people. \nThey are not always well received by people in our own party.\n  I like to say there are three or four things we need to do on this \nissue to make sure our deficits continue to head in the right \ndirection. I do not worship at the altar of a balanced budget every \nsingle year. But what I do believe is that when the economy is \nstrengthened and growing stronger, we ought to be having the deficit \nheading down, and when we are in a war or when we are in an economic \ndoldrum, then I think it is appropriate to, in some cases, deficit \nspend.\n  Four things we need to do if we are serious about deficit reduction: \nNo. 1, we need, in the President's words, entitlement reform that saves \nmoney, saves these programs for our children and our grandchildren, and \ndoes not savage old people or poor people. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, we need, in my view, tax reform that brings down the top \ncorporate rates--something more closely aligned with every other \ndeveloped nation in the world. At the same time we are doing that, we \nneed to generate some revenues for deficit reduction to match what we \nare doing on the spending side.\n  If you think about it, the Senator from Ohio knows and the Senator \nfrom West Virginia knows about tax expenditures: Tax breaks, tax \ncredits, tax deductions, tax loopholes, tax gaps, add up over the next \n10 years anywhere from $12 trillion to $15 trillion. We are going to \nspend more money out of the Treasury for tax expenditures than we are \ngoing to spend on all of our appropriations bills combined. If we could \nsomehow capture 5 percent of $12 trillion over the next 10 years for \ndeficit reduction, that is $600 billion. If we can match that in a \nBowles-Simpson number, such as $2 of deficit reduction on the \nexpenditure side and $1 on the revenue side, we could do about another \n$2 trillion on deficit reduction on top of what we have already done. \nIs that a grand compromise that I want and I think the Senator from \nOhio wants, I know the Senator from West Virginia wants?\n  It is not a grand compromise, but I would call it a baby grand. A \nbaby grand is certainly better than kicking that can down the road. The \nlast time we kicked the can down the road at the beginning of this \nyear, I remember saying on this floor: We kicked a rather large can \ndown the road not very far. I am tired of doing that. I do not want us \nto do that.\n  We have maybe our last best chance here in this budget conference in \norder to do the kinds of things I talked about. Democrats do not want \nto give on entitlements. I am willing to do that. But I am only willing \nto do that if Republicans will give on tax reform that generates some \nrevenues.\n  I mentioned there are three things to do. The third thing is to look \nin every nook and cranny of the Federal Government--everything we do. \nThe Senator from Ohio is a member of the Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs Committee. He knows that we focus--we have large, \nbroad investigative powers, oversight powers, authority over the whole \nFederal Government. There are all kinds of ways to save money, all \nkinds of ways to save money in this government of ours, just as there \nare all kinds in big corporations, big businesses. What we need to do \nis, in everything we do, look at that and say: How do we get a better \nresult for less money in everything we do?\n  I do not know if my friends from Ohio and West Virginia hear this \nfrom their constituents, but I hear from Delaware constituents and \nfolks outside of my State these words: I do not mind paying more taxes, \nI just do not want you to waste my money or I do not want to pay more \ntaxes, but if I do, I do not want you to waste my money. I do not want \nto waste your money or mine.\n  The fourth thing we need to do to be serious about moving the economy \nand getting out of this kind of rut we are in right now is to be able \nto make sure we have some money around that we can invest in the things \nwe know will strengthen our economy. Foremost among those is a strong \nworkforce, capable workforce. The second thing is infrastructure, \nbroadly defined, not just transportation: roads, highways, bridges; not \njust ports, not just airports, not just railroads, but broadband, all \nkinds of infrastructure-related items.\n  The third thing is R, research and development that will lead to \ntechnologies that can be commercialized, turned into products, goods, \nand services we can sell all over the world.\n  The fourth thing we need to do is to do an even better job--and \nSenator Portman was the leader as our trade ambassador. He knows what \nit is all about in terms of knocking down trade barriers. But while we \ndo entitlement reform, we do tax reform, while we look in every nook \nand cranny of the Federal Government, investing in the three areas I \nmentioned, we have got to make sure when we develop these new products \nand services that we can sell them around the world without impediment, \nwe can knock down trade barriers. The Senator has done a lot of work in \nthat regard as well.\n  As the Senator leaves the floor, I will say there are many things for \nus to work on. I hope we will.\n\n\n                          Archuleta Nomination\n\n  That is not why I came to the floor, but I thank the Senator for \nletting me join in that colloquy with the Senator from Ohio. The reason \nI came to the floor is to say a word on behalf of the President's \nnominee to be our next Director of the Office of Personnel Management. \nWe have not had a confirmed OPM Director for the last half year. If you \nlook across the Federal Government, the executive branch of the Federal \nGovernment, it reminds me a lot of what I call Swiss cheese, executive \nbranch Swiss cheese.\n  We start with the Department of Homeland Security. We do not have a \nconfirmed Secretary. We have one nominated, just nominated, just \nstarting to go through the vetting process in the Senate. We have not \nhad one for a month. The Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security--we do \nnot have a confirmed Deputy Secretary. We have had ``acting'' for a \nnumber of weeks now, months. While the people who are in the acting \ncapacity are very good people, very able people, it is not the same as \nhaving a confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security or confirmed Deputy \nSecretary.\n  There are any number of other positions in Homeland Security. As \nchair of Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, I probably \nfocus more on that than on the OMB, Office of Management and Budget, \ntrying to make sure that Sylvia Burwell from Hinton, WV--the Presiding \nOfficer knows her well. As a guy who grew up in West Virginia a little \nbit, born there, spent some time in Hinton, I have a huge respect for \nher. We worked very hard to get her management team, her senior \nleadership team confirmed. They are confirmed. She has a great team. We \nneed to make sure that in our other departments we have from the top to \nway down the ranks strong people in confirmed positions.\n  OPM, Office of Personnel Management. The President nominated a woman \nI had never heard of earlier this year. He nominated a woman named \nKatherine Archuleta. Katherine Archuleta--I never met her, never heard \nof her. The first thing I learned about her is she has been the \npolitical director in the President's reelection campaign. She must \nhave done a pretty good job if the results were to be examined. Maybe \nsome people are troubled by that. If we stopped there, that does not \ndefine who she is or what she has done.\n  If somebody looked at my resume while I have been a Senator, if they \nthink that is all I have ever done in my\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\nlife, they would be wrong. I have been privileged to be Governor of my \nState, leader, and, as the Presiding Officer has, chairman of the \nNational Governors Association, one of the great privileges of my life. \nI was privileged to be a Congressman for a little bit, treasurer of my \nState, and before that a naval flight officer for 20 some years, \nretired Navy captain. That is who I am. That is not all of who I am, \nbut that is a better resume. If people say all I have ever done is my \ncurrent job or my last job, they would say: Well, he is not very well \nrounded.\n  I want us to take a minute and say--I am going to date myself on \nthis, but a guy named Paul Harvey used to do the news. He used to say \npage 1, and then he would say page 2. I am going to go to page 2. Page \n2 is a little resume of some other things she has done with her life. I \nwant to quote one of our old colleagues, Ken Salazar, who has known her \nfor decades and hear what he has to say about her. She was born and \nraised in Colorado, I think has spent almost more than half of her life \nthere. She has been, from time to time, among other things, chief of \nstaff at the U.S. Department of Labor. She did that for several years. \nShe also served as senior advisor on policy and initiatives for the \ncity and county of Denver, CO. There are more people who live in the \ncity and county around Denver than live in a lot of States, including \nmy own. She has done that job.\n  Before that, a number of years ago, she had a number of roles in the \noffice of mayor of Denver, for almost a decade, including deputy chief \nof staff. In a city that size, again as big or bigger than a number of \nStates, that is a lot of responsibility.\n  She has been a senior policy advisor at the U.S. Department of \nEnergy.\n  She has also served at the U.S. Department of Transportation, first \nas deputy chief of staff, and then later as chief of staff.\n  She has been a professor at the University of Denver. She has done \nall kinds of things. But she is a whole lot more than what people see \nand say: Well, I know what her last job was. She has done a whole lot \nbefore that. I think that helps prepare her for this job.\n  There has been a bunch of people who have been nominated to serve as \nOffice of Personnel Management Director since I guess the 1970s. I \nthink this is the first time we have ever had a situation where the \nPresident's nominee--I do not care what party, Democrat or Republican--\nwhere the OPM nominee has required cloture or even a rollcall vote \nsince the agency was created in 1978. That is 35 years ago.\n  I want to quote Ken Salazar, one of my dearest friends, who was a \nSenator, went on to become Secretary of the Interior, who has known \nKatherine Archuleta for 25, 30 years, really all of her adult life. \nHere is what Ken Salazar says about Katherine Archuleta. He says she is \na ``terrific'' human being. He goes on to say she ``helped create \nmodern Denver'' as we know it as deputy chief of staff through Mayor \nPena. She led economic development efforts throughout the city. She was \ninstrumental in the creation of the new Denver International Airport. \nKen went on to say she was ``a star of the Clinton team in the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation.'' Star.\n  I say to my friends and colleagues, we have to get past this \nsituation--I do not care if it is a Democrat President or Republican \nPresident--where we leave these gaping holes in leadership in confirmed \npositions. It is not good for our country; it is not good for these \ndepartments; it is not good for morale; it is not good for efficiency. \nWe are interested in getting work done.\n  You can disable the government by shutting it down or you can disable \nthe government and make it less effective, less efficient, by making \nsure we do not have key people in the top leadership positions. It \nmakes a difference if people are confirmed as secretaries, deputy \nsecretaries, and these other positions.\n  As the agency responsible for managing our Federal workforce, OPM's \nmission is critical to ensuring that our government runs efficiently. \nUnfortunately, vacancies at the top levels of leadership have limited \nOPM's ability to fulfill its mandate. They have backlogs in terms of \nthe processing they are supposed to be doing in job applications and \nothers, people applying for pensions. They need to be addressed.\n  In Katherine Archuleta's hearing before a subcommittee chaired by \nSenator Tester, one of the things she made clear is that she would make \nthat her priority, going after the backlog, which I would say God bless \nher if she is confirmed. I hope she will be.\n  But at any given moment, we are lacking critical leadership in any \nnumber of positions in just about every agency. It undermines the \neffectiveness of our government. While Congress and the administration \nhave taken some steps to address this problem, the fact remains we \nstill have more work to do to ensure we have got the talented people in \nplace to make these critical decisions.\n  This week, we consider the President's nomination of Katherine \nArchuleta to be the next Director of OPM, Office of Personnel \nManagement. I have talked a little bit about her background. One of the \nother people who knows her pretty well, another Senator from Colorado, \nis Senator Udall. She was actually introduced at her confirmation \nhearings along with Michael Bennet. Here is what Senator Udall said \nabout Katrina Archuleta. He said, ``Throughout her career, Katherine \nhas demonstrated her ability to lead, to motivate and to work \nconstructively with a diverse range of people and personalities.''\n  Her story is a story of firsts. Although neither of her parents \ncompleted high school, they worked tirelessly to create better \nopportunities for their children. Throughout her career, she served as \nan example for women and Latinos and would be the first Latina Director \nof OPM.\n  The President nominated her to this critical position back in May. We \nheld a hearing to consider her nomination--Senator Jon Tester held it. \nWe voted her out of committee shortly thereafter. At her confirmation \nhearing, Ms. Archuleta committed to quickly taking steps to identify \nsome of OPM's challenges, such as continuing to implement the \nmultistate plan under the Affordable Care Act, reducing the retirement \nclaims backlog to ensure retirees receive their full pension benefits \nwithout serious delays, which many retirees see today.\n  As to the recruiting and retaining the next generation of Federal \nemployees, I think we have a nominee who is qualified. We have a \nnominee who has been vetted. We have a nominee who is ready to go to \nwork. It is our responsibility to give her a swift vote, a thoughtful \nvote, but a swift vote here on the Senate floor, I hope this week, so \nshe can go to work, take the reins at OPM, and begin directing this \ncritical agency with oversight from us.\n  When the Presiding Officer was Governor of his State of West \nVirginia, when I was privileged to be Governor of my State, the \ntradition in Delaware is the Governor would nominate the people to \nserve on his or her cabinet. The tradition in our State was to nominate \ndivision directors under the cabinet secretaries. The tradition in my \nState is that the legislature, the senate to which the nominees were \nsent, would hold hearings, and would vote up or down without delay on \nthose nominations. I think in the 8 years I was privileged to serve as \nGovernor of my State, every one of them was confirmed. I do not think I \never lost a nomination for a cabinet secretary or for division \ndirector. That is the way we do business in Delaware. That is the way \nwe ought to do business here.\n  If you have a nominee who is qualified, who has good integrity, is \ngoing to work hard, surround themselves with good people and has a \ntrack record he or she can be proud of, that nominee deserves a vote. \nLet's give this nominee a vote and let's give her a chance to go to \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                            Superstorm Sandy\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Today it has been exactly 1 year since Superstorm \nSandy hit my home State of New York and the surrounding region. Today \nis a very solemn day where we pause to ponder the unimaginable loss of \n61 precious lives and the great collective pain as countless other \nlives were shattered. Over 300,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and \nbusinesses lay in rubble. Over 250,000 businesses were affected, many \nof which are still unable to open their doors.\n\n[[Page S7605]]\n\n  There is something else to remember today. In the days and weeks that \nfollowed Superstorm Sandy, we also saw the absolute best of New York. \nWe know New Yorkers are a resilient bunch. We get knocked down, but we \nget right back up.\n  As I traveled all across New York City, I saw neighbors coming \ntogether, going door to door to help the homebound, donating resources, \nvolunteering their time, clearing debris. In the Rockaways I saw \nhundreds of residents create an impromptu bustling plaza of hot food, \nclothing, and anything people might need.\n  I remember talking to one small business owner in Staten Island whose \nrestaurant was nearly split in two by a boat from a nearby marina, and \nhe simply said to me: ``We will rebuild this better than it was \nbefore,'' before agreeing to have dinner together this time next year \nin that very spot where that boat was resting. He said yes, and we had \nlunch at his restaurant only a few months ago. It was amazing.\n  In Westchester, a small business owner gave me a hug, and she vowed \nshe would rebuild. She said defiantly, ``This is our community.''\n  On Long Island, I walked the streets of Lindenhurst, Massapequa, and \nvisited Long Beach and Fire Island. While the devastation I saw was \nawful, I have never met more resilient and compassionate people. I \nwitnessed homeowners struggling to pick up their own pieces and to get \nit out of the way to help neighbors, sharing food, sharing water \nsupplies, giving each other rides to the stores, sharing generators, \nand clearing each others' debris.\n  While the road to recovery is very long and very hard, New Yorkers \nwill rebuild. They will rebuild stronger, but we all have to do our \npart. Too many communities are still recovering and rebuilding. Some \nfamilies are actually still homeless, living in trailers or confined to \nthe second floor of their homes and still waiting for additional \nassistance. Too many homeowners have not yet received the funding to \nrepair their homes and their businesses. Too often, those who are \nstruggling to rebuild have been caught in redtape.\n  Throughout the past year, I have pushed to change some of the Federal \npolicies that have stood in the way of recovery. We have had some \nsuccesses. We were successful at pushing FEMA to extend critical \ndeadlines for Sandy survivors to document their losses, so that those \nwho have had trouble getting back into their homes are not prevented \nfrom filing flood insurance claims.\n  We were able to get the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nto relax regulations that would have prevented substantially damaged \nhomes from accessing critical recovery funds. We received assurances \nfrom the Army Corps of Engineers that they will fund critical shore \nprotection projects at full Federal expense, ensuring that these \nprojects can move forward quickly without having to wait for our \ncommunities to find the matching funds out of very tough and local \nstruggling budgets that are already stretched too thin.\n  That is not enough. For all of our successes, we are still facing so \nmany challenges. There is still far too much redtape getting in between \nfamilies and recovery. My office hears every single day from homeowners \nand families who are struggling just to move forward.\n  Many of us are working on a bipartisan bill to postpone the \npotentially disastrous flood insurance rate increases coming into \neffect as a result of the Biggert-Waters flood insurance reform law. I \nurge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this bipartisan bill that was \nintroduced by Senator Menendez and Senator Isakson that would delay the \npremium increases set to go into effect until after FEMA has completed \na study and provided Congress with a plan to make the rates more \naffordable. Our families working so hard to rebuild, frankly, deserve \nnothing less.\n  Some homeowners, even as they do rebuild, have started seeing their \nrates increase. This would cause so many of our constituents to be \nforced out of their homes and communities that they love, that they \nhave lived in their whole lives. This is why the Menendez-Isakson bill \nis so critical and why I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support this commonsense legislation.\n  As we focus on providing communities with all of the resources they \nneed to rebuild from Sandy, the Federal Government is partnering with \nStates, local governments, the private sector, and academia to develop \nsolutions that will protect us from the next disaster. We know that for \nevery dollar spent to make our homes, businesses, and infrastructure \nmore resilient, $4 is saved in potential recovery costs down the road.\n  Earlier this year Senator Wicker and I introduced the STRONG Act, \nwhich stands for Strengthening the Resiliency of Our Nation on the \nGround. This bipartisan bill seeks to build on the progress that has \nbeen made locally by requiring the Federal Government to develop a \nnational resiliency strategy, assess where there are gaps and \nopportunities for improvements. It also creates a new information \nportal for both the public and private sectors to share information \nabout how to strengthen our communities and protect against future \nextreme weather threats.\n  We have come a long way in the past year, but I am very sad to say we \nhave so much more work to be done. Our communities are working as hard \nas ever to recover, but we have to work equally as hard toward \nrebuilding and being better prepared for the next storm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Later this week we will hit the 1-month anniversary of \nthe launch of President Obama's health insurance exchanges. My question \nis, what have we learned the past 4 weeks? We know the rollout of the \nexchanges and the healthcare.gov Web site, Americans would agree, has \nbeen disastrous.\n  Last week the Associated Press ran a headline about what people in my \nhome State of Wyoming had experienced. It said: ``National health \ninsurance site sputters in Wyoming.''\n  The article goes on to talk about the health care law, the Web site, \nand says: ``Wyoming Insurance Commissioner Tom Hirsig said Monday that \nhe's personally been unable to register on the Federal Government's \nWyoming site despite trying every day.''\n  The insurance commissioner from the State of Wyoming has been unable \nto register on the Federal Government's Wyoming site despite trying \nevery day starting October 1. This is the same story we have seen all \nacross the country.\n  We have also learned over the past 4 weeks that the President's \nhealth care law is much more than just a failed Web site. What we know \nis that there is sticker shock hitting people all across the country as \nthey start shopping and find that higher premiums are what they are \nfacing. They are going to be paying much higher premiums if they are \nable to buy health insurance, if they are able to get through the \nexchange.\n  CBS News had the story of one woman in Florida whose health insurance \nwill cost 11 times what she is currently paying--from $54 a month to \n$591 a month.\n  Over the past 4 weeks, another thing we have learned is that many \npeople have received notices in the mail--cancellation notices--from \ntheir insurance companies. They are being told that the insurance \npolicies, the coverage they have had, is being cancelled. Only a small \nnumber of people have been able to get insurance through the government \nexchanges so far. We have seen that over the last month.\n  In testimony today in the House hearing, a person from the \nadministration said they cannot tell us how many people have been \nunable to get insurance through the exchanges, but we know that \nhundreds of thousands of people are losing the insurance they had.\n  Here is what one woman told CBS: ``What I have right now is what I'm \nhappy with, and I just want to know why I can't keep what I have. Why \ndo I have to be forced into something else?''\n  Like many Americans, this is a person who actually believed President \nObama when he promised that if people liked the insurance they had, \nthey could keep it. Now she learned under the President's health care \nlaw, it is not only a Web site, it is a broken promise. It turns out if \nthe White\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\nHouse likes your plan, then you can keep it. If the White House doesn't \nlike your plan, then you are out of luck, you can't keep it.\n  Yesterday the Obama administration finally admitted that millions of \npeople across the country will lose their insurance. We know all of \nthese ways that the President's health care law is more than a failed \nWeb site, so the big question now is what don't we know yet? What is \nthere that the American people don't know about the health care law? \nHow much worse are things going to get before the White House admits \nthe entire law is broken?\n  We have seen one headline after another about problems with the \nhealth care law that the Obama administration knew about and would not \nadmit. There has been one revelation after another about troubles they \nhid from the American people and did so deliberately. What else is this \nadministration not telling the American people?\n  The White House may have finally said publicly that millions of \npeople are going to lose the insurance they have but, according to NBC \nNews, the Obama administration has known that for at least 3 years.\n  When the train first went off the tracks, the White House said its \nWeb site crashed because they said millions of people tried to use the \nWeb site at the same time. According to the Washington Post, the \nlimited testing the administration did before the launch found the site \nwould crash if only a few hundred people used it.\n  It is fascinating. The Democrats' whole law was based on the idea \nthat Washington, government, is capable of running America's health \ncare system competently. What we have seen is gross incompetence. It \nturns out that Washington can't even set up a Web site competently, and \nit looks as if they knew it.\n  Computer programmers warned about the rush to get the Web site done \nby October 1. Instead of hitting the pause button, which they should \nhave done, hitting the pause button until it could get things working, \nthe White House pushed on. This is what we learned from some of the \ncontractors who built the Web site. This Web site cost the taxpayers \nover $400 million so far and the bills are still coming in.\n  These contractors testified last week in the House that full tests of \nthe site should have started months in advance, but testing didn't \nhappen until the last 2 weeks of September. Who decided to go ahead \nanyway? President Obama's administration. They are the ones who \ndecided.\n  Contractors thought if the registration process wasn't going to work, \nthen maybe it would help to set up a way for people to shop for plans \nand get information without registering. The administration told them \nto ``deprioritize'' that plan. What a government word, ``deprioritize'' \nthat plan.\n  Then when the Web site turned out to be a complete disaster, a \nsystems failure, the Obama administration tried to hide how bad it was. \nIt asked the largest health insurer in North Dakota not to tell anybody \nhow many people have signed up for insurance through the exchange--the \nadministration telling the State: Don't open up, don't tell people the \ntruth. Why not? Because as of last week only 14 people had been able to \nsign up for the companies' plans. The numbers are so embarrassing for \nthe administration they have been trying to cover up. They continued to \ncover up today when there was testimony and no numbers were given. It \nis the same reason the administration won't say how many people have \nsigned up nationwide. They know how many people have signed up, but \nthey refuse to tell the American people, the taxpayers, the people who \npay the taxes and see their money being wasted by this administration \nand this government. There are new problems with this health care law \nevery day.\n  The Web site was supposed to be the easy part, but to me it is the \ntip of the iceberg. The Web site failures are just the tip of the \niceberg.\n  What else does the White House know about? By now they should know \nabout cancelled coverage because it looks as if millions of Americans \nhave already received notices from their insurance companies that they \nhave lost their insurance, their insurance has been cancelled.\n  There have been premium increases. People have talked about the fact \nthat their premiums are going up, and there are higher copays and \ndeductibles to deal with. People are losing access to the doctor. Plus \nthere are always the issues of fraud and identity theft.\n  What else are we going to learn this week when Secretary Sebelius \ntestifies in the House tomorrow? Will she actually open up? Will she \ngive them the truth? Will she give them the real numbers, or will she \nnot admit to what is actually going on and refuse to answer the \nquestions?\n  How much worse does the Obama administration's incompetence get? What \nwill it take for the President to admit that his health care law has \nbeen a train wreck and they will have to delay it for at least a \nyear? We know he is going to have to do it eventually. There is no way \nall of these problems are going to get fixed quickly, and he is going \nto have to delay the individual mandate--the mandate that says every \nAmerican must buy or have and prove they have health insurance. And who \nis the enforcer? The IRS--the Internal Revenue Service. The President \nshould just go ahead and do it now and also delay all the other parts \nof the law, not just the mandate.\n\n  It is time for President Obama to really come clean with the American \npeople about what his administration knew and then come to the table to \nwork with Republicans and give people the real health care reform that \nthey need, want, and deserve so people can get the care they want from \na doctor they choose at a lower cost.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my colleague \nfrom Wyoming.\n  Here in Washington and, indeed, throughout the country everyone is \ntalking about the ObamaCare Web site. No doubt that is a serious \nconcern. The healthcare.gov Web site has been, to put it bluntly, a \ndebacle. I don't know of a single Member of Congress, Democrat or \nRepublican, who would say otherwise.\n  That said, we need to be clear about something: The problems with \nObamaCare go much deeper than a faulty Web site. Sure, the \nadministration would have the American people believe that the problems \nwith this law are simply technical in nature and that once they bring \nin technical experts to fix the Web site, all will be right with the \nworld. But let's not kid ourselves. The problems with ObamaCare are \nfundamental and systemic. The administration may very well get the Web \nsite up and running in the next few weeks, and they should, but that \nwon't fix the health care law. I would like to take a few minutes today \nto talk about some of the problems facing ObamaCare that have nothing \nto do with the Web site.\n  When he was trying to get the law passed, President Obama repeatedly \npromised Americans that ``if you like your current health plan, you \nwill be able to keep it.'' This promise was central to the President's \nefforts to sell ObamaCare to the American people, and as it turns out, \nit was all a lie. Now even the White House admits that millions of \nAmericans will not be able to keep their health plan under the law, and \nif recent news reports are to be believed, they have known this for \nyears. Experts have predicted that as many as 16 million Americans may \nlose their existing coverage due to ObamaCare's new requirements. \nAccording to the NBC News story from yesterday, the Obama \nadministration has known about this for at least 3 years. We have known \nabout it as well.\n  Consumers throughout the country are already receiving cancellation \nletters from their insurance providers. For example, in New Jersey \n800,000 individuals are being dropped from their existing plans. Kaiser \nPermanente in California has sent notices to 160,000 people informing \nthem their current coverage will end. Florida Blue is ending policies \nof 300,000 customers due to ObamaCare. This isn't some unforeseen or \nunintended consequence of the law. On the contrary, it is precisely \nwhat was intended when the law was put into place.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the President's health care law includes \na mountain of new mandates and requirements for health insurance plans. \nAny plans that fail to meet those onerous requirements are invalidated \nunder the law. True enough, the law provides that plans that were in \neffect as of\n\n[[Page S7607]]\n\nMarch 2010 will be grandfathered in, allowing consumers who prefer to \nkeep those policies to do so even if the plan's don't meet the law's \nrequirements. However, the Department of Health and Human Services has, \nthrough regulations, all but eliminated the protections enjoyed by \nthose in existing plans by saying that the grandfathering provision \ndoes not apply to plans that have undergone any changes--even small \nchanges to deductibles or copayments--since 2010. Under this \nrequirement, many of the plans that were in place before passage of \nObamaCare, particularly those in the individual health insurance \nmarket, will fail to pass muster. That is why we are seeing hundreds of \nthousands of Americans being dropped from their current insurance plans \nand why the same fate is certain to befall millions more.\n  As I said, the Obama administration knew about these problems a long \ntime ago. In fact, regulations issued in July of 2010 estimated that \nbecause of normal turnover in the individual insurance market, 40 to 67 \npercent of consumers would not be able to keep their policies. Let me \nrepeat that. The administration knew in July 2010 that at least 40 to \n67 percent of consumers in the individual market would not be able to \nkeep their plans in place. Yet the President never took back his \npromise: ``If you like your current health plan, you will be able to \nkeep it.'' This, quite frankly, is preposterous.\n  The response we are getting from the administration is that, sure, \nmany people will lose their existing health insurance, but it will be \nreplaced by better, cheaper options. This claim is at odds with the \nfacts. For many people, health expenses will increase under the new \nplan as a result of higher premiums, higher deductibles, and higher \ncopays. One study from the Manhattan Institute found that individual \nmarket premiums will increase 99 percent for men and 62 percent for \nwomen nationwide. For others, the new plans may not cover visits to \ntheir current doctor or the hospital they have used in the past. That \nis because insurers are reducing the number of doctors and hospitals \ncovered by plans in the exchanges in order to reduce premium prices. \nThese changes are a direct result of ObamaCare's new requirements and \nmandates.\n  I have received letters from my constituents from all over Utah who \nare scared, who are angry, and who are confused about the changes they \nare facing. For example, Brenton in Provo, UT, currently has a high-\ndeductible plan and uses a health savings account. This arrangement \nworks well for Brenton and his family, and they would like to keep it. \nUnfortunately, Brenton's plan has been canceled due to ObamaCare. The \nplan he will be required to purchase is more expensive and includes \ncoverage he doesn't want. There is also Kathy from Salt Lake City, who \nwrote to tell me her deductible will increase from $3,000 to $5,000, \nher copays for doctor visits will increase by 30 percent, and her \ncopays for prescription drugs will increase to 50 percent. Kathy let me \nknow that as a result of these changes, her health care expenses will \nnow be higher than her income.\n  Even those who were in favor of the law are now finding it is not \nbeing implemented as they expected. A recent L.A. Times article \nprofiled a young woman who was shocked by the 50-percent rate hike she \nreceived as a result of the health care law. She was quoted as saying, \n``I was all for Obamacare until I found out I was paying for it.'' That \nis a refrain I think we will be hearing from a number of people who \nsupported ``health care reform.''\n\n  Increased costs aren't the only problem consumers will be facing \nunder ObamaCare. There are other serious, more subtle problems that \nhave yet to be addressed. For example, some consumers may have their \npersonal information compromised by an ObamaCare navigator or by \nsubmitting an application to the federally facilitated marketplace, the \nFederal data services hub, or one of the Affordable Care Act call \ncenters. I have warned about that for a number of months--that they are \nmoving too fast and not doing the job well enough--and a lot of people \nare going to get hurt.\n  Social Security numbers, employment information, birth dates, health \nrecords, and tax returns are among the personal data that will be \ntransmitted to this data hub, resulting in an unprecedented amount of \ninformation collected in one place by a government entity. Every piece \nof information someone would need to steal an individual's identity or \naccess their confidential credit information will be available at the \nfingertips of a skilled hacker, providing a gold mine for data thieves \nand a staggering security threat to consumers. The entire system, \nincluding the data hub--a new information-sharing network that allows \nState and Federal agencies to verify this information--has not gone \nunder any independent review to determine whether the data that is \nentered is secure. This means an individual's personal and financial \nrecords may be at serious risk of becoming available to data thieves.\n  I have already been to the floor several times to discuss these \nissues. I am here again today because as of yet there has been no \nsolution--or should I say no solutions--to these problems. In fact, the \nObamaCare exchanges are less than a month old and data breaches are \nalready occurring at the State level. A recent CBS News story featured \na Minnesota insurance broker who was looking for information about \nassisting with ObamaCare implementation. Instead, what landed in his \nin-box last month was a document filled with the names, Social Security \nnumbers, and other pieces of personal information belonging to his \nfellow Minnesotans. In one of the first breaches of the new ObamaCare \nonline marketplaces, an employee of the Minnesota marketplace, called \nMNsure, accidentally emailed him a document containing personally \nidentifying information for more than 2,400 insurance agents. While the \nincident was resolved, the broker said it raised serious questions for \nhim as to whether those who sign up for MNsure can be confident their \ndata is safe. These types of incidents are only going to increase as \ntime goes on if rigorous testing is not performed to ensure that the \ndata hub is sufficiently secure.\n  Despite assurances by the chief technology officer for the \nadministration in early September that ``we have completed security \ntesting and received certification to operate,'' we all now know that \nall the testing had not been completed until just days before the \nOctober 1 launch date and that no third party--no third-party expert--\nhad a chance to review it.\n  But there is much we don't know. What kind of testing was done? Who \ndid the testing? What did they look for? What were the results? And \nperhaps most importantly, what are the risks of using the Web site? To \nhelp get answers to these questions, today several of my colleagues on \nthe Senate Finance Committee and I are sending a letter to Secretary \nSebelius asking detailed questions about the testing protocols, what \nwaivers were received with respect to the testing requirements, and any \nand all results of the limited testing that did occur. Hopefully, that \nwill enable Congress and the American people to better understand \nexactly what is broken with the system and help to ensure it does not \nhappen again.\n  These questions and problems demonstrate why it is imperative that \nthe Government Accountability Office--GAO--independently verify that \nsufficient privacy and security controls are in place for the data hub \nand the entire Federal marketplace so that Congress has independent \nassurance that the necessary controls exist and that taxpayers know \ntheir personal information is secure. That is why I introduced S. 1525, \nthe Trust But Verify Act, which calls on the GAO to conduct such a \nreview and delays implementation of the exchanges until the review is \ncompleted. The bill currently has 32 Senate cosponsors.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, the problems with ObamaCare are \nnumerous and fundamental. As I said before, this law was bad policy \nwhen we debated it, it was bad policy when the Democrats forced it \nthrough the Congress, and it remains bad policy today.\n  I have little doubt the administration can eventually get the Web \nsite up and running. They would have us believe that once that task is \naccomplished, everything will be fine. But that is simply not the case. \nThey can't\n\n[[Page S7608]]\n\nsay everything will be fine when millions of Americans are losing their \nexisting health coverage as a direct result of the health care law. \nThey can't say everything will be fine when health care costs are \ncontinuing to skyrocket even though the President claimed his health \nlaw would bring costs down. And they can't say everything will be fine \nwhen consumers' personal information is at serious risk because the \nadministration didn't take the proper precautions with its new data \nsystem.\n  As I said, the healthcare.gov Web site has been a debacle and the \nPresident is right to recognize it as such, but it would be a huge \nmistake to simply write off the problems with ObamaCare as a simple IT \nproblem.\n  My own position on ObamaCare is very clear. I support repealing the \nlaw in its entirety. As more and more Americans lose their health \ncoverage--coverage they shopped for and liked--and face outlandish \ncosts as a result of the law, I believe that position will eventually \nbe vindicated. In the meantime, I think we can all agree that the law \nis simply not ready for prime time and that at the very least it should \nbe delayed so we can protect the American people from further harm.\n  I have made this call before and I am sure I will make it again. \nToday, with all the new information we have received--the broken Web \nsite, the security problems, the skyrocketing costs, and the millions \nof Americans losing existing coverage--I hope my friends on the other \nside of the aisle will begin to see the light. I hope they will finally \nsee what happens when one party tries to take on something as vast and \nas complicated as our health care system all on its own without any \nhelp from the other side.\n  I hope that they would work with us to come up with real solutions to \nour Nation's health care problems. I will keep waiting, and if the \nproblems we have seen in the last few weeks are any indication, I \nshould not have to wait too much longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Under the previous order, all \npostcloture time is yielded back.\n  The question occurs on the nomination.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Senator Thad Cochran's 12,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, our good friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Mississippi, is about to cast his 12,000th vote, a truly \nremarkable accomplishment by a remarkable man. He was the first \nRepublican to be elected to the Senate from Mississippi since \nReconstruction. A few years ago he was named by Time magazine as one of \nthe 10 most effective Members of the Senate, and they called him ``the \nquiet persuader.''\n  For those of you who have recently arrived at the Senate, if you have \nnot had any dealings with Senator Cochran yet, you will find that \nindeed he is the quiet persuader. In fact, it may be the secret to his \nsuccess.\n  He has had an extraordinarily accomplished career here in the Senate, \nand I wanted to take a few moments to congratulate him, not only on his \nservice to his State and the Nation but to our institution.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am sorry I am a little late here. I see \nmy colleague, the senior Senator from Mississippi. I have had the \npleasure of knowing Thad Cochran during my entire stay in Washington. \nHe is a fine man. He has had experience in the House and the Senate, as \nI have. I have always appreciated his courtesies. He is just such a \nfine human being.\n  Before his election to Congress, he served honorably in the U.S. \nNavy. He was a lieutenant in the Navy. After his tour of duty, while \nattending law school at Ole Miss, Senator Cochran returned to active \nduty for his naval work, even while he was going to law school. After \ngraduating from law school in 1965, he joined the very prestigious law \nfirm Watkins & Eager in Jackson, MS, and in less than 2 years he became \na partner in that law firm--which was remarkable. It speaks well for \nhis acumen in the law and for being a nice person.\n  His break from public service did not last long, though. From the \nNavy he ran for Congress in 1972 and served in the House for 6 years \nbefore running for the Senate. He served as Chairman of the Republican \nConference, the Agriculture Committee, and the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Throughout his time in Congress, Senator Cochran has promoted the \nbest interests of Mississippi's citizens. Even when we were on \ndifferent sides of the issues, I always respected Senator Cochran's \nservice to his country, his dedication to the people of Mississippi and \nto the people of this country. I congratulate him on this impressive \nmilestone and appreciate most of all his friendship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Richard F. Griffin, Jr., of the District \nof Columbia, to be General Counsel of the National Labor Relations \nBoard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 222 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Baldwin\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coons\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Chiesa\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Lee\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Inhofe\n       \n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, before the Internet, RCA knew how \nmany records Elvis was selling every day. Before the Internet, Ford \nknew how many cars they were selling every day. Before the Internet, \nMcDonald's could tell you how many hamburgers it sold each day. Yet the \nObama administration cannot tell us how many Americans have tried to \nsign up for ObamaCare. They can't tell us how many people have tried to \nsign up for ObamaCare. They haven't told us what level of insurance \nthey bought or in what ZIP Code they live. Not only can they not tell \nus, they have done their best to keep us from finding out.\n  With WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden spilling our beans every day, \nwhat's happening on the ObamaCare exchanges is the only secret left in \nWashington. The National Security Agency should learn some lessons from \nSecretary Sebelius.\n  We shouldn't have to rely on anonymous sources to get basic \ninformation about what's happening with the ObamaCare exchanges.\n  Yesterday I introduced legislation to require the administration to \ntell Congress and the American people how many people have tried to \nsign up, how many did sign up, what level of insurance did they buy, in \nwhat ZIP Code do they live, and what the administration is doing to fix \nthe problems. This isn't complicated information. In the Internet age, \nthe administration ought to be able to provide this information every \nday. They should be able to provide it really every minute. We \nshouldn't have to pass a law to find these things out.\n  So I hope every Senator will support my legislation. It is a six-page \nbill. It has been available to the public now for 24 hours. It is easy \nto read. The stakes are high for every American.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions be discharged from further consideration of S. \n1590, a bill to require transparency in the operation of the American \nhealth benefit exchanges, and that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration. I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a \nthird time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, my good \nfriend from Tennessee has raised just another effort to divert \nresources from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act which we \ncan then use to fix the very problems he has mentioned. I will point \nout that we report jobs data on a monthly basis, and this is going to \nbe a different standard. I might also point out that in Medicare Part \nD, we release those data on a monthly basis.\n  I agree with my friend that there should be accountability for the \nmistakes that have happened and the implementation of the law going \nforward. In fact, right now, the Department is giving us daily updates \non their progress in fixing the Web site.\n  So, again, let's get on with business. I think enough focus has been \nplaced on the mistakes. Hearings are ongoing. There will be hearings in \nthe Senate also. Let's get the problems fixed and move ahead on \nenrollment without diverting resources.\n  I thought about my friend's proposal, and I thought maybe we should \namend it to say we will put in more money and get more people. I don't \nthink my friend would want to do that, either, so we can take care of \nit.\n  So the people there need to get the problem fixed, and let's move \nahead aggressively to get people enrolled in what is going to be a \npositive change for health care in America.\n  On that basis, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nIowa. I'm disappointed--this administration described itself as the \nmost transparent in history. All we have asked for is how many people \nare signing up, how did they do, where do they live, and what level of \ninsurance do they have. We ought to know that. Taxpayers ought to know \nit. So we'll keep trying other ways to get the information the American \npeople deserve to have.\n  I thank the President, yield the floor, and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I read with great interest the recent \nopinion piece on congressional budget negotiations written by my good \nfriend Kent Conrad, our former colleague here in the Senate and \ndistinguished chair of the Budget Committee.\n  I have been fortunate to serve in this Chamber for the past 38 years \nwith principled leaders like Kent Conrad. I was elected to the Senate \nin 1974, the same year the Congressional Budget Act passed into law, \nand I have served here with all of the Budget Committee chairs--from \nEdmund Muskie to Patty Murray.\n  I think Kent Conrad is right that at this critical juncture we need \nto have a grown-up discussion about our Nation's finances--both about \nthe debts we incur and the ways in which we pay for them. We have all \nheard a lot of talk in the last few years about getting our fiscal \nhouse in order. It makes for a great campaign slogan. But I am afraid \nthat too many are not following through on their responsibility to \ngovern.\n  After jumping from one manufactured crisis to another for the past \nfew years, which has hurt the U.S. economy and America's standing in \nthe world, it is time for reason and sanity to return to the Senate--on \nthe budget process, on nominations, and on a whole host of other \nissues. Returning to regular order on the budget conference--and \nletting conference members from the House and the Senate work out a \nfinal agreement free from rigid ideological positions--would be a good \nfirst step to bringing some comity and order back to this body so we \ncan serve the American people.\n  I remain ready to work with people on both sides of the aisle in the \nhopes that we can find a workable budget solution in the coming weeks, \nand I suggest that everyone heed the calls for bipartisanship and \ncompromise made by Senator Conrad.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that Kent Conrad's full opinion \npiece from the October 24, 2013, Washington Post be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 24, 2013]\n\nOpinion: A Fair Trade for Entitlement Reform Includes Increased Revenue\n\n                        (By Senator Kent Conrad)\n\n       Kent Conrad, a Democrat, represented North Dakota in the \n     Senate from 1987 to 2013.\n       The Post's Oct. 20 editorial on the budget challenge [``A \n     fiscal quid pro quo''] made important points but was way off-\n     base on the issue of revenue. It suggested that a fair trade \n     would be reductions to the ``sequester'' budget cuts in \n     exchange for reforms to Medicare and Social Security and said \n     that Democrats should not insist on additional revenue \n     because that's a non-starter with many Republicans. Democrats \n     would make a serious mistake by following that advice.\n       Our country needs more revenue to help us get back on \n     track. Citing Congressional Budget Office calculations, The \n     Post said that ``federal revenue as a share of [gross \n     domestic product (GDP)] will hit 18.5 percent by 2023, near \n     the upper-end of the postwar range.'' That's true, but the \n     last five times our country had a balanced budget, revenue \n     averaged 20 percent of GDP. The Bowles-Simpson plan, which \n     The Post strongly endorsed, achieved revenue of 20.6 percent \n     of GDP--not by raising tax rates but by broadening the tax \n     base and lowering tax rates.\n       Tax reform should be part of any budget deal. Tax reform is \n     necessary to unlock the full potential of our economy. The \n     current tax system is not fair and damages U.S. \n     competitiveness. A five-story building in the Cayman Islands \n     claims to be home to more than 18,000 companies. Is it the \n     most efficient building in the world? No! That and other tax \n     scams cost our country more than $100 billion each year, the \n     Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has found.\n       If we don't fix the revenue side of the equation at the \n     same time as we repair Social Security and Medicare, it will \n     never happen. To suggest, as The Post does, that Democrats \n     should trade adjustments to the sequester for reforms to \n     these programs assumes that the sequester affects only \n     Democratic priorities. More than half of the $1.2 trillion in \n     sequester cuts are to defense, long a Republican priority.\n\n[[Page S7610]]\n\n       A fair trade would be modest additions to revenue as part \n     of a balanced plan. A revenue increase of $300 billion to \n     $400 billion over 10 years would amount to only 1 percent of \n     the $37 trillion the federal government is expected to \n     collect over that time. We can't do 1 percent? Of course we \n     can. And by reforming the tax code, we could do it without \n     raising tax rates on a single American.\n       A similar $300 billion to $400 billion in savings out of \n     Medicare and Medicaid would amount to about 3 percent of the \n     $11 trillion the federal government is expected to spend on \n     health care over that time. We can't do 3 percent? Of course \n     we can. And we must: Health spending is the fastest-growing \n     part of the federal budget, projected to increase from 1 \n     percent of GDP in 1971 to more than 12 percent of GDP in \n     2050. And the trustees of the Medicare system say it will be \n     insolvent by 2026.\n       The Post was correct that adoption of a ``chained CPI,'' or \n     consumer price index, system of measuring inflation should be \n     part of any agreement. Most economists say that chained CPI, \n     which accounts for behavioral changes people make when faced \n     with increasing prices, is a more accurate way of measuring \n     inflation. Going to chained CPI would raise revenue because \n     our tax system is indexed for inflation, and it would cut \n     spending because many programs, including Social Security, \n     are indexed for inflation.\n       Federal spending has been cut by $900 billion in the Budget \n     Control Act, by $1.2 trillion in the sequester and by more \n     than $500 billion in the 2010 continuing resolution. That is \n     spending cuts of $2.6 trillion, while only $600 billion in \n     revenue has been added. That is hardly balanced.\n       To suggest that Democrats should give up on revenue because \n     it's a non-starter with many Republicans is like telling \n     Republicans they should give up on entitlement reform because \n     it is a non-starter with many Democrats. The truth is, both \n     sides need to give a little ground on their must-haves for \n     real progress to be made.\n       A mini-``grand bargain'' would require all of these \n     elements: changes to Social Security and Medicare to ensure \n     their solvency for future generations; a modest increase in \n     revenue so all parts of society participate in getting our \n     country back on track; and changes to the sequester cuts that \n     force nearly all of the deficit savings on less than 30 \n     percent of the budget.\n       We can do this, but everyone must be prepared to give a \n     little so that our nation can gain a lot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7610-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. ASHTON CARTER\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, after 4\\1/2\\ years at top posts in the \nPentagon, Dr. Ashton Carter announced last week that in December he \nwill be stepping down as Deputy Secretary of Defense. On this occasion, \nI want to recognize Ash's many years of distinguished public service--\nas a scholar, a professional, and a national leader. In so doing, I \nalso thank him for his outstanding leadership of the 2.2 million \nuniformed and civilian members of the Department of Defense and his \nunwavering support of their most important mission.\n  Much can be said of Ash's scholarship. He graduated at the top of his \nclass with honors from Yale University, earning degrees in medieval \nhistory and physics. His academic achievement also earned Ash a Rhodes \nscholarship, which sent him to Oxford University, where he received a \ndoctorate in theoretical physics.\n  Much can also be said of Ash's dedication to public service. Before \nassuming his current position as Deputy Secretary of Defense, Ash ably \nserved as the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, \nand Logistics and earlier under President Clinton as the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for International Security Policy. Throughout his \ntenure at the Pentagon, Ash received several Defense Distinguished \nService Medals--the Defense Department's highest civilian award--as \nwell as the Defense Intelligence Medal. Ash has also helped to promote \nthe Nation's defense from outside the walls of the Pentagon through his \nservice on the boards and committees of several defense, international \nsecurity and counterterrorism organizations, as well as at some of the \nworld's finest academic institutions.\n  In my view, what is just as important as what Ash has done is how he \nhas done it. With regard to the Department's procurement practices, Ash \narticulated a cogent strategy to improve the Department's buying power \nand empowered good, talented people throughout the acquisition \nworkforce who have long been concerned about government inefficiency to \nimplement that strategy effectively. Indeed, it could be said that \nAsh's most significant legacy as the Pentagon's chief weapon's \npurchaser is that he has helped to force the Department to be as \nskilled in buying products and services as industry is in selling them. \nThis achievement is perhaps best exemplified, for example, in the \nrestructuring of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program; the successful \naward of a contract for an aerial refueling tanker; and making tough \ndecisions on some very large, chronically poor-performing weapon \nprocurement programs.\n  Finally, as Deputy Secretary of Defense, Ash has distinguished \nhimself through his professionalism. Indeed, his commitment, skill, \njudgment, and temperament are reminiscent of those of some of the \nPentagon's finest leaders. There can be no doubt that on many issues \nrelating to defense and national security, Ash and I have had our \ndifferences. Some have been profound. But Ash has always conducted \nhimself in a manner that appreciated the valid concerns underlying \nopposing views, while also mindful of the constitutional \nresponsibilities of the elected officials who hold them. As a result, \nmy working relationship with Ash has always been respectful, candid, \nclear, and productive. More importantly, it has been conducive to \nCongress and the Executive working together to address some of the \nbiggest challenges to our national defense.\n  With this in mind, I join many in thanking Ash for his service and \nwishing him and his wife Stephanie fair winds and following seas. While \nAsh will move on from the Department in December, knowing his \ninsatiable intellectual curiosity and his continuing desire to \ncontribute, I suspect he will never be too far away.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7610-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7610-S7611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOMINATION OF MR. THOMAS E. WHEELER\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Tom Wheeler to be Chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission.\n  No one can question that Mr. Wheeler is a supremely qualified nominee \nto lead the FCC. He brings to the job a long and distinguished career \nin the communications industry. He was a pioneer in the cable and \nwireless industries, having been instrumental in the growth of both \nthese critical communications sectors. As an entrepreneur, he built \nbusinesses and created jobs.\n  This collective experience provides Mr. Wheeler with a unique insight \ninto the challenges facing the Nation's communications regulator. And \nit affords him the experience to lead an agency that has the most \nchallenging and complicated set of issues pending before it since the \nCommission implemented the 1996 Telecommunications Act. I do not say \nthis lightly. The decisions the FCC will make over the next few years \nwill shape the future of the Nation's telephone network, public safety, \nthe wireless industry, broadcasting, the Internet, and consumer \nprotection for decades to come.\n  The Commission has before it a number of key proceedings to implement \nmy Public Safety Spectrum legislation that became law last year. Not \nonly will the agency implement a new tool for identifying spectrum \nthrough voluntary incentive auctions, the revenues from those auctions \nwill provide critical support for deployment of the long-overdue \nnationwide interoperable wireless broadband network for first \nresponders.\n  Aside from that work, the Commission is examining the future of the \nNation's voice telephone network, and what the transition of that \nnetwork can mean to longstanding, fundamental tenets of communications \npolicy like universal service, competition, public safety and consumer \nprotection.\n  The FCC continues to look at the future of media policy in an era \nwhen online video distribution looks to disrupt traditional business \nmodels and bring more consumer choice to the video industry. The FCC \nwill need to conclude its work on the E-Rate program and update it to \nmeet the next-generation connectivity needs of our schools and \nlibraries. And finally, the FCC will have to implement a decision from \nthe courts on the FCC's net neutrality rules and potentially on the \nCommission's underlying authority to protect consumers in the broadband \nage.\n  I have absolute confidence in Mr. Wheeler's ability to guide the \nagency through its consideration of these far-\n\n[[Page S7611]]\n\nreaching issues. This confidence comes in part from my strong belief \nthat Mr. Wheeler agrees with me that the FCC must always have consumer \nprotection and the public interest as its primary touchstones.\n  Acting FCC Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn has done an excellent job as the \nsteward of the Commission over the last several months. I am proud of \nher accomplishments, especially her commencement of a proceeding to \nstrengthen and expand the hugely successful E-Rate program, something \nour Nation's children deserve. But acting chairs of agencies can only \naccomplish so much, particularly when they have taken charge of an \nagency that lacks a full complement of its members. It is past time for \nthe Senate to act on Mr. Wheeler's nomination and to put in place the \nPresident's permanent head of this essential agency.\n  At its core, the FCC is a regulatory agency. Too many have forgotten \nthat the agency's fundamental responsibility is the regulation of \ncommunications networks. These regulations serve important policy \ngoals. You cannot have universal service without regulation. You cannot \nensure competition without regulation. You cannot have consumer \nprotection without regulation. Given his experience and history, Mr. \nWheeler understands the vital role of the Commission and the need for \nan active, smart regulator for the nation's communications markets.\n  The Members of the Senate Commerce Committee have fully vetted Mr. \nWheeler's nomination. And an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of the \ncommittee favorably reported Mr. Wheeler's nomination out of committee \nin July. At his nomination hearing in June, Mr. Wheeler ably \ndemonstrated his knowledge of the issues the FCC will face in the \ncoming years. Mr. Wheeler answered all of the questions for the record \nsubmitted to him after that hearing--including all 78 questions from \nRepublican committee Members. And he did so in a substantive and \ndetailed manner. And honest, thoughtful responses by nominees have \nalways been sufficient for this body to move forward when they are \neminently qualified for a position and capable of fulfilling their \nmission.\n  It also has not been the practice of the Senate Commerce Committee to \ndemand that a nominee to an independent regulatory agency like the FCC \nprejudge issues that might come before his or her agency. In fact, it \nwas our colleague and former Commerce Committee Chairman Senator John \nMcCain who, during consideration of a past Republican FCC Chairman \nnominee, said ``Just as it is not appropriate for nominees to the bench \nbe asked how they will vote on a specific issue that is currently \nbefore, or likely to come before, their court; it is not appropriate \nfor commissioners who have quasi-judicial responsibilities to pre-judge \ncases they must consider.''\n  As Chairman of the FCC, Mr. Wheeler will be able to use the power of \nthe FCC to spur universal deployment of advanced technologies, foster \njob growth and innovation, and protect consumers. This is an agency \nthat oversees, by some estimates, nearly one-fifth of the U.S. economy. \nThis is an agency that has raised over $50 billion for the U.S. \nTreasury through spectrum auctions. This is the agency that has, \nthrough smart policy, guided the Nation into the digital age. This is \nthe agency that has wide-ranging authority over so many communications \nservices that are a vital part of our daily lives. From broadband to \nwireless phones to television content to public safety communications--\nthis little agency oversees it all.\n  Because we entrust the FCC with such great responsibility, we expect \na lot from those whom the President chooses to run that agency. I am \npleased to support Mr. Wheeler for Chairman of the FCC, and I call on \nmy colleagues to do the same today. With all the important issues \nbefore the FCC, it is critical that the agency has a confirmed Chair \nand strong leader in place. I am confident, given Tom Wheeler's \nextensive experience and capabilities in the communications industry, \nhe is the right person for this job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7611-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Madam President, the Centers for Disease Control has \ndeclared the misuse and abuse of some prescription and over-the-counter \nmedicines in the United States to be an epidemic. According to the most \nrecent National Survey on Drug Use and Health, NSDUH, there were over a \nquarter of a million new nonmedical users of prescription drugs in the \npast year and 1.9 million new nonmedical users of either prescription \nor over-the-counter pain relievers. These staggering numbers reflect \nthe urgent need to raise awareness about the dangers associated with \nmedicine abuse. To this end, October has been designated National \nMedicine Abuse Awareness Month.\n  Millions of Americans are prescribed medicines every year to treat \nthe symptoms of a variety of injuries and illnesses, from depression to \nthe common cold. Many of these patients do not use the entire amount of \nmedication they were prescribed and either forget about or do not know \nhow to properly dispose of the leftover drug. As a result, half-filled \nbottles remain in medicine cabinets across the country for months or \nyears. And many of these medicines, when not properly used or \nadministered, can be just as deadly and addictive as street drugs like \nmethamphetamine or cocaine. Indeed, according to the NSDUH, almost 70 \npercent of those who abused prescription drugs last year obtained them \nfrom a friend or relative, many of whom may have had excess drugs \nremaining in a family medicine cabinet.\n  As a result, Federal law enforcement and drug policy organizations \nlike the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy, as well as national advocacy groups such as the \nCommunity Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the Consumer Healthcare \nProducts Association, and the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, are \nreaching out to community coalitions throughout the Nation to help \nraise awareness and address the problem head on.\n  For example, in my home State of Iowa, the Van Buren County SAFE \nCoalition--with the help of the local pharmacy and the Van Buren County \nReserve Officers--organizes regular drug take-back events at various \nlocations throughout the county to provide an avenue to properly \ndispose of excess prescription drugs. Additionally, the local pharmacy \nthere has started a take-back program that allows the pharmacy to \ncollect unused and expired medication at any time. Another example of \nthe response to this crisis is the Gateway Impact Coalition, located in \nClinton, IA, that has collected nearly 3,500 pounds of old or unwanted \nmedicine from residents in Clinton and Jackson Counties since 2008.\n  We can stop the growing problem of medicine abuse, but it will \nrequire all sectors of the community to join together to make it \nhappen. I applaud the work of community coalitions, such as the Van \nBuren County SAFE Coalition and the Gateway Impact Coalition, along \nwith many others throughout Iowa and the Nation. I urge my colleagues \nto do all they can in their home States to make their constituents \naware of the dangers associated with the misuse and abuse of \nprescription and over-the-counter medicines.\n\n[[Page S7612]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7612-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       SPECIAL ENVOY APPOINTMENT\n\n  Mr. KAINE.

The center \nprovided those immigrants with a community center to learn and to grow. \nMr. Schonthal also established Camp Schonthal in the center, one of the \nfirst Jewish camps in the region.\n  Today, the Jewish Community Center has several centers located around \nColumbus that provide adult, youth, and early childhood programs. The \ncenter is home to several cultural events a year and hosts a recreation \nand wellness center.\n  The Jewish Community Center recently opened the Columbus Jewish Day \nSchool to provide children from kindergarten through the fifth grade \nwith a general curriculum, while also helping to foster their Jewish \nheritage.\n  The Jewish Community Center of Greater Columbus provides the Jewish \ncommunity in Central Ohio with educational and cultural programs for \nmembers of all ages.

BURTON\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, today I wish to honor the \nremarkable service of a great New Hampshire statesman: Councilor \nRaymond S. Burton of Bath.\n  Councilor Burton has devoted his life to serving the people of New \nHampshire--and it is been a labor of love. He has served with great \ndistinction, remarkable diligence, Yankee wit and wisdom, and a deep \nand abiding love for the people of northern New Hampshire.\n  For 18 terms, he has represented District One on the State's \nExecutive Council, distinguishing himself as a tireless champion for \nthe North Country. Ray is the longest serving Executive Councilor in \nNew Hampshire's history.\n  He has also served for 22 years as a Grafton County Commissioner, and \nis now the board's Clerk. His position as a county commissioner allows \nhim to double his efforts to improve the lives of the people of \nnorthern New Hampshire, which is his life's work.\n  This past weekend, Councilor Burton made the very sad announcement \nthat he will not seek reelection to either elected post next year. This \nwas no doubt a difficult decision for Ray, given his decades of \nservice. I look forward to being in Council District One on Friday to \njoin with Ray's many friends and supporters to honor his unmatched \nrecord of service to our state.\n  I am confident that he will continue to give 110 percent to serving \nhis constituents, just as he has done for decades.\n  But his announcement represents a tremendous loss, not just for the \npeople of the North County, but for citizens across New Hampshire.\n  Daniel Webster once said, ``. . . in the mountains of New Hampshire, \nGod Almighty has hung out a sign to show that there He makes men.'' \nWebster was referring to our beloved Old Man of the Mountain. But he \ncould have just as easily been talking about Councilor Ray Burton, a \ngold standard public official of unmatched stature.\n  No one brings the same level of dedication, commitment, and \nenthusiasm to public life as Ray Burton.\n  To him, public service is not just a privilege--it is a calling and a \ntrue joy. And no one is better at constituent service than Ray Burton.\n  District One is vast, stretching from Pittsburg on the Canadian \nborder south to the Lakes Region, and from the Connecticut River Valley \nto the Mount Washington Valley.\n  He has logged countless miles traveling the villages, towns, cities \nand counties of his district, frequently behind the wheel of a classic \ncar. And if he is not driving an antique car, you will frequently find \nhim on a snowmobile.\n  Seventeen hour days are not unusual for Councilor Burton. He has been \nknown to start days in Claremont and finish way up in northern Coos \nCounty, before returning to his cherished home in Bath.\n  No community gathering or meeting is too small for Councilor Burton. \nIf it is important to his constituents, it is important to him.\n  He has said for many years that he always runs for office like he is \nthree votes behind--a real statement, given that he has served on the \nExecutive Council for nearly 4 decades, frequently was the nominee of \nboth the Republicans and the Democrats, and comfortably wins reelection \nby double digit margins. It just goes to show you how seriously he \ntakes the job and how eager he is to make a difference in the lives of \nhis constituents.\n  The fruits of his labor can be found across Council District One, \nwhether it is an improved bridge or road, or an initiative to \nstrengthen the economy and create jobs.\n  It can also be found in quieter ways: the constituent he helped with \na state agency, or the citizen who needed a hand with local or county \ngovernment\n  In addition to handing out his trademark combs, Ray gladly gives out \nhis office number, his home office number, his car phone number and his \nemail address--and he encourages people to use them. They call for help \nin times of need--and he delivers results.\n  In fact, a former State commissioner once joked that when she \nswitched on her computer on Monday mornings, she would find two dozen \nemails from Councilor Burton. That would not surprise me, given his \nview that the concerns of his constituents are of paramount importance \nand should go straight to the top. I can personally report having \nreceived dozens of inquiries from Ray--signed with his familiar line, \n``May I hear from you?''\n  When not traveling his district, Ray is an enormously respected \nleader in Concord, where he first arrived in the late 1960s to work as \na Sergeant at Arms in the State House of Representatives and the State \nSenate. Remarkably, he has served at the Statehouse during the \nadministrations of 10 governors.\n  In 1976, he was first elected to New Hampshire's Executive Council, \nan executive branch panel that functions as a check on executive power \nand dates back to 1680. It is a position he has held since 1981, \nearning the honorary title of ``dean'' of the council.\n  When I served as New Hampshire's Attorney General, I saw up close \nthat Councilor Burton is someone who does his homework, asks tough \nquestions, and fights with every fiber of his being for what he \nbelieves is right. I also saw how deeply he loves our State--and how \nhard he fights for the people of northern New Hampshire.\n  Beyond his tremendous efforts on behalf of his constituents, Ray also \ndeserves great credit for working to prepare future generations of \nleaders. After his election to the Executive Council, he initiated a \nstudent internship program, which has become legendary in New \nHampshire. Over the years, 140 interns have served Councilor Burton. \nMany of these young men and women have gone on to great careers in \npolitics and government, carrying on his proud tradition of excellence \nin public service. I know that Ray's interns are a source of tremendous \npride to him, and I commend him\n\n[[Page S7613]]\n\nfor continuing a program that has served so many so well.\n  I am pleased to join citizens across New Hampshire in thanking \nCouncilor Burton for his decades of extraordinary service to our State. \nNo one has fought harder for his constituents than Ray Burton. And for \ngenerations to come, public officials will look to Ray as a model--\nstriving to match his tremendous energy, his inherent decency, and his \nextraordinary commitment to strengthening our beloved state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7613-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING BERNARD WYNDER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary individual, Bernard ``Bernie'' Wynder, who passed away at \nthe much too young age of 58 this past June while serving as the \npresident of the Allegany County chapter of the National Association \nfor the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP. Bernie overcame the \nchallenges of a childhood on the streets of East Baltimore and made it \nhis life's work to mentor young Black men and help them to succeed as \nstudents, professionals, husbands, and fathers. Bernie generously gave \nhis time and inimitable leadership to numerous community organizations, \nincluding Maryland Salem Children's Trust, Western Maryland Food Bank, \nPotomac Council Boy Scouts of America, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, \nAllegany County Multicultural Committee, American Red Cross, and the \nCity of Cumberland Mediation Advisory Council. He also served on the \nAllegany County Human Relations Commission and as chair of the Friends \nof the NAACP.\n  Most recently, Bernie's loving attention help reignite the local \nNAACP branch as a powerful voice for social justice in Mountain \nMaryland. I was privileged to spend time with Bernie on my visits to \nAllegany County and get to know his love for his community and to be \ninspired by his passion for social justice.\n  Bernie was born in Baltimore on January 4, 1955. He graduated in 1974 \nfrom Mergenthaler Vocational-Technical High School, where he served as \npresident of the Student Senate for the Baltimore City School System. \nHe is a 1978 graduate of Frostburg State University and received his \nmaster of education from FSU in 1984. Bernie started his professional \ncareer in January 1979, accepting the position of admissions counselor \n& minority recruiter at FSU. He became coordinator of minority \nrecruitment at Slippery Rock University and then returned to FSU in \n1982 as associate director of admissions. He served in this role until \n1986, when he was promoted to be the director of the Office of Student \nHuman Relations & Minority Affairs. In this capacity, he developed an \nacademic monitoring program which is still in use today. In 1996, \nBernie took over the management duties of both the Admissions and \nFinancial Aid Offices at FSU. In 2001, he moved to the Athletic \nDepartment, where he served as the assistant director of athletics and \nworked with coaches and the Office of Enrollment Services to develop \nrecruitment activities for athletes and to increase their retention and \ngraduation rates. Later, Bernie served as assistant vice president of \nstudent services.\n  Bernie Wynder's lifetime of service has been recognized and \nappreciated by others. In 1986, Bernie received the Trio Achiever's \nAward for the State of Maryland. He was inducted into Mergenthaler \nVocational-Technical High School's Hall of Fame in 1993. He received \nFSU's Alumni Achievement Award in 1997 and received the College \nAdmissions Representative of the Year Award given by the College Bound \nFoundation for service to Baltimore City high school students in 2002. \nIn 2005, Bernie received the NAACP Image Award. In 2010, Bernie was one \nof three Marylanders honored as a ``Living Legend'' by the Associated \nBlack Charities for his ``profound achievement in higher education.'' \nHe is also an alumnus of Leadership Allegany.\n  Mr. President, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, \n``Everybody can be great . . . because anybody can serve . . . You only \nneed a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.'' Dr. King could \nhave been describing Bernie Wynder, who devoted his life to service to \nothers. The NAACP and FSU students, faculty, staff, and alumni mourn \nhis death, as do his brothers in Omega Psi Phi to whom he was a mentor \nand a source of inspiration. His love and concern transformed the lives \nof so many generations of Frostburg students.\n  I send my deepest condolences to his wife of 32 years, Robin Vowels \nWynder; their son, Bernard ``Bear'' Wynder Jr.; their daughter, Brandie \nMcIntyre; and the rest of his family. Bernie Wynder was a man of \nuncommon integrity, wisdom, compassion, and commitment. We will miss \nhis courage and vision and voice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7613-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING PAUL RALSTIN\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

Madam President, I rise today with great pride to \nspeak about another Wyoming success story. I am very pleased to have \nthis opportunity to extend our congratulations to the Buckskin Mine, \nwhich is located in my home State of Wyoming, for the outstanding \nrecord of safety they were able to compile in 2012. The mine's focus on \nsafety and the great results they were able to achieve speak volumes \nabout the mine and the care and attention they give to safety and to \nkeeping their employees safe at work.\n  I have often heard it said that successful safety and health programs \ndon't just ``happen.'' They take a great deal of time and effort and \nthey result from a teamwork approach that involves everyone from the \nowner of the mine to the dedicated and hard-working team that works in \nthe mine every day. That means this safety award was earned by everyone \nat the mine.\n  It is no secret. Working in a mine is a difficult and dangerous job, \nand it requires every worker to look out for their own safety as well \nas their fellow workers' safety. That kind of diligence, exercised \nevery day, is what helps to ensure that all our workers will make a \nsafe return home at the end of the day to be with their families.\n  Simply put, that is why the Buckskin Mine is receiving this \nrecognition. Their staff goes the extra mile every day to make sure \ntheir mine is as safe as it can possibly be. The culture of workplace \nsafety that is then created helps to keep each of their workers focused \non safety throughout the day. The result is this special award.\n  I have always believed that the best way to lead is by example, and \nby earning this important recognition they have established a record of \nsafety that other mines will want to emulate. In the end, that is \nsomething that will continue to benefit Wyoming and the mining industry \nall across the Nation.\n  The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, on \nwhich I serve, has focused our attention on this key issue for many \nyears. As a committee, we are well aware of what an impressive record \nthis is, and we hope their record of success will become the norm \nacross the United States. Safe work habits create safe workplaces and \nlow accident rates for all employees which makes our business \ncommunity, especially our mining\n\n[[Page S7614]]\n\nindustry, more productive. Good safety records also help to make our \nbusinesses more prosperous which is another benefit that comes from \nputting workplace safety first.\n  That is why it gives me a great deal of pride to extend these best \nwishes and words of congratulations to every employee of the Buckskin \nMine, its management, and all those who have worked so hard to keep the \nmine safe. It took a team with a vision to create and put a safety \nprogram into effect, and the Buckskin mine team can be very proud of \ntheir efforts and the great result they were able to achieve. They have \nmade a difference that will have an impact from their own backyard to \nevery corner of our country that relies on mines and mining.\n  Now their challenge is to keep up the good work and to keep their \nexcellent safety record going strong. With the hard-working group that \nmakes the Buckskin Mine such a safe workplace, I have every confidence \nthey will continue to serve as an example of what is possible when \nworkers and management work together to keep our workplaces \nsafe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7614-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN N.

While teaching, he obtained a master's degree in education and \ncompleted the coursework for a doctorate in education.\n  Beginning in 1970, Mr. Adubato built the North Ward Center from a \nsmall storefront office on Bloomfield Avenue into the thriving \ninstitution it is today. During an era of instability, uncertainty, and \ntransformation in the city, the North Ward Center served as a pillar of \nstability, offering job training, education, and recreational \nopportunities to families struggling for survival. Given his strong \ncommitment to education, it is no surprise that one of the first \nprograms created by the North Ward Center was a preschool. Today, the \nNorth Ward Child Development Center educates 700 children a year and is \none of the largest Abbott preschools in the State.\n  In 1980, the North Ward Center founded the Newark Business Training \nInstitute, NBTI, which has helped thousands of adults transition from \nwelfare to work and has returned more than $1 billion into the State's \neconomy. NBTI currently offers English as a second language to ensure \nrecent immigrants have the language skills necessary to find good jobs.\n  The crowning achievement of Mr. Adubato's lifelong dedication to \neducation is the Robert Treat Academy Charter School, which enrolls 450 \nstudents in grades K-8. Founded in 1997 as one of the State's first \ncharter schools, Robert Treat has gained a national reputation for its \nacademic success and was named a Blue Ribbon school in 2008.\n  In August 2009, Robert Treat opened a second campus in the Central \nWard of Newark. It started with a kindergarten and first grade class \nand will add a grade each year. Between the two campuses, Robert Treat \nwill eventually enroll 675 students.\n  Mr. Adubato received a doctor of humane letters from Kean University \nin May 2010. He received the Official Knight of the Order of Merit of \nthe Republic of Italy and was honored by the New Jersey Ballet and the \nArchdiocese of Newark as the Humanitarian of the Year. Mr. Adubato was \nalso honored by the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and National \nOrganization of African-American Administrators. In September 2009, he \nwas honored by Essex County, which named the recreation complex in \nBranch Brook Park the Stephen N. Adubato, Sr., Sports Complex.\n  There is no doubt that the lifetime work of Stephen Adubato, Sr., has \ngreatly benefited the people of Newark. His commitment to helping those \naround him is not only admirable, it is inspiring, and his legacy is \nsure to have a lasting impact on the city. I join together with all New \nJerseyans in thanking him for a career of remarkable \ncontribution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7614-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING MICRO 100\n\n Mr. RISCH. Madam President, sons can learn so much from their \nfathers. Whether it is changing a tire, throwing a football, or loving \na family, the lessons derived from our fathers can have a profound \nimpact on our lives. In 1969, 24-year old Dale Newberry agreed to join \nhis father Jack in a family business selling cutting tools to local \nmachine shops. What began 44 years ago as a two-machine operation based \nout of a carport of a southern California home is now a $15 million-a-\nyear business based in Meridian, ID, that employs 110 Idahoans and \nsells from a catalog of 12,000 carbide cutting tools to more than 600 \nU.S. distributors and others in 40 countries.\n  Micro 100 specializes in manufacturing both industry standard and \ncustom carbide tools which are used to manufacture items essential to \nmodern life, including airplane wings, watch parts, telephone \nreceivers, car-door handles, and household appliance components. The \nstrength of these tools makes them virtually unbreakable.\n  Micro 100 utilizes a proprietary process that increases the toughness \nof micrograin carbide material without diminishing its hardness. \nCarbide is 90 percent tungsten--one of the hardest metals on the \nplanet--but Micro 100 uses machines whose grinding wheels are coated in \nindustrial diamond, the only substance known that will cut tungsten. As \na result, carbide tools produced by Micro 100 stay sharp for 10 or 20 \ntimes longer than steel.\n  For years, Micro 100 products have achieved a 99.9 percent customer \nsatisfaction rate from clients engaged in a wide range of metalworking \nfields, including mold and die making, high-speed cutting, high-\nprecision cutting, high-performance milling of aluminum, plastics, and \nnonferrous materials, and hard milling. Therefore, it is only fitting \nthat we celebrate this firm's growth and successes, as they have \nsimultaneously helped create jobs in Idaho and enhanced the reputation \nof American manufacturing in the global community. I am proud to extend \nmy congratulations to Dale Newberry and everyone at Micro 100 for their \ntremendous efforts and offer my best wishes for their continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7614-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7614-S7615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CORY KLUMB\n\n Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I wish to honor Cory Allen Klumb, \na veteran of the U.S. Army and the Army National Guard. Cory, on behalf \nof all Montanans and all Americans, I stand to say thank you for your \nservice to this Nation. It is my honor to share the story of Cory's \nservice, because no veteran's story should ever go unrecognized. Cory \nwas born in Wisconsin in 1965. He joined the Army in January of 1986 \nand reached the rank of sergeant when he was discharged in May of 1989. \nAfter a few years, Cory decided to use the veterans' education benefits \nhe earned to attend Montana State University, a State he had only \nvisited once before.\n  In 1999, Cory got a job with the Montana Highway Patrol and decided \nto enlist in the Montana Army National Guard--10 years to the day after \nhe was discharged from active duty. Cory was a member of the 143rd \nMilitary Police Detachment out of Belgrade. In 2003, his unit was \ndeployed to Iraq to assist with Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  On April 13, 2004, Cory's convoy was traveling from Baghdad National \nAirport to their station when they were struck by an improvised \nexplosive devise, or I-E-D. Fortunately, no lives were lost in that \nexplosion, but Cory experienced permanent hearing damage. Two months \nlater, the 143rd MP detachment returned to Montana. Cory left the \nNational Guard in 2006 at the rank of staff sergeant.\n  Today, he is a police sergeant in Bozeman, where he lives with his \nwife Kelly and his daughter Piper.\n  Earlier this month, in the presence of Cory's family, it was my honor \nto present him with his Purple Heart Medal.\n  This decoration--and the decorations that Cory has already received--\nare\n\n[[Page S7615]]\n\nsmall tokens, but they are powerful symbols of true heroism, sacrifice \nand dedication to service. This medal is presented on behalf of a \ngrateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7615-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1405.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n101 East Pecan Street in Sherman, Texas, as the Paul Brown United \nStates Courthouse; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the late Judge Paul \nBrown, and to urge the Senate to adopt a bill I am introducing, along \nwith the Senior Senator from Texas. This bill will rename the Federal \ncourthouse in Sherman, TX, as the Paul Brown United States Courthouse.\n  Judge Brown was a Federal judge for the United States District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Texas. He joined the court in 1985, after \nbeing nominated by President Reagan. He served on that court admirably \nuntil his death on November 26, 2012.\n  Judge Paul Brown was born on October 4, 1926. He was the youngest of \n6 children. He was raised on a farm near Pottsboro, TX. He graduated \nfrom Denison High School in 1943.\n  He left home to attend the University of Texas at Austin. But with \nWorld War II escalating, he left UT to enlist in the Navy at the age of \n17. He returned to UT, where he got his law degree in 1950. He is said \nto have loved UT so much that a fellow judge once recalled that \nalthough Judge Brown never wore a burnt orange tie on the bench, you \ncould see him ``glow orange'' by simply mentioning UT.\n  Just after Judge Brown got his law degree, the Korean War began. And \nhe served our country admirably once again in the Navy from 1950 to \n1951. In 1951, he returned to Sherman, TX, and began private practice. \nIn 1953, he was appointed as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas. President Eisenhower named him U.S. Attorney for the \nEastern District of Texas in 1959.\n  After meeting and marrying Francis Morehead in Texarkana, Judge Brown \nthen moved back to Sherman and reentered private practice in 1961. \nAfter almost a quarter century of practicing law in Sherman, Senator \nPhil Gramm recommended Judge Brown to President Reagan for a new \nvacancy in the Eastern District of Texas.\n  Judge Brown was confirmed for this vacancy in 1985. He served with \ndistinction for the next 27 years. Judge Brown took senior status in \n2001. At Judge Brown's retirement celebration, Chief Judge Heartfield \ncalled Judge Brown ``a textbook member'' of ``the Greatest \nGeneration.''\n  His legacy lives on today, as the Judge Paul Brown Endowed \nScholarship was established at the University of Texas School of Law in \n2005. He was honored as a Distinguished Alumnus of Denison High School \nin 2006.\n  Judge Brown will be missed by his family, his community, and his \nnation. He, and his family, deserve this great honor, as the people of \nSherman, TX, will forever remember the great jurist, Judge Paul Brown.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Lee, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Heller, Mr. \n        Blumenthal, Ms. Murkowski, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, \n        Mr. Begich, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Markey, Mr. Udall of \n        Colorado, Ms. Warren, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Tester, Mr. Schatz, and \n        Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 1599. A bill to reform the authorities of the Federal Government \nto require the production of certain business records, conduct \nelectronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, \nand use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, \ncounterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nor FISA, was enacted 35 years ago to limit the government's ability to \nengage in domestic surveillance operations. In the years since \nSeptember 11, 2001, Congress has repeatedly expanded the scope of this \nlaw to provide the government with broad new powers to gather \ninformation about law-abiding Americans. No one underestimates the \nthreat this country continues to face, and we can all agree that the \nintelligence community should be given necessary and appropriate tools \nto help keep us safe. But we should also agree that there must be \nreasonable limits on the surveillance powers we give to the government. \nThat is why I have consistently fought to curtail the sweeping powers \ncontained in the USA PATRIOT Act and FISA Amendments Act, while also \nbolstering privacy protections and strengthening oversight. And that is \nwhy I continue my efforts today by joining with Congressman Jim \nSensenbrenner, as well as members of Congress from both political \nparties, to introduce the bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act of 2013.\n  Over the past several months, Americans have learned that government \nsurveillance programs conducted under FISA are far broader than \npreviously understood. Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act has for years \nbeen secretly interpreted to authorize the dragnet collection of \nAmericans' phone records on an unprecedented scale, regardless of \nwhether those Americans have any connection to terrorist activities or \ngroups. The American public also learned more about the government's \nbroad collection of Internet data through the use of Section 702 of \nFISA. And the world has learned that this surveillance has extended to \nmillions of individuals in the global community including some of our \nallies and their leaders. These revelations have undermined Americans' \ntrust in our intelligence community and harmed our relationships with \nsome of our most important international partners.\n  While I do not condone the manner in which these and other highly \nclassified programs were disclosed, I agree with the Director of \nNational Intelligence that this debate about surveillance needed to \nhappen. It is a debate that some of us in Congress have been engaged in \nfor years. Since this summer, the Judiciary Committee convened two \npublic hearings and a classified briefing with officials from the \nadministration, including the Director of National Intelligence, the \nDirector of the National Security Agency, and the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral.\n  As a result of these hearings and the recent declassification of \ndocuments by the administration, the public now knows about the \nrepeated and substantial legal and policy violations by the\n\n[[Page S7619]]\n\nNSA in its implementation of both Section 215 and Section 702. The \npublic now knows that, in addition to collecting phone call metadata on \nmillions of law-abiding Americans, the NSA collected, without a \nwarrant, the contents of tens of thousands of wholly domestic emails of \ninnocent Americans. The NSA also violated a FISA Court order by \nregularly searching the Section 215 bulk phone records database without \nmeeting the standard imposed by the Court.\n  These repeated violations, which have occurred nearly every year that \nthese programs have been authorized by the FISA Court, led to several \nreprimands from the FISA Court for what it called ``systemic \nnoncompliance'' by the government. In addition, the Court admonished \nthe government for making a series of substantial misrepresentations to \nthe Court about its activities. The NSA has assured Congress that these \nproblems have been corrected. Yet with each new revelation in the press \nabout new techniques developed by the NSA that intrude into the privacy \nand everyday lives of Americans, I grow increasingly concerned about \nthe lack of sufficient oversight and accountability.\n  Last week, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and \nCounterterrorism, Lisa Monaco, stated that the government should only \ncollect data ``because we need it and not just because we can.'' I \ncompletely agree--and that is why the government's dragnet collection \nof phone records should end. The government has not made a compelling \ncase that this program is an effective counterterrorism tool, \nespecially when balanced against the intrusion on Americans' privacy. \nIn fact, both the Director and the Deputy Director of the NSA have \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee that there is no evidence that \nthe Section 215 phone records collection program helped to thwart \ndozens or even several terrorist plots.\n  It is clear that as the administration has become more open and \nforthright about these programs, the facts have not matched the \nrhetoric. It is time for serious and meaningful reforms to FISA in \norder to restore the confidence of the American people in our \nintelligence community. Modest transparency and oversight provisions \nare a good first step, but by themselves they are insufficient to \nprotect the privacy rights and civil liberties of Americans. We must do \nmore.\n  The USA FREEDOM ACT is a legislative solution that comprehensively \naddresses a range of surveillance authorities contained in FISA. I want \nto thank Congressman Sensenbrenner for his dedicated work on this \nbipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation that we are introducing \ntoday. We are joined in this effort by members of Congress from both \nchambers and across the political spectrum, and I want to thank the \nfollowing Senators for cosponsoring this legislation: Senator Lee, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Heller, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Murkowski, \nSenator Hirono, Senator Udall of New Mexico, Senator Begich, Senator \nBaldwin, Senator Heinrich, Senator Markey, Senator Udall of Colorado, \nSenator Warren, Senator Merkley, Senator Tester, and Senator Schatz.\n  Our bill will end the dragnet collection of phone records under \nSection 215 of the PATRIOT Act by requiring that only documents or \nrecords relevant and material to an investigation may be obtained, and \nthat they have some particular nexus to a specific foreign agent or \npower. It will also ensure that the FISA pen register statute and \nNational Security Letters cannot be used to authorize similar dragnet \ncollection by applying the same standard. The bill also adds more \nmeaningful judicial review of Section 215 orders and raises the \nstandard for the government to obtain a gag order for every Section 215 \norder.\n  In addition to stopping the dragnet collection of phone records, our \nlegislation will address privacy concerns related to surveillance \nconducted under the FISA Amendments Act, which allows the government to \ngather vast amounts of Internet communications content by foreigners \nlocated overseas. Given the technological nature of Internet \ncommunications, we must vigilantly protect against the inadvertent \ncollection of the contents of the wholly domestic communications of \nU.S. persons--something that the NSA acknowledged has happened before. \nOur bill will place stricter limits on this type of collection, and \nalso require the government to obtain a court order prior to conducting \n`back door' searches looking for the communications of U.S. persons in \ndatabases collected without a warrant under Section 702 of FISA.\n  Finally, the USA FREEDOM Act will require enhanced accountability, \ntransparency, and oversight in the FISA process. Our bill builds on a \nproposal by Senator Blumenthal to provide for the creation of a Special \nAdvocate who will advocate specifically for the protection of privacy \nrights and civil liberties before the FISA Court, as well as a process \nfor publicly releasing FISA Court opinions containing significant \ninterpretations of law. Under the bill, public confidence in the \ngovernment's activities will also be strengthened by more detailed \npublic reporting about the numbers and types of FISA orders that are \nissued.\n  Importantly, this measure requires new Inspector General reviews and \nimposes new sunset dates. I have long believed that sunset provisions \nare an important tool because nothing focuses the attention of Congress \nor the Executive Branch like the looming chance that a law will end. It \nis important to note that Section 215, which the government is using to \nconduct dragnet phone records collection, will expire in June 2015 \nunless Congress decides otherwise. This bill also shortens the FISA \nAmendments Act sunset by 2 years, and adds a new sunset for National \nSecurity Letters. This aligns all of these FISA sunsets so that \nCongress can address them comprehensively in 2015, rather than in a \npiecemeal fashion.\n  These are all commonsense, bipartisan improvements that will ensure \nappropriate limits are placed on the government's vast surveillance \npowers. The American people deserve to know how laws governing \nsurveillance authorities are being interpreted and will implicate their \npersonal information and activities. The American people also deserve \nto know whether these programs have proven sufficiently valuable as \ncounterterrorism tools to justify their extraordinary breadth. This \nlegislation will help to repair that trust deficit by providing \nenhanced layers of transparency, oversight, and accountability to \nensure that we are protecting national security while restoring \nprotections for the privacy rights and civil liberties of law-abiding \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1599\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to facilitate the reestablishment of domestic, \ncritical mineral designation, assessment, production, manufacturing, \nrecycling, analysis, forecasting, workforce, education, research, and \ninternational capabilities in the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, our national security depends upon minerals \nthat enable nearly all of the defense and weapons systems used by the \nU.S. Armed Forces. These minerals are also critical to the clean \nenergy, electronics, and medical industries. Yet, for how critical \nthese minerals are, the vast majority of our domestic supply is \nimported from China in order to reduce cost. In fact, China supplies 90 \nto 95 percent of our rare earth oxides, a special class of critical \nminerals. We have seen how dangerous this dependence can be--in 2009, \nChina choked off the supply of these materials to the rest of the \nworld, restricting exports by 72 percent and causing the prices of rare \nearth elements to skyrocket here in the U.S.\n  I am pleased to join Senators Murkowski, Udall, and Heller as the \nleading sponsors of bipartisan legislation to prevent future supply \nshocks of these critical minerals that are the key to our defense, \nenergy, electronics, and medical industries by expanding U.S. \nproduction and supply of these important substances. This legislation--\nthe Critical Minerals Policy Act of 2013--builds on two bills that were \nintroduced in the 112th Congress and which were referred to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources. S. 383, the Critical \nMinerals and Materials Promotion Act of 2011, which I cosponsored, was \nintroduced by Senator Mark Udall. S. 1113, the Critical Minerals Policy \nAct, was introduced by Senator Murkowski. The Energy and Natural \nResources Committee held a hearing on these bills in June 2011, and \nthis new bill is a product of those efforts. We are being joined by 13 \nof our Senate colleagues as original bipartisan cosponsors: Senators \nRisch, Hagan, Thune, Begich, Enzi, Coons, Hoeven, Landrieu, Coats, \nKlobuchar, Blunt, Franken, and Crapo.\n\n[[Page S7632]]\n\n  Critical minerals are pervasive in our everyday life. Let me give you \na few examples. They are the key to stronger permanent magnets, which \nallow for smaller electric motors and other electronic devices, as well \nas for more efficient clean wind energy and MRI machines. They are \nessential for rechargeable batteries in hybrid and electric vehicles \nand the high-efficiency motors that power them. They are vital to \nphosphors, which give us more efficient lighting and flat panel \ndisplays. They serve as catalysts for fuel cells and for refining \nautomobile fuel. Our Armed Forces also rely on critical minerals every \ntime they use night-vision goggles, heads-up displays, satellite \nimages, radar systems, high-energy laser weapons, precision-guided \nmissiles, and fighter jets. By one estimate, the Defense Department \nalone constitutes 5 percent of total U.S. demand for rare earth \nelements. In short, critical minerals are so indispensable that we \ncan't imagine life without them. They are called critical minerals \nbecause they are indeed critical to the development of so many high-\ntech weapons systems and commercial products.\n  Although China currently enjoys near-monopoly in the global \nproduction of critical minerals, the truth is that it doesn't have to \nbe this way. China only holds 50 percent of the world's natural \nreserves, while the U.S. holds about 13 percent of the world's \nreserves, according a recent study by the U.S. Geological Survey. In \nfact, a large part of the critical minerals supply shock in 2009 was \ndue to uncertainty about the global distribution of critical minerals. \nWhen China began to restrict supply, the rest of the world was in the \ndark about what alternative sources of supply were even available. \nClearly, there is significant work to be done in this field.\n  The bill being introduced today outlines a series of measures to \nexpand U.S. supplies of critical minerals starting with the \nidentification of which minerals and elements are truly in need of \nspecial attention. The bill then requires the Interior Department to \nconduct assessments of where these minerals are located within the U.S. \nand expands research to find more efficient ways of extracting and \nprocessing those minerals. The bill also includes research programs to \nextract critical minerals from unconventional sources, such as coal or \ngeothermal energy wells, as well as recycling these important \nsubstances from obsolete devices. The bill also requires the two lead \nagencies which manage our public lands and forests--the Department of \nthe Interior and the Department of Agriculture--to reexamine the \npermitting processes for hard rock minerals under current law to see if \nthere are ways of reducing delays for mining projects that would \nextract critical minerals. This legislation also includes programs to \nenable our next generation of scientists studying critical minerals and \nto prepare them for jobs in these fields as well as efforts to work \nwith our international trading partners on expanding worldwide supplies \nof these materials.\n  I commend Senator Murkowski for her leadership on this issue. This \nlegislation is important for our national security. It is important for \nour high-tech manufacturing industries. It is important for U.S. \ncompetitiveness. I ask all Senators to support this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1605. A bill for the relief of Michael G. Faber; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce unique \nlegislation to remedy a clear mistake by the Federal Government that \naffects only a single person, an Army veteran, formerly from Alaska, \nnow living in Idaho, who for the past nearly 40 years has been trying \nto get the Federal Government to remedy an inequity that has affected \nhim, but also has impacts on his family.\n  While Congress is struggling to find solutions for the economic and \nhealth care problems of all 311 million Americans and a means to fund \nthe Federal Government, I hope we also can find the time to right a \nwrong for a single man and his family.\n  The issue briefly is that Michael Faber, a Tsimshian Indian whose \nfamily has long roots in Southeast Alaska, initially had been granted \nmembership/stock in 1973 in the Sealaska Native Regional Corp., the \ncorporation made up of Southeast Alaska Natives formed as a result of \nthe aboriginal land claims settlement between the Federal Government \nand Alaska Natives accomplished through passage of the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act, ANCSA, of 1971. Because of a clerical error by \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs in the early 1970s Mr. Faber was shifted \nwithout cause or his permission to the out-of-state 13th Regional \nCorporation in late 1976. For decades Mr. Faber has been trying to win \nreinstatement to the Sealaska Corp., a request the corporation has \nendorsed, but that the Federal Government, and now seemingly the \nFederal courts, have decided can't happen without Congress expressly \nauthorizing his reenrollment.\n  The legislation I offer today, which to my knowledge is supported by \neveryone possibly connected to this case, will do nothing but right an \nerror by our government that never should have happened. It is a bill \nthat affects a sole individual, which I know is something that has \nbecome unpopular on Capitol Hill in recent years. But Congress early in \nhistory provided an avenue for passage of legislation to provide relief \nfor individuals who are the victims of an injustice. In fact, it was \nonce relatively common for Congress to pass such legislation. There \nwere hundreds of such bills approved between 1817 and 1971. Admittedly \njust one was approved last year, when Nigerian student, Sopuruchi \n``Victor'' Chukwueke, became the first person in two years to win a \nprivate relief bill so he could stay in the United States on an expired \nvisa and gain a path to permanent residency so he could enter medical \nschool in Ohio. Mr. Faber's case is even more worthy of approval \nbecause this bill simply remedies a mistake clearly caused by a Federal \nagency.\n  This issue stems from the fact that during the original enrollment \nprocess following passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, \nMichael Faber enrolled in the Sealaska Corporation, the tenth of the \nthirteen corporations created by the Act, along with his father, Clyde \nBenjamin Faber, his brother Gary Dennis Faber and his sister Debra \nMarlene Faber. Michael Faber's enrollment was approved by the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, and he received Sealaska share number 13-752-39665-01, \nand an initial 100 shares of stock in the Sealaska Corporation. The \nfamily lived in Metlakatla, Alaska prior to passage of the claims act, \nand by the time of implementation of the act had moved to Juneau, AK.\n  In the mid-1960s Mr. Faber joined the U.S. Army and was stationed in \nGermany. At some point in 1976, while Mr. Faber was on duty with the \nArmy, and consequently had an out-of-Alaska mailing address, someone in \nBIW apparently moved to shift his enrollment from the Sealaska Corp. to \nthe then newly created 13th Corporation. That corporation was intended \nto serve the needs of Alaska Natives living outside of Alaska.\n  Under the law, Mr. Faber was sent a ballot that he was required to \nsign to accept the shift in enrollment. However, he never received the \nballot; it was returned to BIA--unopened and unsigned. Mr. Faber had \nbeen badly injured during his military service and, in early 1976, was \nin and out of rehabilitation hospitals and clinics at different \nlocations. By late 1976, Mr. Faber spent 19 months in a military \nhospital in Texas recovering from severe burns. Unfortunately, someone \nat BIA went ahead, and without Mr. Faber's legal approval, \nadministratively completed the enrollment shift. Mr. Faber eventually \nwas placed on the military's Temporary Disability Retirement List, \nTDRL, and then was involved in years of post-service counseling. It \nwasn't until after his recovery that he fully realized he had been \nshifted from Sealaska to the 13th Corporation, and it was then that he \nbegan his effort to be reenrolled in the Sealaska Corp.\n  The record indicates that during the 1990s BIA acknowledged it made \nan error in shifting Mr. Faber's enrollment without his written \napproval. Unfortunately, by then BIA believed it did not have the legal \nauthority to reenroll Mr. Faber in the Sealaska Corporation shareholder \nrolls. Over the years, Mr. Faber won a resolution of support by the \nSealaska Corporation's Board of Directors. The resolution welcomed his\n\n[[Page S7633]]\n\nreinstatement to that corporation. He filed in U.S. District Court in \nIdaho a request for a writ ordering BIA to change his enrollment back \nto membership in Sealaska. In late 2012, however, a Federal judge in \nIdaho encouraged all parties to dismiss the suit without prejudice. \nAccordingly, there is no avenue for this injustice to be rectified \nwithout congressional authorization of Mr. Faber's reenrollment in the \nSealaska Corp.\n  This case has been complicated by the fact that Mr. Faber moved back \nto the community of Metlakatla, Alaska in the mid-1990s to work as the \nExecutive Director of the Metlakatla Housing Authority. The \ncomplication is that residents of Metlakatla, the main community on the \nAnnette Island Indian Reservation, were allowed by ANCSA to maintain \ntheir reservation status--the only reservation in the state to be \nreauthorized by the claims settlement act. But in return, members of \nthe Metlakatla Indian Community were required to denounce other ANCSA \nbenefits. This legislation, to prevent any precedents and to clarify \nthe factual record, not only requires Mr. Faber to surrender or \nabrogate any possible membership in the Metlakatla Indian Community \nbefore his enrollment in the Sealaska Corp. can take effect, but also \nin no way alters the Section 19(a) provisions of ANCSA involving \nMetlakatla reservation status.\n  Mr. Faber has been waiting for nearly 40 years for someone to \nchampion his quest to be restored to the Sealaska Corp., a legacy he \nwants largely for the benefit of his children. This legislation will \nallow Mr. Faber retroactive benefits only to 2011. In that year, \nSealaska's board voted to welcome Mr. Faber back to its membership. It \nalso voted to support the legislation. The bill sets no precedents for \nother Natives to seek changes in their ANCSA enrollments because of the \nunique and singular nature of the clerical error that was responsible \nfor this change in enrollment status in the first place. This bill will \nsimply treat Mr. Faber and his descendants humanely and formally \nrecognize their legal and cultural status as Alaska Natives.\n  I hope that Congress will see fit to pass this bill promptly--truly \nthe right and just result.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHATZ (for himself and Ms. Hirono):\n  S. 1607.

Res. 276\n\n       Whereas, according to a report by WorldatWork, a nonprofit \n     professional association with expertise in attracting, \n     motivating, and retaining employees, the quality of a job and \n     the supportiveness of a workplace are key predictors of the \n     job productivity, job satisfaction, and commitment to the \n     employer of workers, as well as of the ability of an employer \n     to retain workers;\n       Whereas the term ``work-life balance'' refers to specific \n     organizational practices, policies, and programs that are \n     guided by a philosophy of active support for the efforts of \n     employees to achieve success within and outside the \n     workplace, such as caring for dependents, promoting health \n     and wellness, providing paid and unpaid time off, providing \n     financial support, encouraging community involvement, and \n     improving workplace culture;\n       Whereas numerous studies show that employers that offer \n     effective work-life balance programs are better able to \n     recruit more talented employees, maintain a happier, \n     healthier, and less stressed workforce, and retain \n     experienced employees, which produces a more productive and \n     stable workforce with less voluntary turnover;\n       Whereas job flexibility often allows parents to be more \n     involved in the lives of their children, and research \n     demonstrates that parental involvement is associated with \n     higher achievement in language and mathematics, improved \n     behavior, greater academic persistence, and lower dropout \n     rates in children;\n       Whereas military families have special work-life needs that \n     often require robust policies and programs that provide \n     flexibility to employees in unique circumstances;\n       Whereas studies show that family rituals such as sitting \n     down to dinner together and sharing activities on weekends \n     and holidays positively influence the health and development \n     of children, and that children who eat dinner with their \n     families every day consume nearly a full serving more of \n     fruits and vegetables per day than those who never eat dinner \n     with their families or do so only occasionally; and\n       Whereas the month of October is an appropriate month to \n     designate as National Work and Family Month: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n\n[[Page S7634]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2013 as ``National Work and Family \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of work schedules that allow \n     employees to spend time with their families to job \n     productivity and healthy families;\n       (3) urges public officials, employers, employees, and the \n     general public to work together to achieve more balance \n     between work and family; and\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Work and Family Month with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/29/senate-section/article/S7634-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n          COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.
