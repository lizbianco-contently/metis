The majority leader.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. We have some speakers throughout the day's session with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. We will have \nmore information at a subsequent time how late we will be in.\n  Yesterday Republicans voted to stop the Senate from even debating \nlegislation to avert a catastrophic default of the Nation's debt. They \nstopped this body from even discussing the single most important issue \nfacing this Nation: the loss of the full faith and credit of our \ncountry.\n  They did so under the pretext that refusing to pay the country's \nbills would somehow make those bills disappear. No one denies that this \nNation has work to do to reduce this debt. But Republicans who say this \ncountry should default on its debt today are the same Republicans who \nran up the debt only a few short years ago. These same Republicans \ncharged more than $4 trillion in tax breaks for the rich on the \nAmerican taxpayers' credit card. They paid for two wars costing about \n$2 trillion with borrowed money, and they rang up a $400 million tab \nfor a Medicare prescription drug plan. They ran up the Nation's credit \ncard for years and years on many things.\n  There was one conversation on one of the Sunday shows today that said \nwe were trying to break the caps set in the Budget Control Act. We know \nthat on January 15, the second year of sequestration, we voted \ndifferently than that. We voted to extend the CR until November 15, not \na word about breaking the caps. We are happy to go forward with the CR, \nas we have already voted for in this body. Any talk about breaking caps \nis not anything that comes from us. Yet every single Republican\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\nrefused yesterday to even talk about paying the bill now that is due.\n  The Presiding Officer and everyone in this body knows--and I think \nthe American people know--that I met yesterday with Senator McConnell. \nWe are in a conversation today. I am confident the Republicans will \nallow the government to open and extend the ability of this country to \npay its bills. I am going to do everything I can throughout the day to \naccomplish just this. It is important we do this, and we must do this. \nIt is the height of hypocrisy to not pay our bills.\n  Americans want Congress to compromise. They want Congress to give \neconomic certainty and security, not more indecision and doubt. \nAmericans want Congress to do its job. That is all they are asking us \nto do.\n  Americans want Congress to reopen the government, take the threat of \ndefault off the table, and sit down and talk about a long-term budget \ndeal that creates jobs and strengthens the middle class.\n  I am confident and hopeful that will be accomplished.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved. Under the previous order, Senators are \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to thank the majority leader for his statement.\n  We are hoping there will be positive developments today, and very \nquickly, relative to the impasse which we have reached. It is time to \nreopen this government, it is time to make certain we pay our bills, \nand then let us engage in honest debate on the issues that are before \nus, and there are many.\n\n  The forum for that debate is very obvious: It is the budget \nconference, the conference between the two budget committees. The \nSenate Budget Committee, chaired by Senator Patty Murray of Washington, \npassed the floor of the Senate 6 months ago. Senator Murray and others \non our side have tried on 21 separate occasions to ask for unanimous \nconsent to go to this budget conference committee to start debating the \nissues which we now see in the press every day. Twenty-one separate \ntimes the Republicans have objected to even meeting. This is \nunfortunate and it is one of the reasons we are here today.\n  It is hard to believe, if one is in the midst of this maelstrom, that \nnot even 2 weeks have passed since we started this debate on the floor \nof the Senate, which has led to this terrible situation.\n  Two weeks ago our government was open. There was good thinking--or at \nleast a good hope--that we were going to extend the debt ceiling of the \nUnited States. Now we are in a much different place. We are only 2 days \naway from the second week ending of a full government shutdown, a \ngovernment shutdown which has furloughed some 800,000 employees. That \nis an unfortunate situation for these employees and their families and \nfor the American people as well.\n  What the House Republicans have learned, and those Senate Republicans \nsupporting them, is that this government shutdown has real-world \nconsequences. I can remember taking my kids to Chuck E. Cheese's and \nwatching this Whac-A-Mole game where something would pop up and you hit \nit with a hammer. This is what the House Republicans have been doing on \na daily basis. If a story comes out that suggests people are being \ndenied critical medical care at the National Institutes of Health, they \nsay: We will open that part of the government. If a story comes out, \ntragic stories, that families who have lost a loved one in service to \nthis country are not receiving benefits they are entitled to, they will \npass am exception to the budget. It is the same thing with the VA and \nFEMA. It is no way to run a government, and it is unfair to the \nAmerican people.\n  Their strategy, as convoluted as it is, is they will pass these bills \none at a time to fund our government until it gets down to a handful of \nbills for agencies they don't care for. One of the agencies the \nrightwing spokespeople have identified they want to close down is the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. They want to close down the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. It is an outrageous statement.\n  They may disagree with the policy of that agency--I disagree with \nsome myself--but when it comes down to its important mission to make \nsure we have safe drinking water and air that is not going to create \npublic health hazards, I hope it is something that most people, \nregardless of their political background, would agree is an important \ngovernment function.\n  This strategy of a piecemeal appropriation has resulted in an \nembarrassing predicament for our government. People laid off cannot go \nto work and basic services cannot be provided.\n  The other day a Republican Senator came to the floor and said: Let us \nat least agree that we should open FEMA, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency.\n  Natural disasters do occur, and so he made a motion to open that \nagency. I asked him: Wouldn't you want to also open the weather service \nto make sure they are fully staffed to warn people before a disaster \noccurs? Wouldn't you also want to make sure the agencies that arrive on \nthe scene of disasters, such as the Small Business Administration, that \ntry to get businesses back in place, should also be reopened? Shouldn't \nthe Coast Guard be fully funded to make sure if there is need for \nrescue, they are present?\n  He reflected on it and said: Yes, let's include all of those.\n  This is the problem with picking and choosing agencies, they are \ngoing to miss something critically important. That is what we face.\n  Secondly, on this debt ceiling, as awful as it is to face a shutdown \nin the government, for the United States to default on its debt for the \nfirst time in history would be catastrophic. That isn't my word. It is \na word given to us by the Business Roundtable. The leaders of the major \nbusinesses in the United States have said if we default on our debt for \nthe first time, it will be catastrophic.\n  October 17, Thursday, is the day. If we haven't taken action by then, \nwe risk default.\n  Yesterday we tried to pass what we call a clean extension of the debt \nceiling with no political strings attached--just extend it until the \nend of next year. All we asked our Republican colleagues to do was to \nallow us to bring the measure to the floor for debate, for amendment. \nNot one single Republican Senator, not one, would vote to allow us to \neven proceed to the bill so that we could start the debate and in a \ntimely way to respond to this challenge of the expiration of our debt \nceiling Wednesday night.\n  If we listen to the business leaders across America, they will tell \nyou there is a lot at stake. This is not only another political issue.\n  Since World War II, the United States has worked, effectively worked, \nto make the United States dollar the soundest currency in the world. \nThink about that. That U.S. dollar is the investment of choice of \ngovernments all around the world. They believe the safest place to be \nis in U.S. Treasuries. Why? Because the United States always pays its \ndebts, period.\n  Now House Republicans and other Republicans have said maybe we won't \npay all our debts; maybe we will go into something called \nprioritization; pick and choose the debts you want to pay. Many of us \ntried that when we were young and in college. It catches up with you. \nAfter a while, we find out we just can't do that.\n  Now put yourself in the position of a great nation, a nation that has \nto make 50 million to 80 million decisions a month as to how to pay the \ndebts that are owed by the U.S. Government. How do we prioritize that?\n  Republicans, many of them argue we will first start by paying our \nlargest creditors. In other words, pay China first. How soon then will \nwe pay Social Security recipients, those waiting for veterans checks, \nthose in our military waiting for paychecks, those who are owed money \nfrom our government, and the transfers to States and localities that \nare critical for the ongoing operations of their own government and \ntheir own credit rating? It is a ridiculous idea.\n  It reminds me of Soviet revisionism when it comes to history. They \ntalk about how simple it will be to prioritize and default on our debt. \nIt will not. It will be disastrous. The flat-Earth economists who are \npreaching this don't have a leg to stand on. Economists and business \nleaders, many of whom are conservative Republicans, have warned the \nRepublicans: Don't do\n\n[[Page S7435]]\n\nthis. This is something that will cause damage for a long time to come.\n  In the threat of default in 2012, interest rates on 4-week Treasury \nbills tripled. They are at the highest levels since 2008. Fidelity \nInvestments, the largest U.S. money market mutual fund, liquidated all \nof their short-term Treasury bills just on the threat of default on our \ndebt.\n  Is this default or is this debt ceiling extension something \nextraordinary? The honest answer is no. We have done it so routinely \nthat most people haven't noticed. Congress has increased the debt \nceiling 78 times since 1960, 49 times under Republican Presidents and \n29 times under Democrats. The debt was increased by 189 percent under \nPresident Ronald Reagan--a 189-percent increase in the debt--compared \nto a little over 40 percent under President Obama. Debt ceiling \nincreases have often been paired with other issues, but only recently \nhas the threat of default been used as a bargaining chip.\n\n  I know if we fail to extend this debt ceiling it will be \ncatastrophic. A lot of people will suffer. I think about families, \nworking families, with their savings accounts, perhaps their retirement \naccounts. Imagine, if you will, what it means to them to lose 5 or 10 \npercent of the value of their savings. They work hard, many of them \nbarely scraping by, just getting by paycheck to paycheck, putting a \nlittle money away for the future. Now, because of political \ngamesmanship on Capitol Hill, their hard-earned savings are at stake.\n  That is the height of irresponsibility. That is the height of \nrecklessness.\n  The fact that we couldn't get one Republican vote yesterday to go \nforward is as troubling as anything that has happened on the floor of \nthe Senate that I can remember. This is something we should all agree \non--to move forward. I am hopeful these discussions between Senator \nReid, the Democratic majority leader, and Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, will bear fruit. I hope they can find a sensible \ncommon ground to spare us what we face. I hope we can end this \ngovernment shutdown, pay our bills, and then engage in a meaningful, \nregular order and honest debate in our budget conference over the many \nother issues that challenge us as a Nation. That is what we were \nelected to do. That is what we must do.\n  There are those who are arguing we need to continue this \nconfrontation and take it to a high-noon scenario. Frankly, that is not \nvery courageous on their part. It is pretty easy to be politically \ncourageous with other people's money, and that is what is happening \nwith those Republicans who are arguing we should default on our \nnational debt. They are playing with the savings of working families \nacross America. That isn't fair to those families. We should stand by \nthem, push for economic growth, for the creation of jobs, and not what \nthis would do--damage this Nation's recovery.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, over the last few days there has been a \nlot of talk about negotiating, and there has been a lot of negotiating. \nThat is good. Various Senators in small and large groups have been \ntalking about how long a continuing resolution should be in effect, how \nmuch to extend the debt limit, among other issues, and surely it is \nimportant that negotiations take place. We Democrats have tried over 20 \ntimes now to move to a House-Senate conference so that we can discuss \nand negotiate our differences on a budget resolution. Regrettably, \nRepublicans have refused to allow those negotiations to occur.\n  The underlying issue is this: While negotiations are underway, our \ngovernment should be open and serving the American people. Democrats \nbelieve government should be functioning during negotiations. For that \nmatter, we believe, because government performs important duties, it \nshould always be open and functioning. While those negotiations are \nunderway, we surely should not have the threat of a global economic \nmeltdown hanging over our Nation.\n  The American people don't want the government to be shut down or for \nthe United States to default on its obligations while negotiations take \nplace--or at any other time, for that matter. No one knows how long the \nnegotiations will take. In the meantime there are real hardships being \nimposed on the American people because of the shutdown. Vital public \nservices are being impaired across all of government: Nutrition \nassistance for women and children, Head Start programs for school \nchildren, research grants at the National Science Foundation, badly \nneeded repairs to our highways and bridges, among hundreds of other \nprograms.\n  I think all of us agree that negotiations are more than desirable; \nthey are essential. But the issue looming before us is not that. It is \nwhether the government will be open and the threat of default will be \nlifted while we negotiate. Negotiations could last a while, so they \nshould take place while the government is functioning. It is \nunconscionable that Americans are denied services and benefits while we \nnegotiate.\n  It is also unacceptable that negotiations take place when one side \nhas placed a bomb on the negotiating table and set the timer. Let me \nput it this way: If in the future I came to my Republican colleagues \nand said: As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am not \ngoing to allow the Defense bill to come out of the committee until the \nSenate raises taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans--something \nI very much favor--what would be the result? They would reject my \nultimatum, and rightly so. Threats to do immense damage unless I get my \nway on an issue is plainly the wrong way to legislate and to get things \ndone. Such threats just push people to dig in deeper on their \npositions.\n  The shutdown of our government is doing tremendous damage. We know \nthe American people have suffered great harm because of the government \nshutdown, and we know the impact on our economy and the world economy \nwould be severe if we default on our debt. Who in this Congress \nbelieves the government should remain closed while we negotiate? Who in \nthis Congress believes the government should remain closed while we \nnegotiate? Who in this Congress believes a default on our obligations \nis not damaging? Surely no more than a handful among us.\n  Cutting through all the fog and cutting through the talk of the \ntalking heads is this point, which I believe is unassailable. There are \na lot of differences in negotiations. People have different positions \non different issues. But I believe this is an unassailable and \nundebatable point: The vast majority of the American people believe \nthat while negotiations are going on, the government should be \nfunctioning and that we should not default on our obligations.\n  Sitting down together and discussing the many issues that our Nation \nfaces is essential, but it is also essential we do so while the \ngovernment is open and functioning and serving the American people.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I appreciate all of the speeches being \ngiven, and all of them have a seed of possibility. But evidently we are \nnot going to water them or try to grow them. We are just going to talk \nabout possibilities.\n  There is enough blame to go around. It isn't just on one side. But I \nwould like to remind people of why we are here, hoping that we won't be \nhere again. The reason we are here is we didn't do the appropriations \nbills the way we are supposed to.\n  I know we had a budget process, and the budget process got bogged \ndown between the House and the Senate. But obviously we have gotten \npast that problem, because I noticed on the calendar we have a whole \nbunch of appropriations bills--I think, actually, all 12 of them that \nwe are supposed to pass--and the first one went on the calendar on June \n27. Obviously they didn't feel constrained by not having a budget that \nwas agreed to by the House and the Senate. They set some parameters and \ncame up with bills. So we are past that budget argument that there was \nno conference committee. I thought there should be a conference \ncommittee, but there wasn't a conference committee.\n  While we are talking about conference committees, I have to mention \nthe last offer from the House we voted\n\n[[Page S7436]]\n\non in regard to this shutdown was a request by the House to have a \nconference committee--a conference committee made up of the Senate and \nHouse--to work out these problems before the shutdown went on this \nlong. The Democrats voted against that unanimously. It seems to me if \nthey want a conference committee on a budget that was supposed to be \ndone by April 15, but that we have bypassed and done the appropriations \nfor already, that is kind of a weak argument for saying now that there \nshouldn't be a conference regarding all of these issues that are coming \nup right now.\n  I don't know how you get this resolved without getting the two sides \ntalking. Neither side can solve the problem in the Senate without some \nhelp from the other side. It will take 60 votes, and that means neither \nside has the clear majority that is necessary to pass it.\n  The cloture vote we voted on yesterday was to fix the credit cards of \nthe Federal Government indefinitely, with no limits for another year, \nthrough 2014. That amounts to $1.1 trillion of estimated additional \ndebt for the country, for our kids and our grandkids. I used to talk a \nlot about our grandkids, then I moved it up to our kids, and now I am \ntalking about us. We are finally the ones at risk. That should \ncertainly make all of the seniors interested.\n  We went to the White House the other day, and the President did a \nmarvelous job of going through a speech and then taking questions and \ngiving answers. But I was very disappointed at the end because the end \nspeech was give me what I want for the shutdown and government; give me \nwhat I want for the debt limit increase, and then we can talk. The \nreason we are talking is because we have a government shutdown and we \nhave this looming debt ceiling problem. There ought to be other ways we \ncan talk, but we don't. So like I said, there is plenty of blame to go \naround.\n  This comment about we shouldn't do it piecemeal, that is a reference \nto the different measures the House has sent over in regard to problems \nthe Senate said we were having--problems that people immediately \nrecognized. Yet none of those have been voted on. None of them have \nbeen voted on. Maybe they weren't that much of a crisis. I think we all \nagreed they were that much of a crisis, but the answer is: Let's not do \nit piecemeal.\n  Do you know why the appropriations process has 12 separate budgets, \n12 separate spending bills? It is so we do it piecemeal, so we can look \nat them with some depth and maybe get some clarity out of the spending \nwe are doing. When we wind up doing an omnibus bill--and that is where \nwe are headed, where everything will be grouped into one, and it will \nbe passed for the rest of the year--we won't get to look at any of the \ndetails. We won't get to offer any amendments to it, and we won't get \nto say what is effective and what isn't. We will just keep doing what \nwe have been doing, which is running up the national debt. But we can't \nafford to keep doing that.\n  I talked about the national parks being a problem. I specifically \ntalked about the national parks that are revenue producers and how we \nshouldn't shut down the businesses that produce the revenue. Well, I \nthink in response to that, the States were allowed to take over \nnational parks, but at their own expense and not from the revenue that \nwould be generated by the park. That creates some complications for \nYellowstone park, because Yellowstone park is shared by three States. \nThey did that specifically so Wyoming couldn't claim that Yellowstone \nwas Wyoming's national park. So a little goes into Montana, and a \nlittle goes into Idaho. So that would require a joint agreement by the \nthree States on exactly how that would work, and I am hoping those \nthree States are working out a plan for that if this ever happens \nagain.\n  That is one of the things government ought to do, to look at what the \nfuture possibilities are and say: No, we are never going to have a \nshutdown or we are never going to have a debt ceiling crisis. We create \nthese crises. We create them by putting definite deadlines on things \nand then everything crescendos up to that point. The people who are \nthen picked for the task force to deal with that crisis have a huge \nmedia listening group, which is a disincentive, actually, to get it \nsolved before the deadline.\n  A few other problems that were mentioned that need to be solved: The \nNational Institutes of Health, armed forces who are on Active-Duty \ntraining, veterans benefits--particularly veterans benefits for the \nyear--compensation for furloughed Federal employees, special nutrition \nprograms, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, continuing appropriations for Head Start, and salaries \nand related expenses for certain Federal employees.\n  Traditionally, when we have had a situation like this, when the \nemployees do come back to work, they get compensated for the time they \nweren't there. Do you know what the people in my State think of that? \nWhy are we paying people for not working?\n  So if the principle behind that is to go ahead and approve their \nsalaries and expenses and get them back to work, that would take care \nof most of the problems. But then the people wouldn't be feeling the \nhurt out there, and if they don't feel the hurt, they don't know whom \nto blame, and if they can blame one side or the other, that makes a \ndifference in elections.\n  That is not what this body is about. We should be about getting \nthings done in the regular order, following the right spending \nprocess--which we don't do--and avoiding situations where we make it \nhurt.\n  We have a sequester in effect. It is the first time the Federal \nappropriations and the Federal spending have been cut probably since \nthe Korean war. It was a true cut, but it was a 2.3-percent cut. You \nwon't find anybody agreeing it is really 2.3 percent even though that \nis what the law says, and that is because we didn't do our spending \nprocess in the proper order. So we got through 8 months before the \nsequester went into effect, and when it goes into effect with only 4 \nmonths left, the 2.3 percent of the whole year's spending has to be \ntaken out of the 4 months' worth of budget. That made it 5.3 percent.\n  I was visited by the Head Start folks of my State, and they showed me \nwhat was going to happen if the sequester stayed in place. It was kind \nof fascinating because they were cut 7.5 percent and are projected to \nbe cut 7.5 percent each year after this. If we did the appropriations, \nthe spending process, at the beginning of the year, it would be 2.3 \npercent, and we should anticipate that it is going to be done that way \nfor the future, so they should have been told to watch for 2.3 percent \ncuts--5.3 for last year, for the 4 months they knew about it--although \nwe knew about it for a whole year in advance, just didn't imagine it \nwould ever happen.\n  So why 7.5 percent? Well, I have to believe, from other spending \ninformation I have seen by the people from Wyoming coming to Washington \nand telling me their dilemma, I think the Washington bureaucracy is \nholding on to an overproportion of the money to keep their jobs in \nplace instead of out there where the kids are, and 7.5 percent when it \nshould be 5.3 percent tells me that they kept 2.2 percent for running \nWashington. I don't think they think that is a very important part of \nthe spending process.\n  The papers have been covering a number of things that people have \nbeen having trouble with. One of them is a fellow who went into the \nrum-making business. You can do that legally, and there are certain \nrequirements you have to meet. Now he can't sell the rum. I thought, \nwell, sure, his formula hasn't been approved or there hasn't been an \ninspection of the premises or something disastrous like that. No. He \ncan't do it because the FDA hasn't approved the labels. I didn't even \nknow we had a law that said Washington had to approve labels on \nliquors. I know we used to have one for labels that had to go on \ncigarettes, but even that didn't require Senate and House or \nadministrative or FDA approval; it just required it. But evidently, if \nyou are making rum, you have to have somebody approve your labels. I \ndidn't run into that before, and I questioned it.\n  But we don't have to be in this position. We could have the \ngovernment running, people could be paid, but we need to do it through \nthe regular process. We need to do 12 spending bills and do them over a \nperiod of at least a week each and have amendments to them. There isn't \nan appropriator who\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\nis the ultimate answer for any spending bill. There isn't even a \ncommittee that is the ultimate answer for each spending bill. The \nreason we have 100 people here and 435 people over there is so that we \nhave 535 opinions on what could be unintended consequences or what is \nor what isn't important, and if they are denied the right to \namendments, they are being denied the right to a voice for their \nconstituents. It is not for us; it is for our constituents. That is why \namendments are important.\n  We have had important bills come up here, and we worked on them for \nmaybe 3 weeks with no votes on amendments while they tried to negotiate \nfor a limited number of amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, my colleague, our good friend from \nWyoming, has talked about the need to get back to regular order so we \ncan discuss our funding priorities. The fact is, of course, we agree. \nAnd the regular order would be to go to conference on the budget the \nSenate passed way back in March. On a regular basis the Democrats in \nthe Senate have requested unanimous consent to go to conference on that \nbudget. In fact, only a few days ago we put in our 21st request for \nunanimous consent to go to conference on our budget so we can go to \nregular order and discuss and debate the priorities that are so \nimportant to all of us. Every single time, a Republican Senator has \nobjected to that request.\n  Like so many of my Democratic colleagues have been doing, I come to \nthe floor again today to discuss the urgent need to end the shutdown \nand raise the debt ceiling. There can no longer be any doubt that the \nshutdown is hurting hundreds of thousands of families and businesses \nthroughout our country. I and many of my colleagues have told the \nstories of these families and businesses and will continue to do so. \nThis shutdown hurts real people in real places all across our country.\n  Keeping the government running should not be a partisan battle. Yet \nthe Republicans who caused the shutdown in the first place seem to \nthink they would be doing Democrats a favor by reopening the government \nso that people can get back to work, get paid, and pay their bills. The \nidea that Congress should simply do its job isn't a favor to Democrats; \nit is our responsibility to the American people.\n  The idea that stopping Congress from doing its job is somehow a \nvaluable bargaining chip is incomprehensible to most people. Since the \nbeginning of the shutdown driven by an extreme faction of the \nRepublican Party, people of all walks of life in Hawaii have contacted \nme. They have shared stories about the impact of the shutdown on their \nbusinesses, their families, and their communities.\n  I talked about the toll of the shutdown on our Federal employees. I \nhave shared stories from small businesses impacted by the closure of \nour national parks and other attractions. I have also been in contact \nwith Hawaii's business community, our military, our State and local \ngovernments, and others. Today I would like to share some more shutdown \nstories and also underscore that allowing the United States to default \non paying its bills would only serve to make things much worse.\n  One woman wrote to me:\n\n       My husband and I are both Federal employees with the Forest \n     Service. We both work in wildland fire. I am currently \n     furloughed and he is working, but of course neither of us \n     will receive a paycheck. We have three children ages 5, 3, \n     and 1. My current day care costs are $2,300 a month. I can't \n     stop paying for day care, because all require a 2-4 week \n     notice and I would lose our spot for when I do go back to \n     work. We have savings, but the money is what we have saved \n     for things like Christmas and a special vacation together \n     since my husband was gone for several months this summer \n     fighting fires. This shutdown is extremely stressful for me \n     and I am very concerned that it is going to go on for several \n     weeks more.\n\n  The Hawaii Chamber of Commerce, representing over 1,000 Hawaii \nbusinesses of all sizes, also sent me stories from some of their \nmembers.\n  The president of one business wrote:\n\n       Sixty percent of our business is with the Department of \n     Defense. We move military household goods around the world as \n     they are restationed. As a direct result of the government \n     shutdown, we just had to lay off 41 of our 80 employees until \n     this is resolved and the government starts booking moves. We \n     informed the affected employees that all our staff will be \n     working reduced hours. We anticipate that each day of this \n     shutdown is costing the company over $18,000.\n\n  Another business owner wrote:\n\n       My business is working on opening a fourth location in \n     Aikahi Park Shopping Center. I was advised by our banker that \n     SBA loan approvals and execution may be held up due to this \n     debacle in D.C.\n       How is that helping to move our economy forward? If we ran \n     our business the way our leaders on Capitol Hill run our \n     country--well, the ``closed for business'' sign would not be \n     far behind.\n\n  These are stories about what is happening now as a result of the \nshutdown.\n  If the United States were to fail to pay its bills, it would be much \nworse. Interest rates would skyrocket, our capital markets could \nfreeze, and our Nation's borrowing costs over the long term would \nrequire more of our Federal budget. In other words, a default would end \nup costing our economy and consumers billions of dollars.\n  Our country has never defaulted before. The consequences of such a \ndefault are so serious that everyone from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nto the National Association of Manufacturers has warned the Republicans \nin particular to avoid such a catastrophe. Even the uncertainty of a \npossible default is enough to hurt middle-class families and \nbusinesses.\n  For example, after the last manufactured fiscal fiasco in 2011, \nmortgage interest rates rose. If you were a family looking to refinance \nor buy a new home, your mortgage would have cost you $100 per month \nmore after the United States nearly defaulted than it would have cost \nbefore. That means $100 less for families across the country to spend \non groceries, gas, and other items. For most working people, $100 means \na lot. Imagine piling another $100 or more on the family with three \nyoung children I mentioned earlier. We can't do that to them or other \nfamilies like them. Remember, in 2011 we didn't default. The \nuncertainty alone caused mortgage interest rates to rise. It would have \nbeen much worse if there had been a default. Yet here we are again.\n  It is incomprehensible that there are default deniers among my \ncolleagues who refuse to believe that default would be catastrophic for \nall of us when we have the 2011 experience staring us in the face. A \ndefault would be like an immediate tax on everything middle-class \nfamilies do. If interest rates explode, the cost of living in Hawaii \nand everywhere else would rise. Student loan rates would go up. That \nwould reduce access to a quality education for many people. Credit \ncards, car payments, mortgages--all of these would become more \nexpensive. The cost of doing business would go up. The cost of \nborrowing money to start or keep businesses going would go up. There is \nnot a single good result that would come from our country defaulting on \npaying its debts.\n  As I mentioned in the past few months, a government shutdown doesn't \ngive businesses a pause in meeting their commitments. They still have \nto pay rent, maintain staff, and pay to keep the lights on. Imagine if \nthe cost of all of these suddenly went on and still nothing was coming \nin. That is exactly where many businesses would find themselves if the \nUnited States defaults.\n  In addition, with our economy still recovering from the economic \ncrisis of 2008, finally we have businesses contemplating growing, and \nthose plans will likely be put on hold or abandoned altogether. We \nshould be growing jobs, strengthening the middle class, and creating \nopportunities for our families and businesses. A default crisis would \ndo exactly the opposite.\n  In day 12 of the shutdown and with the potential of default looming \non the horizon, it is way past time to give our families, businesses, \nand communities certainty and security. We need to open the government \nand avoid a totally manufactured catastrophe. Let's get on with it. I \nam disappointed that our Republican colleagues yesterday failed to \nsupport going forward to do just that. I ask them to reconsider their \nposition so that we can find a path that protects our families, our \ncommunities, and our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I wish to follow up on the words of my \ndistinguished colleague from Hawaii and also comment on a few points \nthat the Senator from Wyoming Mr. Enzi made in this important debate \nthat is happening in Washington today--actually a debate that is \nhappening all over our country.\n  First, I wish to associate myself with the effort underway by Senator \nCollins from Maine and Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota, Senator Pryor \nfrom Arkansas, and others on both sides of the aisle who have been \nworking throughout the evening, the night, early morning hours--\ntalking, trying to find a way forward. I thank both Leader Reid and \nLeader McConnell for blessing that effort and trying to find a way \nforward because, as the Senator from Hawaii said, this is a very \ndangerous situation.\n  Despite the fact that there are Members on the other side of the \nCapitol in the Republican Party--not in the Democratic Party, in the \nRepublican Party--who continue to doubt that there will be any \nramifications from default, I hate to say it, but they are going to be \nsorry they uttered those words. This is a very serious situation.\n  The U.S. Treasury bond is the safest investment in the world today. \nLet me repeat, the safest investment in the world today. Think about \nit. If you had a little bit of money, would you invest it in Russia? \nWould you invest it in Saudi Arabia? Would you invest it in China? \nWhere would you invest it? The Government of the United States is not \nperfect but, relatively speaking, in all aspects of the world what is \nthe safest, most sure group that is likely to pay their debts? That \nwould be the United States, and it has been that way for over 225 \nyears.\n  But the Republicans in the House have decided to put that on the line \nbecause they do not like the Affordable Care Act or they put all of \nthat on the line because they don't like the way the budget process is \nworking. They then doubled down and said not only are we going to put \nthe full faith and credit of the United States at risk, we are going to \nshut down the government while we do that until we get our way on a \nspecific piece of legislation.\n  I know there are principles underlying the Affordable Care Act that \nare worth debating how big the size of government should be, how much \nthe Federal Government should spend, how much local government should \nspend, what level of revenues should be required to pay for it and who \nshould put up those revenues, individuals or businesses. Those are \nimportant issues to decide. We try to make those decisions every day. \nBut a group of 80 Republicans--3 of whom are in my own State, I am \nsorry to say, 3 Representatives--signed a letter saying: If we don't \nget exactly what we want on the Affordable Care Act--which, by the way, \npassed the Congress, was upheld by the Supreme Court, and is being \nimplemented in a majority of States--we are going to put the full faith \nand credit of the United States at risk. Literally, the ramifications \nare too massive to describe.\n  We have only a few days. I wouldn't even say we have a few days. We \nare already feeling the results of this hostage-taking by a few \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives. I am praying and hoping \nthat my colleagues in the Senate will live up to the great hope of the \nSenate, which was at times such as these to walk back from the ledge, \nreason together and find a way forward.\n  I see my good friend from Tennessee. I think if there is anyone who \ncould help us do that, he would be one who could, along with Senator \nMcCain and Senator Graham and others who have been mayors, who have \nbeen elected officials for a long time, who understand how you can get \nwound up and that it is important to calmly wind down and figure this \nout.\n  I will yield for a minute to the Senator if he has a question. But I \ndo want to say, because my argument is not with him, that when Senators \ncome to the floor to say that Democrats have not wanted to go along \nwith the regular process, I want to say again as an appropriator, \nbecause I came to the floor yesterday, I want to say the first step in \nan appropriations process is to get a budget.\n  The Democrats, amazingly, were able to get a budget. We have not for \n4 years in the Senate. So we got a budget. Republicans got a budget. \nThese are two completely different approaches to how the government \nshould be funded, what should be spent, how much money should be \nraised--two different approaches. But you know what. It is two \ndifferent parties. We have a Democrat Party controlling here, the \nRepublican Party controlling there. That is the first step, two \nbudgets. They are very different. We need to go to conference on that \nbudget.\n  But the Democrats here have asked our Republican colleagues who sit \nright across the aisle, please let us go to the Budget Committee, 21 \ntimes. I have put this in the Record. We started on April 23, Senator \nReid requested unanimous consent; Senator Toomey from Pennsylvania \nobjected. I am not going to read them all. Let's fast forward to 5/14, \nMay 14. Senator Warner asked unanimous consent to go to conference. \nSenator McConnell blocked it. Then go into June, June 4. Senator Murray \nasked unanimous consent. Senator Rubio blocked it. Then go to July 17, \nSenator Murray asked again, Senator Mike Lee blocked it.\n  They blocked going to budget conference because the tea partiers in \nthis party, the small group of Republicans, said we will go to \nconference, but you cannot talk about raising any revenues in the \nbudget conference. We will go to a budget conference to try to solve \nthe budget problems of the United States, but you Democrats cannot talk \nabout raising revenues. That is because the only thing we want to talk \nabout is cutting--cutting, cutting. That is all. They will cut \nanything: Head Start, education, EPA--don't like the EPA very much \nmyself, but that is all they want to do is cut.\n  We said you cannot solve a problem with just one side of that \nequation. We don't know where the revenues might need to come from, but \nthere has to be a balance and we have to start paying down our long-\nterm debt.\n  That is one thing I wish to say again. I don't want anyone in this \ngovernment or the world or my State or the Nation to think Democrats \nare not concerned about the debt. We are concerned about the debt. We \ndo not like the debt being this high. We want to try to find ways and \nwe have reduced--with our Republican colleagues--spending trillions of \ndollars.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, to his credit--because I have not been in \nthose negotiations. I was not part of the group of 8, but I supported a \nlot of what they have done. I was not on Simpson-Bowles, but I \nsupported a lot of that. To his credit, he has tried to come up with a \ngrand bargain to get our country to pay down our long-term debt but in \na smart way that strengthens our economy and does not pull out the rug \nfrom underneath it.\n\n  But because the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz--through the Chair, \nSenator Cruz from Texas, because Senator Lee from Utah, said: No, we \ncannot go to budget unless you Democrats agree before you ever get to \nthe negotiating table that we cannot raise any revenue--that was what \nthe fight was about, so we never went to conference.\n  When you don't go to the budget conference, then you cannot start \nnegotiating the individual bills. My responsibility is to negotiate \nHomeland. I want to say I am very proud of my colleague Senator Coats. \nHe and I were given a number by our leadership and we have completely \nput our bill together with virtually no disagreement on a lower number \nthan we had last year. We had to cut a lot of things out. I might say, \nwe were asked by some Republican leaders to add a $700 million project \nthat I had to absorb into my budget because of something the \nRepublicans asked for--and the President supported, I want to be \nhonest. I was not a big fan of it, but the President and the \nRepublicans wanted it, so I had to compromise and put it in my bill \nwithout any additional money and take some things out to make room for \nit. That is what we do around here--that is what we used to do around \nhere. We are not doing it much right now.\n  For anyone to come to the floor to say to Democrats you are not the \nones who want to go to regular order--we will go to budget. Patty \nMurray, the Senator from Washington, could not be working any harder. \nShe is one of the most respected Members in this whole\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\nbody, and I am not just saying that. She is very humble. She is very \nsmart. She is very much willing to negotiate. The Senator from Maryland \nMs. Mikulski is probably one of the most popular Senators who has ever \nserved in the Senate. Literally everyone likes her. She is not \ndifficult to work with.\n  She is tough. She is not difficult to work with. So we have two \nextraordinary people trying to work through this. Yet we are not so \nmuch being blocked by our side on the Senate--even though they have \nblocked 21 times--they are being run by a group of extreme, radical \nparty members on their side who have now gotten the Republican Party in \ncomplete disarray. That is not good for them. It is not good for the \nDemocrats. It is definitely not good for the country. Now we have to \nfigure out our way forward.\n  I know I have run into my 10 minutes. I don't know if the Senator \nwants to speak or if he wants me to yield for a question. I am happy to \nwrap this up and I will in a minute.\n  But to recap, I am willing to be part of the common ground to find a \nsolution, but I will not allow--as long as I am on this floor today and \nI will be here for a couple of hours--for anyone to suggest that \nDemocrats have been holding up the process, we have been trying to get \nto a budget conference for 6 months. We have been trying to negotiate \nappropriations bills. But we will not be held hostage, nor the Federal \nemployees or the businesses or nonprofits or our States and mayors and \ncities because Republicans cannot even go to the negotiation until they \nget 100 percent of their way or until the government is shutdown, it \ncannot open, or until we default on our debt.\n  We cannot negotiate under those terms. We can negotiate on terms \nwhere the hostages are freed and we sit down like grownups and work \nthis out. I am hoping we can do that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her desire to see \nthis to a conclusion. I appreciate the many ways we have been able to \nwork together on so many issues.\n  Look, I do not rise to blame either side right now. I do not. Let's \nface it, I have said from day one the effort that was taking place in \nthe House regarding the health care bill was not an effort that was \ngoing to lead to a conclusion. It was an overreach. I know that. You \nknow that. They know that. The country knows that. So we have ended up \nwhere we are.\n  But in fairness what has happened over the last couple of days is--on \nthe other side of the aisle it has gotten one tick too cute. We had a \ngroup of folks who had an idea. I thought it was a good starting place, \ncandidly. We had six Republicans and six Democrats who had an idea of a \nway to move beyond this. Let's face it. We all know what happens around \nhere. Two nights ago the White House weighed in and leadership on the \nDemocratic side pulled back a hair, asked the 12 folks not to have a \npress conference yesterday to announce what their efforts were.\n  The fact is we are where we are. Let me say this. I am perfectly \nhappy with the two leaders negotiating a deal, and I want to support \nthe leaders in negotiating a deal. I truly am. But at the end of the \nday what happened, let's face it, is we have had a little bit of a \npullback where House Republicans overreached, no question. What has \nalso happened over the last couple of days is there has been a little \nbit of a push to overreach and undo what happened with the Budget \nControl Act back in 2011, where budget caps were put in place, the \nPresident signed it, it passed, components of it--it passed the Senate. \nSo just as much as the health care law is law, this also is law. What \nwe have had over the last few days is a little bit of a pullback. I \nhope it is temporary.\n  What I would say is at this moment in time we have actually had a \nlittle bit of a problem on both sides of the aisle. Let's face it. I \nthink we have an opportunity over the next 24 hours for that to be \nworked out. What I would do is encourage the leadership to continue on \nthis pace.\n  As we all know, it takes 4 days to move anything across the Senate \nfloor. We all know the debt ceiling is this Thursday. What I hope is \ngoing to happen is that both sides will admit there is a little bit of \nan issue, on both sides. I think there is a strong desire by the vast \nmajority of our caucus over here to do something that is a pragmatic, \ngood-government step. At the end of the day, look, these events have \nalways been used in times when you have tremendous concerns about what \nour financial situation is. They have always been used as a backstop to \nhopefully negotiate some reforms. We have been on the wrong page for so \nlong, which I admitted to. We may not have even been in the right book, \nbut we have definitely been on the wrong page, and now we are finally \non the right page.\n\n  Let's face it. Not only are we on the right page where we are focused \non fiscal issues relative to the debt ceiling and the continuing \nresolution to fund government, we are finally on fiscal solutions. Not \nonly are we on the right page, we are finally on the right paragraph. \nWe are focused on discussing mandatory reforms. We are on the right \nsubject. We have the two leaders who are now talking to each other. By \nthe way, I think the six Democrats and six Republicans who came \ntogether have helped that effort.\n  There has been a little bit of a pullback. I think the White House \nkind of encouraged--hey, let's see if there is some way we can bust the \nsequester. In fairness, I am pretty sure that happened. I think the \nSenators are pretty sure that happened. I know there has been concern \nby some of the appropriators about the caps that exist, but it is the \nlaw.\n  What I hope will happen is that we will end up with an agreement. The \ntime is so short. We are not going to be able to do anything \nsubstantial on the mandatory issue. I think we all know that. I hope we \nwill end up with an agreement that at least sets the framework for us \nto move, leave this behind us, as we should, but sets up the framework \nto move into dealing with the mandatory issues in such a way as they \nneed to be dealt with.\n  I think it is unreasonable to ask people on our side of the aisle to \nhave a $1 trillion debt ceiling increase and not put some kind of \nframework in place to look at some of the mandatory issues we know are \ndriving our country into the ground the way they are. I think there \nshould be some framework for that to be discussed over the next 60 to \n90 days. The House has looked at 6 weeks. Some people have said that is \ntoo short.\n  It seems to me that doing something for the short term to get \ngovernment up and the threat of the debt ceiling behind us--but doing \nsomething over the short term--gives us some time to harness the energy \nthe Senator from Louisiana was alluding to. I know the Presiding \nOfficer has intimated some of the same things. There is some energy in \nthis body to deal with that, but the fact is we have not. A big part of \nit--as I mentioned--is that we have been on the wrong subject for a \nlong time. We are finally on the right one. Let's come to a place where \nwe can now focus on what we should have been focused on all along \nrelative to debt ceilings and CRs.\n  I think the less we do--and I don't think anybody I have heard in \nrecent time has been doing this--to barb each other at this moment \nwould be in everybody's best interest, because this is a moment where \nwe do need to resolve this issue. This is not a moment to take shots at \neach other. We know where we have been. We know the path we have been \ndown. It has been winding, it has been in the wrong direction, and we \nare now in the right place. Let's let the leaders work it out. I hope \nthey will.\n  I hope while the Democrats say this is settled law--the health care \nbill, the Affordable Care Act--that Democrats and Republicans will say \nthe Budget Control Act is settled law. We have agreed to some caps. \nThere is a more intelligent way of getting to those caps. I think there \nare probably 70 people in this body who agree.\n  We could do some mandatory reforms and substitute those for some of \nthe discretionary cuts and still end up at the same levels of spending \nthat are in this bill, which would be more intelligent for our Nation, \nand it would make our Nation much stronger. I think there is a lot of \ndesire to talk about those kinds of things as long as it is done in the \nright way. There are all kinds of mandatory reforms. They are not the \nsame.\n  I know the Senator from Alabama, who just came into the Chamber, made \nnote of that yesterday. There are all\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\nkinds of mandatory changes, and they are not the same; they are not \nequal. We need to look at those and honor the trusts that have been set \nup.\n  Look, I think we have finally gotten to a pretty good place. I really \ndo. I think both sides are a little bit at fault. People might discern \nthat one side is more at fault than the other, but now it is time for \nall of us to focus on the right page, the right paragraph, so we can \nget this done.\n  I think we can get this done as long as people don't try to--as the \nSenator from Louisiana mentioned a minute ago--game this out to say \nwhich side ends up with a bigger win. I am afraid a little of that \nstepped in over the last 24 hours. I hope it will dissipate. I hope we \nwill end up in a place that is good for our Nation. That is what we all \ncame here to do, and I think it is going to happen, although I will say \nI have been a little bit concerned because over the last 24 hours that \nhas not been what these conversations have been about.\n  Hopefully we will get back on the page we were on about 36 hours ago \nand focus on doing something that is bipartisan, that will stand the \ntest of time, and will go over to the House in such a way that it has a \ntremendous amount of support coming out of this Chamber, and that it is \nnot something where one side tries to peel off five or six items from \nthe other side. That is not going to stand the test of time. That is \nnot going to take us to a place that solves this problem in time to \nkeep the kind of things the Senator from Louisiana mentioned might \nhappen if we don't.\n  In all likelihood my time is up, and I yield the floor for that \nreason.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I would like to respond for 5 minutes, \nand then I will have to take the Chair and relieve the Presiding \nOfficer.\n  Let me again say how much I respect the Senator from Tennessee. No \none on his side of the aisle--except perhaps the good Senator from \nAlabama--has spent more time on budget issues because that is actually \nthe job of the Senator from Alabama.\n  The Senator from Tennessee has taken it upon himself to be a leader. \nI agree with him that we are on right page, the right chapter, and in \nthe right book to talk about some fiscal issues.\n  I don't agree that the strategy to get us here was the right \nstrategy, but we are here. There is no sense in pointing fingers. I do \nagree that the Senate needs to try to find our way forward because--the \nSenator from Tennessee is correct--where we are now, there are no \nwinners and losers. It is just about doing what is right for the \nAmerican people. I want to do that for the State of Louisiana, and he \nwants to do that for the State of Tennessee. We have lots of people who \nare counting on us to try to lower our temperatures and find a way \nforward.\n  Secondly, I also agree with him that whatever we can come up with \nhere has to be broadly supported on both sides--or at least core-\nsupported on both sides--because it is going to have to be something we \ncan bring to the House and say, look, this is the best we can do and we \ncannot go over this cliff.\n  Thirdly, I want to make a point. On this Budget Control Act, that is \nlaw. Let me say the Affordable Care Act, in lawyers' terms--and I am \nnot one--would say it is not settled law. It is law that has passed and \nbeen upheld by the Supreme Court, but there have not been enough court \ntests. I will take the Senator's word for it, but it is settled as far \nas we are concerned because it passed.\n  The Budget Control Act is as well. But this is the point I would like \nto make to my good friend from Tennessee: The House is willing to take \nthe sequester, which is the lowest number, but what they do--which is \nvery disingenuous and what the Democrats will not be for--is basically \ntake the lower number overall, but keeping Defense at a very high \nnumber, and therefore cutting the heck out of everybody else.\n  There is no agriculture money, no education money, no health care \nmoney, no nothing, but they want to keep Defense whole. That is what \nthe House is trying to do. I realize that is not what my colleagues on \nthe Republican side here want to do. As the Senator from Tennessee \nknows, that is our problem. It is not about just taking the lower \nnumber, but how that number is going to be allocated across \nappropriations. That is how the Defense appropriations bill is put \ntogether. It absorbs all the money and leaves all the other budgets \nstarving.\n  I know Defense is important. I am a Democrat who supported a strong \ndefense. I have stood against irresponsible cuts to the Defense budget. \nBut to take a lower number in the whole budget and then say, OK, we \nwill take the lower number, but we are going to give it all to Defense, \nand then we can't fund anything in health, education, and social \nservices, which is so important--that is not right either.\n  One more point is this: The Senator from Tennessee has been very \nbrave. There are not that many brave people around here. He has been \none of the brave ones around here who said we may need to raise a few \nrevenues around here; we can't solve the whole problem by cuts alone. \nIn the last big deal we did, we were able to figure out how to raise \nsome revenues and also make some cuts so we could have a good and \nsteady way to balance our budget and not pull the rug out from \nunderneath this very promising economy.\n  I have 5-percent unemployment in Louisiana. I am not talking as a \nState that doesn't have jobs. Our problem is we have so many jobs, we \nneed people to fill them. It breaks my heart we are ready to pull the \nplug on that, and we are close. I know how much my people are counting \non us to get this done.\n  I want to thank the Senator, but I hope he will also stand up to some \nof the other voices over there who say we can solve this problem by \ncutting, cutting, cutting, and we can cut mandatory problems and cut \nentitlements, that is all we have to worry about, and I think he knows \nthat is not correct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I want to take 30 seconds and say for \nthe Record, I don't want anybody to think that I thought the strategy \nthat was undertaken was the right strategy. I think I have been clear \nin saying I did not think that took us to a positive place. But the \npoint is we are where we are, and we are finally on the right page. \nLet's stay there and solve this problem.\n  With that, I will yield the floor. I see the outstanding and \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama is here. He is someone whom I very \nmuch enjoy working with, and I look forward to his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity \nto share some thoughts, and I thank Senator Corker for his commitment \nand leadership on these difficult budget issues.\n  As a businessman and someone who fabulously ran an important city in \nTennessee, he knows we have to live within our means. There are limits \nas to what we can do and maintain a healthy financial future for \nAmerica. I think that is important for all of us.\n  I first want to respond to a couple of things Senator Reid, the \nDemocratic leader, and Senator Durbin said earlier this morning that \nsort of surprised me. First of all, he said there is no plan to break \nthe caps. I was--as the Senator from Tennessee was--with the President \non Friday, and he said there was a strong push from Democratic Senators \nto spend above the limits of the Budget Control Act that we all agreed \nto in August of 2011.\n  The Budget Control Act allowed substantial growth in spending. \nInstead of growing $10 trillion over the next 10 years, we would have \nreduced the growth of the budget to $8 trillion. It is not really a cut \nover the 10-year period.\n  The President submitted a budget in February of 2012, 6 months later, \nthat would spend $1 trillion over those cuts. The Democratic budget \nthat just passed this year--the first time in 4 years--would have \nincreased spending by $1 trillion over those cuts. I am a little bit \nuneasy because I think there is an effort, and there will be an effort, \nwhich is unacceptable, to deal with those cuts--or to break the caps \nthat limit the growth of spending, which is the right way to say it. Of \ncourse, there are some cuts we need to make.\n\n  Then Senators Reid and Durbin talked about President Bush's problems \nwith deficits. He didn't do a great\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\njob in containing deficits. The highest deficit he had in 1 year was \n$487 billion. The year before he left office, the deficit he had was \n$167 billion. President Obama took office and rammed through, with \nunanimous Democratic support, a stimulus bill that added $1 trillion to \nthe debt of the United States--the biggest single spending bill ever, \nand every penny of that borrowed because we didn't have any money. We \nwere already in debt. So we borrowed $1 trillion to spend.\n  So for 5 consecutive years we will have averaged over $1 trillion in \ndeficits per year. We have never been over $500 billion a year before \nthat, and $1 trillion is $1,000 billion. So President Obama's average \nin 5 years is unprecedented. It is stunning. We have never, ever seen \nsuch a debt accumulation in such a rapid period of time. I think we \nneed to understand that. Our colleagues continue to defend it and still \nwant to spend more, and their budget would spend $1 trillion more that \nthey voted on and passed in this Congress.\n  They use the word ``extreme'' for anybody who wants to reduce \nspending and try to attack people who want to reduce spending.\n  Senator Durbin talked about how we need a sound dollar. Is the dollar \nsounder today, I ask Senator Corker, because we, this Congress, reached \na bipartisan agreement to reduce spending by $2.1 trillion and the \ngrowth of spending by that much? Isn't it stronger today than it would \nhave been if we hadn't done that? It was a tense time in August 2011. \nPeople weren't sure how it would all end, but it ended in a modest \nreduction in the growth of spending which I think made the country \nbetter as a result. The last thing we should ever contemplate is \nbacking off of that agreement and not at least adhering to that \nagreement. We need to do a good deal more.\n  So I wish to share a few thoughts in general. I will go into detail, \nif we have time, about the nature of the Budget Control Act and explain \nit in more detail.\n  We have heard the word ``extremist'' thrown around a lot over recent \ndays. Let me share with my colleagues what I think is extreme. Extreme \nis adding $6 trillion to the debt of the United States in 5 years--that \nis extreme--and saying there is no spending we can cut. ``We have cut \nevery dime we can cut.''\n  Extreme is forcing a health care law through that the American people \noppose and telling them we can take $500 billion out of Medicare, and \nstrengthen Medicare, and then fund ObamaCare, double counting the $500 \nbillion that will come back to haunt us in the future. Extreme is \nrefusing to make any concession, negotiation, or alteration to a health \ncare law that is going to financially bankrupt us. It will add another \n$6 trillion to the long-term debt of America--almost as much as Social \nSecurity, according to the Government Accountability Office.\n  They say it would be fully paid for. The President said in a joint \nsession of Congress it would not add one dime to the debt now or ever, \nperiod, and the Government Accountability Office says it will add $6 \ntrillion to the long-term debt of America. This is how a nation goes \nbroke. Instead of fixing Social Security and Medicare, which need \nfixing, we start a whole new program that adds almost as much debt over \ntime as they do.\n  Extreme is knowing we are on an unsustainable debt path and refusing \nto do anything about it. In the last 5 years, we have spent more than \n$15 trillion and added more than $6 trillion to the debt. Never has so \ngreat a sum been spent for so little benefit. Consider: Nearly 60 \nmillion working-age Americans aren't working. They are out of work. I \nwish the unemployment rate were 5 percent, but the truth is the \nunemployment rate in this country is 7.3 percent, and we have the \nlowest workplace participation since 1975. There are fewer people \nworking today than there were in 2007. That is the key number. How many \npeople are working? Our population is up, but the number of people \nactually having jobs is down, and more and more of those are part-time \njobs.\n  Median household income is lower than it has been on any year since \n1998. Two-thirds of the job creation this year has been part-time. We \nspent $1 trillion last year on welfare and poverty programs, State and \nFederal combined. One in six Americans are on food stamps. Let me \nrepeat: One in six people in this Nation are receiving food stamps from \nthe Federal Government. This economy is not healthy. Despite the \nendless inundation of Federal funds in some of our big cities, one in \nthree children still live in poverty in our Nation's capital. In nearby \nBaltimore, one in three residents are on food stamps, and one in three \nyouth live in poverty.\n  This isn't a booming, growing economy. We borrow, tax, and spend. It \nhasn't produced results that are good for our country. Growth is way \nbelow what it was projected to be at this time. They were predicting \n3.5 or 4 percent growth. We are not likely to add 2 percent growth this \nyear.\n  The only people who seem to be gaining in this economic plan is the \npolitical class who came up with it and those with enough lobbyists to \nprofit from it. What does the President say? What does Senator Reid \nsay? How about our friends on the other side of the aisle, what do they \nsay? Spend more money. That is what they say we need to do. But it is a \nbudget that spends another $1 trillion, and we have to go to conference \non that budget, they say. It is rather odd that after 4 years of not \neven producing one at all, now they are anxious to take one to \nconference that adds $1 trillion to the debt.\n  Put more people on government aid. Energy prices too high? Oh, mail \npeople another check. They are hurting; let's send out government \nchecks. Factory closed? Mail another check out to people who didn't get \na job. Your school is failing? Send them more money. Families falling \napart? Mail another check. Then there is this one: Too many Americans \nunemployed? Bring in foreign workers to do the job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, do we have a 10-minute limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  By what definition can we call what we have been seeing for the last \n5 years a success? It is just not. That is the problem. We have taxed \nmore, we have spent more, we have regulated more, we have borrowed \nmore, we have stimulated more, and it hasn't produced solid growth. We \nhave had the slowest recovery from a recession since the Great \nDepression.\n  So this is the plan. Reduce wages that results in an increase in \nunemployment, more part-time jobs, more regulations, and higher energy \ncosts. And we make that up how? Well, the government will just borrow \nmoney and subsidize people in need.\n  That is not the kind of compassion I think we need. I think we need \nto be asking ourselves, what is really happening that is hurting \nAmericans, and why can't we create a government that is leaner, more \nproductive, that allows growth and prosperity to occur, and not tax, \nregulate, and borrow our country into debt. This is the fundamental \nchoice the Nation is going to have to be dealing with.\n  Indeed, my colleagues fundamentally are saying this: Well, we have a \nproblem in Washington. We don't have enough money. We just don't have \nenough money. We acknowledge we are borrowing too much money, the debt \nis too high, and we are on an unsustainable course. But, see, the \nproblem is not us. We haven't overspent. We don't have programs that \nare running out of control. We have no unmanaged agencies and \ndepartments. The problem is, American people, you haven't sent enough \nmoney. Why don't you send some more money? That is what we need to have \nin this country. The American people need to understand how smart we \nare, how good we have managed their money, and if they will just send \nus more money, we can figure out all of this and the government will \ntake care of it. It is your fault, America. You are hardheaded. You \nwon't send us more money. Send more money, and we will fix the problems \nin America.\n  I reject that idea. We have to get our house under control and make \nour government leaner, focused on productivity, and serving the \ninterests of people who are hurting right now. They are not doing well, \nand this economy is not doing well.\n\n[[Page S7442]]\n\n  I see other Senators are here, Madam President. I thank the Chair for \nthe opportunity to share these thoughts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, I was presiding during the last \nexchange between the great Senators from Louisiana and Tennessee. I was \nstruck because as a junior member of this body I get an opportunity to \nsit in the chair quite a bit. I would suggest to anyone, if they want \nto see someone who came to the floor and predicted this outcome--who \nsaid it very early on--Senator Corker gave what I call the box canyon \nspeech. He did it repeatedly, because he could see what this would do \nif we continued to take hard-line positions that really would achieve \nabsolutely no results.\n  I think Senator Corker has been a champion in calling out all of us \nto behave responsibly, to behave in a fiscally appropriate way. He has \nbeen a great mentor to many of us who are new in this body. We don't \nalways share the same philosophies, but I certainly appreciate his \nwillingness to tell the truth and to speak with common sense. That is \nreally why I came to the floor today.\n  Initially, when I came here, I thought I would write a book called \n``That Makes No Sense,'' talking about all that we do and what we say \nand how what we do doesn't really match up all that well with what we \nsay. I have to admit that in the last couple of weeks, my father's \nvoice has come to me over and over. My father never went to high \nschool. He had an eighth grade education, but he was part of the \ngreatest generation, a World War II vet. He had an expression for his \nseven kids, in nine years--seven of us in nine years. When we would do \nthings that he thought lacked common sense, he would say, ``How darn \ndumb are you?'' I am sure the Presiding Officer knows he didn't use the \nword ``dumb,'' but I will use that word in the interest of propriety \nhere. So I rise today to talk about what we are doing now that makes no \nsense.\n  We have heard in the last hour and a half a lot of discussion about \nfiscal accountability and fiscal responsibility. Senators have been \ncoming to the floor and speaking about their perspective on how we need \nto live within our means. I totally agree. But think of this: Think \nabout where we are right now, today, adding to our debt and deficits by \na dysfunction that is completely created right here in Washington, DC.\n  I am going to start by mentioning three things. The first thing is \nthe House of Representatives consistently not voting--not taking up the \nCR, which was negotiated--short-term, negotiated and agreed to--and not \nputting that CR on the floor for a vote. Then, the same people who \nvoted to not let people work voted to pay people not to work. Think \nabout what the American public sees when they see that, that we won't \nlet people who want to work--they know their work is piling up. They \nare committed public servants. The Washington Post has been replete \nwith stories about people who want to get back to their jobs. They want \nto be public servants. So we vote so they can't go to work, but we pay \nthem not to go to work. We won't let them work, but we pay them not to \ngo to work.\n  In the meantime, we don't have anyone to check out disaster accounts \nin North Dakota. We don't have BLM permits being issued in Indian \ncountry to help as the struggling Indian nations in my State achieve \nsome economic parity. We don't have things getting done. There is no \nbill in the House with that headline CR--that is what I call it. It is \nthe headline CR. Whatever is in the headlines, we will pass a bill to \nfix that. That is no way to run a government. It makes no sense.\n  Let's talk about the debt. Let's talk about the need to control our \ndebt and have a deficit reduction and a long-term plan to pay down our \ndebt. Why is it important? Because we pay interest on the debt, and \nevery dollar of interest we pay is another dollar we don't have for \nHead Start, another dollar we don't have for education or research or \nfor higher education. So this is a real problem. What are we doing?\n  We have people who have said it doesn't matter; we don't need to pay \nour debt. We can just decide which bills we are going to pay. I am the \nsame as every person in America. They know that when they go to check \ntheir credit score--a person goes to the bank to get a car loan, and \nthe bank says: Well, you don't have a high enough credit score so we \nare going to deny your car loan.\n  You say: But what is the problem?\n  They say: Well, you missed a credit card payment and you missed your \nmortgage payment.\n  You say: But I always paid my car loan.\n  That is not the way it works. What they know and what the American \npeople know is that if you do not pay all your bills, your credit \nrating goes down.\n  The tragedy is that we are not only going to add to the debt and \ndeficit of this country by playing this brinkmanship, we are going to \nhurt every American who relies on credit--whether it is for a mortgage, \nwhether it is for a car loan, whether it is for a student loan. We have \nnow linked student loans to this problem.\n  Think about the dollars and think about what is happening to the \nAmerican people when we do not do what we need to do. We shut down \ngovernment but will not let people go to work, will not let people \nserve the public, but then say: Oh, don't worry, we are going to pay \nyou. And then, by shutting down this government, we have cost millions \nand millions and billions of dollars, adding to the debt and deficit--\ndollars we did not have to spend.\n  Now we are going to play this brinkmanship on our debt limit. We are \ngoing to shake up not only the American markets, we are going to add to \nthe interest costs of the American people and of this government. We \nalready have in the markets discounting of our Treasury bills. We \nalready have seen exactly what is going to happen. The longer this \nimpasse stays, the more dramatic this result is going to be.\n  The vote we took yesterday in the Senate sent a message--and the \nwrong message, I tell you, the wrong message--to the markets. We need \nto send the right message. We need to come together. We need to lead \nfrom the Senate because the House, which is not even in session today \naddressing this problem, seems to think there is no problem with the \ndebt limit, there is no problem with not paying our bills, there is no \nproblem with paying people and not letting them work.\n  Do you know what my dad would say? How darn dumb are you? What I say \nis that makes no sense because as passionate as I know they are about \ndebt and deficit reduction, the reality is that what we are doing is \nadding to the debt and deficit.\n  What we are doing is justifying--justifying--a 5-percent approval \nrating for the U.S. Congress. Every day we are here that we do not \nachieve a result, every day we are here that we do not solve this \nproblem, how can you argue that the judgment of the American public is \nwrong?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we are in the 13th day of a self-\ninflicted crisis brought to us by the Republicans. Why did this happen? \nWhy are we in the 13th day of a shutdown, the 13th day of the American \npeople not being able to count on their government, which is supposed \nto be of, by, and for the people? Why? Because Speaker Boehner over in \nthe House said he does not believe the American people want the \nAffordable Care Act, and even though he believed they did not want a \nshutdown, unfortunately that is what he brought to the Nation. That is \nhorrible news--horrible news. People are suffering. People are \nstruggling. Hundreds of thousands of people are not getting their \npaychecks. Americans know a lot of us do count on that paycheck. It is \nnot as if we have massive amounts of savings behind it. If you do not \nget that paycheck, you are in trouble. How do you pay the mortgage? How \ndo you pay the rent? That is what is happening. We have police officers \nwho talked to me yesterday, trying to use some gallows humor to explain \naway their fears. They are afraid. They cannot pay the bills. They have \nfamilies. This is a disgrace--a self-inflicted disgrace--on our Nation.\n  I have not even gotten to the issue that is staring us in the face: \nperhaps the first time in history that America would not pay its \nbills--a default--even\n\n[[Page S7443]]\n\nthough the Constitution is clear. It says, essentially, the debts of \nthe United States shall not be questioned. That is in the Constitution. \nWell, they are being questioned.\n  We have a situation where not only are these employees of the Federal \nGovernment being laid off and not getting paid and the communities in \nwhich they live are going to suffer because they really cannot go down \nto the corner store, but the contractors are not getting paid; the \nsmall businesses are not getting paid; road projects--and I know \nsomething about this as chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--many new projects are stopped in their tracks, not because \npeople are not ready to go but because all the various signoffs that \nhave to be made before you start a project cannot be made; \ninvestigations into chemical explosions that kill people every single \nyear in America stopped in their tracks; investigations into airplane \ncrashes stopped in their tracks; little kids kept out of Head Start. \nWhy? Because the Republicans do not like the Affordable Care Act.\n  What is it that they do not like about the Affordable Care Act, I ask \nrhetorically. Do they not like the fact that 3 million adults in \nAmerica are now insured through their parents' plan--I am sure many in \nthe Presiding Officer's State and I know in my State over 1 million. \nAre they that upset that they want to shut down the government because \npeople are getting insurance?\n  Madam President, 71 million people across the country--8 million in \nmy State--getting free preventive services, including immunization. Are \nthey that upset that they would shut down the government and make our \npeople suffer and shut the doors? Seventeen million kids with \npreexisting conditions like asthma and diabetes can no longer be denied \nhealth insurance coverage. The Presiding Officer is a champion for \nchildren. I can imagine how she feels about this. They want to repeal a \nlaw that finally has protected 17 million kids with preexisting \nconditions like asthma and diabetes. There are no more lifetime limits \non policies.\n  There was a magnificent piece written in the Washington Post by one \nof my constituents--a mom, a freelance writer--who talks about her son \nwho was born with a brain tumor, and over the years they have had to \nhave operation after operation after operation. They came an inch away \nfrom reaching the lifetime limit on the policy--$500,000--and they \nlearned the Affordable Care Act passed, and this child got his health \ncare. Now, as she says, he is talking and he is walking and he is \nshooting baskets. I saw that mom and son on the Lawrence O'Donnell show \nthe other night, and if you have not seen it on MSNBC, I think you \nought to take a look at it.\n\n  So you have to wonder, what is it they are trying to do?\n  What is interesting is that if you listen to my colleagues now, they \nare off the Affordable Care Act. They kind of gave up on it because we \nsaid to them: This law passed 4 years ago. It has a steady stream of \nfunding. It has its kinks and its problems. We are going to work with \nyou on that. But you cannot stop it. It was upheld in the Supreme \nCourt. You lost an election about it. Get a life. Figure it out. It is \nhappening. OK. It is happening.\n  So now they have a new thing--deficits. Madam President, you are \nconsidered a fiscal conservative. I want to remind you and everyone \nlistening within the sound of my voice that not only did the Democrats \nlead the way on a balanced budget, we actually got surpluses at the \ntime Bill Clinton was President. How did we do it? We worked together \nwith our Republican friends, but we passed a budget without one \nRepublican vote and we set the stage. Do you know what happened? Not \nonly did we have a surplus--in other words, we had extra money beyond a \nbalanced budget--we had created at that time 23 million new jobs. What \na glorious time. We did not do it by threatening to shut down the \ngovernment. We did not do it by threatening to default on the full \nfaith and credit of the United States of America. We did it by sitting \ndown, looking at each other, smiling, shaking hands, and working \ntogether.\n  Let's open the government, let's pay our bills, and then let's sit \ndown and really debate how we are going to get to a balanced budget. We \nhave a lot of history to draw from. We do know when you put two wars on \na credit card and the biggest tax break to millionaires in history on a \ncredit card and a prescription drug benefit on a credit card it is a \nproblem. That is why we saw, under George W. Bush, surpluses turn \nimmediately into deficits. Now our colleagues suddenly are deficit \nhawks. Where were they when George W. was putting all this on the \ncredit card? And now they do not want to pay the bills. It is \nunbelievable.\n  This is not complicated. This is a self-inflicted crisis. You keep \nthe government open, you pay the bills, and through regular order, with \nmy friend the good Senator from Alabama and my friend the great Senator \nalso from Washington State, sitting down, hammering it out, we bring in \nPaul Ryan, we bring in the House Democrats, and we sit down, and \nthrough them we get a path forward.\n  Everything that is happening now is unnecessary. I want to repeat \nthat. Everything that is happening now is unnecessary--13th day of a \nshutdown, pain and suffering throughout the country.\n  I have a little community in Los Angeles. Little kids--their noses \nare bleeding. They are sick. They live near some industrial site. EPA \nsaid they were getting on it. EPA got the message: You are out. We \ncannot help you. We are closed down; 92 percent furloughed.\n  You will notice in all those little mini-bills, Madam President, you \ndid not see anything about that. No watchdogs anymore. The watchdogs \nare gone. We cannot have government by press release. We cannot have \ngovernment by mini-bills. We are the greatest Nation on God's Earth, \nand we need to open the doors and let the people in.\n  We have elections. Elections have consequences. Republicans control \nthe House, it is true, but Democrats control the Senate and the White \nHouse. Therefore, we need to work together. We do not threaten to shut \ndown.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So here is the good news. The good news is we have a bill \nover in the House. It is a clean continuing resolution. It would open \nthe doors to government immediately. And it is a very short-term CR--\ncontinuing resolution--and would still preserve everyone's right to sit \ndown and negotiate through regular order. We have a strong budget \nchairman. We have a strong budget ranking member. America has gotten to \nknow them well. And the same in the House. Therefore, I put my faith in \nthose folks under regular order.\n  So we could open this government in 5 minutes, we could pass a clean \ndebt extension in 7 minutes, and then we sit down and negotiate. I did \nspeak with Leader Reid this morning, and I feel he is optimistic that \nwe are going to get there--I really do--and it lifts my spirits.\n  Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid have been around here a long time. \nThey have had their ups and downs and sideways and everything else like \neverybody in the relationships here. But I think they know the moment \nof history is calling them. I put my faith in that. I hope I am right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, yesterday Senate Republicans rejected a \ncloture motion on a strictly party-line basis for a simple measure to \nprevent default for the United States of America. This bears repeating. \nYesterday we voted on whether to proceed to a bill to prevent default, \nand not one Senate Republican voted for it.\n  I think it is fair to say that many of the Senate Republicans are \noperating in good faith and have a strong desire to get out of this \nmess, but they are concerned about embarrassing and undermining the \nSpeaker of the House by moving too quickly on this measure. Too quickly \ncame and went a couple of months ago.\n  Worrying about undermining the Speaker of the House should not be our \nprimary concern given the crisis upon us. We should be singularly \nfocused on protecting the dollars as the reserve currency, maintaining \nour ability to borrow at the lowest possible rate, and\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\nretaining our ability to solve problems as the greatest Nation in the \nworld.\n  The time for worrying about the implications for one or the other \npolitical party or a faction within it has long since passed. It is \ntime to reopen the government, to pay our bills, to ensure the full \nfaith and credit of the United States, and to return to the negotiating \ntable on all of the challenges in front of us. In short, it is time to \nget back to governing in the way we should.\n  I would like to emphasize a point that is not made often enough about \nthe current crisis; that is, there is simply nothing conservative about \nthe behavior of the House Republicans. Conservatives traditionally have \nbeen characterized by holding a respect for institutions, a focus on \nthe needs of the private sector, and a desire to not waste money.\n  Are these principles being upheld or subverted by the actions of \nHouse Republicans?\n  First, with respect to our Democratic institutions, the procedural \nviolence being done to the Congress is hard to overstate in this case. \nThe idea that a faction of a party is demanding concessions in exchange \nfor ceasing their infliction of pain on America is unbelievable. Why? \nBecause we are all Americans here. We all want to do right by our \ncountry.\n  So the idea that one party is willing to inflict terrible pain on our \ncountry, or else, was so beyond the pale that there is no rule against \nit because no one ever contemplated that a major political party would \never behave in such a way. The assumption has always been that elected \nleaders would find a better way to stand for strongly held beliefs than \nby threatening to bring the American economy to its knees. Up until now \nthat has been a safe assumption.\n  This is the least conservative behavior imaginable because it throws \nus into a permanent crisis, unable to solve major problems for the \nforeseeable future.\n  Second, conservatives traditionally have wanted to protect the free \nmarketplace. Some default deniers surmise that maybe the U.S. \nGovernment can service its debt while delaying other payments, that we \ncan simply prioritize. The United States of America cannot do that. \nEven if it were operationally possible, which the Treasury Department \nassures us it is not, it would cause such severe harm to markets and \nundermine our credibility so terribly that even talking like that may \nbe doing damage to our economy.\n  In 2011, Congress's delay in raising the debt limit forced the \nDepartment of the Treasury to take extraordinary measures to ensure \nthat our government could pay its bills. GAO estimates that this raised \nTreasury's borrowing costs by about $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011. \nThat is $1.3 billion in added government costs just for coming close to \ndefaulting. This does not include the lingering added costs of \nborrowing that continued beyond fiscal year 2011.\n  It also does not include the wasted time and resources that these \nextraordinary actions meant. After all, this manufactured crisis took \nthe Treasury Department's focus away from other important cash and debt \nmanagement responsibilities. The Bipartisan Policy Center projects that \nthe full cost of that crisis to the Federal Government alone, not to \nthe economy, just to the Federal Government, will be around $19 billion \nover the maturity of the debt.\n  There is nothing conservatively virtuous about defaulting on what we \nowe. It will cripple free markets. It is Russian roulette played with a \nbullet in every chamber. There so nothing conservative about that.\n  Finally, there is the conservative principle about saving taxpayers' \ndollars. Two points: First, with the likely passage of the House bill \nto provide retroactive pay to Federal employees, let me tell you what \nis happening. We are paying Federal employees to stay home. We are \npaying our dedicated Federal workers, who want to do their jobs, not to \ndo their jobs. This is not conservative. This is not liberal, for that \nmatter. It is upside down.\n  We are preventing Federal employees from doing their important work, \nsuch as assisting small businesses and combating terrorism. Let me be \nclear. Federal workers did not cause this shutdown and should not lose \npay because of it. That is why I cosponsored Senator Cardin's bill to \nmake sure they receive back pay when the government reopens. Our \nNation's furloughed public servants want to work, and many Federal \ncivilian employees are being required to work during this shutdown \nwithout pay.\n  While it does not make sense to punish Federal workers for Congress's \ndysfunction, it makes way more sense to simply reopen the Federal \nGovernment. Still, the House refuses to vote on a clean continuing \nresolution that can reopen the government tomorrow but instead voted to \ngive backpay after the shutdown ends. What is conservative about paying \npeople to stay home?\n  Second, this shutdown is costing us money, not saving us money. In \njust the first week, it cost the economy $1.6 billion in lost economic \noutput and is estimated to cost an average of $160 million each \nadditional day. This is hurting small businesses and working families \nacross the country, and it is completely avoidable.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, people are in real pain. This needs \nto stop. There is nothing good in this shutdown or in the threat of \ndefault. As a progressive, I have talked on this floor about how it \nhurts our economy, the American people, and the priorities I am \nfighting for. But you do not have to share my priorities to think this \nis an awful mess. You can be a rock-ribbed conservative too. This is \nbad for all of us. There is a simple way to move forward: Open our \ngovernment, pay our bills, and start negotiating on the issues that \nmatter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nHawaii Senator Schatz and share his points. I think most of the \nAmerican people share his perspective this is an awful mess and it is \nway past time that we fix it.\n  I am hearing from people in New Hampshire every day who are affected \nby the negative consequences of this shutdown. I heard from some \nemployees at the Berlin prison. This is a medium-security facility in \nthe northern part of New Hampshire. It has not even been fully staffed. \nIt does not have all of the inmates there. Several of the employees \nhave emailed me talking about what their situation is.\n  One woman says:\n\n       We are expected to work and not get paid for the time \n     being. But it's going to be tough when both working members \n     of the household are government employees who aren't getting \n     paid. I am expected to make my Federal student loan payments \n     on time as well as my private student loans. How is one \n     supposed to do that when the government is not paying them? \n     They expect payment. Well, so do we.\n\n  I also heard from a gentleman whose family is back in New York \nbecause he is still getting settled in Berlin. He has a child who is \nill. He says he was told last week that any sick or annual leave could \nbe used, but it would be considered as a nonpaid day during this \nshutdown. He says:\n\n       I have been dealing for the past 3 months with my youngest \n     child who's been having kidney problems and had surgery \n     recently. My wife has been having kidney difficulty and had \n     surgery. So now I cannot respond to my family's aid because I \n     would be concerned about whether or not I am going to be able \n     to get paid for these sick days. We are hearing from people \n     across New Hampshire. Hundreds of Federal workers have been \n     furloughed in the State. New Small Business Administration \n     loans have been stopped. Federal Housing Administration and \n     VA loans have been slowed. Facilities in the White Mountain \n     National Forest have been closed.\n\n  This is the peak weekend for foliage in the White Mountains of New \nHampshire. Yet because of the shutdown, facilities, bathrooms in the \nWhite Mountain National Forest are closed, campgrounds are closed, the \nsmall businesses that depend on those for the rest of their season are \ntaking a huge hit. So many of the manufacturing businesses in New \nHampshire are being affected.\n  I heard from a company called Nanocomp, which is a real innovative, \nsmall New Hampshire company producing next-generation carbon nanotube \ntechnology. They have a number of Federal contracts. They have already \nbeen hit by sequestration. So this is a double whammy. Their CEO said \nto me:\n\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\n\n       We would burn through our very thin cash reserves as a \n     result of this shutdown, and when that money is burned, it is \n     not able to be replaced. So our basic financial viability can \n     be irrevocably damaged, even after the crisis passes.\n\n  For this company, the consequences of this shutdown could be \nirreversible. I heard from another small business owner with a company \ncalled GlobaFone. He called because he is so frustrated because again \nhis government contracts are not being paid. He does not know what that \nis going to mean. Their cashflow is uncertain. He is not sure if his \nline of credit with the bank is going to continue.\n  There are very real consequences from this government shutdown.\n  Then of course, on SBA loans, according to the Granite State \nDevelopment Corporation, which is one of the largest SBA lenders in New \nHampshire, about 20 loans have been put on hold with the Granite State \nDevelopment Corporation because of this shutdown.\n  Then, we have heard from some of our community banks that provide for \nSBA loans that those loans are being held up. There is no doubt this is \nhaving a huge impact in New Hampshire on families, on small businesses. \nBut it is having an impact across this country.\n  That is affecting activity. As the Presiding Officer said so well in \nhis comments, this is having a huge impact on how the economy of this \ncountry is doing. As we think about the concerns we have heard \nexpressed about the debt and the deficit, one of the improvements to \nreducing the deficit and the debt as this economy recovers is the \nrecovery itself. It has improved economic activity. It is making sure \nbusinesses can do better. They can hire more workers, people get back \nto work, and they can pay their taxes.\n  Yet that very economic recovery is what is being threatened right now \nby this shutdown. We know that as bad as this shutdown is--and we are \nin the 13th day--that 4 days from now we have an even more disastrous \npotential impact to this country and to our economy looming. Economists \nacross the ideological spectrum have warned that if the Federal \nGovernment defaults on paying our bills, if we reach that debt ceiling \nand we do not continue to pay our bills, we could see businesses stop \nhiring, retirement accounts and families nest eggs could lose much of \ntheir value overnight. Interest rates would rise, which means higher \ncosts for consumers, small businesses, and the Federal Government. \nConsumer confidence, which is so important for small businesses, would \ndrop sharply. We are seeing that already. In the last few weeks we have \nseen the sharpest drop in consumer confidence since the fall of Lehman \nBrothers back in 2008.\n  We have heard from some people who are debt deniers, debt ceiling \ndeniers, that these are just scare tactics, that these terrible \nconsequences would not happen. But, in fact, we saw that in 2011; when \nwe were having this debate again about whether we should raise the debt \nceiling, there were dire consequences to that debate. In late July and \nearly August, leading up to the debt deal of 2011, the Dow Jones \nIndustrial Average dropped 2,000 points. As a result of that drop, \naverage Americans with retirement accounts saw their household wealth \nplummet by $2.4 trillion.\n  Our credit rating was downgraded for the first time in America's \nhistory, and the crisis resulted in an additional $1.3 billion in \nborrowing costs for the Federal Government. As the Presiding Officer \nsaid so well: If you care about the debt and the deficits facing this \ncountry, why would we inflict that kind of burden again on the economy \nby saying we are not going to raise the debt ceiling.\n  The potential consequences, if we refuse to raise the debt ceiling, \non November 1 we have already heard from Treasury Secretary Lew that \nSocial Security and Medicare, which have not been affected by the \nshutdown, would clearly be affected by a default. It could delay or \ndisrupt Social Security checks, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' benefits, \nmilitary salaries.\n  According to the Treasury, delayed or disrupted payments would \nprevent 57.5 million Americans from receiving Social Security benefits \nin a timely manner. This could put the most vulnerable people in \nAmerica in jeopardy and prevent them from receiving the benefits they \nhave earned and the benefits they need to live on.\n  My former colleague and fellow Senator, Judd Gregg, a Republican--he \nand I don't always agree on everything, but we certainly agreed on the \nnegative consequences of our failure to act to increase the ability of \nthis country to pay its bills.\n  In an op-ed that was published by The Hill newspaper, Senator Gregg \nsaid the brinkmanship on default is: The political equivalent of \nplaying Russian roulette with all of the chambers of the gun loaded. It \nis the ultimate no-win strategy. A default would lead to some level of \nchaos in the debt markets, which would lead to a significant \ncontraction in economic activity, which would lead to job losses, \nhigher spending by the Federal Government, and lower tax revenues, \nwhich would lead to more debt.\n  That sums it up very well. Senator Gregg understands, as I think most \nof us do in the House and Senate, that for us to refuse to raise this \ndebt ceiling, to allow the country to pay its bills, to allow the \ncountry to default, would be shortsighted, irresponsible, and reckless. \nI hope that we are all going to come together to get this done in the \nnext couple of days and save this country from even more disastrous \nconsequences.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The vote yesterday was to raise the debt ceiling \nwithout altering by one penny the spending and debt path we are on.\n  It was demanded by Senator Reid and the majority that we raise the \ndebt ceiling, give the President another $1 trillion or so in \nborrowing, and no commitment to make any changes in how we got here. \nThat was not what we did in August 2011. Then, we agreed to reduce the \ngrowth of spending over 10 years by $2.1 trillion in exchange for \nraising the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion. Of course, we have already \nspent all of that.\n  We have already borrowed $2.1 trillion more. Senator Reid and the \nmajority are demanding a clean debt ceiling bill, where we raise the \ndebt ceiling but don't bother to ask us to change our spending habits, \nnot one penny.\n  They say we can't negotiate on the debt ceiling. That is wrong.\n  I think it is perfectly appropriate. The House is prepared to do \nthis, but they want some changes in how we are spending the taxpayers' \nmoney. The American people are tired of it. By a huge majority, they \nsay we should not raise the debt ceiling unless we change our spending \nhabits. Actually, almost a quarter of the American people say we should \nlive within our income. We shouldn't raise the debt ceiling at all.\n  The idea that the President of the United States would not pay the \nbond holders of the United States, the debt holders of our country, if \nthe debt ceiling were not raised, is unthinkable. Of course he will. He \nhas to under the Constitution.\n  If we did not raise the debt ceiling, we would be bringing in $240 \nbillion a month. The interest on our debt is $20 billion a month. That \nshould be the first thing that is paid--and I am sure it would be if \nthat were to happen.\n  I agree, the shutdown needs to end and the debt ceiling impasse needs \nto be dealt with. It is not good for America. But we cannot just say we \nare not going to do anything, we are not going to make any changes in \nour habits around here. That is what is at stake.\n  I will take a few minutes to walk through our situation about how we \narrived at this point, especially with discretionary spending. I hope \nthis will be helpful to our colleagues. It is a product of our work on \nthe Budget Committee, where I am ranking member.\n  Many will remember in the summer of 2011 that Congress and the \nPresident engaged in a vigorous debate, tough negotiations, about how \nbest to address runaway annual deficits of $1 trillion a year. As a \nmatter of fact, over 5 years we have added $6 trillion to the debt of \nthe United States of America.\n  Our discussions were ultimately resolved with the passage of the \nBudget Control Act. The BCA, as it is called, had at its heart three \nagreements. First it required a vote in each House of Congress on a \nbalanced budget. Of course, the Senate voted that down. A majority, I \nbelieve, voted for it, but it didn't get the supermajority for a \nconstitutional amendment.\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\n  Second, it allowed the President to increase the debt limit by $2.1 \ntrillion subject to a congressional vote. That occurred.\n  Third, it provided spending controls of at least $2.1 trillion over \nor equal to the debt limit increase over 10 years.\n  The debt ceiling has already been reached in 2 years, a little over, \nand we still have not honored the commitment to reduce the growth of \nspending by $2.1 trillion over 10 years.\n  To rein in government spending the BCA did two things. It placed \nstatutory caps or limits on discretionary spending. Those are the \ngeneral programs of our government, which totaled $915 billion over 10 \nyears. It was enforced by sequestration. It also called for an \nadditional $1.2 trillion of future savings from any combination \nof entitlements and revenues agreed to by the so-called supercommittee \nthat the legislation formed to try to reach some agreement on long-term \nimprovements in our financial condition. This supercommittee was given \nthe challenge to do this.\n\n  If they failed, then additional reductions of $1.2 trillion would be \nenforced through a future sequester mechanism.\n  The sequester was very clear, very real. The legislation mandated \n$2.1 trillion in reduced spending, but it allowed the committee to look \nfor ways to do it. If the committee didn't reach agreement, there would \nbe some automatic cuts. Nearly $1 trillion of savings were booked \ninitially. The supercommittee went to work, but unfortunately they \nfailed to make recommendations to Congress to find the other savings \nrequired under the act.\n  I commend the members of the committee. I do believe they tried their \nbest, but they didn't reach agreement.\n  With that failure, the BCA outlined the path forward: $1.2 trillion \nin spending reductions, including interest savings, in both defense and \nnondefense operations spread out evenly over the 9 years left between \nthe fiscal years 2013 and 2021.\n  Due to a variety of other laws passed over the years, primarily the \n1990 deficit deal and the 2010 so-called pay-as-you-go act, which was \npassed on a debt limit increase also, the reductions do not apply to \nall Federal spending programs but only to those that are not exempt \nfrom enforcement. Many social programs are actually exempt. The food \nstamp program does not get a dime in reductions. Medicaid does not get \na dime in reductions, for example. These cuts were to begin in January \n2013, but were delayed until March of this year 2013, inside of that \nfiscal cliff agreement bill we reached, the American Taxpayer Relief \nAct, in January.\n  When the sequester took effect on March 1, it covered both \ndiscretionary and some mandatory spending, but less on mandatory. \nDiscretionary spending was reduced a total of $68 billion for this \nfiscal year; $43 billion of that will fall on defense, and $26 billion \non nondefense spending. They each represent about half of the Federal \nGovernment expenditures for discretionary accounts.\n  Additionally, $17 billion in identified mandatory spending was \nsequestered, of which $11 billion came from Medicare.\n  Total reductions were $85 billion. It is not a whole lot when we are \nspending $3.5 trillion, but $85 billion was at least progress downward \nin spending a little bit, at least from the growth in spending.\n  Looking ahead, colleagues have asked me what happens next under the \nBudget Control Act? In 2014, spending will be restrained on both the \nmandatory and discretionary side of the ledger at the approximate rates \nI mentioned. A sequester began on October 1 for mandatory spending--and \nthis is mainly Medicare--totaling $18.8 million. Medicare spending will \nbe reduced by a little over $11 billion, and the rest of the mandatory \nsavings will come from reductions in defense and other mandatory \nspending.\n  There are some programs in the Defense Department that are mandatory \nalso. Most of the Defense Department is discretionary. So the minor \nmandatory spending reductions hit defense and certain administrative \nexpenses for Federal benefit programs and so forth.\n  For discretionary spending, the direction is down. Under the BCA, \ntotal regular discretionary spending is planned to be at $967 billion \nthis upcoming fiscal year, split between $498 billion for defense, $469 \nbillion for nondefense, although nondefense got less of a cut than \ndefense.\n  This year's nondefense number is the same as last year; it is frozen. \nThe nondefense discretionary spending did not take another cut this \nyear. It is flat. Defense will be taking an additional $20 billion \nreduction this year under the BCA.\n  A so-called clean continuing resolution would come in at an annual \nrate of $986 billion, due to the fact that it keeps nondefense spending \nbelow the BCA caps while reflecting the current run rate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I have a number of other comments \nabout where we are financially.\n  I would ask unanimous consent to have 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would say, colleagues, that the defense cuts do not \ncount the war reduction costs. Those were entirely separate and not \npart ever this.\n  The defense budget is getting hammered, but we ought to smooth some \nof these reductions out in a more fair way. Fundamentally, though we \nmust remain committed to the requirements of the BCA.\n  I know it would be hard for my Democratic colleagues because the \nbudget they produced would spend $1 trillion over the BCA limits. The \nPresident proposes to spend $1 trillion above those limits that we \nagreed to in August 2011.\n  As part of this deal, it would be wrong for us to breach the promise \nwe made to the American people that if they let us raise the debt \nceiling to $2.1 trillion, we would reduce spending over 10 years by \n$2.1 trillion. That reduction is really a reduction in the growth of \nspending because we would be growing spending $8 trillion over 10 years \nrather than $10 trillion over 10 years.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection. Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the cost of \nthe Federal Government shutdown, including a cost we don't talk about--\nthe opportunity cost. The fact is we are paying a huge price for what \nwe are not doing here in Washington while so much of our time and \nenergies are spent on this totally unnecessary shutdown.\n  Americans are rightly looking at Congress and saying: What are you \nguys doing? Why are you hurting people? Why are you hurting families? \nWhy are you impeding our economic recovery? They are also asking: Why \naren't you working on what we send you there to do--on creating jobs, \non improving our educational system, on addressing our Nation's long-\nterm fiscal sustainability?\n  Last weekend, I came to the floor to talk about the effect of this \nshutdown on individual Minnesotans. I receive e-mails from people who \nare hurting. Let me read from a few. I will not read them in full \nbecause of time.\n  Charlotte from Duluth writes:\n\n       Senator Franken: Veterans' benefits are important to me, \n     and I want to tell you my story. I have three children and my \n     spouse who currently attends college, we just got into the \n     hud-vash program.\n\n  The HUD-VASH program is a program that provides housing assistance \nand support services for homeless veterans and their families.\n  Charlotte continues:\n\n       We thought it was a miracle to not be homeless. Now we are \n     facing the same thing, no check, no schooling. My family will \n     be homeless without food, clothes, a vehicle if this \n     government shutdown is not resolved. I am praying for a \n     miracle in this situation; my son is turning 1 year old next \n     month, I don't want to remember his first birthday with us \n     losing everything we have worked so hard for. My daughter \n     just started head-start. She loves it, but it is the last \n     thing on my mind now. I am thinking, how will I get her to \n     school? How will I provide a home for her to live in? What is \n     she going to eat? This is not a joke. I have never been one \n     to take a hand out from anyone. These are things I have \n     earned; and are now being taken away from me because someone \n     in Washington\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\n     wants to prove a point. What point is everyone trying to \n     make? That you have the power to do this?\n\n  Timothy from Bloomington writes:\n\n       My daughter is a single mother who cannot afford her home. \n     She has wisely decided to sell the house. She has persevered \n     and now has a sale pending. She is in a financial crisis and \n     needs this sale to go through or she will risk falling into \n     foreclosure. And now the government shutdown is threatening \n     to prevent the sale from going through because a branch of \n     the IRS that prints income tax transcripts is closed. At the \n     very least the situation will cost my daughter more than \n     $1,000 if she has to continue making payments, at worst she \n     may fall into foreclosure.\n\n  Last weekend, I also talked about the way the shutdown threatens to \ndeprive our seniors of vital nutrition programs, such as Meals-on-\nWheels. Here is what Millie Hernesman from Hibbing, MN, told the \nHibbing Daily Tribune about Meals-on-Wheels:\n\n       I'd hate to see it disappear. It offers a variety of \n     important meals that cover every facet--from protein to \n     fiber--and it comes right to my door. I like it a lot.\n\n  Sandra, a Head Start director in southern Minnesota, wrote me about \nHead Start. She writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Franken, Thank you for your ongoing support \n     for Head Start. If the federal budget is not settled by \n     November 1st, the HS programming in Olmsted and Freeborn \n     Counties will have to shut down. Our federal grant is from \n     11/1-10/31. As the HS Director, I know the devastating impact \n     this would have on our families and staff.\n\n  Now let me talk a little about Head Start. Because of the sequester, \nwe have seen children in Minnesota lose slots in Head Start. If this \nshutdown continues through the end of October, programs serving about \n2,500 children could be affected by the lack of Head Start funding.\n  You know, kids are only 3 years old once. They are only 4 years old \nonce. The learning experiences they would be missing at that age \nbecause their Head Start Program is shuttered due to this shutdown or \nthat they are missing now because their program has already been \nshuttered because of the sequester can never be replaced. We are just \nhurting our communities and our Nation when those little children lose \nthat opportunity.\n  We know from study after study that a quality early childhood \neducation such as Head Start returns between $7 and $16 for every $1 \ninvested. Why? Because a child who has had a quality early childhood \neducation is less likely to be referred to special ed, is less likely \nto be left back a grade, and has better health outcomes. Quality early \nchildhood programs can help reduce the rates of adolescent pregnancy. \nKids who have had a quality early childhood education are more likely \nto graduate high school, more likely to go to college, more likely to \ngraduate from college, more likely to have a good job and pay taxes, \nand they are less likely to go to prison.\n  If we really cared about our Nation's long-term fiscal \nsustainability, we would be investing more in Head Start, not less. And \nwe have been investing less because of the sequester and are now \nbecause of the shutdown. So that is just an example of the entirely \ncounterproductive nature of this shutdown and the tremendous price we \nare paying for it.\n  But I rise today also to talk about the price we are paying for what \nwe are not doing here in Congress, for the unmet needs which we are not \nturning our attention to because of the time we are wasting with this \nshutdown and the threat of default on our debt.\n  We have a skills gap in Minnesota. What is a skills gap? Well, recent \nstudies have shown that between one-third and one-half of manufacturers \nin my State have at least one job they cannot fill because they can't \nfind a worker with the right skills to fill that job. This is a \nnationwide phenomenon and it is not just manufacturers, it is \ninformation technology, health care, and other businesses that have \njobs sitting there waiting for skilled workers to fill them. There are \nmore than 3 million jobs in this country that could be filled today if \nthere were workers who had the right skills--more than 3 million jobs \ntoday.\n  The thing is, we know how to train people for these jobs. We know it \nbecause we have done it. We have done it in Minnesota and we have done \nit elsewhere in this country. I have seen partnerships in my State \nbetween businesses and community and technical colleges that have been \nwildly successful.\n  Take, for example, Hennepin Technical College in Hennepin County. A \nnumber of manufacturers needed workers skilled in precision machine \ntooling. They worked with Hennepin Technical College to create a \ncurriculum, and they then donated machines for the students to work on. \nAt a roundtable at HTC I learned they had graduated over 300 students \nfrom the program and 93 percent of those graduates had permanent jobs.\n  One of the manufacturers at the roundtable was Erick Ajax, CEO of EJ \nAjax and Sons. It is a metal stamping and sheet metal fabrication \ncompany in Fridley, MN, that was founded by Erick's grandfather in \n1945. I love what Erick has done with his company and how he has worked \nwith HTC--Hennepin Technical College--and the University of Minnesota \nto train his workforce and provide them with good high-tech jobs and \npays for them to continue their education.\n  Erick gave me an example of one of his workers that I find so \nexciting--not because it is extraordinary but because it is something \nwe can duplicate over and over in this country. He hired a guy who had \ncompleted a certification program at a community and technical college. \nThe guy was really good at his job, so Erick sent him back to continue \nhis education and get his associate's degree. The guy continued to work \nfor Erick, continued to be a star, and a few years later Erick paid him \nto go to the University of Minnesota to get his bachelor's degree, and \nhe got it. Now the guy is head of quality control for EJ Ajax, an \nincredibly high-skilled job at an advanced manufacturing company.\n  Now, understand, this guy graduated from college with no debt--zero \ndebt--and with a great job. This brings me to what I want to be working \non here.\n  A number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know how \nenthusiastic I am about incentivizing partnerships between businesses \nand community and technical colleges to fill the skills gap. As I said, \nI have seen many successful models in my State.\n  I have seen it at Alexandria Technical and Community College in \nAlexandria, MN, which is sometimes referred to as the Silicon Valley of \npackaging machines. I have seen it at South Central Community and \nTechnical College in Mankato, MN, where about 8 to 10 manufacturers, \nwho had helped fund and had given machines to the school's Right Skills \nNow Program, sat with me and told me that between them they had about \n50 job openings they could fill that instant.\n  In the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, of which I \nam a member, we had a hearing a couple of years ago on workforce boards \nthat had successfully responded to the great recession and created jobs \nin the face of it. We had four workforce boards testify from four \ndifferent States: Virginia, Wisconsin, California, and Washington. \nEvery model had been essentially the same: A business--manufacturing, \nIT, health care--had worked with a community and technical college to \ntrain unemployed workers for jobs they needed to fill. These are \npublic-private partnerships. The businesses have skin in the game.\n  Where do we come in here in Congress? Well, I have gone around \nMinnesota to community and technical colleges and talked to businesses, \nand I have talked to national experts in our State and around the \ncountry, and the fact is we aren't doing this fast enough. Sometimes \nthese partnerships could do a lot more, train a lot more people with \nsome extra funding--maybe to buy a very expensive machine or to hire an \ninstructor with very specialized skills.\n  What I am proposing is a competitive grant program. Businesses and \ncommunity colleges would apply for grants based on how many jobs their \npartnership would create, what the value of those jobs would be to \nthose hired and to the community, and how much skin the businesses have \nin the game.\n  Let me tell you why I think we have to do this, just in terms of \nglobal competitiveness. Manufacturing is moving back to the United \nStates. That is because of a number of factors. Manufacturing these \ndays is a lot more capital intensive because of the investments in \nmachine and technology. So labor as a piece of the pie has gotten \nsmaller, but\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n\nskilled labor as a piece of the labor pie has grown. It is a much \nbigger piece. That is why, if we are going to be competitive with the \nrest of the world, we need skilled labor. Filling the skills gap is a \nnational imperative.\n  I go to high schools, junior high schools, and middle schools with \nmanufacturers all the time. I let the manufacturer describe what the \nwork is like at their factory. It is not dark, dirty, and dangerous, as \npeople think it is, or as it used to be. It involves advanced technical \nskills, critical thinking, creativity, and teamwork. These jobs, good, \nskilled, well-paying jobs, are available with the education you can get \nat a 2-year community and technical college.\n  One of the concerns I hear is that people often think of a 2-year \neducation as a ceiling, and I understand that. But a 2-year education \ndoesn't have to be a ceiling. That is not how they think of it in some \nEuropean countries. They think of a 2-year education as a platform. And \nif you think about it, with the pace of technological advancement \naccelerating as it is now, and no doubt will continue, the idea that \nyou will have the same job in the workplace for the 40 or 50 years of \nyour working life is kind of ridiculous, especially in any field \ninvolving technology.\n  So it makes perfect sense to go to a 2-year community technical \ncollege and get an education that trains you in the kind of skills that \nwill get you a good-paying job. Then, as Erick Ajax does with his \nemployees, the business you work for can send you back to school and \npay for it, often while you continue to work and draw a good paycheck.\n  We just came through a big debate in Congress about student debt. \nThink about getting a job after 2 years or even after a credentialed \ndegree and then having your continuing education paid for by your \nemployer. Think about that as a piece of an evolving approach to the \nissue of college affordability.\n  Jobs, economic growth, global competitiveness, college affordability, \nhow we think about education, aren't these the things we should be \nspending our time on in the Senate, in Congress? That is why I came \nhere. That is what I get excited about. That is what I get excited \nabout working on. Let's end the shutdown. Let's commit to not \ndefaulting on our debt. Then let's discuss how we strengthen our \neconomic recovery. Let's talk about which investments we make that are \nsmart and will lead to economic growth and which ones have outlived \ntheir usefulness.\n  Every day the government stays shut down, every day we wake up under \nthe threat of default, every day we spend focused on something that \nisn't working together to create jobs and rebuild the middle class is, \nin my mind, a tragedy. It is an insult to all the people who are \nstruggling and it is a huge missed opportunity for our country. This \nnonsense would be ugly enough even if we didn't have work to do, but we \ndo. We have so much work to do. It is time for Congress to stop \ncreating problems and start solving them again.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with \nseveral of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, it is Sunday afternoon. I am sure all of \nus as well as a lot of furloughed employees would rather be preparing \nfor coming back to work. Even though Monday is a holiday, maybe they \nare thinking about Tuesday and getting ready.\n  But here we are on the Senate floor thinking about all the issues \nwith the shutdown, the default, and the threat of the default on us \nright now as we creep closer and closer to this deadline. It is \nunbelievable that we are at the risk of potentially defaulting on the \ndebt of this country.\n  I heard one of my colleagues earlier talked about the default \npotential and maybe it is not as bad as people think and we will get \nthrough this. The fact is, if we go into a default, there is no \nquestion we have already seen--by the chamber of commerce, the business \ncommunity, many people whom we talk to in our home communities--the \nimpact this will have on everything from the stock market, interest \nrates, the ability for small businesses to borrow money at a reasonable \nrate.\n  The number that came out was a 7-year high in the sense of the least \nforeclosures in the last 7 years for individuals. Yet as families are \nfinally getting back on their feet, with less defaults, here is the \nbiggest default sitting in front of us. We have tried to do everything \npossible to avoid this effort in the next few days; one, by trying to \nget the government back open so we can have negotiations and \ndiscussions about what is necessary to ensure we don't have a default \nthat could jeopardize the economy.\n  In my home State we see the impacts. We had a hearing on Friday here \nin Washington and we had the captain of one of the crab vessels, which \nis a big industry for us. My friend in Oregon deals with seafood issues \nalso. It is an incredible impact that could happen. They have to have \nthe permits and the quota laid out by October 15 so they can start the \nseason because crabs don't sit around on the bottom of the sea waiting \nfor a shutdown to finish. They have another process they go through. So \nif we are unable to get the permits done, this industry in Alaska which \nsells a lot of crab in the holiday season, especially to our trading \npartner Japan, Japan will go elsewhere. They will go to Russia and buy \ncrab. Once they start buying from another seller, the odds of us \nrecapturing that decrease.\n  As my colleagues on the other side like to say, we are just trying to \nfind a solution. Every day we wait is another day we are shipping jobs \noverseas, and here is a clear example.\n  We have several Federal lands that are permitted for bear hunting and \nhunting in general, fishing, sports fishing, by Federal regulators, but \nwe do not have those agencies open. So now those sports hunters who \ncome up to our State from all across the country and the world are \nunable to access those places. The result? Thousands and thousands of \ndollars are lost to these guides. We don't get this business back. Once \nthe season ends, it is gone. It is over.\n  This idea that the House has--and my colleagues and I have talked \nabout it. My friend from Montana talked about this a few days ago. They \npassed on the House side a bill to pay all the furloughed employees; \n435 to 0 was the vote. The Presiding Officer spoke about this on the \nfloor. We all support that. We want to get our employees back to work \nand pay them because the furlough wasn't their problem--the shutdown \nwasn't their problem. But here is what is amazing. They want to put \nthem all back to work and pay them, but they only send us a few \nagencies to open.\n  In other words, if you are a fiscal conservative--and from the States \nwe all represent we have pockets as well as full components of \nindividuals who are concerned about the taxes of this country and the \nspending--why would you pay for everyone to go back to work and then \nnot put them to work? It makes no sense.\n  The Presiding Officer was the Lieutenant Governor of a State. I can't \nimagine if he and the Governor decided that we are not going to put \nanyone to work, but we are going to pay them all for the next month or \nwhatever, he would be dragged out of office before he could blink an \neye. As a former mayor, I couldn't do that. It is unbelievable. But yet \nthat is how chaotic it is over on the House side. We are ready to solve \nthese problems, move forward, get the government open, and ensure that \nwe do not default on our debt.\n  I know some claim this is all new spending. This is not new spending. \nThese are all bills, for those of us on the floor right now, which came \nbefore our time. But they are due and we have to pay the bill. It is \nsimilar to when you buy a house. After you buy the house and you have a \nbanker, you don't get to say: I would like to stop and think about \npaying you part of it or maybe not pay you all of it and still live in \nthe house.\n  They like to toss numbers around and make it sound as if it is more \nspending. No, it is paying for what has already occurred. We have \nactually cut\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\nthe deficit since a lot of us came to office. When I came in January \n2009, the deficit was $1.4 trillion per year. Today it is about 630. We \nhave cut that deficit over 60 percent in a combination of efforts, and \nthat is where we need to keep going, but this is not helping that \neffort.\n  I know my colleagues on the floor have example after example, as I do \nin my home State, of sports fishermen who can't go fishing and fees for \nthose folks who manage it, to the commercial fishing, and my military \nfolks. Here is what is amazing. Every one of the folks on the floor has \nthe same situation. Even if we pay our furloughed Federal employees all \ntheir pay back, what happens to the contractors who work on behalf of \nthe Federal Government? They have bills to pay. They don't get that \nmoney back. But they are told to go back to work, and I guarantee it is \ngoing to cost the Federal Government more money. In my State there are \nmultiple examples, and I will leave it to my colleagues. But I know \nwhen the American people are watching and when Alaskans are watching \nthis for the last week, they think it is ridiculous, and it is. It is a \nself-created crisis by a few who believe the only way they can get \ntheir way is to crash the economy and at the same time crash the \ngovernment.\n  Are there problems with the government? Sure. Are there things we can \ndo to improve it? Absolutely. Every day we should be working on it. But \nthis start-and-stop program doesn't work so well because we never get \nto the issues all of us came to work on.\n  So I turn to my friends if they want to add to this. The idea is \ngoing to be kind of a free-flowing conversation so people can see a \ndiscussion of what is affecting us in our home States and see how we \ncan get to a solution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here with my \ncolleagues from Montana and Alaska to talk about some of the impacts in \nour various States. I thought I would share six or seven different \naspects of the impact of a government shutdown and the potential of a \ndefault and then turn this over to my colleague from Montana. Then I \nthink we are going to engage in a little bit of back-and-forth.\n  Before I list specific examples of the challenges that are faced, I \nthought I would give a framework or an analogy of how to think about \nthis.\n  The legislative process is very much like a baseball game where \nvarious folks come together. There are some for bills, some are against \na bill, they have a competition, and ultimately one side wins. \nNormally, the side that loses, if they believe they are still right, \nwill say we will be back again later in the session, next year, just \nlike a baseball team, to compete again or we will be back next year \nwith an improved team.\n  But in this case, after the team that supported health care won, the \nteam that lost said we are going to appeal the ruling to the umpire and \nwe are going to ask the umpire to rule the game out of order and rule \nthat the losing team actually won. Then, if the umpire doesn't come to \nour rescue, we are going to hold the crowd hostage and we are going to \nthreaten to burn down the stadium.\n  Those are the types of actions that are outside the sphere of the \nnormal legislative process--and they should be--because we have to be \nable to have a dialog in a democracy where we consider a bill and \ndecide yes or no and then implement it and then come back and have an \nargument over improvements to that framework or whether we should throw \nit out completely. The American people have the opportunity to weigh in \nand say: Keep those folks. They did good legislation or throw the bums \nout.\n  But all that is broken if, instead of completing that cycle, we have \nthe losing team say we are going to hold the crowd hostage and threaten \nto burn down the stadium. Then democracy doesn't function. That is \nwhere we are right now. Holding the crowd hostage is the government \nshutdown, and threatening to burn down the stadium is the threat to \ndefault on the payment of bills due.\n  So let's look at how the government shutdown is reverberating in some \nunexpected ways. Let's take home mortgages. A great majority of home \nmortgages across the Nation are insured by Fannie and Freddie. That \ninsurance doesn't happen while Fannie and Freddie are shut down.\n  Let's take work necessary to improve our ports, where that work is on \njetties. Now that work has to stop because we can't incur a new \nliability to the contractor to haul the rock out and put it into place \nor maybe it is on a dredger that needs to take place during a window \nbetween different salmon runs in the Columbia River. But now that gets \ndelayed and who knows when it will get done.\n  Let's talk about a company in Oregon that exports, and they need for \nthose exports an export license, but they can't get the export license \nbecause Commerce is shut down and can't issue that license. They have \ninventory that is waiting to ship out. Then they have cashflow problems \nnot only because they can't ship the inventory, they can't get the \npayments for shipping.\n\n  Let's talk about the trickledown for folks who are unemployed. You \nmay think about it as an employee who is staying home. One employee \nwrote to me and said, think about this, think about the fact that I owe \nchild support that is not going to get paid because I am not getting \npaid. Then he said, think about the housing market. I am not going to \nbe able to pay my mortgage. What impact is that going to have on the \nU.S. economy?\n  Let's take a look at the backlog of veterans' benefits. All over my \nState I have veterans who are applying for benefits and they want an \nanswer, and the Veterans Department is trying to process those \napplications. They have a high, intense effort to catch up on that \nbacklog. Suddenly the backlog is getting bigger instead of getting \nsmaller because the work that was being done to get rid of that backlog \ngrinds to a halt and therefore individual veterans are disadvantaged by \nnot having their applications processed.\n  Let's think about Head Start. Jessica wrote to me.\n\n       I work in early headstart in Grants Pass. We are facing a \n     shutdown due to the government shutdown. We have children who \n     need stability and a caring place where they can get their \n     basic needs met. So many families struggle to feed their \n     children and sometimes the food we serve is all those \n     children get for the day.\n\n  Then she says:\n\n       We provide more than just what some consider day care. We \n     teach, we nurture, we give hope to the next generation. \n     Shutting down our centers would mean a higher rate of poverty \n     and dangerous homes for families and children. We need our \n     voices to be heard. We need someone to stand up for us.\n\n  There are so many different ways in addition that this shutdown is \nreverberating in Oregon. One that affects every rural community is the \nimpact on timber planting. We have had the shutdown going on of actual \nlogging that is taking place in Federal forests. Folks who are logging \nare being told to stop cutting new trees, to pull their logs, skid them \nout, if you will, haul them out and shut down.\n  What about the planning for the cuts for next year? What about the \nsupply of logs to the sawmills that is going to keep that sawmill \noperating through the winter and into the spring? The reverberations \nare substantial. What about the economy in those small towns that \ndepends on those log mills when folks don't have the money, because \nthey can't log, to buy food at the grocery store?\n  I know the issues are not unique to Oregon. I am sure many of them \nreverberate in Alaska and Montana.\n  With that, I yield the floor for my colleague from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank my colleague from Oregon and the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  For many years my Republican colleagues have railed against \ngovernment. We find ourselves in an interesting time right now where \ngovernment is shut down. We are on the verge of not expanding our debt \nlimit, putting the full faith and credit of this country at risk. Some \nof the folks on the other side of the aisle ran their campaign last \nyear about shutting down the government. They got their wish. They have \nsteered us into an unnecessary, very costly shutdown.\n  Yet during the shutdown we found and we have learned every day, \noften, underappreciated functions of the government. Beyond the \nheadlines there are countless stories of the functioning of government \nwhich is not doing its\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\njob because of the shutdown that is hurting American families. There \nare a number of them in Montana.\n  We read in the news about children with cancer. We have an NIH \nlaboratory, Rocky Mountain Lab, in Hamilton. It is closed. It is one of \neight Biosafety 4 labs in the United States. They do critical research \non SARS, ebola virus, staph infections. It is not happening.\n  Mr. President, 98 percent of the National Science Foundation is \nshuttered--no new scientific research grants. Four of the five Nobel-\nprize winning scientists are furloughed.\n  National parks are closed, disappointing tourists and impacting \nstruggling communities around those parks. Closing fishing access sites \nthat support local businesses--fly stores, river guides, fly fishing \ninstructors, and just improved quality of life--does not allow people \ninto many of the best fishing spots in this country.\n  Head Start Programs are struggling, depending on when you got your \ngrant. In the small town of Box Elder, 10 miles from my hometown, they \nare on the cusp of laying off 20 percent of their teachers. Why? \nBecause they can't get their Indian Impact Aid. Since that office is \nmostly furloughed at this point in time, it is very difficult to get \nthem any help.\n  We have heard about the devastating floods in Colorado, the blizzards \nin South Dakota. We do not have a farm bill, but these folks are doubly \nimpacted. Because the Farm Service Agency offices are shuttered, there \nis no help for livestock producers who have literally lost thousands of \nhead of cattle.\n  When it comes to getting a cosignature on an FSA loan check, it is \nimpossible to do because the FSA office is closed.\n  Our military members are getting paid, but the ROTC students all over \nAmerica who rely on the government to help pay for their rent--that is \nnot happening right now.\n  The Senator from Oregon talked about VA disability claims put on \nhold. The backlog is growing. It was shrinking.\n  The IT system for a smooth transition between the DOD to VA, the \nelectronic medical records, is on hold. By the way, that is critically \nimportant to get our backlog to a reasonable number.\n  Home loans, education assistance, transportation office, workforce \ntraining--all put on hold. Domestic abuse shelters, Meals on Wheels, \nflu monitors at the CDC, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, \nNational Transportation Safety Board--all furloughed except for the \nessential staff who are working without pay.\n  Along that line, I want to say thank you to the folks at the rostrum \nwho put in 3 pretty tough weeks. In the last week and a half-plus, \nalmost 2 weeks, they haven't been paid. They are here on a Sunday \nafternoon, much like the police officers who responded to a tragic and \nscary situation last week were running toward the problem, who were on \nduty but were not getting a paycheck.\n  The House's political appeasement approach has been an attempt to \nopen the most popular and most noticed agencies, picking winners and \nlosers in a system instead of working together.\n  Then we have the debt ceiling, a situation where there is a \nRepublican-driven government shutdown to bring us close, too close for \ncomfort, to defaulting on our national debt. Some folks out there will \nsay it is no big deal. I can tell you if you are in business you know \nit is a big deal. Some folks say you can prioritize your payments, but \nthe fact is that without increasing that debt limit, prioritizing the \npayments will not fix the problem.\n  We have folks all across this country, business people, working \nfamilies, who are losing confidence in the United States. I just met a \ngroup of World War II vets who got off a plane about 2 hours ago in \nWashington, DC. A number of them talked to me about how we need to get \nour act together here. They fought for this country, but we are not \nfighting for them, and we need to.\n  The Montana Chamber of Commerce, bankers across this country, Macy's, \nbusiness leaders--all have said don't be playing with this fire. In \nfact, a friend of mine by the name of Tony James, who is president of \nBlackstone Group, wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Using the debt ceiling to settle domestic squabbles is \n     playing Russian roulette with a loaded gun. And worse, by \n     continuing on the present course, we are playing a deadly \n     game with a gun held by some of this nation's biggest rivals.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. We need to reopen this government. We need to \npay this Nation's bills. And we need to put this country back in the \nleadership role in this world.\n  Senator Begich, the Senator from Alaska, talked a little bit about \npark shutdowns. I was curious to know, with Denali National Park, which \nis a big deal--I assume the Senator is in the same place as we are with \nGlacier and Yellowstone. It is closed for business?\n  Mr. BEGICH. Yes. Not only closed for business. As we know, the FAA \nalso is shut down. There are elements of FAA still operational, but the \nfact is, in order for visitors to my State--and I am sure to the \nSenator's State, to Oregon, there is a lot of general aviation that \nmoves around, moving tourists, moving businesses, moving folks from \nplace to place. If you are in need of parts--people may not realize it, \nif you need parts for those planes you have to register them with the \nFAA. But if the FAA is closed, you cannot register the parts, you \ncannot get the parts for your plane, and they are not making the parts \nthen because they know they cannot get them registered. It is like a \nripple effect.\n  The worst part of this is those businesses that are on the outskirts \nof all these national treasures we have in this country--Oregon has \nthem, Montana has them--and the net result is those businesses don't \nhave customers. Customers do not show up. Those businesses that had \nprepared, built their inventories in anticipation, got material ready, \ngot guides ready, got their businesses all ready to go for those tours, \ncannot do them. They have no customers because they have no place to \ntake them. The reality is, the net result for these individuals--I \nthink my friend from Oregon says it so clearly in discussions I have \nhad with him--it is almost like--my friend from Oregon can correct me \nif I say this wrong--but it is almost like a tax for these businesses. \nThey do not get that money back they have invested. It is gone. It is \nover. They do not get to repeat the season. It is not like the movie \n``Groundhog Day,'' you don't get to go over and over it again. If it is \ngone, it is gone. All of us have that with these parks and national \ntreasures. The Senator talked with me about this.\n  I want to mention one thing that is very important, because we have \nheard it on the floor and I have heard it in the media accounts. They \nsay we cannot extend and pay the debt of this country, making sure we \ndo not go into default unless we have more spending cuts. We did that. \nWe did that. The continuing resolution cuts $70 billion on an \nannualized basis out of the budget this year, this coming year. We cut \n$70 billion. We actually talked about it, tried to find common ground, \nand the common ground was we agreed with their number, the House \nnumber. We brought it all the way down to their number. Seventy billion \ndollars was taken, additional cuts on an annualized basis, to our \nbudget. Now you have to pay the bill.\n  When you hear this ``we didn't give one extra penny to make sure we \ndon't default''--first of all, the default should not be part of the \ndebate here. We should never default on our debts, period. But if you \nwant cuts, we have done it, $70 billion.\n  Now because of the work they are doing or lack of what they are \ndoing, the government shutdown is causing kind of an indirect tax on \nthese business people, which is unbelievable.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague from Alaska. He is correct in \npointing out that essentially right now we have a shutdown tax being \nimposed on families and businesses across our country. Indeed, we are \nfacing just a few days from now a default tax. A lot of folks from \nacross the aisle come here and say they took a pledge to block any form \nof tax. But this is the worst kind of tax of all.\n  Mr. BEGICH. They do not get any recovery.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. There is absolutely no value, no revenue raised that can \nbe applied to the important aspects of running a government or reducing \nour deficit. Indeed, this is a burden on\n\n[[Page S7451]]\n\nAmerican businesses and American families that has no benefit in any \nother way.\n  In fact, the Senator mentioned the ripple effect. That ripple effect \nmeans what damages a family--I gave the example of a simple situation \nwhen an employee does not get their wages. They cannot pay their child \nsupport and they cannot pay their mortgage--and then what goes on from \nthere.\n  Let's take, for example, the cut in food stamps. If food stamps are \nnot issued, then it is not just the family who is directly hurt--and I \nmight mention our most vulnerable families--but it is also the grocery \nstores that are hurt. They may have to lay off additional employees, \nadditional ripples. This is a huge infliction of a burden.\n  If we want to think of a few examples of what happens with the \ndefault, we can think of many. Let's picture the default tax. By \nthreatening not to pay our bills, that reduces confidence in Treasury \nbills, so therefore the interest rates go up on those Treasury bills. \nThe interest rates therefore on mortgages go up and the interest on \nhome loans go up.\n  Mr. BEGICH. If I can interrupt, car loans, credit cards, student \nloans, any type of credit you want to get to grow your business, expand \nyour educational opportunities--maybe you are doing holiday shopping \nthis year--all that is impacted in a negative way.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Indeed, maybe you were planning to take out a home \nequity loan to repair your roof or make improvements to your house. You \nare going to pay a higher price. This is a default tax on all of \nAmerica that does nothing productive at all.\n  This infliction of pain and agony on our businesses and our families \nis something that has not apparently resonated for some of my \ncolleagues who want to threaten a default. Some of them have come to \nthis floor and said: We think there is enough revenue coming in that we \ncan pay our T-bills--our Treasury bills--and we can default on other \nobligations and therefore there won't be much damage.\n  We had a group of experts come in and testify before the banking \ncommittee. They said: Look, envision a situation where you are applying \nfor a mortgage and you tell the bank that you have always made your \nhouse payments, but you were not able to make some of your other \npayments, such as your student or car loan. The bank is going to charge \nyou more for your house payment because there are bills you have been \ndefaulting on.\n  The same situation applies in America. If we pay our Treasury bills \nbut we don't pay other obligations, that in itself will lower our \ncredit rating and increase interest rates. A default is a default. You \ncan choose whom you are going to default on, but no matter whom you \ndefault on, there will be a default tax on American families and \nAmerican businesses with great damage to this country. That is why \nPresident Reagan simply said: Do not mess with the good faith and \ncredit of the United States of America.\n  Mr. BEGICH. It makes no sense that we would be here. Earlier this \nweek Senator Tester and I were on the floor talking about this issue. \nWhen I went home, my 11-year-old son asked: How do you not pay your \nbills? We can have all the fancy economists we want, but when you have \nan 11-year-old ask you the question, it should tell you something about \nthis country--what we should do to meet our priorities. When you don't \npay your bills, you are in default. When you are in default, you \ndestroy your credit rating. When you destroy your credit rating, the \ncost of doing business goes up. It is very simple.\n  They can use all the fancy words and different ways to slice it and \ndice it by saying that we can pay some or we can pay a little. No, that \nis not how it works. Can you imagine if every household watching us \ntoday said: I think I will pay part of my bills today. Maybe I will pay \nanother bill next week, but I won't pay them all. Congress doesn't pay \nall its bill, so I guess that is the new norm.\n  If my 11-year-old son can pick this up, you can surely guess what is \nhappening when people around the country are watching us. And I say \n``us'' in a collective way. All three of us are appropriators. We have \ndealt with cutting $70 billion out of the budget already for this year. \nWe sucked it up and said: We are going to do that because it is right \nfor this country. Even though we may not have agreed on that number, we \nagreed to make sure we did this because we wanted to make sure we did \nnot default and that we kept the government working. We will continue \nto fight on the issues we care about.\n  It is amazing to me. Sometimes we have to look to the young folks in \nthis community and around this country, and they probably know better \nthan we how to solve this problem. I am just guessing.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I think the children across the country know that \nresponsible individuals pay their bills and responsible governments pay \ntheir bills. I am sure this concept is common sense in the great State \nof Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. The Senator is correct. There are so many folks out there \nwho claim to be probusiness folks and that they know what is going on \nin the business community. This whole debate that revolves around the \ndebt ceiling is about as antibusiness as we can have.\n  The fact is that if we don't increase the debt ceiling--and the \nSenator from Oregon and the Senator from Alaska have already pointed it \nout--interest rates not only go up for our national debt, they go up \nfor everybody. The economy decreases and shrinks, and as a result we \nhave less revenue coming in. Everybody knows that if we are going to \naddress our national debt, we have to have a vibrant economy to address \nit.\n  We came through a period of time where we had a Vice President who \nsaid debt doesn't matter, we got into two wars, two major tax cuts, a \nMedicare Part-D plan, and the worst recession--some would call a \ndepression--since the 1930s, where the tax revenue dropped like a rock \nand the safety net programs to keep people afloat--which cost money--\nwere decreased.\n  Now we have a situation with the debt that we need to deal with. The \nworst thing we can do is play around with the debt ceiling so our \neconomy tanks again, and then we will see not only the interest rate go \nup on the debt but the debt go through the roof one more time. It does \nnot make any sense from all the different perspectives. When people \nlose confidence--whether it is people within this country or outside \nthis country who buy our debt--that means the rate we pay is going up.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Is it fair to say that we have been moving this annual \ndeficit down every year? It has been on the right glidepath--down. If \nwe have a change in the T-bill rates, this effort to keep moving the \ndeficit down will quickly reverse because we pay interest.\n  Mr. TESTER. Absolutely. It could have such a negative impact on the \nGDP that we could have a negative fourth quarter if this crazy talk \nkeeps going.\n  Mr. BEGICH. To remind folks who are listening, the gross domestic \nproduct is basically the business of the country.\n  Mr. TESTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BEGICH. If it goes in the wrong direction, it will have a direct \nimpact on the people who are working--meaning fewer people will be \nworking. If there is less business, there is less need to hire people, \nwhich means higher unemployment and more foreclosures. It is a domino \neffect.\n  Mr. TESTER. That is exactly correct. I think everybody on the floor \nright now--and there are a lot of other folks--would love to sit down \nand figure out ways to get the debt and deficit under control. As Tony \nJames said, you don't do it by holding a loaded gun.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. If I could just emphasize the point the Senator from \nMontana just made, there are those who say they want to engage in a \ndefault strategy because they think it will somehow do something \npositive in controlling our deficit and controlling our debt, but what \nthe Senator from Montana pointed out is that when you engage in using \ndefault as a weapon, you reduce revenues, increase costs, which \nincreases deficits and increases the debt.\n  I think what we can summarize is not only is the default strategy \nseverely damaging to families and businesses across the country, but it \nis damaging to the effort to reduce our deficits and reduce our debt.\n  Mr. TESTER. And I might add it could not happen at a worse time. We \nhave seen the economy rebound, and it\n\n[[Page S7452]]\n\nis starting to head in the right direction. We have an opportunity to \nhave more growth. We have an opportunity to get some manufacturing back \nin this country. We have an opportunity to really help rebuild this \neconomy. Because of the actions of Congress, particularly folks over in \nthe House, we have seen the stock market--God help us today. I think it \nopens right now.\n  Mr. BEGICH. The Asian markets open right about now.\n  Mr. TESTER. I can't help but think that these folks are back there \nshaking their heads and saying: We have no confidence in what Congress \nis doing.\n  Mr. BEGICH. For the first 15 to 18 days of debate, the market slowly \nslid about 800 points. Last week, when there was a sliver of \nopportunity and people thought maybe we would get the default off the \ntable, that market shot up 300-plus points. The business community \nwants us to establish some certainty here so they can take their \nresources, invest in this economy and continue to move forward.\n  We know the resources are there. They tell us that in our home \ncommunities. I had a business that just laid off another 400 people \nbecause of this shutdown. They are ready to grow their business \ninterests out of Anchorage and around the globe, but the challenge for \nthem is they are not sure what we are going to do.\n  Within a couple of days when they saw a glimmer of hope, the market \nshot right back up, which tells us again that the market is ready.\n  Some people said that yesterday's vote was just a partisan vote. No, \nwe had to actually not default, so we supported not defaulting on our \ndebt. I will have debate after debate on where we need to cut. Again, \nthe continuing resolution cuts $70 billion on an annualized basis. We \nhave met their number with that cut, and we are willing to keep to that \nagreement, but let's not throw the economy over the edge or crash it \ninto the wall, as some seemingly want to do.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask through the Chair whether the Senator knows of any \nbusiness group in Alaska that is arguing that the government shutdown \nstrategy or the default strategy is good for business.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I come from the small business world. At the young age of \n14 I started my first business. I don't hear the business community in \nmy State asking me to crash the economy and keep the government shut \ndown because it has no impact.\n  When we look at the concentration of Federal workers, it is Maryland, \nHawaii, and Alaska, in that order. When we think of the State budget, \n25 percent of the State operating budget is from Federal resources; 50 \npercent is capital money that comes from Federal resources; the \nmilitary is pretty strong; and over $1 billion goes to Social Security \npayments. I can go through the list. It has a huge impact.\n  There are no businesses calling me and asking: Can you keep the \ngovernment shut down longer? I don't need that permit to drill on the \nNational Petroleum Reserve. I don't need to go fish for that crab this \nweek. I don't need to fly my plane to move that cargo out to a rural \ncommunity. I don't hear that.\n  I have people call me and say--I can't use the words they use because \nwe are on the Senate floor, but you can fill in the blanks. They are \nvery upset that they cannot conduct their basic business operations \nbecause of some of the connectivity they have with the Federal \nGovernment through permits or land use. Denali National Park is a great \nexample. It is an unbelievable place to visit, but nobody can visit it. \nThe hotels and the facilities around it are not getting the access they \nneed.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. It is the same in Oregon. I don't think I have heard \nfrom a single business group that has argued in favor of the shutdown \nor default strategy. I know many businesses need the export license, \nand they need permission to take up the subcontract or the contract on \nthe jetty or the dredging or any number of other areas.\n  We have Crater Lake National Park. The tourist industry relies on \npeople to come to that area. There are timber companies that need to \nhave permission to complete their logging contract. In every single way \nthey know, they are partnered with the government groups that enable \nthis work to go forward, and they want those doors open. They want the \ngovernment open.\n  I ask through the Chair, what is the story in Montana?\n  Mr. TESTER. It is the same in Montana as it is in Oregon and Alaska. \nParticularly startup businesses and entrepreneurs who have a great idea \nare holding back because they don't want to get into a situation where \nthey start investing money and interest rates go through the roof and \nthey are not able to fulfill the dream they have which would also \ncreate jobs and grow more economy.\n  We are getting very close to October 17. The longer we play with \nthis, there will be a point in time where the damage that will be done \nwill take a very long time to rebuild. I think now is the time--in \nfact, hopefully tomorrow--to get a commonsense agreement on the Senate \nfloor to open the government and deal with the debt limit in a way that \nmakes sense for this country and makes sense for the world because it \nwill not only have an impact here, but it will have an impact around \nthe world.\n  We are seeing businesses in our States that are not investing right \nnow. They are holding off at this point. They were starting to invest. \nSo it is very unfortunate. We are playing with fire, and we should not \nbe doing that. We should be working to build the economy, not to try to \ncontract it.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I think all of us on the floor agree that we have hope \nthat an arrangement and deal will be made. We want to reopen the \ngovernment, pay our bills, not go into default, and recognize we still \nhave more work to do because we do need to bring down the deficit. We \nneed to bring it down and ensure that at the end of the day we are \npaying off our debt long term. But we have to get through this process. \nWe can't just keep doing these short term, stop and go. I think we are \nall here to make sure that happens.\n\n  So from my perspective, I am not happy that I am here on Sunday, but \nI am glad I am here on Sunday, trying to work with others to solve this \nproblem. I would rather be back home with Alaskans talking about the \nneeds they have and trying to figure out what we are going to do in the \nlong term on education, making sure we oversee our oil and gas \ndevelopment, our mining and our timber, which I think both of our \nStates have a lot of interest in.\n  We are here now, and we have to resolve these issues. They are going \nto be tough. There is going to have to be a little give-and-take to \nfind that common ground. At the end of the day, I believe we can get \nthere. But we can't get there if people are hardened into their views, \nand trying to claim that we haven't done enough already. We have done \n$70 billion worth of cuts already on an annualized basis.\n  So I thank my colleagues for coming to the floor and spending their \ntime on a Sunday talking about an important issue. Hopefully, the next \ntime we are here we can talk about a great resolution that moves this \ncountry forward and keeps our economy going.\n  I yield to my friend from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I appreciate my colleague from Alaska helping to \norganize this conversation. I must say, I think if we got 10 \ncommonsense people in a room, they would agree to do that short-term \ncontinuing resolution. The Democrats have agreed to a Republican \nnumber. It is a win for the Republicans. The Democrats are asking for a \nnegotiation. That is a win for our country. We are asking for the \ndefault strategy to be set aside completely because it is completely \ncontrary to any responsible organization to use a strategy of not \npaying their bills.\n  On that foundation we should get back to the normal process of \nconsidering legislation we should be passing, such as how we restore \nthe regular budget and appropriations process. I know that would be \nvery welcome across this Nation. This Senate has to be able to get a \nbudget process that isn't cut off right out of the gate, if you will, \nas it has been this year. It was 6 months ago that we passed a budget \nand we started to go to a conference committee, and a small group of \ncolleagues filibustered starting the budget conference committee. \nSomehow we have to have a process where we can get into a conference \nroom and have that conversation and not have a small group basically \nsabotage the entire budget appropriations process that is so important \nfor our Nation.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I agree. The last thing I will say this afternoon is--and \nI will\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\nsay it as an appropriator--that is what we should do. We need to get \npast this stop-and-go. We need to sit down and focus on the long term. \nWe need to get the budget resolved. We need to stop spending our time \ntrying to get people to the table. That is all we have been trying to \ndo. We need to get a budget resolved so people will know what their \nannualized budgets will be. I totally agree with the Senator from \nOregon.\n  Hopefully, over the next 24, 48 hours, we will get down that road, \nand we will get this short-term stuff out of the way and get on with \nthe longer term.\n  Again, I wish to thank the Presiding Officer for the time and for \nallowing us to speak today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleagues for \nwhat I think was a very vivid way in which they laid out the severe \ndamage that is occurring because of the shutdown and the potential that \none of the most important economic powers, if not the most important \neconomic power in the world, is fooling around with the notion that we \nnot pay our bills on time.\n  I wish to compliment various newspapers around the country that are \ndoing their best to point out to people that this isn't some kind of \nexercise that is just about all of us here in Washington. This isn't \nabout the politics or the posturing. This is about real people and the \npain they are feeling.\n  This morning in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the headline was \n``Shutdown is casting a wide net of grief.'' In that article, it went \nthrough a number of different people's lives and how they were hurting \nbecause of the shutdown--people such as Nancy Jones.\n  Nancy retired from the Army 4 months ago, and she was at a food \npantry this weekend because her retirement check had not processed \nthrough yet, and now it is not clear when she is going to get her \nretirement check. She moved back to St. Louis to help with her four \ngrandchildren, and now she is putting her head on her pillow tonight \nnot knowing when her pension, which she has earned, will actually come \nthrough because of the shutdown. As a result, she is going to a food \npantry at a local church to get two bags of groceries.\n  Then there is Rasheedah Whitfield. She went to the Social Security \noffice in St. Louis to do something very simple, and that was to \nreplace her lost Social Security card. She knocked and no one was home. \nThe Social Security Administration has furloughed people who do things \nsuch as getting a replacement for people's lost Social Security card. \nWhy is that so important? Well, because Ms. Whitfield needs her Social \nSecurity card in order to fill out her Section 8 application, and time \nis running short for her to find housing for herself and her small \nchild. She is unsure what she is going to do if she can't get that \nreplacement card.\n  Then there are the people who have been furloughed who clean one of \nthe Federal office buildings in St. Louis. They work for $11 an hour \ncleaning the Goodfellow Federal Center in north St. Louis. It is an \n$11-an-hour job. These people aren't sitting on a big cushion. These \npeople are trying to figure out now, without that $11-an-hour job, if \nthey can either pay the rent or make the car payment, but probably not \nboth.\n  Then there is Jill Ketchum who works and who is fortunate that her \nchild, her 5-year-old daughter, goes to the Head Start school. She is \nnot sure what she is going to do because she has been told by the Grace \nHill Settlement House that the Head Start program cannot last through \nthe month if the shutdown continues. That mother, who is working and \nuses that important Head Start program to make it work for her family, \nwill have no place to take her daughter. What does she do? Does she \nhave to quit her job? What about all the other single mothers out there \nwith young children who have the rug pulled out from under them because \nHead Start can no longer operate?\n  Jill and Rasheedah and Nancy don't deserve this. They are playing by \nthe rules. They are doing everything they should be doing in this great \ncountry. They are not asking us to do them a favor. They are just \nasking us to do our job.\n  Here is what I am so frustrated about. This pain is being inflicted \non millions of Americans, and this pain grows every day. Somebody \nlikened it the other day to when the power goes out at our home. In the \nfirst couple of hours, we are getting candles out and getting out the \nboard games, and we think, Oh, this is kind of fun. I got the feeling \naround here the first couple of hours that we didn't understand the \ngravity of what this meant to so many people throughout this country \nand to so many people in my State. But after the electricity has been \noff a few hours, all of a sudden it is not funny anymore. We start to \nlose our food in the refrigerator, and we wonder how we are going to \nreplace it. We wonder about what is going to happen with our jobs. We \nwonder about keeping warm. That is what we are getting to now. We are \ngetting to the point where these families across America cannot believe \nthis is going on day after day.\n\n  Here is the weird part. What are we doing? It is not even clear to me \nwhat the other side wants. It started out with a goal that was not only \nirrational, but unreasonable--that somehow the election last November \ndidn't matter; that somehow a faction of one party in one House in one \nbranch of this great government could say: If you don't give us our \nway, we are going to turn out the lights, and we are going to cut the \npower. So it was about blowing up ObamaCare.\n  Now it is not about that anymore. I listened with interest this \nmorning as the Republicans in the House of Representatives spoke about \nwhat this is about, and it is not clear to me at this point what it is \nabout. What is it that is the problem? Because it is not ObamaCare \nanymore. Is it entitlement reform? Is it a grand bargain? Speaker \nBoehner walked away from one of those not too long ago.\n  Is it about how much we are spending? We have been asking for a \nconference on our budget. For years, we were getting political \ncriticism over the fact that the Senate had not passed a budget. So we \nstayed up all night, took dozens and dozens and dozens of votes, and \npassed a budget. Then we asked to go to conference. For month after \nmonth after month, the junior Senator from Texas and others blocked our \nability to go to conference and talk about the budget.\n  So I don't even understand at this moment what this is about. It is \nnot about ObamaCare anymore. Is it about reforming Medicare and Social \nSecurity? That is not clear. Is it about how much money we are \nspending? That is not even clear.\n  It feels as though we are boxing shadows.\n  I am really hopeful about my colleagues across the aisle in the \nSenate, many of whom I have worked with on many different issues and a \nlot of whom I have worked with on bringing down spending. My colleague \nfrom Alaska said we cut our deficit in half last year. It is a good \nthing we are spending less money. Most of us here think we should \ncontinue in a thoughtful way to spend less money. It is my hope that my \ncolleagues who rejected--the majority of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle rejected the effort of the junior Senator from Texas \nto say, ``Us too,'' to the goal that was irrational and unreasonable, \nshutting down ObamaCare. Those Senators who knew this was not a game \nthat should be played, I am hopeful they will help us reach a \nresolution that will not only allow the government to reopen but allow \nus to quit playing the very dangerous game of saying to the rest of the \nworld that we are not the United States of America; that we are not the \ngrandest and most glorious democracy ever created; that we are \ndysfunctional deadbeats. If it gets to be Thursday and we have not \ngotten this wrapped up, the rest of the country is going to see this \ndemocracy as dysfunctional--a democracy that so many other countries \nhave tried to copy and emulate because we have always managed to work \nit out. To me that is the saddest part of this whole thing, that we are \nactually playing around with the essence of what makes our country \ngreat, and that is our democracy, our ability to compromise, our \nability to negotiate, our ability to not throw tantrums and say we \neither get our way or we shut the place down.\n  And the phoniest argument of all that is being made, the most \ndisingenuous, misdirected reason we have gotten is this notion that \nsomehow this is\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\nall about if we would just stop the congressional exemption under \nObamaCare. Members of Congress and their staffs are the only people in \nAmerica who are required to shop on the exchange. Let me say it again. \nMembers of Congress and their staffs are the only people who are \nrequired to shop on the exchange. The only issue here is whether or not \nwe get an employer contribution. That is the only issue.\n  Every Republican in my State who works for the State government gets \nan employer contribution. Every Republican who serves in Congress from \nmy State gets an employer contribution. They do it right now; they get \nthat employer contribution. If it is so immoral, if it is so bad to get \nan employer contribution, give it up. Step up, set the example. Set the \nexample, Say, ``No more employer contribution. It is evil.'' Until they \nstep up and give up their employer contribution, I think it is beyond \noffensive that they would threaten the young lady who answers my phone \nwith her employer contribution or the young man just out of school with \na heavy debt load who thought he was going to get an employer \ncontribution when he came to work for the Senate, who lives in \nColumbia, MO, and doesn't make a huge amount of money.\n  You do not come to work for the government if you want to get rich. \nYou come to work for the government if you want to serve. The notion \nthat for political purposes we are threatening the employer \ncontribution of the people who work in our offices is, frankly, about \nas low as it gets. So I do not want to hear it anymore unless somebody \nis giving up their employer contribution. They all can. The minute I \nhear the Republicans who are advocating this position have given up \ntheir employer contribution--right now--then we can have a discussion \nthat has misled the American people into thinking somehow--somehow--\nthis is some special deal for Congress.\n  Real people are getting hurt. We are not even sure what the other \nside wants. We are threatening the essence of what makes America great, \nwhich is our democracy, and we are misleading the American people in \nways that are tremendously unfair to the great people who work for all \nof us across this city and, importantly, across all of our home States.\n  So I will continue to talk to my friends across the aisle. Even \ntoday, on Sunday, all of us are having these conversations. It is my \nunderstanding our friends down the hall in the House of Representatives \nwent home. We are having conversations. One week ago I do not think the \nSpeaker could utter a sentence without saying the word \n``conversation.'' We are having conversations today. I hope they will \ncontinue into the night and that tomorrow will be a better day for this \ndemocracy that we all like to brag about but we are threatening to blow \nup.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
