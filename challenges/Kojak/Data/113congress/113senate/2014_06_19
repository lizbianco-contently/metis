Last weekend there was something strange and unusual \nhappening out in Southern California near a place called Dana Point, \nwhich is north of San Diego. The previous night's guests were being \nushered off the premises by hotel security. A private security team \nmoved onto the property, setting up checkpoints. The hotel employees \ncould be seen sweeping the rooms for electronic listening devices, and \ndozens of wealthy men and women were led into the resort, registering \nto attend an event deceptively entitled ``T Annual Sales Meeting.''\n  This meeting, once started, turned into a multiple-day event. It was \nclosed to all spectators, journalists, and all those not explicitly \ninvited. No official itinerary was available and details have not been \nforthcoming.\n  There were at least two Senators slated to attend and they did \nattend, but their offices have refused to comment on their \nparticipation. After all, attendees were sworn to secrecy--high levels \nof security, concealment, deception, and oaths of silence. That doesn't \nsound anything like a typical conference. It sounds more like a cult. \nBut instead of being a religious movement or a secret sect, this is a \ncult of money, influence, and self-serving politics. This is the cult \nof Koch, and I am referring to the Koch brothers.\n  At their twice-yearly secret donor retreat, Charles and David Koch \nraise millions--millions and hundreds of millions--of dollars they then \nuse to pursue their radical agenda--and it is radical. This year's \nconference was especially important to the Koch brothers as they \ncoordinate efforts to spend hundreds of millions of dollars dictating \nthis year's elections.\n  But why cloak their message in secrecy?\n  In his op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Charles Koch invited his \ncritics to ``try to understand my vision for a free society.'' It is \neasy to understand. Look at the Libertarian run he had for Vice \nPresident in 1982. They laid out what they wanted to do: privatize \nSocial Security, basically do away with government. So to his critics \nhe said, ``Try to understand my vision of a free society.''\n  That is pretty easy to do. How could we possibly understand the \nKochs' vision, though, when they and their loyal followers try to do \neverything in secrecy? They hide from America. The truth is the Koch \nbrothers are concealing their massive fundraising because Americans \noverwhelmingly oppose the purchase of our country. Our country \nshouldn't be for sale, and it isn't for sale, and I think in a little \nless than 5 minutes that can be proven.\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\n  Instead of making the case directly to the American people, the Koch \nbrothers funnel unseemly amounts of money into elections, trying to \nelect representatives who will do their bidding. Again in the paper \ntoday, they have all these phony organizations they fund. It is just a \nway to hide the agenda of the Koch brothers. They don't want their name \nto appear. They want to do everything they can to mislead the American \npeople.\n  The influence of unlimited spending on a political system is not \nright. It allows individuals to dictate their will on the American \nelectoral process, and in this instance in secret. This unlimited \ncampaign spending disenfranchises Americans who don't have the \nresources to go tit-for-tat with two of the richest men in the world.\n  When the minority leader was a freshman Senator, he also took \nexception to the limitless spending of special interests. He said:\n\n       If the American public thinks that special interests are \n     having undue influence on the process, then get rid of the \n     PACs. I will be more than happy to eliminate PACs altogether.\n\n  But I guess times have changed. Now the Republican leader rails \nagainst campaign finance reform when in the past he was in favor. There \nshould be no surprise that he attended the Kochs' planning session this \npast weekend. Evidently Senator McConnell no longer believes that \nspecial interests have an undue influence on our government.\n\n  But he wasn't the only member to attend the Koch extravaganza. The \njunior Senator from Florida found the time to fly across the country \nand kiss the ring of the Republican Party's billionaire benefactors \nand, among other things, told them how outrageous it is that people are \ntalking about the climate changing, that the Earth is warming. I am \nsure the junior Senator got a lot of applause there, even though we \nwere not able to hear the applause because it is all very secret.\n  What else should we expect? The decisions by the Supreme Court have \nleft the American people with the status quo in which one side's \nbillionaires are pitted against the other side's billionaires--except \none side doesn't have any billionaires.\n  We must undo the damage done by the Supreme Court's recent campaign \nfinance decisions, and we need to do it now. That is why I support the \nconstitutional amendment sponsored by Senators Tom Udall of New Mexico \nand Michael Bennet of Colorado. This constitutional amendment grants \nCongress the authority to regulate and eliminate the raising and \nspending of money for Federal elections. Senators Udall and Bennet's \namendment will rein in the massive spending of super PACs which have \ngrown so much since the Citizens United decision in January of 2010. \nThis constitutional amendment also provides States with the authority \nto institute campaign spending limits at the State level.\n  Simply put, a constitutional amendment is what this Nation needs to \nbring sanity back to political campaigns and to restore Americans' \nconfidence in their elected leaders.\n  Let's put an end to the cult of darkness which is corrupting our \nelections. It is time we revive our constituents' faith in the \nelectoral system and let them know their voices are being heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield to a question through the \nChair?\n  Mr. REID. Be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the majority leader through the Chair, yesterday \nafternoon the subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary on the Constitution \nheld a hearing and a vote on Senate Joint Resolution 19, which the \nmajority leader has referenced, offered by Senator Udall of New Mexico \nand Senator Bennet of Colorado.\n  The resolution would basically restore us to the moment in time \nbefore the Citizens United decision and before the McCutcheon Supreme \nCourt decision which would allow the Federal Government and the States \nto regulate campaign spending. It is content neutral in terms of the \nefforts to be made by the government but reestablishes new standards in \nterms of contributions in spending across America.\n  I ask the Senate majority leader, who has followed this closely, as \nhe has followed the amount of money being spent on elections in this \ncountry, what he can foresee as the ultimate result if we fail to undo \nthe Citizens United decision?\n  Mr. REID. We are already seeing it, I am sad to say. In one State the \nKoch brothers have spent almost $20 million against one Senator, and \nthey say that is just the beginning.\n  America should not be for sale. I agree with the Republican leader \nwhen he said there should be limits put on this. I agreed, as I read \nthe quote from his earlier remarks, it is not right.\n  Now we have two of the richest men in the world trying to buy \nAmerica, and they are not only trying to buy Senate seats and House \nseats, there are votes on secretaries of state around the country, \nState legislatures. They have far more money than virtually every \ngovernment and they want to have their view of government be the law: \nPrivatize Social Security, do away with the Internal Revenue Service, \nand on and on with their money-buying program to convince the American \npeople that the Koch brothers are right.\n  Mr. President, I would also say this through the Chair to my friend. \nThey not only have all these entities I have talked to you about, they \ngive money to the Chamber of Commerce. I am sure they were their \nlargest contributor. Why? Because the Chamber of Commerce runs ads \nagainst us.\n  I appreciate the question and I would like to go on a little longer \nbut the Republican leader is here.\n  I will close, but I deeply appreciate my friend who has been such an \nadvocate on the Judiciary Committee and I hope very soon that the full \ncommittee reports on that resolution so we can move it on the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3826-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last night the Senate Deomocratic \nleadership pulled the Energy and Water bill from consideration for one \nreason: to protect the administration's new job-killing coal \nregulations. So once again Senate Democrats are preventing my \ncommonsense procoal measure from moving forward. They have done the \nbidding of the administration instead of listening to constituents back \nhome. Kentucky families, especially our coal families, continue to \nstruggle under the Obama economy.\n  The Senate Democratic leadership's latest action is yet another \nexample of the lengths they are willing to go to defend the Obama \nadministration's regulatory agenda--an agenda Washington Democrats seem \nwilling to protect at all costs, even when supposedly pro-energy Senate \nDemocrats try to make us think otherwise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3826-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3826-S3827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. President, historians will note that President Obama's national \nsecurity policy has been noteworthy for its adherence to consistent \nobjectives: drawing down our conventional and nuclear forces, \nwithdrawing from Iraq and Afghanistan, surrendering the tools necessary \nto fight the war on terror, and placing substantial trust in \ninternational organizations and diplomacy. In short, he has displayed \nan inflexible commitment to policy positions that would completely \nerode America's standing in the world, and he has refused to change \ncourse even as circumstances have changed.\n  I, like many in the Senate, profoundly disagree with his view of \nAmerica's role in the world. I disagree because I believe his attitude \nhas left America weaker and will leave substantial problems to his \nsuccessor.\n  I believe that we, as a superpower without imperialistic aims, have a \nduty to help maintain an international order and a balance of power, \nnot out of altruism but out of national interest. And I believe that \ninternational order is best maintained through American military might. \nIn fact, I believe that American military might forms its very \nbackbone.\n  But President Obama has always been a reluctant Commander in Chief. \nIt seems he has always seen things quite differently. That was clear \nfrom his first actions in office, and his more\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\nrecent actions set the other bookend to his Presidency--withdrawal from \nAfghanistan.\n  Consider that in his very first week in office, he signed an \nExecutive order that sought to end CIA's interrogation and detention \nprograms and to close Guantanamo within a year. The problem was that he \ndidn't have a credible plan for what to do with the detainees \nafterward. He still doesn't.\n  That was one of the first things he did in office, and it parallels \ndisconcertingly with one of the most recent things he has done in \noffice: announcing the withdrawal of all of our combat forces from \nAfghanistan by the end of his term. I say that because once again he \nannounced step A without thinking through the consequences of step B. \nHe seems determined to pull out completely whether or not the Taliban \nis in a position to reestablish itself, whether or not Al Qaeda's \nleadership finds a more permissive environment in the tribal areas of \nPakistan, and whether or not Al Qaeda has been driven from Afghanistan \ncompletely--one of our primary aims in this conflict from the \nbeginning.\n  The two examples I mentioned serve as bookends to his Presidency, but \nbetween these two bookends much has been done that undermines our \nnational security--for instance, the President's inability to see \nRussia and China for what they are: dissatisfied regional powers intent \non increasing their respective spheres of influence.\n  The failed reset with Russia and the President's commitment to a \nworld without nuclear weapons led him to hastily sign an arms treaty \nthat did nothing to substantially reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile. \nWhat do we have to show for the reset? Moscow was undeterred in its \nassault on Ukraine, as everyone can plainly see, and Russia has \nrepeatedly found ways to undermine our national objectives.\n  Then there is the President's strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific--a \nplan he announced without any real plan to fund it, rendering the \nstrategy largely hollow. We see examples of that almost daily, with \nChina undeterred in its efforts to intimidate smaller nations over \nterritorial disputes. Let's be clear. We cannot pivot forces to Asia \nthat are still needed in places such as the Mediterranean and Persian \nGulf, nor can we constrain China's ambitions without investing or \ndeveloping the forces needed to do so. I fear that the failure to make \nthe kinds of naval, air, and Marine Corps investments that are \nnecessary could have tragic consequences down the road.\n  Of course, we have all seen how eager the President is to declare an \nend to the war on terrorism. The threat from Al Qaeda and other \naffiliated groups has now metastasized. The turmoil unleashed by \nuprisings in north Africa and the broader Middle East has resulted in \nadditional ungoverned space in Syria, Libya, Egypt, and Yemen. We have \nseen prison breaks in Iraq, Pakistan, Libya, and the release of \nhundreds of prisoners in Egypt. Terrorists have also escaped from \nprisons in Yemen, a country that is no more ready to detain the \nterrorists at Guantanamo now than they were in 2009. And the flow of \nforeign fighters into Syria--which has fueled the growth of ISIL--\nsuggests that the civil war there will last for the foreseeable future.\n  The dogged adherence to withdrawing our conventional strength and \nsticking to campaign promises has created a more dangerous world, not a \nstable one--as just one example, the President's failure to negotiate a \nstatus of forces agreement with Iraq. An agreement such as that would \nhave allowed for the kind of residual military force that could have \nprevented the assault by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Now \nwe see the consequences unfolding before our eyes, and it is incredibly \nworrying. President Obama's withdrawal-at-all-costs policy regarding \nIraq has proved deeply harmful to U.S. interests, and it ignores the \nsacrifices made by our servicemembers--those who sacrificed life and \nlimb fighting to keep America safe.\n  Several weeks ago the President spoke at West Point, and in that \nspeech he vaguely described a new counterterrorism strategy and pledged \nto engage ``partners to fight terrorists alongside us.'' He made clear \nthat he hopes to use special operations forces in an economy of force, \nand he hopes to deploy, train, and assist missions across the globe--\nall as he withdraws our conventional forces and as our conventional \nwarfighting ability atrophies.\n  As I said, he will leave his successor with a great many challenges.\n  So this morning my Republican colleagues and I will explain how, by \ninflexibly clinging to campaign promises made in 2008, the President \nhas weakened the national security posture of the United States and why \nwe believe he is likely to leave the next President with daunting \nsecurity problems to solve.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Arizona and others are here.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3827-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today we see reports that now ISIS has \ntaken over the major oil refinery in Baiji, Iraq. Names that we used to \nhear quite often, such as, Tal Afar, Mosul, Fallujah, Ramadi--all of \nthese areas are now under the black flag of Al Qaeda and ISIS, which is \nan even worse organization than Al Qaeda, if that can be believed.\n  We now see the forces of ISIS marching on Baghdad itself, which I \ndon't believe they can take. But the second largest city in Iraq--\nMosul--is now under the black flag, and quantities of military \ncapability and equipment have clearly fallen into the hands of what has \nnow become the richest, largest base for terrorism in history. This has \nall come about in the last couple of weeks.\n  What has the United States of America done? Today we see on the front \npage of the Washington Post: ``U.S. Sees Risk in Iraqi Airstrikes.'' \nThe President of the United States goes for fundraising and golfing and \nnow is fiddling while Iraq burns. We need to act, but we also need to \nunderstand why we are where we are today.\n  The Senator from South Carolina and I visited Iraq on many \noccasions--more than I can count. We know for a fact that if we would \nhave left a residual force behind, this situation would not be where it \nis today.\n  The fact is that the President of the United States, if he wanted to \nleave a residual force, never made that clear to the American people. \nIn fact, on October 22, 2012, the President said: ``What I would not \nhave had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down.'' \nIn 2011 he celebrated the departure--as he described it--of the last \ncombat soldier from Iraq.\n  The fact is that because of our fecklessness and the fact that we did \nnot leave that residual force behind, we are paying the price, and the \npeople of Iraq are paying a heavier price.\n  What do we need to do? First of all, we have to understand there are \nno good options remaining. This is a culmination of failure after \nfailure of this administration. But for us to do nothing now will \nensure this base for terrorism. We have tracked over 100 who have \nalready come back to the United States of America. There are hundreds \nwho are leaving--not only the battlefield in Syria and Iraq--and they \nwill pose a direct threat to the security of the United States.\n  I say to the critics who say ``Do nothing and let them fight it \nout,'' you cannot confine this conflict to Iraq and\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\nSyria. The Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of \nHomeland Security have said these people will be planning attacks on \nthe United States of America.\n  What do we need to do? Of course, Maliki has to be transitioned out, \nbut the only way that is going to happen is for us to assure Iraqis \nthat we will be there to assist. Let me make it clear that no one I \nknow wants to send combat troops on the ground. But airstrikes are an \nimportant factor psychologically and in many other ways, and that may \nrequire some forward air controllers and some special forces.\n  We cannot afford to allow a Syria-Iraq enclave that will pose a \ndirect threat to the United States of America. And if we act, we are \ngoing to have to act in Syria as well. A residual force of U.S. troops \nin Iraq could have checked Iranian influence in Iraq.\n  The other question is, What are the Iranians doing while we are not \nmaking any decisions? Well, probably the most evil man on Earth, the \nhead of the Quds Force--an Iraqi terrorist organization--has been \nreported to have been in Baghdad. There are reports of Iranian forces \nmoving into Baghdad.\n  I say to my colleagues that we must meet this threat. The President \nof the United States must make some decisions. I am convinced that the \nnational security of the United States of America is at risk, and the \nsooner all of us realize it, the better off we will be.\n  I yield to my colleague from South Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, contrary to what may be popular belief, \nthere are plenty of Democrats in this body who are very much worried \nabout Iraq. The question is, What do we do about it? I will be the \nfirst to admit it is complicated.\n  The first thing we have to assess as a nation is, does it really \nmatter what happens in Iraq? Clearly, I think it does. Economically, if \nIraq becomes a failed state, the oil production in the south will fall \ninto the hands of the Iranians, and Iraq will become a failed state \nthat spreads economic chaos throughout the region. We will feel it at \nthe gas pump, and we will eventually feel it in our wallets. An \neconomic collapse in Iraq would affect our economy. I think it would \nthrow the world oil market into turmoil. So it matters economically.\n\n  Militarily, does it matter? It does in this regard: ISIS is an \noffshoot of Al Qaeda because Al Qaeda kicked them out. These people now \nare going to have a safe haven from Aleppo, Syria, to the gates of \nBaghdad. They have sworn to attack us. Part of their agenda is to \nstrike our homeland. Their goal is to create an Islamic state--a \ncaliphate--that would put the people under their rule into darkness. I \ndon't want to hear any more war-on-women stories unless we address Iraq \nand Syria. Do we want to see a war on women? I will show my colleagues \none. Can we imagine what little girls are thinking today in the Sunni \npart of Iraq and in Syria? Can we imagine the hell on Earth? The people \nwho will do that to their own--what would they do to us?\n  I don't mean to be an alarmist, but I am alarmed. I am just telling \nmy colleagues what they are saying they will do. Our Director of \nNational Intelligence has said that the safe haven for ISIS in Syria, \nand now in Iraq, presents a great threat to our homeland. The mistake \nPresident Obama is making is not to realize we need lines of defense.\n  Why did we want to leave a residual force behind in Iraq? Ten \nthousand to 15,000 would have given the Iraqi military the capacity \nthey don't possess today, the confidence they don't possess today. It \nwould have given us an edge against ISIS we don't have. A Toyota truck \ndoesn't do very well against American air power. But when we have no \nAmerican air power and when the intelligence capability of the American \nmilitary leaves, the Iraqi Army goes dark. We have seen a collapse of \nthe Iraqi Army that I think could have been prevented.\n  We can't kill all the terrorists to keep us safe. Our goal in this \ntrying time is to have lines of defense, to keep the war over there so \nit doesn't come over here. It is in our national security interests to \npartner with people in Iraq. There were many who wanted a different \nlife than ISIS would have. There are many Shias who want to be Iraqi \nShias, not Iranian Shias. I have been there enough to know.\n  So this fateful decision to look for ways to get out totally has come \nback to haunt us, and we are on the verge of doing the same thing in \nAfghanistan. I promised my colleagues the Taliban would be dancing in \nthe streets--they just do not believe in dancing--when they heard we \nwere leaving in 2016. Can we imagine how the Afghan people feel who \nhave fought these thugs by our side believing we would not abandon them \nand now to hear we are going to pull all of our troops out but for a \ncouple of hundred. Can we imagine how a young woman in Afghanistan \nfeels. Can we imagine how people in Pakistan feel--a nuclear-armed \nnation that could be in the crosshairs of the people trying to take \nAfghanistan down.\n  But it is not just about the people in Afghanistan. What about us? \nPresident Obama is going back to a pre-9/11 mentality. On September 10, \n2001, we had not one soldier in Afghanistan, not one dollar of aid, not \neven an ambassador. So those in America who think if we leave these \nguys alone they will leave us alone, you are not listening to what they \nare saying. The only reason 3,000 Americans died on September 11 and \nnot 3 million is they can't get the weapons to kill 3 million of us. If \nthey could, they would, and they are very close.\n  So, Mr. President: Recalculate your decision on Afghanistan. If you \npull all of our troops out, the Taliban will regroup, the Afghan \nNational Army will meet a terrible fate, and the people who wish us \nharm will be coming back our way. The region between Afghanistan and \nPakistan is a target-rich environment for the world's most radical \nterrorists, radical Islamists. So at the end of the day, Mr. President: \nYour job is to protect us. You are destroying the lines of defense that \nexist. The Afghan people are willing to have us stay there in enough \nnumbers to protect them and us. Mr. President: Before it is too late, \nchange your policies in Afghanistan. Mr. President: Do not take this \ncountry back to a pre-9/11 mentality where we treat terrorists as \ncommon criminals when we read them their rights rather than gathering \nintelligence.\n  We are letting our defenses erode all over the world. The enemies are \nemboldened and our friends are afraid. I can tell my colleagues this. \nIf we continue on this track, it will come here again.\n  With that, I yield the floor for Senator Chambliss.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ndiscussing the current direction of U.S. foreign policy, especially as \nit relates to the Middle East. The Obama administration's foreign \npolicy in this regard has unfortunately totally unraveled. The \nPresident, to his credit, made the Middle East his priority and engaged \nthe Arab world early on in his presidency. He attempted to forge a new \nbeginning between the United States and the Muslim world, but his \nidealistic strategy simply has not worked.\n  The Middle East over the last 3 years has been besieged by a \nresurgence of violence, instability, and terrorism. The administration \nhas chosen to confront this challenge, which has major implications for \nU.S. national security, by leading from behind and by relying on an \nineffective diplomatic strategy that involves few concrete security \nmeasures.\n  The shortcomings of this diplomatic strategy are painfully evident \ntoday in both Syria and in Iraq. In September of last year the \nadministration praised the U.S.-Russian deal to disarm Syria of its \nchemical weapons. The deal was designed to rid Syria of chemical \nweapons and buy time for a diplomatic solution. Yet here we are today, \nin a situation where the Syrians have missed countless deadlines, still \nhave chemical weapons, and continue to use barrel bombs filled with \nchlorine and other chemicals, as well as ball bearings, with impunity. \nIn addition to the humanitarian disaster that has unfolded in Syria, \nallowing the status quo to\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\ncontinue has also given the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, \nand the al-Nusra Front the safe haven they needed to grow into the \nforce we face today. Make no mistake about it. Terrorists are training \ninside of Syria today, planning to attack America and American \ninterests.\n  I have been shocked to hear news commentators and some in this body \nrefer to recent events in the Middle East, including the rise of ISIL \nin Iraq, as intelligence failures. The intelligence community makes its \nfair share of mistakes and I am the first to criticize them when they \ndo. But these recent events, including the resurgence of ISIL, are not \nintelligence failures; they are policy and leadership failures. As we \nsaw in Benghazi, the intelligence community provided ample strategic \nwarning of the deteriorating security situation in Libya. Yet the \nadministration did little to enhance security in Benghazi. Failing to \nprotect the diplomatic facility, despite repeated warnings, is not an \nintelligence failure, it is a policy and a leadership failure on the \npart of the administration.\n  With regard to Iraq, intelligence, including Director Clapper's \ntestimony at a January 29, 2014, hearing, has been abundantly clear \nthat Iraq was vulnerable to the threat from ISIL. I encourage any \nMember to read the intelligence if they have questions regarding the \nintelligence community's assessment about security in Iraq and the rise \nof ISIL before the fall of Mosul. It was clear in 2011, as U.S. forces \nwere withdrawing, that Iraq was vulnerable to a resurgence in extremist \nactivity, and we have seen the violence escalate steadily in the last 3 \nyears during this administration's failed policies. This collapse in \nsecurity was again easily predicted, but we have stood by and watched \nas it has occurred. Again, this is a policy failure, not an \nintelligence failure.\n\n  Perhaps the most concerning aspect of this administration's foreign \npolicy is its inadequate counterterrorism strategy. I often hear \nadministration officials touting Al Qaeda's demise or describing the \norganization as on the run. Yet nothing could be further from the \ntruth. As my friend from South Carolina alluded to earlier, before we \nbegan on the floor this morning, he said: Yes, Al Qaeda is on the run. \nThey are running from one country to the next and taking over one \ncountry and the next.\n  Violent extremism is on the rise in the Middle East, and the warning \nsigns have been visible for years. These warning signs include the \nSeptember 11, 2012, attack in Benghazi, the rising of Al Qaeda-\naffiliated extremist groups such as the al-Nusra Front in Syria, the \nresurgence of ISIL, and most recently the fall of Mosul. Just yesterday \nwe saw a terrorist flag raised over the largest refinery inside of \nIraq. Despite these stark warning signs, the administration has only \nbeen willing to take very limited steps to curb this disturbing trend. \nInstead of focusing on making counterterrorism operations more \neffective, the administration has been focused on ending the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan while America's enemies grow stronger. This \napproach has been a huge gamble that continues to jeopardize America's \nsecurity.\n  The administration has sidelined many of the tools we used to \nsuccessfully counter Al Qaeda in the years immediately after 9/11, \nincluding the effective, long-term detention and interrogation of enemy \ncombatants. As a result, we know far less today about many of these \nterrorist organizations. Since the President ordered the closure of the \ndetention facility at Guantanamo Bay in January of 2009, our Nation has \nbeen without a clear policy for detaining suspected terrorists. Without \nsuch a policy, including one that identifies a facility for holding \nterrorists that are captured outside of Afghanistan, the intelligence \ncommunity's ability to conduct ongoing intelligence operations have \nbeen severely limited. I recognize there is no one-size-fits-all \nsolution for handling terrorists, but our detention policies must \nfoster full intelligence collection before any prosecution begins.\n  Al Qaeda and its affiliates and other terrorist groups are determined \nto attack the United States. We constantly face new plots and \noperatives looking for ways to murder Americans, such as the foiled May \n2012 AQAP plot to put another IED on a United States-bound aircraft. \nThankfully, this plot and others didn't materialize, but we are not \ngoing to always be that fortunate.\n  We know that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula--or AQAP--today \nrepresents one of the biggest threats to the U.S. homeland and \npersonnel serving overseas. They are continually plotting against our \ninterests and seeking new recruits, especially among our own citizens \nas well as former Guantanamo detainees. Explosive experts such as \nIbrahim al-Asiri continue to roam free, posing a tremendous threat to \nthe safety and security of U.S. citizens.\n  The proposed closure of Guantanamo Bay presents significant risks for \nthe United States and Yemeni efforts to counter AQAP inside Yemen. A \nsubstantial portion of the detainees remaining at Guantanamo Bay are \nYemeni citizens. Transferring these individuals to a country plagued by \nprison breaks, assassinations, and open warfare at this point could \nprove very catastrophic. These detainees would likely join several \nother former Gitmo detainees who have returned to the fight in Yemen, \nfurther destabilizing the country and worsening an already tenuous \nsecurity situation.\n  The most recent example of a totally failed and dangerous policy on \nthe part of this administration is the exchange of five Guantanamo \ndetainees for Sergeant Bergdahl. We are all glad Sergeant Bergdahl is \nback. We should have done everything we could to get him back, and \nthank goodness he is now with his family. But the deal--the exchange of \nfive individuals from Guantanamo Bay who now wake up every morning \nthinking of ways to kill and harm Americans--was not the right thing to \ndo. There were other ways to handle it. Yet this administration, almost \ncallously, without notifying Congress--by the way, that was clearly \nintentional. The failure to notify Congress of what they planned to do \nwhen they signed a memorandum on May 12 and didn't release these \nindividuals for another 2\\1/2\\ weeks gives us a pretty clear indication \nthat this administration did not want to come to Congress and say we \nare going to exchange these five Guantanamo prisoners. The reason they \ndid not is because they knew there would be objections from both sides \nof the aisle to doing such a dangerous thing and setting such a \nterrible precedent.\n\n  So whether it is in Iraq, Afghanistan or in other parts of the Middle \nEast, Americans have fought and died in the war against Al Qaeda. Our \nNation is weary of war, but threatening elements still remain. And \nthose five individuals who I just alluded to are clearly threats to the \nUnited States.\n  I have asked the President to declassify the personnel files on those \nfive individuals: Tell the American people what we know about them, Mr. \nPresident, and then look the American people in the eye and say: This \nwas a good deal. I know they are going to return to the fight, and they \nare going to seek to kill and harm Americans, but this was a good deal.\n  Well, that is for the American people to decide ultimately.\n  I urge President Obama and my congressional colleagues, as well as \nthe American people, not to abandon the gains we have made in the fight \nagainst terrorism since 9/11, but let's remain steady and let's \ncontinue to fight the good fight.\n  With that, I yield for my friend from North Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today to discuss the \nadministration's misguided foreign policy, especially as it relates to \nAfghanistan and the threat of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Haqqani \nNetwork. Despite what the administration would have you believe, Al \nQaeda, the Taliban, and the Haqqani Network remain capable and \ncommitted adversaries in Afghanistan. They are a clear strategic threat \nto the safety, the security, and the stability of the region and \ncontinue to commit to acts of violence against U.S. troops and plot \nagainst U.S. interests in the region and here at home.\n  Yet, for some reason, this administration has time and again failed \nto\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\nrecognize this simple fact, or worse, they have chosen to ignore it. Al \nQaeda is not decimated--regardless of what Ambassador Rice may have \ncommunicated to the American people. Its senior leadership continues to \nplot devastating attacks and, more troubling, serve as an inspiration \nto a series of affiliates in Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, and elsewhere. These \naffiliates are plotting against the United States of America here at \nhome, with the guidance, advice, and financial support of Al Qaeda's \nsenior most leadership.\n  The Al Qaeda brand is alive and well, and the Obama administration's \nAfPak strategy to end the conflict, not win it, reveals a profound \nfailure to analyze threats to the region, the world, and the United \nStates of America.\n  Despite what this administration would have you believe, leaving \nAfghanistan before our work is done will not--will not--end the \nfighting. We cannot take the pressure off or our enemies will bring the \nfight to our doorstep here at home.\n  But Al Qaeda is not alone in Afghanistan. It is well established that \nthe Haqqani Network, one of our deadliest adversaries, is the link \nbetween the Taliban and Al Qaeda--a direct link.\n  The Haqqani Network is directly responsible for a significant number \nof U.S. casualties and injuries on the battlefield in Afghanistan and \ncontinues to actively plan potentially catastrophic attacks against our \ninterests and the interests of others in the region.\n  The group routinely targets civilians--civilians--and uses murder as \nan intimidation tactic against the Afghan people. They have mounted \nnumerous assaults and suicide attacks on civilians and U.S. forces with \ndeadly effectiveness. Yet the administration took until late 2012--at \nthe urging of the Senate of the United States in a bill that I \nintroduced--to actually name the Haqqani Network as a foreign terrorist \norganization.\n  Why was that important? Because that act changes the game. It \nprovides us the full range of diplomatic and military tools to use \ndirectly against the Haqqani Network. It is against that backdrop that \nthe administration then negotiated with the Haqqani Network the release \nof five high-level Taliban fighters for SGT Bowe Bergdahl's return. In \nother words, the President rewarded the Haqqani Network for its \nincarceration of a U.S. servicemember, strengthened its relationship \nwith the Taliban, emboldened the Taliban, and undermined the Afghan \nGovernment--all with one decision.\n  Does anyone in this administration believe that five high-ranking \nTaliban officials, when set free, would not return to the fight? If \nthey do, then they have not paid attention for the last decade or \nlonger.\n  I understand that this Nation is weary of war. I understand the \nsacrifices made by our servicemembers, and I work every day to ensure \nthat our brave veterans are provided the care and treatment they \ndeserve. Their efforts should not be in vain.\n  As we are here today, Marine Cpl Kyle Carpenter will receive the \nMedal of Honor. He was a 19-year-old when he signed up to go in the \nMarine Corps. The young marine, in combat--to save a fellow marine--\njumped on a grenade. Kyle Carpenter lived--not only lived--after 40 \nsurgeries, today he just completed his freshman year at the University \nof South Carolina, at 24 years old.\n  He is an American hero. He could be any one of our children or \ngrandchildren. What makes this country great is that we have people \nsuch as Kyle Carpenter who step up, when asked, and they do more than \nwe could ever ask of them.\n  Our servicemembers served and sacrificed overseas so that we could be \nsafe at home. We cannot in good faith let the administration dishonor \ntheir efforts with a misguided policy.\n  The continued drawdown of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan \nwill provide Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Haqqani Network with a safe \nhaven to train operatives and plot further attacks against the United \nStates of America and our allies.\n  Contrary to the campaign statements of the President and Vice \nPresident, Al Qaeda is not ``on the run,'' and I urge this \nadministration to avoid further actions that may endanger our Nation.\n  I yield the floor for Senator Inhofe.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak until the arrival of the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the subject today, of course, is the \nfailed foreign policy of this President and this administration. It is \nreally hard to do it in a limited period of time because once something \nhappens like Benghazi, and we get into the middle of that thing, then \nall of a sudden you turn around and this President turns loose arguably \nthe five most heinous terrorists from Gitmo. At the same time, we have \na policy that was going so well in Iraq, and now we find out that is \nnot working out either. If I have time, I will touch on that.\n  But the first thing I want to do is just mention this Benghazi thing. \nBeing the ranking member on the Armed Services Committee, I had the \nopportunity to really be in there and see as it was happening. It \nhappens that Chris Stevens--the Ambassador who was sent over there and \nwho was killed, one of the four who was killed in Benghazi--was a \nfriend of mine. He was in my office. We spent time together. We talked \nabout the threats that were out there. Then, as we got closer to this \ntime, he realized and started sending messages to the President, to the \nWhite House, to us, to send security over there. He said that right now \nthe terrorists are actually training in Benghazi. They actually had \ntheir flags flying. They knew they were organizing something, probably \nfor an anniversary of 9/11. So he knew that. He had requested it, and \nthe President elected not to send help at that time.\n\n  The question a lot of people have is--they will say: Inhofe, how do \nyou know the President knew that was an organized attack? Well, I can \ntell you how. In our system of government, we have four people who are \nresponsible for advising the President on threats, on intelligence. \nThey are the CIA Director--at that time it was John Brennan. The \nDirector of National Intelligence was James Clapper. The Secretary of \nDefense at that time was Leon Panetta. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff was General Dempsey.\n  Now, all of them acknowledged, when the annex was hit in Benghazi, \nthat it was an organized--that same day--an organized terrorist attack. \nThey all knew it. They expected it, but then they knew for a fact it \nwas.\n  So you are talking about the individuals who are responsible for \nadvising the President. All of them were well aware that on the day of \nthe annex attack in Benghazi that it was an organized terrorist attack. \nIt was several days later that they sent Susan Rice to all of these \nshows in order to try to make it sound like it was some video that \nsomebody had.\n  Now, why would the President not want to admit that this was an \norganized terrorist attack? It was right before the election and the \npolls showed a lot of the people thought--Osama bin Laden having been \ncaptured--there was no longer that big threat out there in the Middle \nEast and that would inure to his benefit. So it was for political \nreasons, and we ended up losing four lives.\n  Then, just recently, they are saying, oh, they have now found this \nAbu Khattala. This is someone who has been around for 2 years. The \npress has been talking to him for 2 years. Why, all of a sudden, are \nthey saying--now of all times--this is the guy who perpetrated \nBenghazi, when, in fact, this all came from the White House? I just \nthink it is just covering it up, and I am very much offended by that.\n  But the one thing I wanted to talk about--and I know some of the \nother Members are going to be here, and I will not abuse the time that \nhas been given to me--but it is having to do with the release of the \nfive Taliban terrorists on the American people. Let me tell you a side \nof this that people are not talking about that I feel strongly is the \nreason for it.\n  First of all, this President is in the last half of his second term--\nor approaching the last half of his second term. As is always the case, \nwhen you get down toward the end of your term, you start looking for a \nlegacy. What was his legacy?\n  One of his legacies is closing Gitmo. This President has been talking \nabout\n\n[[Page S3831]]\n\nclosing Gitmo for as long as I can remember, certainly longer than he \nhas been President.\n  Now, you wonder why. I go back and I tell people in Oklahoma--they \nsay: Why does he want to close Gitmo? You cannot answer that. We have \nhad Gitmo since 1903. It is one of the few good deals we have in \ngovernment. We only pay $4,000 a year for that, and half the time the \nCubans do not cash the check. So we have this thing. We had actually \n778 people there incarcerated and being interrogated prior to the time \nthat Barack Obama became the President of the United States. Now we are \ndown to 149.\n  But as far as Gitmo--that resource--no one argues with the fact that \nthe humane treatment is beyond anyone's expectation. There is no place \nelse in the world they can do that. They are fully compliant with the \nGeneva Convention. They have had people go in there and look at the \nmaximum security prison, and it is attested to. Human rights \norganizations, the Red Cross, and everyone else agrees that it is a \nvery humane place while they are interrogating. As I said, there is no \nplace else they can do this. Because if you start doing this in our \ncourt system, obviously, they get Miranda rights, constitutional \nrights, and people are pretty offended when they find out. That keeps \nus from getting information that would affect some of the others.\n  We have an expeditionary legal complex there. It is the only one like \nthis in the world, where they can actually do this.\n  So this is a place where we can actually get in there, interrogate, \nget information, incarcerate people, not intermingle the terrorists \nwith the prison population in this country, which is what the President \nhas been talking about doing.\n  Why do I say that? I say that because these guys are terrorists. They \nare not criminals. You put them in our prison system, and by definition \ntheir job is to train other people to become terrorists, and that is \nwhat they would be doing in training the prison population to become \nterrorists.\n  I have to say this too. All of the talk about Osama bin Laden and the \nfact that we do have him--and I am very glad we were able to bring him \ndown. But how did we do it? We did it through information that we \nreceived through interrogation at Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay.\n  So I only say that because people wonder, why in the world would he \nbe wanting to do this? And how does he want to fulfill this expectation \nor this legacy he has?\n  Let me tell you, tell you how I think. If he would take, out of the \n149 individuals who are left there, the 5 most heinous terrorists, most \ndangerous Taliban terrorists, and turn them loose, that would put him \nin a position, then, to get rid of the rest of them, with the exception \nof those who are awaiting war crimes trials.\n  So what happened? He turned them loose, No. 1. No. 2, he told the \nTaliban exactly when the United States is going to leave, regardless of \nthe conditions on the ground. And then, thirdly, he has said that he is \ngoing to declare an ``end of hostilities.''\n  That is a proper phrase, ``end of hostilities.'' This is not a war, \nit is a hostility. If he does that, that would then give him the \njustification for opening the gates, turning everyone loose from Gitmo \nand closing Gitmo. That, in my opinion, is the estimation.\n  What are the threats we are facing as a result of that? We are in a \nposition right now where we have five people who are turned loose. Even \nif we trusted Qatar to hold these five guys for a period of 1 year, \nstill the philosophy there would be: All right, we will turn you loose \nif you few promise not to kill Americans for 1 year. That does not make \nsense.\n  So this is something that should not have happened. We now have the \npeople there making decisions, and they are celebrating as we speak. \nOne of the five individual's name is named Fazl. I will end with this: \nThere is a guy named Mullah Salem Khan. He is a Taliban commander over \nin Afghanistan. Listen to this. He is talking about Fazl, one of the \nfive guys. He said:\n\n       His return is like putting 10,000 Taliban fighters into the \n     battle on the side of jihad. Now the Taliban have the right \n     lion to lead them in the final moment before victory in \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  That is what happened with these guys. That is how it is viewed over \nthere. It is an atrocity that it did happen.\n  I yield the floor for Senator Cornyn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time remains in the allocation of \nthis side's time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republicans have 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I know we perhaps have another Member coming to speak. \nWould the Chair please advise me after I have used 5 minutes of that 8 \nminutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do that.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the intersection of \nnational security and our mounting debt. Over the last 5 years, \nPresident Obama has had multiple occasions to embrace real structural \nentitlement reform that would help solve our long-term debt problem. \nOne might wonder why am I talking about debt when the subject we are \ngenerally talking about is national security, including what is \nhappening in Iraq and Syria.\n  It is because as the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nsaid, ADM Mike Mullen, when asked what the single biggest threat to our \nnational security was, he said: It is our debt. The President had an \nopportunity, when the Simpson-Bowles Commission released its \nrecommendations in late 2010. As you will recall, this is a bipartisan \ncommission the President himself appointed to help come up with a \nformula to deal with our fiscal problems.\n  Unfortunately, once they made their recommendations in December of \n2010, the President walked away from them and nothing came of it, even \nthough we are facing, in addition to $17 trillion in debt, more than \n$100 trillion in unfunded liabilities. Perhaps it is because those \nnumbers are so big that we have a hard time getting our head around it, \nthat people have become desensitized to the urgency of dealing with our \ndebt and these unfunded liabilities.\n  But the President has never once endorsed any sort of reform \nnecessary to deal with this challenge or to prevent a future crisis. \nThe fact is, somebody someday--probably these young men and women who \nare working as pages and others their age, is going to have to be the \nones to pay this back because our generation will have failed them \nunless we meet the challenges this presents.\n  It seems as though the only part of the Federal budget the President \nis eager to cut is national defense. Under his latest budget plan, \ndefense spending would drop from 3.4 percent to 2.3 percent of GDP by \n2023. At the same time, we are told the U.S. Army might be shrunk to \nthe smallest size since pre-World War II.\n  President Obama needs to realize that even America's current military \ncapabilities are proving inadequate to meet global challenges. For \nexample, one former Assistant Secretary of Defense has declared that \nbecause of Pentagon budget cuts, President Obama's highly touted pivot \nto Asia cannot happen. In other words, despite promoting the Asia pivot \nas a crucial element of American foreign policy, the President has \nfailed to take the necessary fiscal steps to make sure that happens or \ncould happen.\n  This of course makes it a hollow policy, one where the promises are \nextravagant, but the delivery is anemic, and one that will do major \ndamage to U.S. credibility among our allies and adversaries. The \nprospect of bringing DOD spending back down to sequestration levels has \nalarmed our senior military officials in all branches of government. \nChief of Naval Operations ADM Jonathan Greenert has said that reverting \nto sequester levels in 2016 ``would lead to a Navy that is too small \nand lacking the advanced capabilities needed to execute the missions \nthat nation expects of its Navy.''\n  The Secretary of the Air Force has said that going back to those \nspending levels ``would compromise our national security.'' Ray \nOdierno, Chief of Staff of the Army, said it would put ``our young men \nand women [in uniform] at much higher risk.'' In other words, the \nPresident cannot simply keep cutting defense spending and the military \nin order to fund his other priorities and at\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\nthe same time ignore the 70 percent of spending that is on autopilot, \nso-called entitlement spending. That is where the big money is. That is \nwhere the reforms need to take place, but it will not happen without a \nleader.\n  We all know what is happening in Iraq. I know time is short. I do not \nwant to take away any more time than necessary from my colleague from \nAlabama, but this map reflects what is happening now in Iraq. The civil \nwar in Syria, the President had drawn a red line which once crossed--\nthere were no consequences associated with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Now this border between Iran and Syria has basically been \nwiped away. We see all of these places where the ISIS, a horrific \nterrorist group that is even worse than Al Qaeda, has basically taken \ncharge. So this is what happens with a failure of leadership. \nUnfortunately, this is where we are in so many places around the world.\n  In short: President Obama simply cannot keep asking America's \nmilitary to shoulder such a disproportionate share of the spending cuts \nwhile our biggest entitlement programs remain virtually untouched. DoD \nspending did not cause our long-term budget problem, so slashing it to \nthe bone would not solve that problem. Moreover, seemingly every week \nbrings fresh reminders of the challenges our country will face in the \nyears to come. At this very moment, we have Russia's ongoing aggression \nagainst democratic Ukraine. We have an Iranian theocracy that shows no \nsigns of abandoning its quest for a nuclear weapon. We have a \npersistent terrorist challenge in Afghanistan. We have a potential \nfailed state in Libya. We have growing Al Qaeda activity in many parts \nof Africa. We have a Chinese dictatorship that is increasing its annual \nmilitary budget by more than 12 percent while continuing to bully its \nneighbors on the high seas.\n  Most notably, we have a burgeoning terror state in the heart of the \nMiddle East, where a ruthless band of jihadist killers--a group that is \neven more radical and murderous than Al Qaeda, if you can believe it--\nnow controls a massive piece of territory spanning both Syria and Iraq. \nCalling their movement the ``Islamic State of Iraq and Syria,'' or \nISIS, members of this organization have taken over major Iraqi cities, \nincluding Fallujah, Mosul, Tikrit, and Tal Afar, leaving a trail of \nblood and medieval terror in their wake.\n  The map to my left shows just how much territory ISIS has conquered. \nTo make matters worse, they have seized a tremendous amount of weaponry \nand money--almost half a billion dollars--making them perhaps the most \nwell-resourced terrorist group on earth.\n  And again, just to reiterate: This group is considered more radical, \nand more vicious, than even Al Qaeda.\n  Amazingly, even after ISIS took control of Mosul, Iraq's second-\nlargest city, a National Security Council spokeswoman stuck to the \nWhite House's 3-year-old talking points and said, ``President Obama \npromised to responsibly end the war in Iraq and he did.''\n  Of course, the President did no such thing. By the time he assumed \noffice in January 2009, Iraq had largely been stabilized. All the \nPresident had to do was convince the Iraqi government to sign a new \nStatus of Forces Agreement, SOFA. Unfortunately, he was more interested \nin keeping a misguided campaign promise from 2008.\n  As a result of his failure to maintain a significant U.S. troop \npresence in Iraq, America emboldened the Iranians, the Shiite militias, \nand the Sunni terrorist groups to become more aggressive. We also \nemboldened Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to behave in a more \nsectarian and dictatorial manner.\n  Meanwhile, amid the fallout from America's Iraq withdrawal, President \nObama's failure to take early, decisive action in Syria made it much \neasier for Sunni terrorists to increase their territory, weapons, and \nmanpower. As you can see from this map, the jihadists have effectively \nbeen using their bases in Syria as a launching pad for attacks in \nwestern Iraq.\n  The path forward in Iraq is highly uncertain, but I would urge \nPresident Obama to explain to the American people what is at stake, and \nto formulate a robust strategy for defending U.S. interests and \npreventing the creation of a new terror state. The President may well \nbelieve--as a recent New York Times article suggested--that ``he is \nmanaging an era of American retrenchment.'' But with bloodthirsty \njihadists marauding through Iraq and approaching the gates of Baghdad, \nnow is not a time for U.S. retrenchment. Instead, now is a time for \nclear thinking, clear decisions, and clear action.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, when a nation commits itself to a \nmilitary effort, it is a very significant, august decision. I was here \nwhen we voted to utilize military force in Iraq and Afghanistan. A \nmajority of the Democrats in this body supported that. The American \npeople supported that.\n  Through tough times, success was achieved in the sense that Iraq had \nelections, they had a functioning government, the U.S. military was \ndrawing down its personnel, the country had a reconciliation with the \nSunni and the Shia and the Kurds, and we were on a path that gave us \nsome prospect, I believe it is fair to say--critics can have different \nopinions--but it is pretty clear to me we had prospects for a \nsuccessful conclusion of that effort which would allow a relatively \nstable, relatively democratic nation to be established that did not \nthreaten its neighbors or the United States.\n  So we should have not done that. Well, we did that. That is what has \nhappened. That was the situation when President Obama took office. He \nfailed, in my opinion, in negotiating the kind of drawdown in the \nstatus of forces agreement that needed to be established to be able to \ncreate credibility in this new and fragile regime and help hold their \nmilitary together, keep them trained, while we reduced dramatically our \npresence and military activities. We would be there as support, \nsupplying equipment, intelligence, aircraft lift capability. That would \nhave given them confidence.\n  It was very clear when we just said: We cannot reach an agreement. We \nare pulling everybody out. We had General Bednarek talk to us recently. \nHe told us he has 100 solders. I asked him if he was the current \nGeneral Petraeus.\n  He said, yes, with a bit of a smile, but he only has 100 people. So I \nguess I would say we are worried about it. One of the things that is so \ncritical in our conduct and understanding of what we are involved in is \nto understand that the terrorist threat is going to be there for a long \ntime. We are going to be dealing with this for a long time. There is a \nsignificant number, not a majority by any means but a significant \nnumber, of radicalized people in the Middle East who want to destroy \nthe United States. They see us as an evil force. They support what we \noppose. They want to take over their neighbors and continue to expand. \nThey want to knock down reasonably functioning regimes that provide at \nleast some freedom and order in their societies. They want to impose a \ncaliphate. They want to impose on those countries a theocratic \ngovernment and legal system.\n  It is not good for the United States and it is not good for the \nworld. One of the things we have to do and have to understand is that \nwhen we capture a person committed to the destruction of the United \nStates, and who is attacking our people, they are not criminals. They \nare warriors. Most of their activities are clearly contrary to the law \nof war. So they are unlawful enemy combatants.\n  When we capture a soldier in battle, whether lawful or unlawful, if \nthey have complied with the rules of war, unlike this group, we do not \ntry them, per se. We hold them until the war is over, until a peace \ntreaty has been signed, until an agreement has been reached. That is \nnot happening now. As a result, we have a confused policy that results \nin the release of dangerous enemy combatants, such as the five Taliban \nleaders we just released under this confused thinking.\n  It fundamentally arose when the left--determined to attack President \nBush--attacked the secure terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo \nBay. They argued that it became some symbol of the policies we are \nusing to detain people who are captured enemy\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\ncombatants, lawful or unlawful. When we capture them, we hold them. We \ndo not release them so they can go back to the war and kill us. We are \ngoing to send soldiers out to capture them, and then once they have \nbeen captured, we are going to release them so they continue into the \nwar? It goes against all common sense. As Justice Jackson once said: \nThe Constitution is not a ``suicide pact.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So they have to be treated properly and that sort of \nthing, but they do not have to be released. We captured, for example, \nNazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai last year for conspiring with bin Ladin to \nattack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia and for his part \nin the 1998 bombings of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa that killed \n224 people before 9/11. He is a treasure trove of intelligence.\n  U.S. forces went in and captured him, took him away at risk of their \nlives. He had been undergoing interrogation on the USS San Antonio \nuntil he said he was sick and not doing well. So what happened? They \ntook him to New York, where he was formally arrested and taken into the \ncustody of the U.S. Justice Department, and put into the civilian \njustice system. The purpose of capturing him was to get intelligence. \nThis is a warrior. We want to talk to him. We want to see what we can \nlearn about him. Even the New York Times said ``his capture was seen as \na potential intelligence coup because he had been on the run for years \nand so would, presumably, possess information about al Qaeda.'' \nHowever, when he appeared in Federal court, he was appointed a lawyer, \nguaranteed a speedy, public trial--the things that prisoners of war are \nnot entitled to--yet this has been happening over and over again. Al-\nRuqai's cooperation ended, leading to a major lost opportunity to \nobtain valuable intelligence.\n  This evidences a serious lack of understanding of the nature of the \nconflict we are engaged in. It evidences a policy that is dangerous to \nour safety. It is wrong to send Americans to capture people such as \nthis and then treat them in a way that allows them to minimize the \nopportunity to obtain intelligence.\n  Indeed, the gravest danger with bringing enemy combatants to U.S. \nsoil is that the President cannot absolutely prevent their release into \nthe United States. And, once foreign nationals are here, there are \nlegal limits on the government's ability to remove them from the U.S. \nThe reality is, once here, their fate is no longer simply up to the \nadministration but also a federal judge.\n  There are many examples of foreign nationals who have committed \nmurder and other serious crimes and were released into the U.S. when \nour government could not transfer them to another country.\n  This risk extends to the detainees at Guantanamo Bay. We saw that in \nthe case of Kiyemba v. Obama. There, the D.C. District Court ordered \nthe release into the United States of a group of ethnic Chinese \nUighers who were detained at Guantanamo, many of whom had received \nmilitary-style training in Tora Bora. Fortunately, the D.C. Circuit \nreversed the decision based on the fact that the Gitmo detainees had \nnot been brought to the United States. If, however, Gitmo detainees are \nbrought here, a judge may very well order them released into the United \nStates if they cannot be removed to another country. That very real \nrisk obviously does not exist if Gitmo detainees are not brought to the \nUnited States in the first place.\n\n  The course this administration has chosen on national security \nmatters has steered us into a head-on collision with reality. The \nAmerican people unequivocally oppose transplanting terrorists from \nGitmo into their own communities, either for detention or trial. Our \nprimary goal is to prevent future terrorist attacks, especially through \nobtaining intelligence. We should not jeopardize that goal in order to \nafford foreign terrorists who seek to harm the United States and its \ncitizens the rights and privileges granted to ordinary criminals. The \nadministration's policy has put this country at grave risk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3833-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3833-S3834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         LORI JACKSON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, photographs on this poster are of a \nyoung woman, Lori Jackson, a Connecticut resident, who died tragically, \nneedlessly, savagely in Oxford at the hands of her estranged husband.\n  Lori is the reason I have introduced legislation named after her to \nclose a gaping loophole in our Federal law--well, she is not the only \nreason. Tragically, there are thousands of other women and some men who \nhave shared her fate because of a gap in Federal law that permits \nintimate partners to continue to have firearms, even when they are \nunder restraining orders from the court. Those restraining orders are \nplaced against them because they evidence clear danger to their \npartners, whether their husband or their spouse.\n  The reason they pose danger is that they become violent. The gap in \nthe law is it applies only to permanent restraining orders, not \ntemporary ones.\n  Lori Jackson sought a temporary restraining order when her estranged \nhusband threatened her physically and her two 18-month-old twins at \ntheir home. She sought and she obtained a temporary restraining order \nand literally the day before that temporary restraining order was to \nbecome permanent and the prohibition against her husband having a \nfirearm would have gone into effect, he gunned her down at her parents' \nhome where she had sought refuge with her children--gunned her down and \nsavagely and severely wounded her mother as well with those same \nfirearms.\n  The temporary restraining order against Lori's husband was completely \nineffective, powerless to prevent him from using that gun against her \nand killing her--and her mother, severely wounding her.\n  Tragically, Lori's story is far from unique. Jasmine Leonard also had \na temporary restraining order against her husband. She died last week \nafter her husband shot her.\n  Chyna Joy Young celebrated her 18th birthday just days before she was \nshot and killed by her estranged boyfriend, despite the temporary \nrestraining order she had against him. Young was 3 months pregnant.\n  Barbara Diane Dye was granted a temporary restraining order and then \nfled to Texas. She returned only for a hearing on the permanent \nrestraining order, and that is when her husband cornered her in a bank \nparking lot and shot her repeatedly with a .357 magnum revolver, \nkilling her there.\n  When domestic abusers have access to firearms, it isn't only abuse \nvictims who are at risk. A violent husband under a temporary \nrestraining order in Brookfield, WI, followed his wife to the salon \nwhere she worked. Not only did he shoot and kill his wife but he killed \ntwo additional people and wounded four more.\n  After Erica Bell got a temporary restraining order against her \nhusband, he came to her at church. He followed her there. He shot and \nkilled Erica and he also shot four of her relatives, including her \ngrandparents, great-aunt, and a cousin.\n  This scourge of domestic violence, combined with the epidemic of guns \nin our society causing gun violence, is a toxic recipe, and we must do \nmore against domestic abuse. That is why I have formed an organization \nin Connecticut called Men Make a Difference, Men Against Domestic \nViolence. It is a program launched in cooperation with our largest \ndomestic prevention and response agency, Interval House, which does a \nwonderful job against domestic violence. It is a commitment of \nprominent men, all men, providing role models for young men and boys to \nreach out to other males and take action to prevent domestic violence. \nWe can truly make a difference as men. We can fight domestic violence. \nWe can gradually make progress against it because it is a cycle.\n  More than 70 percent of all men who commit domestic violence have \nseen or experienced it in their own lives, and these kinds of \norganizations can help stop and stem domestic violence. But\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\ndomestic violence, combined with guns, is a recipe for death.\n  As our former colleague Frank Lautenberg used to say: ``The \ndifference between a murdered wife and a battered wife is often the \npresence of a gun.'' Women are five times more likely to die as a \nresult of domestic violence when there is a gun in the home than when \nthere is not.\n  So I have introduced the Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor \nProtection Act. It is a long name. The most important part of the name \nis Lori Jackson, because her story tells it all.\n  There is no reason we should fail to protect women when they are \nprotected by a temporary restraining order rather than a permanent \nrestraining order. In fact, there is every reason to provide more \nprotection in the first week or 2 weeks when there is a temporary \nrestraining order in place. Remember, the temporary restraining order \nis granted not on a whim or a question, because of specific, credible \nevidence that an intimate partner poses a physical danger, and it is \ngranted by a judge after considering that evidence.\n  The moment of danger in a relationship such as Lori Jackson's is when \none partner tells another--it may be a spouse, it may be a boyfriend, a \ngirlfriend--she is leaving, she wants a divorce. That is the moment of \nmaximum rage. That is the moment of greatest danger. That is the moment \nof uncontrollable wrath.\n  At that moment of greatest danger, the law is at its weakest. There \nis no prohibition against that enraged, impulsive, hurt, angry \nindividual from continuing to possess or purchase a firearm.\n  The Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act very \nsimply closes that gaping loophole in our law, providing that just as \nwith a permanent protective order, an individual subject to a temporary \nrestraining order cannot purchase or possess a firearm. It is a very \nsimple, commonsense measure, but it can help save lives. It can help \nsave others such as Lori Jackson and the individuals whom I have \nnamed--many of them courageous, strong individuals like Lori Jackson \nwho broke with an abusive relationship.\n  The experts in this field will tell us that is among the most \ndifficult things to do, and it puts a woman at her most vulnerable \npoint in the relationship. Again, that is the time when current law \nfails her. That is the reason we should close that loophole.\n  Other measures are also important and necessary.\n  I salute our colleague Senator Klobuchar for her proposal that will \nclose an equally important loophole in our law relating to people who \nare convicted of stalking. That is an eminently important and sensible \nstep to take. It will keep guns out of the hands of stalkers; likewise, \nRepresentative Moore's legislation to help States enforce our gun laws.\n  Similarly, the comprehensive measure of mental health initiatives, \nschool safety steps, background checks, is part of a comprehensive \neffort to stop gun violence in our country. They are all important and \nnecessary.\n  I thank my colleague and friend Senator Murphy of Connecticut for \nchampioning them as a teammate in this effort, and he has joined me \nin supporting this legislation.\n\n  I named this legislation after Lori Jackson as a memorial to her and \na gesture of sadness and outrage at her death.\n  Every man or woman who has lost his or her life through a domestic \nviolence gun homicide deserves to be memorialized on this floor, as \ndoes every victim of gun violence. With more than 1,000 names added as \nvictims every year, I believe we can honor them best by passing this \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in honoring Lori Jackson, \nJasmine Leonard, Chyna Joy Young, Barbara Diane Guy, and Zina Daniel, \nall of the women who have lost their lives to domestic abusers and \nwhose lives might have been saved. We can't know for sure. There is no \ncertainty they would be alive today, but we know their chances would \nhave been better if that temporary protective order had also protected \nthem from an abuser who possessed or bought a firearm at that moment of \nmaximum danger.\n  We continue to grieve in Connecticut for all victims of gun violence, \nespecially the 20 beautiful children and 6 great educators who lost \ntheir lives. This past Sunday I attended in West Haven the opening of a \n24th playground. Where Angels Play is the name of the playground \norganization headed by a firefighter, a very resolute, steadfast, \npublic servant, Bill Lavin. This playground, honoring one of those \nchildren, was on the beach in West Haven--a moment of haunting and \nexquisite beauty--when all of us gathered in honor of Charlotte Bacon \non a sun-filled day, Father's Day. Joel and JoAnn Bacon and their son \nGuy were with us.\n  Each of those playgrounds is a memorial to those children who died, \nand we have likewise honored the six great educators who perished.\n  There are ways to honor and remember and memorialize these victims. \nAlexis Volpe in Middletown did a small garden, and she was joined by \nthe Daisy Scouts there.\n  All of them are beautiful in their own special way, but action is the \nbest way to honor the memory of the victims of gun violence, action to \nadopt commonsense, sensible measures that will help prevent gun \nviolence in the future. None is more important than honoring, \nremembering, and acting to save others such as Lori Jackson, who will \nalways be with us in spirit and memory.\n  I thank my colleagues who have joined me in this effort, Senators \nDurbin, Murray, Boxer, Murphy, Hirono, Warren, and Menendez, sponsoring \nthe Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act.\n  I yield the floor for my good colleague and friend, the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3834-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3834-S3835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CELEBRATING WEST VIRGINIA'S 151ST BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Connecticut. \nI appreciate his unwavering commitment to continue to fight for justice \nand fairness for all, and he does it every day.\n  I am here to say happy birthday to West Virginia. Tomorrow, June 20, \nwe will be 151 years old, and I rise to honor my great State.\n  I have often said this: Some of us were lucky enough to be born and \nraised there--and I am one of the lucky ones--some people were smart \nenough to move there, and some people just wish they could get there. \nSo under any circumstance, we will take you.\n  This is a State that truly embodies a brave and daring declaration of \nstatehood that is unprecedented in American history.\n  Born out of the fiery battles of the Civil War, West Virginia was \nfounded by patriots who were willing to risk their lives in a united \npursuit of justice and freedom for all. Since that day 151 years ago, \nJune 20, 1863--when our State officially became the 35th State admitted \ninto the Union--West Virginia's rich culture and strong traditions \ngrew.\n  That year the Great Seal of the State of West Virginia was adopted--\nand we all have our seals and preambles in all of our States--depicting \nwho we are as a people and our culture. With our birth date's \ninscription forever engraved in its center, the seal features a big \nboulder rock with two crossed rifles and a liberty cap sitting on top \nto express our State's importance in fighting for liberty and justice.\n  On either side of the boulder stand two men: On the left, a farmer \nstands with an ax and a plow to represent agriculture. On the right, a \nminer stands with a pickax and a sledgehammer to represent industry. \nFinally, along the outer ring is carved the text ``State of West \nVirginia'' and ``Montani Semper Liberi,'' which means ``Mountaineers \nAre Always Free.''\n  That Great Seal of West Virginia, designed in 1863 during America's \nbloody Civil War, leaves a lasting imprint of who we are as the people \nof West Virginia.\n  Just like the farmer and miner on our seal, we cannot forget the \ncountless others who fought for our freedom and embarked on our State's \nimprobable journey to independence from Virginia and to our very own \nplace in the Union--a land of the free and home of the brave. We \nbelieve--and we believed way back then--that justice would prevail.\n\n[[Page S3835]]\n\n  Those pivotal figures climbed over mountains, crossed raging rivers, \ntussled through thick forests, and fought against bondage and \noppression to be free. Their resilience succeeded, and because of their \nbravery and patriotism the ``mountaineers'' are still always free.\n  Ever since our historic beginning, we, the people of West Virginia, \nhave never failed to answer our country's call. We have almost more \nveterans per capita than any other State in the Nation. When 9/11 \nhappened to our great country, there were more West Virginians \npercentagewise who signed up to enter all branches of our Armed Forces \nto fight for our country. I am so proud of each and every one of our \nWest Virginians and our veterans and the people serving today.\n  Ever since we chose the stars and stripes and chose to live under a \nConstitution that promised a constant pursuit of ``a more perfect \nUnion'' of States, no demand has been too great, no danger has been too \ndaunting, and no trial has been too threatening.\n  Our State's abundance of natural resources, coupled with the hard \nwork and sacrifice of our people, have made America stronger and safer. \nSince our birth, we have mined the coal that fueled the Industrial \nRevolution, powered our railroads across the continental United States, \nand produced the steel that built our ships, skyscrapers, and our \nfactories. Our little State has given every ounce of blood we have.\n  To this day, West Virginians continue to generate the electricity \nthat lights our cities, heats our homes, and powers our businesses. We \nhave also filled the ranks of our military forces in numbers far \ngreater than should be expected from our little State of less than 2 \nmillion people.\n  West Virginia's population holds one of the highest percentages of \nveterans among all States. As I always say, West Virginia is one of the \nmost patriotic States in the country. We always have been and we always \nwill be.\n  ``The best steel comes from the hottest fires.'' My father always \ntold me that, and the fires of the Civil War transformed us. We forever \nbranded ourselves to the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and \nthe guarantees of the U.S. Constitution--and, as the ``mountaineers'' \nwho will always be free.\n  We are tough. We are independent. We are inventive. We are honest. \nOur character has been shaped by the wilderness of our State. With \nwelcoming mountains, countless hollers, rushing streams, boundless blue \nskies, and dense green forests, we have it all. West Virginia is a \nplace of coal mines and soaring eagles, Boy Scouts and community \nleaders, sparkling lakes and captivating mountains, winding backcountry \nand smoky barbecue joints, battlefields, and hidden trails, college \ntowns and small towns, and it goes on and on. West Virginia is a place \nof power, pulse, and passion--a special place I get to call home, along \nwith other West Virginians.\n  Yes, we have had our ups and downs, our setbacks and triumphs, famous \nfamily feuds, neighborly fights, timely trials, and unexpected \nchallenges have been thrown our way, but the spirit of West Virginia \nhas never been broken, and it never will. I learned a long time ago, \ngrowing up in the small coal-mining town of Farmington, WV, with \nhardworking men and women, when things get tough, by God, we just got \ntougher. That is the way it had to be to survive.\n  Tomorrow, as people across West Virginia celebrate West Virginia's \n151st birthday, a day we now also know as West Virginia Day, I \nencourage all West Virginians to remember who we are, from where we \nhave come, and where we are going to go. I encourage us all to remember \nthe first mountaineers and the brave leaders and strong laborers who \npaved the way for us and for future generations to come.\n  We have so many reasons to be proud of our beautiful State, its kind \nand compassionate people, powerful landscapes, unique customs, rich \nculture, and fascinating history.\n  John Kennedy, in 1963, when he came for our centennial celebration \nand spoke on the capitol steps, once said: Sometimes it is raining cats \nand dogs. Sometimes the Sun doesn't always shine in West Virginia, but \nthe people always do.\n  He was so correct, as he felt the heartbeat of our State.\n  Every West Virginian contributes to our State's amazing story, and on \nWest Virginia Day I encourage all West Virginians to seize this \nopportunity to imagine the future of this great State--and this \nNation--and be proud of how far we have come and how far we will go \ntogether.\n  We are West Virginians. Even in the darkness and the gloom, we look \nto a just God who directs the storm, and similar to the brave loyal \npatriots who made West Virginia the 35th star on Old Glory, West \nVirginians' love of God and country and family and State remains \nunshakable, and that is well worth celebrating every year.\n  So God bless every West Virginian.

Mr. President, about 2 weeks ago I had a chance to meet \nwith the leaders in the agricultural community to go over certain \nissues that are available to our farmers. I met with the NRCS chief \nJason Weller. I met with the Maryland State agriculture secretary Buddy \nHance and Lee McDaniels, who is a Harford County, MD, farmer and \npresident of the Maryland Association of Soil Conservation Districts.\n  We were talking about ways in which the agricultural community, and \nthose citizens who are concerned about our environment, can work \ntogether so we can have a clean environment and a healthy agricultural \nindustry in our State. I found the discussion to be extremely helpful. \nWe talked about the Regional Conservation Partnership Program.\n  I thank Senator Stabenow for her incredible leadership on the farm \nbill. When we reauthorized it, we consolidated a lot of the \nconservation programs--particularly for specific great water bodies--\ninto the Regional Conservation Partnership Program. It provided new \nenergy and tools available for conservation within agriculture so we \ncan have a clean environment and also have sustainable agriculture in \nour country.\n  Recently, the Chesapeake Bay watershed was designated as one of the \ncritical conservation areas. That becomes important because that allows \na certain amount of the funds under the Regional Conservation \nPartnership Program to be available to the critical conservation areas \nin our country and will be used by our farmers to conserve their land, \nand to be better stewards of the land and our environment, and at the \nsame time have a sustainable agricultural program.\n  The Chesapeake Bay Program first started many years ago under the \nleadership of then-Governor Harry Hughes of Maryland, who worked with \nthe Governors of Pennsylvania and Delaware and then expanded to include \nthe States of New York, West Virginia, and of course Virginia, to \nestablish the Chesapeake Bay Program. They understood that in order for \nthe program to be successful, they had to deal with development issues \nand storm runoff, the hardened surface, the loss of forestry land in \nthe Chesapeake Bay watershed, and the causes of the pollutants in the \nsoil and our environment through\n\n[[Page S3836]]\n\nsurges which rush into our water system, our streams, and rivers, and \ninto the Chesapeake Bay. We have to do a better job of development in \ndealing with storm runoff.\n  It also recognized the responsibility of local governments. They are \nthe primary entity responsible for how we treat our waste with the \nwastewater facility plants and how we can do a better job of preventing \npollutants from entering our water system.\n  We also dealt with business growth and the pollution coming in \nthrough business activities.\n  One of the major focal points was how do we deal with agriculture. In \none sense agriculture is very positive for our environment. Maintaining \nopen space is important, and agricultural activities are generally open \nspace. That can be good because it gives us a larger tract of land in \norder to filter rainwater, to filter the pollutants from perhaps never \nentering the bay but, if they do enter the water system, they enter in \na way that has already been filtered. So in that sense agricultural \npreservation is important for the conservation of the bay, but because \nof farming activities that use nitrogen and phosphorus, it can cause \nsignificant challenges for the bay.\n\n  I think Maryland farmers have done a good job. They have done a good \njob for many years. But I wish to speak about one farmer particularly \nbecause I was very pleased--before this meeting, I had a chance to meet \nHank Suchting. He is a farmer in Baltimore County, MD. That is pretty \nclose to the urban centers. The Presiding Officer was referring to me \nas being the Senator from Baltimore. I am a proud resident of \nBaltimore, and Mr. Suchting's farm is only a few miles from my house. \nIt is interesting. He has a beef-farming cattle activity. It is in the \nOregon branch of the Gwynns Falls River, which has been dammed to \nprovide for the Loch Raven Reservoir to deal with our water supply. In \nother words, that stream, which is part of his cattle production, is in \nthe watershed that goes into the drinking water that the Presiding \nOfficer and I drink in the Baltimore region. So we all have a \nsignificant interest in making sure that water supply is kept safe and \nthat when we turn on our tap and when we drink our water, it is fresh \nwater.\n  Mr. Suchting's farm activities produce about 30 beef calves a year. \nThat is an important number because in order for that cattle population \nto be properly grazed, it needs to have a water supply, and it needs to \nhave a place where the cattle can cool off, particularly on a hot day \nlike we had yesterday. So the traditional farming activities for this \ncattle production were to allow the cattle--as I said, the stream goes \nright through his property--to use the stream for the purpose of \ncooling off and for the purpose of the drinking water for the cattle. \nHowever, that was not the best way to do it for the purposes of \nprotecting the water supply of Baltimore and to deal with the \nChesapeake Bay and to deal with our environment because, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, free access for the cattle to the river meant \nthat the cattle manure, the phosphorus would go into the waters, \ncausing a challenge for the water system, and it caused significant \nerosion to the streambed itself.\n  So Mr. Suchting felt a commitment to help the environment, so he \nsaid: Look, why don't I look at fencing in the riverbed so my cattle do \nnot get direct access to the stream and producing a supplemental water \nsystem through a water trough--as we see in the photograph. It works \nthrough gravity. It uses the aquifer, works through gravity, and \nproduces direct water for the cattle to drink.\n  Here is the interesting part. His principal motivation was that he \nwanted to do something that would help the environment, but he still \nwanted to be able to produce his cattle. He felt an obligation to do \nthis.\n  The State of Maryland had help for him. In partnerships with the \nFederal Government and conservation programs, there were funds \navailable to help him fence in the property to have a sensible \ncrossing--because he was on both sides of the creek--so that he could \nhave a way for the cattle to cross safely and still protect the water \nbed itself. That program made it more financially advantageous for him \nto put in the fencing so the cattle did not have direct access to the \nstream and to put in the water trough so they could get fresh water.\n  But guess what. He put a pencil to it and found out it was better \neconomically for him to do this. It actually made his farming practices \nmore financially viable. How did that happen? Well, he was losing \ncalves every season to storms when there were water surges and they \nwould get caught in the stream and they would actually drown. He was \nlosing calves because of extreme weather. Being in the stream caused \nhypothermia for the calves, and they would die. Every time he lost a \ncalf, he also lost about $1,000. This was a sound investment from the \npoint of view of the financial viability of his cattle production.\n  Also, he found it was healthier for his cattle in two respects. \nFirst, the water supply did not include the pathogens that can be found \nin the streams, so he found it was healthier for his cattle to get \nwater through the trough rather than through the stream itself. \nSecondly, he said the growth around the stream increased dramatically \nbecause the cattle were not in the stream, and it gave better shade on \nthe property to allow the cattle to be able to cool off in the shade in \na more efficient way than going into the stream itself.\n  My point is this: This is just one example. I could give hundreds of \nexamples where conservation makes sense for agriculture and our \nenvironment.\n  My reason for being at this farm and my reason for bringing together \nthe leaders in agriculture in Maryland is to talk about this new \nprogram that is now available. It is the Regional Conservation \nPartnership Program, which is available under the farm bill, which \nmakes hundreds of millions of dollars available competitively--it is \nnot earmarked--for farmers to be able to do what Mr. Suchting did \nthrough similar types of programs to help themselves and help our \nenvironment so we can have a safer environment for our community.\n  Working together, we can have a cleaner environment and successful \nagriculture. There are now new tools available. We want people to know \nabout them. We want farmers to know about them. We want conservation \ndistricts to get this information out to our farming community because, \nquite frankly, agriculture is critical to Maryland, it is critical to \nNew Jersey, it is critical to this country. It is the largest single \npart of our local economy, and I expect it is the same in New Jersey \nand around the Nation. We want viable agriculture. We outcompete the \nworld in production. We want to be able to continue to do that, but we \nalso want to pass on a cleaner environment to our children. We can do \nboth.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Stabenow and thanks to the \nleadership of this body, we now have new tools available to help our \nfarmers in conservation. I hope they will take advantage of them for \nthe sake of our environment and for the sake of agriculture.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The motion to proceed to the Commerce-Justice-\nScience provisions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me make two comments on two amendments actually to the THUD \nappropriations bill having to do with CNG, natural gas vehicles. If I \ncould speak very briefly on two amendments, the first is amendment No. \n3245. That amendment is the regulatory streamlining for the use of \ncompressed natural gas. This will allow us to give some of the same \ntreatment to natural gas vehicles that are given to other alternative \nfuel vehicles. In fact, I am joined with Senator Carl Levin on this \namendment, which also gives access to HOV lanes for certain vehicles \nthat are using natural gas and other alternative fuel vehicles.\n  The other one is amendment No. 3275 having to do with light semi \ntrucks that use natural gas, because of the additional weight of the \nequipment, we would give some leniency--up to 2,000 pounds--in terms of \nthe total weight to allow them and encourage them to use compressed \nnatural gas without facing a freight-weight competitive disadvantage.\n  Those are the two amendments, when the time comes, that I wanted to \nget into the Record that I will be proposing at that time.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine for yielding me a few minutes of her \ntime, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I rise to speak on an amendment I have \nfiled on the appropriations bill that this Chamber is now considering. \nThe amendment is cosponsored by Senators Rockefeller, Feinstein, \nMenendez, Schumer, Blumenthal, Gillibrand, Markey, Warren, and Brown.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add as cosponsors to the \namendment Senator Durbin, Senator Boxer, Senator Hirono, Senator \nMurphy, and Senator Schatz.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Our amendment would maintain critical evidence-based safety rules \nthat reduce truckdriver fatigue. I am disappointed that this bill \ncurrently includes a provision that would roll back the enforcement of \nthese rules--rules that are based on years of scientific evidence. It \nis doing so without further study. It is rolling back these safety \nrules without public input. It is rolling back these safety rules \nwithout even a hearing.\n  At a time when truck crashes are actually on a rise in the United \nStates of America, it is paramount that Congress do more in \ntransportation safety to improve the protection of lives--not remove an \nevidence-based element of reform.\n  Keep in mind that the rule the bill currently suspends enforcement of \nwas the result of feedback from more than 20,000 formal comments \nsubmitted by industry and stakeholders. It was a result of 6 public \nsessions and incorporated 80 sources of scientific data and research, \nas well as a regulatory impact analysis.\n  Over the past week alone, New Jersey has been impacted by at least \nfour major, separate accidents involving tractor trailer collisions. \nNational statistics, unfortunately, show that these tragedies are \nunfolding more and more frequently.\n  Many of my colleagues may not spend much time in New Jersey, but I am \nwilling to bet that many have driven on the more than 38,000 miles of \npublic roads that exist in my State. If you know the New Jersey \nTurnpike, this corridor connects our State and drivers, much of our \ncommerce, and our economy all together. This highway also sees a lot of \ntrucks at all times of the day, all around the clock.\n  So I am compelled by these facts:\n  Nearly 4,000 people are killed in truck accidents and over 100,000 \npeople are injured every single year.\n  From 2009 to 2012, truck crash injuries increased by 40 percent and \ntruck fatalities increased in our Nation by 16 percent.\n  Truckdriver fatigue is a leading cause of major truck accidents. \nThese drivers, who work extensively long days delivering the goods we \ndepend upon, deserve basic protections allowing them to get sufficient \nrest to do their job safely and efficiently.\n  Just this morning the National Transportation Safety Board released a \npreliminary report about a truck crash that happened on the New Jersey \nTurnpike on June 7 which killed one passenger traveling in a limousine, \nand four others were airlifted to a hospital. Six cars were impacted by \nthe collision between the truck and the limo. The truckdriver, \naccording to the NTSB report, had logged 13 hours 32 minutes of work at \nthe time of the crash. Had he reached his destination, he certainly \nwould have exceeded the number of federally permitted hours to work in \na given day. The truckdriver will clearly be punished for pushing the \nlimits.\n  Truckdrivers are working extremely long days to deliver the goods \nthat keep America moving, but it should never ever be at the cost of \nsafer roads.\n  At a time when we should be doing more to improve safety, we should \nnot be rolling back evidence-based rules. Our amendment prevents \nreadopting a policy that could force many truckdrivers to work over 80 \nhours per week. It maintains a balanced rulemaking that provides for \ntruckdrivers to be allowed two nights' rest at the end of a taxing \nworkweek.\n  The Department of Transportation itself--our Federal Department of \nTransportation--estimates that the current rulemaking is preventing \n1,400 crashes each year, saving 19 lives and avoiding 560 injuries on \nAmerican highways.\n  Our amendment would simply retain a provision to authorize--it would \nactually retain a provision to authorize further study. We believe \nfurther study on the issue is good. I am not against further study, nor \nare we against further analysis. But we believe it is absolutely \nunacceptable to consider suspending these driver rules while the study \nis being conducted. Safety cannot wait.\n  I have not been in the Chamber very long and even today may have \nviolated some of the rules of comity of this great body, but I know \nthis effort is an important one, and I know it will be an uphill fight. \nThere are some entrenched interests who tend to have a lot of influence \non Capitol Hill, but this, to me, is one worth fighting. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me.\n  I have heard a lot of the arguments and questions about why this \nshould possibly be rolled back, why we should roll back safety \nregulations in the face of increasing accidents on our highways. \nSomebody might say that DOT rules make the roads less safe by forcing \ntrucks on the road during busy rush hour traffic.\n  The notion that the DOT's rules--which were based on all of those \nhearings, all of that public input, the scientific study--somehow make \nthe roads less safe, to me, is unfounded. To be sure, the rule does \nrequire that scientifically proven optimal sleep hours of 1 a.m. to 5 \na.m. be included in the DOT's mandatory 34-hour ``restart'' period. But \nlet me be clear. This restart period only applies when a truckdriver \nhas reached his or her maximum driving hours for the week--the maximum \nallowed. It only triggers that provision when someone has worked a 70-\nhour workweek.\n  Keep in mind that most people work 40-hour workweeks. Requiring those \ndrivers operating 80,000-pound trucks on busy roads to get some rest is \nnot only common sense, it is supported by the science. The Department \nof Transportation estimates that the current rule, again, is preventing \ncrashes, is preventing the loss of life. Nineteen lives they believe \nthese rules around hours have saved, 560 injuries, 1,400 crashes. \nSuspending this rule without studying it first is not common sense.\n  I have heard another argument that the DOT rules are a solution \nlooking for a problem, that truckdriver fatigue is somehow not that \ncommon. A study\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\nthat was conducted by FMCSA in 2006 found an astonishing number of \ntruckdrivers--65 percent of truckdrivers--reported that they often feel \ndrowsy while driving. Over 40 percent of truckdrivers responded they \nhave trouble staying awake at the wheel. An alarming 13 percent \nadmitted they have fallen asleep while driving.\n  Fatigue is an issue. The survey illustrates how vitally important \nrules governing hours of service and rest periods are in keeping our \nroads and highways safe. Now is not a time to roll back those rules \nwithout studying, without evidence, without a hearing, without \ninformation.\n  There are some people who might say this is a partisan issue, that \nsomehow Democrats are safety advocates and are exploiting the severe \naccident that faced a comedian named Tracy Morgan, that we are using \nthis as a political opportunity. But that suggestion is wrong. Somehow \nit misses that fatal accidents are common on our highways.\n  This concern continues to rise in our country as the number of \naccidents increases. While the accident involving Tracy Morgan on the \nturnpike was tragic, it was one of thousands of accidents and crashes \nthat occur in our country each day. The incident has brought needed \nattention to a rising trend of trucking accidents. This is a problem \npolicymakers have long been trying to address through Federal rules and \ninitiatives, based again on years of study and analysis.\n  In fact, last month I sent a letter to the U.S. Department of \nTransportation regarding important truck safety concerns. My \npredecessor, Frank Lautenberg, spent years of his life in public \nservice trying to make our roads safer.\n  I also have heard that most truckdrivers are negatively impacted by \nthe current rule, that language in the Senate appropriations bills \nstops this impact that most truckdrivers are seeing.\n  That is simply not true. A driver is only required to use the 34-hour \nrestart if and only if he or she works the maximum number of hours \nallowed under the Federal regulation. This restart is most frequently \nin effect for those long-haul drivers who make up only about 15 percent \nof the trucking workforce. Those averaging 70 hours per week or less \nare not affected by the changes to the 34-hour restart, because they \nwould never work the number of hours that would require them to use the \nrestart under the current rule.\n  The Senate amendment would allow drivers, though, to return to the \nextreme schedule allowed under the pre-July 2013 rule, when a company \ncould require a driver to work a maximum of 82 hours a week, pushing \nthe limit of human endurance. Not only 82 hours in 1 week, trucking \ncompanies would force the limits of human endurance of 82 hours week \nafter week after week after week, 82-hour week after 82-hour week after \n82-hour week.\n  I have also heard this HOS provision in the T-HUD appropriations bill \nis a low-impact change to the hours-of-service rule, that this is \nactually not that much of a change. Suspending enforcement of these DOT \nhours-of-service rules substantially increases the number of hours a \ntruckdriver could be forced to work each week and forced to push the \nrealm of human endurance. In fact, the change would be from an already \nhigh 70-hour workweek to a more than 80-hour workweek, which is the \nequivalent of an extra workday each week and nearly twice the amount \nthe average American works.\n  The appropriations bill will remove this commonsense guarantee that \ntruckdrivers themselves, as we have seen with the support from the \nTeamsters Union, that truckdrivers themselves get at least a 2-night \nrest, the humane 2-night rest at the end of a tasking workweek.\n  What these changes mean in practice is that drivers may be forced to \nwork grueling hours now, week after week by truck companies that are \npushing the limit. Studies have shown this leads to the fatigue that \ncauses accidents such as we are seeing on the New Jersey Turnpike. The \nDOT hours-of-service rules, some people say, implemented last year were \nbased on insufficient analysis, that somehow these were rushed rules.\n  But I have said already, this came out of a balanced rulemaking \neffort and process that took into account both safety and industry \ninterests. DOT rulemaking involved the feedback from 21,000 formal \ndocument comments submitted by a wide range of stakeholders, including \nsix public listening sessions, and incorporated 80 basic scientific \nresearch data provided by scientists, as well as conducted a formal \nregulatory analysis.\n  By contrast, the bill rolling this all back was done in an \nappropriations process. It was not reviewed. It was not considered by \nthe committee of jurisdiction upon which I sit. It was not subject to \npublic comment. It had no hearings established where both sides were \nlistened to and their comments were weighed and engaged. It rolled back \na rule that now will allow truckdrivers to be pushed more into the \nlimits of their human endurance and put more fatigued drivers on our \nroads.\n  Some people say this amendment I am putting forth, with many of my \ncolleagues, somehow would prevent further study. That is not true. Our \namendment only strips the provision of the appropriations bill that \nties the Department of Transportation's hands and prevents them from \nenforcing the current rules on the books. But we actually leave intact \nauthorization for more study, which I am open to.\n  This should be done on scientific studies in an open process, with \nhearings, with information, with testimony. It should not be saddled \nonto an appropriations bill that ultimately would roll back rules which \nthe DOT themselves are saying will help to preserve the safety and the \nlives of American citizens. So I caution right now, why not wait? Why \nnot do a study, leaving the current rule intact? Why not keep these \nregulations, these safety regulations in place, and let's do another \nround of studies? Let's do another round of hearings. Let's have debate \nand discussion in committee and the committee of jurisdiction before we \nroll back rules that put truckdrivers on our roads, pushed by trucking \ncompanies, to further their limits of exhaustion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, it appears I first need to say to my \ncolleague and to those who are listening, there is no one in this body, \nin the trucking industry, among their customers who wants to see \ntrucking accidents. All of us are committed to safer roads, and to make \nsure that freight is delivered in a safe manner in this country.\n  In fact, the former Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration said in a letter to the committee dated June 17:\n\n       The fact is the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban \n     Development bill which contains a temporary suspension of two \n     new provisions in the 34-hour restart rule makes the roads \n     safer.\n\n  Makes the roads safer. That is what this debate is about.\n  I am very disappointed to see that the Senator from New Jersey is \notherwise engaged and not listening to these comments.\n  Let me start with a fact. The fact is, under current law, under the \nCollins amendment, under the provisions we reported in the \nAppropriations Committee, it is illegal for any driver to operate a \ncommercial motor vehicle when that driver's ability or alertness is \nimpaired through fatigue, illness, or any other cause so as to make his \nor her driving unsafe.\n  That is illegal. That is illegal now. That will continue to be \nillegal if our provisions become law. I think that perhaps it would be \nhelpful, given the disappointing amount of misinformation that has been \ncirculated by the proponents of this amendment, if I were to go through \nsome of the provisions of the hours-of-service regulation. Those are \nthe regulations that are the foundation of the rules that govern truck \nsafety in this country.\n  The fact is our Transportation-HUD appropriations bill would not \nsuspend the entire hours-of-service regulation or the entire 34-hour \nrestart provisions as some keep saying, both on the Senate floor and in \nthe media. To be clear, our proposal would not change the maximum \ndriving hours that are allowed per day. It would not change the total \non-duty window in each shift. It would not change the minimum number of \noff-duty hours between shifts, which is 10 hours. It would not change \nthe mandatory 30-minute rest break that is required by your eighth \nhour.\n\n[[Page S3839]]\n\nThat is a new provision that was adopted last July.\n  My friend from New Jersey claims I am wiping out all of these rules. \nRegrettably, he is simply mistaken about that. I am not changing any of \nthese provisions of the hours-of-service regulation, including one that \nwas adopted last July requiring a mandatory 30-minute rest break prior \nto your eighth hour. I support that. I think that is a good idea. I \nsupport the provisions for a limit on how many hours a driver can be \nbehind the wheel. I support the limit on the maximum on-duty hours. I \nsupport the requirement for 10 hours off between shifts. So to say I am \nrepealing all of these truck safety regulations is simply false. It is \na disservice to the debate on an important issue for wrong information \nto be circulated about what we are trying to do.\n  There is another important provision we are not changing that I think \nis going to help to improve truck safety, and that is the upcoming \nrequirement for electronic, onboard recorders to replace the paper logs \nthat are kept by some truckdrivers now.\n  The paper logs have been proven to be less accurate, and obviously \nthere is a potential for reporting false information. With electronic \nlogs, that goes away. I am a strong supporter of the rulemaking that is \ngoing to lead to the requirement for electronic logs, which many \ntruckdrivers are already using. Our bill, in fact, includes some \nfunding to help truckdrivers of smaller fleets afford the electronic \nlogs.\n  What are we changing? We are changing only two provisions, and that \nis why our amendment--my amendment--was adopted by an overwhelmingly \nstrong bipartisan group in the Appropriations Committee. The vote was \n21 to 9 because the members of the committee took the time to \nunderstand what we were doing and what we were not doing.\n  Here is one of the problems. The new rules require that a truckdriver \nhave two consecutive nights where he must be off duty and sleeping \nbetween 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. There are a lot of people in this country who \nwork a night shift, and if we talk to them they will tell you that what \nis disruptive to them is to work a day shift part of the week, a night \nshift part of the week, go back to the day shift, and go back and \nforth.\n  Many of our drivers want to drive during the overnight hours because \nthe statistics overwhelmingly show that is the safest time for them to \nbe on the roads.\n  This isn't a matter of conjecture. It is based on the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration's own analysis about what times of the \nday crashes occur. The fact is, the safest time for trucks to travel is \nbetween midnight and 6 a.m. The number of crashes nearly quadruples \nbetween 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. It is five times higher between noon and 6 \np.m.\n  Let's think about this for a moment. It just makes sense. There are \nfar fewer vehicles on the road. Why in the world would we want to push \ntruckdrivers to have to be on the road when children are going back and \nforth from school, when commuters are going to work.\n  One truckdriver from Maine gave me a great example. For those of us \nwho are familiar with downtown Boston, with all of its small, curvy \nstreets and all of its one-way streets, he said to me: If I have to \nwait until 5 a.m. to deliver fuel to a convenience store on the corner \nof two busy streets in downtown Boston and I am going to arrive there \nat 7 a.m.--during the rush hour, during the time when people are \ngetting up, going to school and to work--it is far more dangerous. It \nis far more difficult for those commuters trying to stop at that \nconvenience store while I am trying to deliver the fuel. It is far \nsafer for me to be delivering that fuel at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. in the \nmorning before the convenience store even opens and before the traffic \npicks up.\n  But, again, the Senator from New Jersey doesn't have to take my word \nfor it. Please, I would implore the Senator from New Jersey to look at \nthe statistics--and these are the newest statistics the Department has \nput out. They are very clear that the crashes more than quadruple--\nquadruple--during those daylight hours.\n  That is why the truckdrivers would prefer to be on the road at night \nwhen it is safer and to do their deliveries when their customers need \nthe deliveries to be done--whether it is to that convenience store that \nneeds gas before the rush hour starts or whether it is to a grocery \nstore that needs to reload its shelves. That just makes sense.\n  The second change--and the only other change--that our amendment \nmakes to the hours of service provisions has to do with the limitation \non the use of the restart. Under the new regulations which were \nimplemented last July about 1 year ago the Department limited the 34-\nhour restart to once a week. It is once every 168 hours.\n  How does that make sense? The Presiding Officer and I both come from \nStates where there can be severe winter weather, and a truckdriver who \nis delivering in Wisconsin or Maine may run into a terrible storm.\n  Why shouldn't he or she be allowed to take a 34-hour period off while \nthe storm is raging and then restart the clock on the number of hours \nthat he or she can take?\n  By the way, the restart, under the current law, is voluntary, and we \ndo not change the requirement--which is current law--that a truckdriver \ncannot drive more than 70 hours in 8 days. What we are saying, however, \nis we don't want that truckdriver to be out there in bad weather trying \nto push through and get home because he or she is running up against \nthe clock and can't take a second 34-hour restart.\n  In fact, as the former administrator--who, by the way, has spent her \nprofessional life of 22 years in public safety--has written: We \nencourage drivers to get more rest, to not take the chance of driving \nthrough bad weather.\n  Now let me address the conflicting arguments I heard from the Senator \nfrom New Jersey on the issue of whether these regulations have been \nstudied enough.\n  On the one hand, he says they have been studied to death and they are \nwell based in scientific research. But the fact is that the current \nAdministrator of FMCSA recently testified over on the House side and \nwas specifically asked if the agency had evaluated the safety and \ncongestion impacts of large trucks being forced by the new regulations \nto drive during the hours when crashes are most likely.\n  The Administrator confirmed: The field study did not address or talk \nabout the impact of traffic on the road.\n  That is why it is critically important to study all aspects of the \nregulation. It appeared that FMCSA also failed to coordinate with its \nsister agency the Federal Highway Administration.\n  Just last month the Federal Highway Administration announced a grant \nprogram called the Off Hours Freight Delivery Program for cities that \n``look at how truck deliveries made outside of peak and rush hours--\nwhen there is less traffic on the highways--can save time and money for \nfreight carriers, improve air quality and create more sustainable and \nlivable cities.''\n  So clearly the agencies within the Department of Transportation are \nnot communicating their policies with one another. We have one DOT \nagency trying to direct more trucks onto our Nation's highways during \nthe daylight hours, and then we have a second agency that is pushing \nfunding out to cities in order to keep those same large trucks from \noperating during daylight hours and to encourage them to operate during \novernight hours.\n  Why we would want to prevent or discourage large trucks from being \nable to drive during overnight hours simply makes no sense.\n  On the other hand, my colleague from New Jersey says: Don't worry, we \nhave kept in the study. We have kept the Collins study in the bill.\n  Well, if it has been studied so extensively, as he claims, then why \nis there a need for the study? You can't have it both ways. You can't \nsay these regulations were thoroughly studied and supported \nby scientific evidence, but, gee, we need a study. I mean, which is it?\n\n  I think what the Administrator admitted in her testimony over on the \nHouse side is accurate, and that is the field study did not look at the \noverall impact of congestion on our roads, and that is a real flaw. \nThat is why I worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come \nup with a study that will look at all of these factors, to make sure \nthat we do not have what the Administrator herself has conceded are \nunintended consequences of these changes, and that is what we have now.\n  The fact is that these changes that were adopted by a vote of 21 to 9 \nby the\n\n[[Page S3840]]\n\nAppropriations Committee are common sense. They will lead to less \nfatigued drivers. They deserve more study and consideration, and--as \nthe former Administrator of this agency has said--they will improve \ntraffic safety.\n  I hope my colleagues will oppose the amendment that has been offered \nby the Senator from New Jersey. I will speak further, but I know there \nare others who want to debate this issue or who are waiting to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Will my colleague yield for one short question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would be glad to engage in more debate later, but my \ncolleague from Missouri has been waiting for a half hour to speak, and \nI think it would be courteous for him to be allowed to speak.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Nevada for \nyielding a few minutes to me. He is going to speak on an amendment \nwhich requires the Senate to pass a budget I am supportive of and \nsupport his efforts to do that, but I wish to speak in support of this \ngreat explanation of what the committee did as we just heard from the \nSenator from Maine.\n  The committee debated this. We looked at the facts as Senator Collins \nhas repeated. That full debate, that full discussion in the committee \nultimately had a bipartisan vote of 21 to 9. This was something the \ncommittee thought about. I think the committee reached the right \ndecision, and I was glad to be part of the 21 votes that said this \nshould be part of the underlying bill.\n  There is a wide consensus that further study is needed. That \nconsensus goes even to the administration.\n  As the Senator from Maine has already pointed out, the ``restart \nrule'' allows drivers to restart their weekly on-duty time calculations \nby taking at least 34 hours off duty.\n  In July of 2013, new restrictions were placed on the restart \nprovision, and the changes, frankly, have had unintended consequences \nand unintended effects for drivers, for their families, for customers \nin the supply line, and even other users of the road.\n  The new restrictions state that a restart period has to include two \nback-to-back periods in the middle of the night--from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. \nI am usually up not too long after 5 a.m. I am almost never up between \n1 a.m. and 5 a.m., but many people are.\n  The Federal Government can decide a lot of things, but what is the \nbest work and rest pattern for people should not be one of them, \nparticularly when that work pattern forces people to do their work at a \nmore dangerous time. I believe that is what this rule does. That is \nwhat the accident reports would verify; that back-to-back rest periods \ncan only be used in a way that disrupts the ability to get the job done \nin a way that works for these drivers and their families, and works for \nsafety on the road.\n  This rule would push more trucks onto the road during the daylight \nhours, and accidents are worse when there is more traffic.\n  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration just admitted that \nthis wasn't studied as it should have been. I asked the Secretary of \nTransportation over 1 month ago to tell what studies were done on this \nissue. We still haven't gotten a report. He very nicely said, ``I would \nlike to take that for the record.'' Apparently the record is pretty \nhard to complete here because we haven't had a report yet about the \nresearch done on what would happen if you took truckdrivers off the \nroad in the middle of the night and put them on the road in the middle \nof the day, the middle of the afternoon, the very rush hour hours the \nSenator from Maine has talked about.\n  I have heard from a lot of drivers in our State. We are in the middle \nof the country. We are a transportation hub. We have lots of drivers in \nour State. One constituent of mine, a driver from Energy Transport \nSolutions in Bates City, MO, said a lot of drivers are losing a whole \nday on the road and a whole day with their family.\n  Many drivers choose to drive at night or early in the morning so they \ncan be home when their kids come home from school. If a driver wants to \nbe home when their kids come home from school and if they want to drive \nduring safer parts of the driving 24-hour cycle, why would the \ngovernment tell them they can't do that without any study to indicate \nit somehow would be safer?\n  The fact is this provision would in no way affect the hours-of-\nservice rule. The Senator from Maine once again has explained what \nwouldn't change. It wouldn't change the daily driving time limit; it \nwouldn't change the daily working limit; it wouldn't change the daily \nbreak requirement; it wouldn't change the weekly work limit.\n  This rule only says: We are not going to move forward with more \ndangerous traffic times required by law until there is some proof that \nsomehow this works out to their advantage. Drivers still can't work \nlonger than the maximum 14 hours in a shift. They can't drive longer \nthan 11 hours at a time. By the way, that is what the rules say now. \nThey would still be required to take at least 10 consecutive hours' \nrest before starting the next shift, and they have to take at least 30 \nminutes before the 8 hours they come on duty. These safeguards will \nremain in place.\n  The provision the committee is offering as part of this bill merely \nsuspends the two restrictions on the restart rule, which is only one \nsubset of a larger part, a rule that would still be in effect.\n  During that suspension, the Federal motor safety group would be \nrequired to adequately study the effects of what they have required to \nhappen here. It is also worth mentioning again that they have said they \nneed to make this study. So why don't we let them? Traffic accident \nreports would indicate we are forcing people to drive at a more \ndifficult time.\n  Talking about the terrible accident we saw lately, the fact is, \nsomebody who drives 24 hours straight, whether it is their own car or a \ntruck, is in violation of every rule that is out there now.\n  The rules the Senator from New Jersey says we should protect because \nof the recent accident are the rules that were in effect during the \nrecent accident. Those were the rules in effect then. If anything, we \nshould say what rules were in effect a few days ago and how would we \nreevaluate them so this wouldn't happen again, rather than saying we \nhave to have exactly the rules in effect we had in effect when the \ntragedy occurred. That makes no sense at all.\n  There are reasons to research this. There are reasons to look at it. \nOne of the reasons to keep the current rules in place is not that they \nwould have prevented the accident that happened, because the current \nrules were in place when the accident happened.\n  Reports have stated the vehicle was traveling too fast, and the \nperson drove in their own vehicle long before they got in the other \ncar. There is nothing in the amendment the Senator from New Jersey \nproposes that would have done anything about those violations of the \nrules our bill would leave in effect that Senator Collins and I are \nadvocates for.\n  We don't want to put truckdrivers and others on the road in danger \nunnecessarily. The more cars that are out, the more likely you are to \nhave an accident; the more cars and trucks that are out there, the more \nlikely you are to have an accident.\n  This overnight rest rule has clearly put trucks on the road at a \nbusier, more congested time. We believe that is not good. The \ncommittee, by a vote of 21 to 9, believes that is not good. I hope the \nSenate decides to stay with the decision the committee has brought to \nthe floor.\n  Let's have a study. It should have happened before these rules came \nout, and it absolutely should happen now.\n  I see now Senators from Nevada on the floor. I do wish to mention \nagain I am grateful to Senator Heller for letting me make these remarks \nbefore we get to the amendment he wants to talk about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:45 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the \nfollowing nominations: Calendar No. 770, Aguilar; No. 538, Nichols, to \nbe Ambassador to Peru; No. 766, McWatters, to be a Member of the \nNational Credit Union Administration; and No. 712, which is Wormuth, to \nbe Under Secretary of Defense for Policy;\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\nwith all other provisions of the previous order remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I thank my colleagues on the floor for \ntheir healthy debate on advancing traffic safety. I am sure we will \nhear a lot more about it, and I look forward to continued debate.\n  I also thank my colleague from Missouri for his support on the \namendment I am about to offer and talk about. The amendment I am \nspeaking of is the Heller amendment No. 3269 to H.R. 4660.\n  While I commend the chairwoman and the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee for all of their hard work in putting together \nthe appropriations minibus to be considered on the floor, this is only \nthe first of the appropriations bills that Congress needs to, and \nshould, consider before the end of the fiscal year.\n  This will not surprise the American public, but this Congress is once \nagain facing another October 1 deadline to complete all of the current \nfiscal year appropriations bills. We are now well into the year and \nonly now are we starting to bring appropriations bills to the Senate \nfloor. By our own calendar there are only 8 full legislative weeks left \nto avoid yet another continuing resolution.\n  Missed deadline after missed deadline has been a staple of this \nCongress. Without even a basic budget process, we have failed to pass \nany of the current fiscal year appropriations bills on time so far this \nyear.\n  I know the Appropriations Committee has been working hard to pass \neach of their spending bills in committee, but all too often these \nbills end up being rolled into one large omnibus measure or a \ncontinuing resolution that is not subject to any amendments.\n  As our Nation faces a rising national debt, the American people can \nno longer afford Congress's failure to tackle our Nation's spending \naddiction. I must admit that since coming to Washington back in 2006, I \nhave never seen Congress pass all 12 appropriations bills on time. In \nfact, I am certain most of my colleagues who serve with me today have \nnot experienced a normal appropriations process, and there are probably \neven more Members who don't think it is even a realistic expectation to \npass all 12 appropriations bills on time anymore. So I am here to \nremind everyone that Congress has been able to accomplish its regular \nbudget and appropriations process before in recent history.\n  A couple examples: It happened under President Clinton with a \nRepublican Congress in 1996. It happened under President Reagan with a \nDemocratic Congress in 1988. These are just two examples, but the fact \nremains that these deadlines have been met before, and now is the time \nto start meeting those deadlines again.\n  I have always said Washington, DC, is a pain-free zone that faces no \nconsequences--zero consequences--if Members fail to do their jobs. I \nthink it is time we start requiring accountability for Members of \nCongress in order to get things done.\n  I know many of my colleagues have heard me talk about my legislation, \nNo Budget, No Pay. It is pretty simple: If Members of Congress do not \npass an annual bipartisan budget resolution and all 12 spending bills \non time each year, then they simply should not be paid.\n  I wish to repeat that last part: If Congress fails to pass all 12 \nspending bills on time each year, they should not get paid.\n  We have honest, hardworking Americans in the gallery and across this \ncountry who play by the rules. That rule says: If people do their job, \nthey get paid. Why shouldn't it be the same for us as Members of \nCongress? We need to be honest.\n  We also need to recognize that both Democrats and Republicans are at \nfault. Governing from crisis to crisis while our long-term debt \ncontinues to grow is now the new normal in Washington. We need \nbipartisan solutions, but nothing will happen if Members of Congress \ndon't start feeling some pain.\n  Instead of playing another game of brinkmanship, let's start working \nnow on a plan that will place our Nation on sound fiscal footing or \ncultivate a progrowth economy that will produce jobs in the long term.\n  I have filed No Budget, No Pay as an amendment to this appropriations \nminibus to highlight that we have to end this cycle of inaction and \nindecision. Let's show the American people their elected officials are \nready to lead and make the tough decisions these times deserve.\n  While I am not a betting man, I am from Nevada so I would bet that \nonce again we will fail on passing any appropriations bills into law \nbefore October 1, and we will once again punt our responsibilities by \ndoing another CR or omnibus.\n  I ask my colleagues--if you are sick and tired of this broken budget \nand appropriations process as much as I am, support No Budget, No Pay, \nand let's fix this problem once and for all.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Madam President. I know Senator Kirk is on \nhis way to give tribute to one of his staffer--a tragic situation--so I \nam going to be very brief.\n  Madam President, I come to the floor to support Senator Collins' \nefforts to bring some common sense to these truck safety regulations, \nand I know this is a very emotional debate because of the tragic \naccident that occurred recently with a very well-known and well-\nrespected comedian, Tracy Morgan.\n  I understand that there are families in my State and around the \ncountry who have had horrible and, unfortunately, fatal accidents with \ntrucks that are more and more prevalent on our overcrowded highway \nsystem. I am not insensitive to those families, to those stories, and I \nhonestly believe that what Senator Collins and I and others are trying \nto do is going to make a very unsafe situation more safe, not less \nsafe.\n  There is really an honest and sincere disagreement among us that has \nto be debated. I am glad we are having this debate so that the \nevidence, the record, and the facts can speak for themselves.\n  This first came to my attention a couple of months ago when a group \nof citizens came up from Louisiana to say: Senator, we are shocked to \ntell you this, but there is a new rule out that is going to require \ntruckers to sleep between the hours of 1:00 and 5:00 two nights a week.\n  I looked at them and said: That cannot possibly be correct. Nobody at \nthe Federal Government would ever mandate when people are supposed to \nsleep.\n  I mean, how would you do such a thing? How can you tell people when \nto sleep and when to be awake? You can tell them how many hours they \nneed to rest, you can determine how many hours they can drive before \nthey have to take a break, but how exactly are you going to enforce \nwhen people sleep? That is going a step too far. So that is why I \nsigned on with Senator Collins to say: Wait a minute, there has to be a \nbetter way.\n  When they told me--which I could not believe and later found it to be \ntrue--they said: Senator, don't you think that sometimes it is better \nfor truckdrivers to drive at night when the highways are less crowded \nthan during the day when they are more crowded, when children are on \ntheir way to school, when people are on their way to work, when most \npeople have day jobs?\n  But there are millions of Americans who work at night. It is probably \ntwo-thirds who work during the day and one-third at night.\n  Wouldn't it be safer for the trucks to drive at night? Some of these \ntruckdrivers can sleep during the day.\n  I said: Absolutely. That makes sense to me.\n  They said: Well, that is soon going to be illegal under these rules.\n  So that is why I got into this debate.\n  I am very respectful of Senator Booker, one of the outstanding, \nbrightest lights that has hit this Chamber in a long time. His \nintellect is spectacular. His heart is in the right place. He and I \nboth agree that we want our highways safe. We want the truckers rested. \nWe don't like the crowding on the highways. But it is going too far \nwhen\n\n[[Page S3842]]\n\nthe Federal Government starts mandating when workers should sleep. We \njust can't go there.\n  So I am going to support Senator Collins' legislation that is going \nto back up these no-commonsense rules and ask them to come back with \nanother suggestion that will result in the same safety but not mandate \nwhen Americans should sleep. I think adults who drive trucks can make \nthose decisions for themselves.\n  If the law is that they have to rest 8 or 9 hours in a 24-hour \nperiod, I think they are responsible enough to do so. If they are not, \nthen they should be held accountable and prosecuted for reckless \ndriving--which happens frequently--and they should then be \nappropriately punished, whether by fine or revocation of their license \nor jail time. But I cannot be part of any government that is making \nregulations demanding that people sleep a certain hour--not from \nmidnight to 4, not from 2:00 to 7:00, but from 1:00 to 5:00 on \nconsecutive nights a week. I just don't understand it, and I am not \ngoing to support it.\n  So this is not about safety; this is about government overreach to a \npoint where it is almost visceral. There has to be a better way to come \nup with a rule to get our highways safe. I am open to it. Not this \nrule.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3842-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3842-S3843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING LISA RADOGNO\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise to memorialize the life of my \nWashington, DC, scheduler who passed away yesterday, Lisa Radogno.\n  This is a picture of her. I am going to give these remarks as if I am \ntalking to Lisa because this blow was such a severe one that we \nsuffered yesterday.\n  Lisa Radogno was one of the brightest lights of my Washington, DC, \noffice. She was such a strong supporter of mine, even stronger than I.\n  Lisa was a diehard White Sox fan. She even had a White Sox logo \ntattoo on her ankle. We will miss her so very dearly.\n  Lisa, I will tell you that this loss is--sorry, Mr. President. I get \nvery emotional about this death that just happened yesterday. I want to \nmemorialize Lisa, who was so much like her mother, State senator \nChristine Radogno of Lemont, dedicated to the service of the people of \nIllinois. She was a fierce, fierce worker on campaigns and here in the \nSenate. She is somebody I will miss with every fiber of my being. She \nwas with me in the House of Representatives and here in the Senate and \nwas so proud to represent the people of Illinois here in the Senate.\n  To have her die yesterday was a big blow, especially for a young \nwoman in her thirties. It is a real shock to my staff to have Lisa gone \nfrom us.\n  Lisa, these days are going to be really hard. I will just say you ran \nthe schedule so perfectly. It was a work of art, in your case, to do \nthe complicated workings of a House office, of a Senate office, to be \nso perfect and so young in what you did. The staff is all now in shock. \nYou were certainly the social light of our operation here in \nWashington, DC.\n  I spent a good part of last night on your Facebook page looking at \npictures of you, and it really caused me to cry a bunch. I will miss \nyou, especially in our office, and watching you online quite a bit, \nhoping that Facebook leaves up those pictures forever so I can always \ntake a quick look at your smile and remember your humor, which was \nalways right at the ready.\n  Lisa was such a strong supporter of my office. To have her lost like \nthis so suddenly was a big shock to us. This is pretty hard for all of \nus in the Kirk operation to handle.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I know we have pending now the \nappropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, and Science, which contains \nan important issue I have offered an amendment on, along with Senator \nChambliss, who is the ranking Republican on the intelligence committee, \nas well as Senators Wicker, Inhofe, Cruz, Graham, and Blunt, all of \nwhom serve on the Armed Services Committee, and Senator Vitter and \nSenator Kirk. Our amendment would prohibit the administration from \ntransferring to or releasing to the custody or control of any foreign \ncountry Guantanamo detainees whom our own Guantanamo Review Task Force \nhas recommended for continued law-of-war detention.\n  This is a task force that looks at all the circumstances surrounding \nthose who are being held at Guantanamo, including whether they continue \nto represent a danger to our country and to our allies if they were to \nbe released.\n\n  Our amendment does three things. It prohibits the transfer to foreign \ncountries of these detainees, that this group the administration put \ntogether to review each of the detainees and their status at Guantanamo \nhas recommended them for continued law-of-war detention.\n  These are the worst of the worst. These individuals have been \ndetermined to be the most dangerous to continue to present a risk to \nthe United States of America and to our allies if they were to be \nreleased.\n  So our amendment is pretty straightforward. It simply says they \ncannot be transferred to third-party countries--or transferred to the \nUnited States of America, for that matter--and that they shall remain \nat the secure detention facility, Guantanamo Bay, based on the \nrecommendation of the Guantanamo Review Task Force.\n  Our amendment would also prevent the transfer of Guantanamo detainees \nto countries that have had prior instances of Guantanamo detainees \nbeing transferred to that country and then those detainees getting back \nin the fight against us.\n  It is pretty common sense. If we have a history with a country where \nwe previously, under either the Bush administration or the Obama \nadministration, transferred the detainees there and then they have been \nreleased and have gotten back in the fight against us or our allies, \nwhy would we want to transfer them to this type of country again? \nBecause, obviously, these countries cannot guarantee the security of \nthese detainees, and it puts us and our allies at risk.\n  Finally, our amendment would prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo \ndetainees to countries that have failed to honor their previous \ncommitments to the United States of America to monitor, detain, or \ncontrol the travel of former Guantanamo detainees. Again, if we have \nhad a prior agreement with a country and we have transferred a detainee \nor detainees there, and they have failed to honor those agreements, why \nwould we want to transfer detainees there now?\n  The most recent instance of this was the five Taliban dream team who \nwere transferred to Qatar, because the country of Qatar actually had a \nprior instance where they failed to honor their commitments to us with \nregard to how they would treat the detention and travel restrictions on \na Guantanamo detainee.\n  I am deeply concerned about the national security implications of the \nfive detainees who were transferred in the prisoner swap. In fact, \nhaving asked our intelligence officials about what will happen to these \nfive detainees, what I have heard from them is on a scale of 1 to 10, 4 \nout of 5 of those detainees are a 10 for 10 on the likelihood to get \nback in the battle against us or our allies. The fifth is about an 80-\n10 scale. We have a 29-percent reengagement rate or recidivism rate \nfrom those we have held at Guantanamo, meaning 29 percent of them get \nback in the fight against our country, against us, against our \ninterests after they have been captured and put in Guantanamo.\n  So we have a history here, and it is important if the administration \nis going to transfer anyone out of Guantanamo they not transfer \nindividuals who have been found too dangerous to be let loose because \nthey have been designated for continued law-of-war detention and they \npresent too much of a risk to our country and the world. Second, to not \ntransfer these individuals to countries where we have already\n\n[[Page S3843]]\n\ntransferred people in the past--and guess what, they couldn't keep them \nsecure and they got back in the fight against us and our allies. Third, \nto prohibit transfer to countries that have not honored prior \ncommitments when we have transferred a Gitmo detainee there, and that \nwould apply to the country the President most recently released the \nfive Taliban dream team to who, unfortunately, are going to get back in \nthe fight, and that 29 percent are those who have reengaged in the \nfight or are suspected of reengaging in the fight against us.\n  Our amendment is straightforward. It is focused on making sure the \nterrorists held at Guantanamo--the most dangerous of those individuals \nwho present a threat to our country--are not put in a position where \nthey can get back in the fight against us or against our allies.\n  We have to think about the men and women in uniform who have put \ntheir lives on the line to capture these individuals, in some \ninstances, and honor our commitment to them to make sure we can hold \nthe country safe and secure, to not allow those who have been deemed \nthe most dangerous at Guantanamo for continued law of war detention to \nbe transferred to a third-party country or not allow us to transfer \nthem to countries where we already have a history of either detainees \ngetting back in the fight from that country or the country not honoring \nits commitment to the United States of America.\n  My prior job was as a prosecutor. I will tell you, it is just a \nmatter of common sense. This is a matter of protecting the American \npeople from dangerous captured terrorists who we already have in our \ncustody, to make sure we are not putting them back in a position where \nthey can harm us again.\n  I think that is something that America would expect of us. That is \nwhat I believe our amendment would do. I hope, as we take up this \nappropriations bill, this amendment will be considered so we can pass \nit to ensure that dangerous Guantanamo detainees are not put in a \nposition again where they can harm us, our people or our allies because \ntoo many of them, unfortunately, have already committed acts against \nour country, our people, and our allies, and shame on us if we do not \ndo everything we can to prevent that from happening again.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3843-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3843-S3845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF GUSTAVO VELASQUEZ AGUILAR TO BE AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF \n                     HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF BRIAN A.

The majority leader.\n\n\n         Unanimous Consent Request--Calendar No. 428, H.R. 4660\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that postcloture \ntime on the motion to proceed be considered expired; that the Senate \nproceed to vote on adoption of the motion to proceed; that if the \nmotion is agreed to, Senator Mikulski or her designee be recognized to \noffer substitute amendment No. 3244, which consists of the text of S. \n2437, Calendar No. 411, division A; the text of S. 2438, Calendar No. \n412, as division B; and the text of S. 2389, Calendar No. 390, as \ndivision C; provided further that for the consideration of division B, \nH.R. 4745, Calendar No. 430, and for the consideration of division C, \nH.R. 4800, as reported by the House Committee on Appropriations, be \ndeemed House-passed text in H.R. 4660 for purposes of rule XVI; \nfurther, that the substitute amendment offered by Senator Mikulski or \nher designee be considered a committee amendment for the purposes of \nparagraph 1 of rule XVI; further, all amendments or motions to commit \nbe subject to a 60-vote threshold.\n  Mr. President, before the Presiding Officer calls for approval of \nthis consent, let me say a few words so everyone understands all of the \nprocedural stuff.\n\n[[Page S3844]]\n\n  It is a fairly simple matter. We have waited all week to get a simple \nagreement to move forward on appropriations bills the way we have \nalways done. If it had been just one appropriations bill we wouldn't \nneed consent. We put three of them together, and that was the right \nthing to do. But it seems to me we spent all week doing, so much of the \ntime, nothing. Sadly, I am sorry this is the norm around here. For \nevery single matter, even wildly popular matters such as an \nappropriations bill, it requires the full play of the cloture rule to \nadvance. This has been so even though on Tuesday, when cloture was \ninvoked on proceeding, 95 Senators voted to get on the bill, only 3 \nvoted against it.\n  Senators on both sides said they want to have amendments, and we \nshould have amendment votes. I am willing to have amendment votes on \nthis and other things. Let's talk about this today.\n  I want to have votes on the conditions that Senator McConnell has so \nfrequently stated, a 60-vote threshold. The idea of a 60-vote threshold \nwill not come as a surprise to anyone in this Chamber, I don't think, \nbecause I wish to take a minute outlining direct quotes from my friend \nthe Republican leader.\n  No. 1: Now, look, we know that on controversial matters in the \nSenate, it has for quite some time required 60 votes.\n  No. 2: Requiring 60 votes, particularly on matters of importance, is \nnot at all unusual. It is the way the Senate operates.\n  No. 3: Matters of this level of controversy require 60 votes, so I \nwill ask my friend [referring to me] if he would modify his consent \nrequest to set the threshold for this vote at 60.\n  Again he said: For him to suggest that a matter of this magnitude in \na body of 60 votes for almost everything is going to be done with 51 \nvotes makes no sense at all.\n  And he said: So it is not at all unusual that the President's \nproposal of this consequence would have to achieve 60 votes. That is \nthe way virtually all business is done in the Senate, certainly not \nextraordinarily unusual.\n  Finally he said, quite recently: Mr. President, I can only quote my \ngood friend [again referring to me] who repeatedly has said--most \nrecently that in the Senate, as has been the case, we need 60 votes. It \nrequires 60 votes, certainly on measures that are controversial.\n  So let's make this pretty simple. We are going to have the ability to \noffer germane amendments, and we will follow the McConnell rule and \nwill have 60 votes on them. It seems fair.\n  That is my consent request, and I would ask that it be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, what I think I hear the \nmajority leader saying is that any amendment offered by any Republican \nis controversial and thus must require 60 votes.\n  It was my hope we could get forward on this appropriations bill with \na full and open amendment process and a reasonable number of amendments \nfrom both sides.\n  The only restrictions on amendments to this bill are those in the \nStanding Rules of the Senate, which create a requirement that the \namendments deal with an appropriations matter or, if legislative in \nnature, have a defense of germaneness to one of the underlying House \nappropriations bills.\n  Chairman Mikulski has been determined to try to get us back to \nregular order in considering appropriations bills.\n  In 2011, just a couple of years ago, we considered this same \nappropriations package--the very one we are considering now under the \nregular order--and all Senators, Democrat and Republican, were treated \nfairly--just 3 years ago.\n  Today's Senate is a totally different place. The majority leader has \nblocked all but nine rollcall votes on Republican amendments since July \nof last year. That is about a year ago.\n  By contrast, during that same period, House Democrats got 153 \namendments, rollcall votes, over that same period of time. That is in \nthe House where you would think it would be hard for the minority to \nget amendments.\n  In fact, one Member of Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee from Houston, has \nhad 15 amendments herself. Sheila Jackson Lee has had more votes over \nthe past year than Senate Republicans. In fact, the House seems to have \nturned into the Senate and the Senate seems to have turned into the \nHouse.\n  The gag rule, as was pointed out by Senator Alexander and others this \nmorning in an appropriations meeting, seems to now apply to committee \nmeetings as well. So not only do we not get votes on the floor, we \ndon't get votes in committee either.\n  They cancelled the scheduled markup on the Energy and Water bill, I \nassume out of concern that some Republican amendment might, my \ngoodness, actually pass with Democratic support. So we are being shut \nout of amendments in committee as well as on the floor.\n  When do we start legislating again? What has happened to the Senate?\n  Therefore, I would ask unanimous consent that the proposed agreement \nby the majority leader be modified so that all amendments be considered \nunder the regular order, Chairman Mikulski and Ranking Member Shelby, \nand move this bill across the floor in a bipartisan manner exactly as \nwe did it on the very same bill back in 2011.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, my friend the Republican \nleader is obviously not in contact with what is going on around here. \nThis doesn't apply to Republican amendments, it applies to Republican \nor Democratic amendments--as all of his requests, which are in the \nrecord and I read.\n  A reasonable number of amendments he wants. Fine. That is what we \nwant too. We want to have a reasonable number of amendments on this \nbill and move it forward. It is important we get this done.\n\n  I have served in the House of Representatives--not without going into \na lot of detail here, as the Presiding Officer has served in the House \nof Representatives. The rules there are totally different. Of course, \nthere are a lot of votes because every vote is predetermined in the \nHouse, with rare exception, because the Rules Committee sets the \nboundaries of what happens. So over in the House the majority never \nloses.\n  Here the Senate is the way it is. We are willing to do votes as the \nRepublican leader has stated time and time again we should do it. I \ndisagree, but as he has said, this is the way the Senate operates now. \nI wish it didn't, but it does and that is the way we should proceed.\n  I am willing to move forward on this bill. We should have a 60-vote \nthreshold, and I think that would be the appropriate thing to do.\n  Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nRepublican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend the majority leader always reminds me he \ngets the last word, and I am sure he will have something to say \nfurther, but let me briefly say that during this same period, going \nback to last July, Senate Democrats have only had seven rollcall votes. \nCongresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, in the minority in the House, has had \n15 rollcall votes over the last year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. The House is different than the Senate. There is no \nquestion about that. We could have on this bill a lot more than seven \nvotes, so we should do that.\n  Would the Chair state the business that is before this body?\n\n\n                       Vote on Nichols Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Brian A. \nNichols, of\n\n[[Page S3845]]\n\nRhode Island, a career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, Class of \nMinister-Counselor, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary \nof the United States of America to the Republic of Peru?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n\n                      Vote on McWatters Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of J. Mark \nMcWatters, of Texas, to be a Member of the National Credit Union \nAdministration Board for a term expiring August 2, 2019?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n\n                       Vote on Wormuth Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Christine E. \nWormuth, of Virginia, to be Under Secretary of Defense for Policy?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motions to \nreconsider are considered made and laid upon the table, and the \nPresident will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today, due to tornados and severe storms in \nSouth Dakota, which resulted in significant damage to homes and \nbusinesses in my State, I was traveling back to South Dakota to survey \nthe damage and meet with local leaders coordinating response efforts \nduring the scheduled vote. Had I been present for today's vote on the \nconfirmation of Executive Calendar No. 770, Gustavo Velasquez Aguilar, \nof the District of Columbia, to be an Assistant Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Devopment, I would have voted nay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3845-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield that time back.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to claim those 9 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. If she wants to use the time, please do.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before we move to the adoption of the \nmotion to proceed on CJS appropriations, if in fact we do so, I wish to \nspeak as the chairperson of the Appropriations Committee and the chair \nof the subcommittee on CJS.\n  I am really sad about what has happened here. I am really sad we \ncouldn't find a way to proceed to bring up these three outstanding \nbills.\n  I note that what we wanted to bring to the floor was the Commerce-\nJustice-Science bill, the Agriculture bill, and Transportation, Housing \nand Urban Development.\n  There are significant policy differences even on each one of those \nbills, whether it is truck requirements, whether it is school \nnutrition, whether it is environmental--important discussions and \ndecisions on the environmental protection.\n  On my own CJS bill, we are going to really lose a lot. You know, I \nhad money in this bill--working with Senator Shelby--for bulletproof \nvests for cops to protect those who protect us and more money for \ndomestic violence to be able to protect those in their own homes. I \nhave also added more money to work with those people who have been rape \nvictims, doubly assaulted by the system where they are not only raped \nby a perpetrator, but the very system didn't process the forensic \nevidence that would have validated the guilty party or even ascertained \nthat there was a serial rapist.\n  Agriculture fed the hungry in this country and fed the hungry around \nthe world. And of course transportation and housing both created jobs, \nsolved problems in physical infrastructure, and also at the same time \nmet compelling human needs in our housing. Particularly, I note the \nitems such as housing for the elderly and the economic development.\n  I am not going to take my full 9 minutes, but I would hope that at \nthe end of today we figure out how we could have another day.\n  I know on both sides of the aisle in the Appropriations Committee \nitself, those subcommittee chairmen really worked hard to produce \nbills. As of today, we have moved six bills out of our full committee \nand are pending on the floor. But now we have to truly arrive at a set \nof rules for the road on how we can proceed to bring these bills to the \nfloor. I really hope we can do so.\n  There has been so much good will on both sides of the aisle and also \non both sides of the aisle a really incredible effort to be able to \nmeet the needs of our country, to have a more frugal government and a \nreally, truly civil process.\n  So this day will come to an end. But I really hope that the \nAppropriations Committee coming to the floor doesn't die today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I know there are others who wish to speak, \nand if they want to use time remaining postcloture, fine; otherwise, I \nyield the time back, and the floor will be open for everybody. But I \nneed to do that first. So, does anyone want to speak for the 2 minutes \nremaining on this?\n  I ask unanimous consent that all time postcloture be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3845-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3845-S3847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         BIPARTISAN SPORTSMEN'S ACT OF 2014--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 384, \nS. 2363.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 384, S. 2363, a bill to \n     protect and enhance opportunities for recreational hunting, \n     fishing, and shooting, and other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I know my friend from Tennessee is on \nthe floor and would like to make a few observations. I would just very \nbriefly make the following point ahead of him.\n  Another way of looking at the way the Senate is being run that \naffects Democratic Senators:\n  Democratic House Members from Oregon have had 12 rollcall votes on \ntheir amendments, but Oregon's Democratic Senator does not have any--\nnone. Democratic House Members from Virginia have gotten 11 rollcall \nvotes on their amendments, but Virginia's two Democratic Senators have \ngotten none--zero. Democratic House Members from Colorado have gotten \nseven rollcall votes on their amendments, but the Democratic Senators \nfrom Colorado have gotten none--zero. Democratic House Members from \nCalifornia have gotten 37 rollcall votes on their amendments, but \nCalifornia's Democratic Senators have gotten none--zero.\n  So that is the condition of the Senate today. It is not just \naffecting the Republican minority, but the Democratic majority as well.\n  I see Senator Alexander is on the floor. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, let me see if I can say something \nthat contributes to progress, especially while the Senator from \nMaryland, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, is on the \nfloor.\n  She has really done a terrific job in working with the Republican and \nDemocratic leaders to try to get us back to the business of \nappropriating. We are not that far away. We have three bills ready to \ncome to the floor. We have consent on the Republican side--which had to \nbe unanimous over here to be able to bring it up in this way.\n  Now we have a difference of opinion between the two leaders about \nwhether all the amendments ought to be 60 votes. I would respectfully \nsuggest that is not the norm.\n  It is true that the Republican leader has said many times that an \nimportant amendment ought to be 60 votes. Recently when we were working \non the\n\n[[Page S3846]]\n\nChild Care and Development Block Grant or some other legislation, we \nwould say the norm is 51 votes. But for a nongermane amendment, or if \nit was an especially controversial amendment, then maybe it would be 60 \nvotes. That was a matter of negotiation.\n  So my hope is that we could move through these appropriations bills \nin the normal way, which would mean most votes would be 51. \nOccasionally, there might be a 60-vote vote. That is what we usually \nhave done. That is what we historically have done. The majority party \nhas 55 members last time I checked. It has a President who can veto \nanything, and it takes 67 to override him. So they have plenty of \nadvantages on their side.\n  Now, let me conclude in this way--and I said it this morning in our \nAppropriations Committee. Last week I was visiting with some Senators \nand an Ambassador. We had dinner at the home of an ambassador from a \ncountry who greatly admires the United States. He was saying how much \nhe envies this great tribunal--the Senate, and how other countries in \nthe world envy it, and how it is the only tribunal like this anywhere \nin the world that is set up to have extended debate on important issues \nuntil we reach a consensus and stop debate and come to a result.\n  That is the history of the civil rights bill, the Medicare bill, and \nthe student loan bill last year, and bills even more recently than \nthat.\n  What that means in very simple terms is that the majority decides \nwhat we are going to talk about, the minority decides what amendments \nit would like to offer, and we keep talking and keep talking until it \nis time to cut off debate and try to come to a result. That is what we \nshould be doing.\n  I would respectfully say that this business of not being willing to \nvote on amendments because it might hurt some individual Senator is not \nreally worthy of the Senate. It is not practical, and it really doesn't \nmake that much difference in campaigns.\n  The idea that only 9 Republican amendments have received votes out of \nmore than 800 amendments offered since last July is probably a record \nin the Senate. What is even worse is that--according to the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, who has counted these--there were only 7 Democratic \namendments voted on out of nearly 700 offered since last July.\n  Now, why are we here if we are not here to speak on behalf of our \nconstituents about Benghazi, about the new health care law, about \nwhether we need a college rating system from Washington, DC, about \nfixing No Child Left Behind?\n  I remember in Senator Byrd's book he talked about the Panama Canal \nTreaty that he and Senator Baker marshaled through. It took 67 votes--a \nvery divisive issue. He said: We allowed nearly 200 amendments, \nreservations, and other codicils to the amendments, and we killed them \nall. We beat them all. But, he said: We never would have gotten the \ntreaty ratified if we hadn't allowed Senators to have their say.\n  So we have gotten to this level of distrust between that side and \nthis side. And most of us are trying over here to say: All we want is \nan opportunity to have amendments offered in the regular order, a \nchance to debate them and a chance to vote on them, and if we are \ndefeated, so be it. To impose a gag rule on us imposes a gag rule on \nthe people who sent us here. This morning in the Appropriations \nCommittee, that gag rule moved from the Senate floor to the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  If the Republicans were in charge of the Senate, the Democrats \nwouldn't put up with that. I don't know why they are putting up with it \ntoday.\n  I know there is distrust on both sides. But we are very close to a \nsituation where we have three major appropriations bills which are on \nthe floor. We have a disagreement only about whether all amendments \nought to require 60 votes. That has not been the norm before. We should \nbe able to work that out and use our time to represent the people of \nthe United States so that ambassador, when he has another group of \nSenators out there, can say: You belong to the tribunal that is unique \nin the world that every country in the world wishes it had, because it \nis a forum--the only one in the world of this kind--where you have \nextended debate on major issues until you get a consensus and come to a \nresult.\n  That is the only way to govern a complex country like the country \nthat is the United States of America. We are getting back toward that, \nand I hope that our leaders and our Appropriations Committee members \ncan make the next few steps and let us all go to work like we aim to \ndo.\n  We have some pretty talented people here. We have Rhodes Scholars and \nformer Governors and people who have been here a long time and people \nwho have been here a short time. It is not easy to get here, and it is \nnot easy to stay here. So while we are here, we would like to work--\nwhich means we would like to speak, have our say, vote, and, if we can, \nget a result.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my friend from Tennessee is a fine man. He \nhas been a good Senator, a good member of a President's cabinet, and he \nreally has tried to be a peacemaker all the time I have known him. But \nhis speech that he just gave could be given by any Democrat about the \nobstruction, the delay, the diversions that have taken place during the \nentire time President Obama has been President.\n  We have never had to file cloture on every motion to proceed as we \ndid on this one, as we have done on everything that comes along.\n  So we can talk about where we have been, but I think we should talk \nabout where we are. Everyone knows that, because of the Republicans, \nthere has been a threshold of 60 votes.\n  But I say to my friend from Tennessee: I asked for my consent \nagreement. He says we are very close. With his skills of negotiating \ncompromises, I am willing to listen to something else if he has a \nbetter idea to change the McConnell 60-vote threshold rule. I have some \nideas myself, but perhaps they should come from him. I, on behalf of my \ncaucus, am entirely agreeable to listen to any reasonable counteroffer.\n  We have been trying really hard to get things done, but every step we \ntake is a stalling tactic. My friend talked about ambassadors. I don't \nknow the exact count--I haven't gotten it for a day or two--but the \nlast count I had, 54 foreign ambassadors were held up. The continent of \nAfrica, up to a third of the countries there do not have a U.S. \nambassador. That doesn't count the scores of other people who are being \nheld up. Why are they being held up? They are being held up because we \nare now able to move judges. Ambassadors related to judges is nearly \nempty. We have a few district court judges, and we have a circuit court \njudge. They will report some more out. But in an effort to--use \nwhatever term you want--``We will show you guys. You are going to get \nyour judges, and we are not going to give you any other nominations.'' \nSo we are working through those very slowly.\n\n  As much as I care and respect the Senator from Tennessee, he does not \nneed to lecture me about stalling around here. We are not. If they want \nto beat the record of eight or nine amendments--however many it is--\nmove this bill. They will have lots of amendments. And we can start \ndoing that this afternoon.\n  So, Madam President, I repeat now for the third time: If my friend \nfrom Tennessee has a better idea on moving forward--he says we are so \nclose--I am willing to listen to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to say to my friend from \nTennessee that the majority leader has offered a way forward, and he \nhas taken a page out of the book of the Republican leader, and he \nquoted him, and I have those quotes here: ``Matters of controversy \nalways require 60 votes.'' And my friend knows. He knows.\n  I stand here as the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. I am so grateful I have moved some bills through here--\nhighway bills, water bills--but my friend knows that the two big \namendments that his side wants to offer don't deal with ordinary \nmatters. They deal with matters that have jurisdiction in the \nenvironment committee, and they deal with a repeal of parts of the \nClean Air Act and a repeal of parts of the Clean Water Act.\n  So my friend wants to move forward. I am sure he would agree that to \nrepeal\n\n[[Page S3847]]\n\nparts of landmark laws on an appropriations bill is legislating on \nappropriations and ought to require 60 votes. It is wrong.\n  Now, I would say to my friend, why is the other side so determined to \nrepeal two laws--one dealing with the Clean Water Act and the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, and then the other one is this Clean Air Act--why \nare my friends on the other side continuing to go against these \nlandmark laws--which, by the way, were signed into law by a Republican \nPresident? He has to explain, because I don't understand why people \nwant to put children at risk and families at risk, pollute our rivers \nand streams, and suspend a plan that the President has announced is \ngoing to save thousands of lives, going after carbon pollution, making \nsure we don't go back to the days of smog and ozone. And we know these \nare the riders that my Republican friends want to offer. There is no \nsecret.\n  The Republican leader defined the 60-vote threshold for controversial \namendments. I can assure my friend that if there was a tweak or two \nthat was going to be made and Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby \nagreed with it, I would not demand 60 votes.\n  We are talking about repealing basic, important landmark provisions \nof environmental laws, and that is exactly what this is about.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the gentlelady yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be happy to yield, yes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Because I was listening to what she said. Senator Reid \nproposed a 60-vote threshold on amendments to our appropriations bill. \nIt was rejected. OK. The Senator said now she wouldn't object----\n  Mrs. BOXER. To a 60-vote threshold, no.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. On all amendments? Could the Senator clarify?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I would say----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. In other words, the Senator does want a 60-vote \nthreshold or is it----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would go with the Mitch McConnell rule, which he has \nstated seven times, which is that on controversial amendments we have \nto have 60 votes. I am not going to stand here----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. So the Senator would want----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just want to answer my friend.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Sure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend said we are trying to spare people tough votes. \nThat is ridiculous. Members on your side, Members on our side--we are \ngrownup Senators. We know how to win elections, cast tough votes. I \nwant to protect the American people, and so do a lot of folks on our \nside of the aisle. And we don't want to see majority rule to repeal \nlandmark environmental laws. We are not going to stand for it, and \nneither would the minority leader in the way he describes it. He said \nover and over that on amendments of controversy we have to have a 60-\nvote threshold.\n  So my friend, if he is sincere about this--he is sincere about this. \nBut if the two chairmen can come up with a plan where amendments like \nthis, controversial amendments, require 60 but amendments that both \nsides feel are not controversial can go to a voice vote, I will be a \nhappy person. I have gotten bills through here before. I wasn't born \nyesterday, as you can probably tell, and we know a controversial \namendment from a noncontroversial amendment.\n  So I will close with this: I know my friend Senator Mikulski is an \nincredible chairman, and with Richard Shelby working with her, they are \nquite the duo. And I have seen their work--because every single Member \ncares about the work they do--and it is stellar. But I am not going to \nsit here and see amendments come to the floor that would repeal clean \nair, clean water, safe drinking water, and just nod approval and say: \nOh yeah, just take it away. No big deal. That is it.\n  And that is why I feel the majority leader was right when he said \nlet's move forward with a 60-vote threshold. That makes a lot of sense. \nI am sorry the Republicans objected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to continue \nand finish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have been really interested in this \ndebate. Let's just be honest about it. The Senate is being run in a \nshoddy fashion. I don't care which side you are on. I have only been \nhere 38 years, and I have never seen a bigger mess than we have right \nnow. I have never seen the majority stifling amendments by the minority \nlike we have right now. I have never seen cloture filed almost \nimmediately when a bill is brought up, like we are filibustering when \nwe are not. All we want are amendments and to have a vote up or down--\nsomething we always gave the Democrats on crucial bills like this one. \nIt is pathetic, and it has to change.\n  Frankly, if the American people really knew--we have had nine \namendments since last July that we voted on. The Democrats have had \nonly seven. Now, even some of my Democratic friends are up in arms \nabout it. They are not able to act as Senators. They are not able to do \nthe work. They are not able to be part of it. I mean, my gosh, is \nprotecting your side from the election--is that more important than \nhaving the Senate run the way it should? The answer to that is a \nresounding no.\n  This is pathetic. I have never seen anything like it. To come out \nhere and act holier-than-thou about it, as if it is just normal around \nhere, is just plain wrong, and everybody knows it. That is the thing \nthat just kills me.\n  If we were doing that, if we were in the majority, my gosh, the whole \nworld would be coming down on us, especially with the beloved media we \nhave in this country--and rightly so if we were pulling the kinds of \nthe stunts that are being pulled on the Democratic side.\n  Look, I am tired of it. I know Democrats who are tired of it. Every \nRepublican is tired of it. We are being treated as though we don't \ncount in this battle--in this battle between the two parties in the \nSenate. It doesn't have to be a battle every time. Both sides have been \nwrong from time to time but nothing like this. This is pathetic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3847-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3847-S3855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRS INVESTIGATION\n\n  Madam President, about a year ago the American people learned that \nthe IRS--one of the most feared and powerful agencies in our \ngovernment--had engaged in political targeting. There is no doubt about \nthat. Specifically, we learned that the IRS had, by its own admissions, \nsingled out individual conservative groups applying for tax-exempt \nstatus for harassment and extra scrutiny during the runup to the 2010 \nand 2012 elections, and the IRS admits it--at least some in the IRS \nadmit it. Needless to say, the American people were outraged when this \nnews became public, and the IRS's credibility was seriously damaged.\n  We saw numerous groups and individuals come forward to acknowledge \nthat they had been targeted. Politicians across the political spectrum, \nincluding the President of the United States, condemned these actions \nand vowed to get to the bottom of it.\n  In the many months since the targeting scandal was revealed, I have \nsaid numerous times that the most important objective for the IRS and \nits leadership consisted of repairing its reputation with the American \npeople. For a while there, it appeared as though the agency was serious \nabout doing that. Sadly, over the last few days a new chapter in this \nscandal has been opened, and as a result the IRS's credibility has \ntaken yet another serious hit.\n  For more than a year the Senate Finance Committee has been engaged in \na bipartisan investigation into the targeting scandal. During most of \nthat time we were under the impression that the IRS was acting in \nrelative good faith to cooperate with our inquiry. As of last week we \nbelieved we were close to completing our investigation. We had prepared \nthe bipartisan majority report and the majority and minority views in \naddition. We were about ready to come out with that. The facts, we \nbelieved, were coming together. Then, in what I thought would be one of \nthe last steps in the investigation, I insisted that we send a letter \nto IRS Commissioner John Koskinen demanding that he formally certify \nthat the agency had produced\n\n[[Page S3848]]\n\nall documents that were relevant to our requests. It was then--after we \nsent that notice to them asking them to verify--that we learned there \nwas an enormous hole in our factfinding. I am sure glad we sent the \nletter.\n  On Friday of last week the IRS informed us that due to a hard drive \ncrash, it was unable to produce thousands of pages of emails from Lois \nLerner--the one who took the fifth amendment--the former Director of \nExempt Organizations and one of the central figures, by anybody's \nestimation, if not the central figure, in this investigation. The gap \nin the emails was from 2009 through April 2011--a pivotal time in the \nactivities under investigation.\n  You heard that right, Madam President. A full year after our initial \ninvestigation request or information request, the IRS informed us that \na huge chunk of relevant emails was mysteriously gone.\n  Needless to say, this was disturbing. That is why Chairman Wyden and \nI demanded to meet with Commissioner Koskinen on Monday of this week. \nSadly, this meeting produced even more bad news.\n  The first thing we learned during the course of this meeting was that \nMs. Lerner's emails were not going to be reproduced. The IRS's \nredundancy operations were apparently insufficient to ensure that these \nemails would be saved in the event of a hard drive crash. According to \nCommissioner Koskinen, the IRS only saves emails on its servers for 6 \nmonths. Get that. The IRS only saves emails on its computer servers for \n6 months. Now, they require you and me and everybody else to save at \nleast 3 years of our tax returns, but they only--according to them--\nwere saving emails on their servers for 6 months. I don't know about \nyou, but I have a rough time believing that. I cannot believe it. That \nis what they do.\n  The next thing we learned is that officials at the IRS became aware \nof this gap in Ms. Lerner's emails as early as February of this year \nand that the Commissioner was made aware of the hard drive crash about \n3 weeks or more prior to our meeting--he wasn't quite sure, but \nsometime around the end of March or the first part of April, is my \nrecollection, but certainly more than 3 weeks before our meeting. It \nwas never made clear to us why it took at the very least 3 weeks and a \nletter from us demanding a signed certification from the Commissioner \nfor the IRS to inform the Finance Committee that the emails were \nmissing. As of right now we still don't know why the agency failed to \ninform us immediately that the emails were gone.\n  The IRS was more willing to share this information with others in the \nadministration. Yesterday we learned that by April the IRS had already \nnotified Treasury that some of Ms. Lerner's emails appeared to be \nmissing. We also learned that in April Treasury informed the White \nHouse of this development, but they didn't inform us. The IRS has \noffered no explanation of why they waited 2 more months to inform \nCongress--and particularly the Senate Finance Committee, which is the \ncrucial committee here in the Senate which was performing an active \ninvestigation into this very issue. You haven't heard from either me or \nthe chairman, Senator Wyden, popping off about this. We conducted a \nreasonably good investigation, doing everything we thought we could do \nwithout mouthing off about it.\n\n  Moreover, we do not know what discussions have taken place since \nApril between the White House, Treasury, and the IRS about the lost \nemails.\n  That would be bad enough, but it gets worse.\n  After our meeting on Monday, we were surprised to learn, via a press \nrelease from the House Ways and Means Committee, that even more emails \nrelevant to our investigation may be missing. Apparently the IRS had \ninformed the Ways and Means Committee, but not us, knowing we were \nconducting an investigation, that it might have lost the emails for six \nIRS employees, all of whom were covered by the Finance Committee's \ndocument requests. Think about that.\n  One of these employees is reported to be Nikole Flax, who was the \nchief of staff to former Acting Commissioner Steve Miller. In that role \nMs. Flax helped oversee the processing of tax-exempt applications. From \nour investigation, we also know that she directly dealt with the White \nHouse and the Office of Management and Budget on a number of issues.\n  It seems there is an epidemic of hard-drive crashes going on at the \nIRS, and it seems to be particularly focused on individuals relevant to \nthe targeting scandal and the ongoing congressional investigations. \nChairman Wyden and I just wanted to get to the truth on these matters, \nbut it is going to be difficult to ever get there now.\n  Needless to say, it is very troubling that even more emails might be \nmissing and may never be recovered. It is also troubling that neither \nCommissioner Koskinen nor his staff thought they should reveal this \ninformation to Chairman Wyden and myself during our long conversation \nearlier this week. They knew about it, but they didn't tell the people \nwho were conducting the investigation about it at all.\n  It is obvious from the timing of the revelations that people in that \nroom were aware of the additional missing emails. Yet it didn't occur \nto any of them that they should disclose this information to the \nchairman and ranking member of the only Senate committee with oversight \nauthority over this agency.\n  As I said, the Finance Committee was getting close to completing its \ninvestigation last week. We were getting close to issuing our report, \nand we were moving forward under the assumption that the IRS had been \ncooperating. It took me a week to read the bipartisan report and the \nmajority and minority views that were added to it--not because I am a \nslow reader, but because I was interrupted all day long every day. I \nhad to set aside various times when I could read it. We were moving \nforward under the assumption that the IRS had been honestly \ncooperating--we thought. Now we have to ask ourselves whether we can \ntrust any of the statements coming out of this agency.\n  Our investigation is important. We need to have a full and complete \naccount of what went on at the IRS during the 2010 and 2012 election \ncampaigns. Sadly, it seems that in order to get such an account, we are \ngoing to need to also delve into what has gone on at the IRS during the \nmonths the agency was supposedly trying to respond to our reasonable \ndocument requests.\n  One way or another, I am going to get to the bottom of this, and I am \nprepared to take any steps that are necessary to do so. We need to get \nto closure on what the facts are before we can close out the \ninvestigation. Otherwise, the conclusions in the investigation will be \nbased on a faulty factual premise.\n  Earlier today, I sent a letter to Commissioner Koskinen demanding to \nknow what he knew about the additional missing emails and why the \nchairman and I were not informed about them during our meeting this \nlast Monday. He had three others with him, and at least one of them \nfully knew about the additional six hard drives that crashed.\n  I am not naive. I do a lot in the IT world, and I can tell you this: \nThese are the first hard drives that crashed--that I have known about--\nthat some of our IT, information technology, experts could not get into \nand find some of the data. That is possible but not probable in seven \ndifferent cases. Once again, it appears that either the Commissioner or \nhis staff were less than forthcoming in the meeting and someone needs \nto be held responsible.\n  This is important. If we can't trust these agencies to be truthful to \ncongressional leaders, we have serious problems. This letter is only \nthe first step. More action needs to be taken. There needs to be an \nindependent review of the fiasco surrounding all of these lost emails \nand crashed servers.\n  We need an independent arbiter to determine if the agency's account \nof the computer problems is accurate and whether the relevant emails \nare, in fact, unrecoverable. We also need a review to determine if \nthere are more missing emails. As I said, this review needs to be \nindependent as we apparently can't trust the IRS to be fully \nforthcoming on these issues. This is what we are going to need to get \nto the bottom of it, but sadly, even that won't be enough.\n  The problem with these missing emails is that we won't have any \nassurances that we will ever get a complete\n\n[[Page S3849]]\n\npicture of what went on. We need to take the necessary steps to find \nout what communications these individuals were making during the time \nin question.\n  We have received many of these employees' emails from the IRS because \nfor obvious reasons they tended to include the email addresses of other \nIRS employees. However, what we don't have are emails sent by these \nindividuals to parties outside the IRS. If the computer problems at the \nagency have indeed made these emails impossible to recover on the IRS's \nend, the only way to recover them is to extend the inquiry to agencies \noutside the IRS.\n  Let me say, this is a mess. Honestly, I don't see how any reasonable \nperson cannot conclude that there is a very real possibility that \nsomething is wrong in Washington, something is wrong at the IRS, \nsomething is wrong at Treasury, and something is wrong at the White \nHouse.\n  Communications to agencies such as the Treasury Department, Justice \nDepartment, and the Federal Election Commission are all relevant, as \nare emails sent to the White House.\n  I plan to send document requests to all of these parties, asking them \nto produce any communications they received from the seven IRS \nemployees whose emails have been lost.\n\n  Of course, in an ideal world none of this would be necessary, but we \nare not living in an ideal world. Instead, we are living in a world \nwhere apparently hard drives crash every day and administration \nofficials decide to withhold information from congressional \ninvestigators. As a result, additional steps are necessary in order for \nthe truth to finally come out.\n  In conclusion, I want to make one thing clear. While I am angered and \ndisappointed by this recent turn of events, I am not the aggrieved \nparty here. That unfortunate distinction belongs to the American \npeople.\n  Once again, the IRS is one of the most powerful and feared agencies \nin our government. It is one that millions of Americans have to deal \nwith on a daily basis. The American people have a right to expect this \nagency will conduct itself in a fair manner without regard to parties \nand politics, and that trust was broken last year when the targeting \nscandal was made public.\n  Now, a year later, after all the work we have done to hold this \nagency accountable and to get to the bottom of these matters, that \ntrust has been broken again.\n  I have to say that Chairman Wyden has been very good on these \nmatters. He has tried to be bipartisan in every way, and I personally \nappreciate it. I think he will continue to work in a bipartisan way as \nwe try to get the real facts about all of these matters.\n  It is a shame, but once again I am going to get to the bottom of this \none way or the other. It is going to be difficult because it appears \nthat going forward we will not be able to trust anything the IRS says \nto Congress. That is why we are going to have to bring other parties \ninto the inquiry. This is unfortunate. As I said, this is the world we \nare living in.\n  I am discouraged about this. I mean, the administration knows I am as \nfair as a person can be on our side, and all I want to do is get to the \nfacts and the truth and resolve these problems in the best interest of \nthe American people.\n  Why some of these were not brought up when they were known is beyond \nme. It is beyond me that only after we sent a letter saying: Will you \nverify this is everything, then all of a sudden there were other emails \nthat were found, but not from these servers, and not for 2 years in the \ncase of the Lois Lerner server.\n  Lois Lerner took the Fifth Amendment, which is her right. I am not \nabout to condemn her as a guilty criminal around here, but I think the \nbest thing she could have done was help provide these emails that would \nhopefully exonerate her, but I believe would not. Otherwise I don't \nthink there would have been a crash of the computer.\n  What really bothers me is this too: When computers in the Federal \nGovernment crash, they usually have backups, and the backups will allow \nus to get the computer up and working. For some reason there apparently \nwere not backups here either. Not only that, they were only keeping \ntrack of the prior 6 months, so you would have never gotten the 2 years \nno matter what you did if the computer crashed. But we don't have those \n2 years, which were relevant years, in anybody's estimation.\n  There is something rotten in Washington. I am not sure who is \nresponsible for it. I have to say I like Mr. Koskinen. I helped put him \nthrough in a very ready fashion and got him confirmed. I believed he \nwas telling us the truth. But I am disturbed that the only way we even \ngot the rest of the available emails--none from 2009 to 2011. And who \nknows, as to the other six servers, how many of those crashed and how \nmany of those emails are gone forever.\n  The administration will say, well, we did look at the addresses and \nwe got the emails in some respect from some of the people they were \nsent to, but that is not what the real investigation would show \neither. They don't have a bit of an excuse here. It just makes one \nwonder, why did Lois Lerner take the protections of the Fifth \nAmendment? Why has not the administration been outraged as much as we \nare? I can say I believe our distinguished chairman is as outraged as I \nam. I can't speak for him, naturally, but I know him, and he is as \nupset as I am because we sat right there last Monday and they never \ntold us about the six servers. As far as I know, they disposed of the \ncrashed server of Lois Lerner. So nobody will ever be able to examine \nit and determine whether there is the possibility of getting the emails \nfor that crucial period between 2009 and 2011, which is probably the \nmost crucial period of the whole investigation.\n\n  Now Senator Wyden and I have to rework our report on this, and \nhopefully we can do that, even though we don't have all the information \nthat anybody with common decency would expect us to have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, we all continue to follow the events in \nIraq that have significant national security implications for the \nUnited States now and in the years to come. The President spoke on this \nissue a few moments ago, and I wish to share a few thoughts before we \nreturn to our States for the next few days and then come back to \nWashington early next week to continue our work.\n  The first thing I wish to say about this issue of Iraq is, while I \ncertainly respect those Members who have served in this body and those \ncommentators who have either served in government and now are out and \nothers who have strong opinions about the decisions that were made \nregarding Iraq in the past, I would say I hope what we spend our time \naround here doing during this process is focused on what is happening \nnow and what lies ahead. That doesn't mean there shouldn't be a debate \nabout the decisions made in 2003 and beyond. Those are important \ndebates to have, primarily because we learn from history. We learn from \nthe successes and the mistakes, but I think we are spending a lot of \ntime around this process these days talking about the past. We have the \nrest of history to debate who was right and who was wrong with regard \nto the war in 2003 or the surge thereafter. I have strong opinions \nabout it, and we should certainly spend time talking about that so we \ncan learn from it and so we can apply it to new decisions that are \nbeing made, for example, in Afghanistan, but I would hope that 90 to 95 \npercent of what we spend our time on is talking about how to deal with \nthis threat now--the one that is right before us.\n  The President today announced--and it is going to be covered--that \nthey are going to send close to 300 additional American trainers and \nadvisers into Iraq. I have no direct objection to that decision. I am \nhopeful, however, that it is but the first step in a multistep process \nin this counterterrorism risk we now face. I am hopeful what this is \ndesigned to do is set the framework for the United States to achieve a \nnumber of important goals that directly impact the national security of \nthe United States.\n  The first, of course, is I believe the United States, working in \nconjunction\n\n[[Page S3850]]\n\nwith others in the region, needs to do everything we can to cut off \nISIL's supply lines. Many people may not be fully aware of this, but \nISIL or ISIS--the same group involved in Syria--is not simply a bunch \nof Sunni Syrians or Sunni Iraqis; these are foreign fighters, including \nhundreds who are estimated to have come from the West, who have flocked \nto Syria and now Iraq to participate in this fight.\n  In addition, this group, in order to make the advances and the gains \nit is now making in Iraq, requires--as any force would--distinct supply \nlines that allow them to transport individuals and weapons and \nammunition, in addition to, by the way, the things they are now getting \ntheir hands on as they make these advances. So one of the goals the \nUnited States must have, working in conjunction with others, is to \nsever those supply lines so they cannot continue to make these gains.\n  Secondly, I hope what the President announced today as the beginning \nof a process will, in part, also focus on the command and control areas \nthey currently operate from within Syria. Without those safe havens, \nthey would not possibly be able to expand the reach they now have. So I \nhope, again, that what the President announced today is but a first \nstep toward a multistep process that allows us to address those two \nissues.\n  In addition, I think it is important to continue to revisit the issue \nof the opposition in Syria. When people read about the opposition in \nSyria, it is important to note there is no such thing as the \nopposition. There are a handful of groups operating within Syria \nagainst the Assad regime, but these groups also fight each other, and \nthere is a group of nonjihadists, nonradical terrorists who are \nfighting in Syria to topple Assad, but this group also takes on the al-\nNusra Front and ISIS. I have for many months now been calling on the \nadministration to do more to capacitate these groups, the nonjihadists. \nI felt it was a mistake not to do so early on because that actually \ncreated the possibility or the eventuality that now we face; that is, \nthat the best organized, best equipped, best trained groups in Syria \nhappen to be the most radical ones. That includes ISIL and of course \nal-Nusra. By the way, al-Nusra and ISIL fight each other, which adds \nfurther complexity.\n  Last but not least, I think it is important to spend a significant \namount of focus on helping our allies in Jordan. If we play out what is \nhappening--if, in fact, ISIS is able to erase this border between Syria \nand Iraq and establish this Sunni caliphate, their next move logically \nwill be to threaten the Kingdom of Jordan, an incredibly important ally \nto the United States, to the stability of the region, to Israel, and to \nothers. So we should continue to provide assistance to Jordan in \nprotecting their borders and their future.\n  These are four goals I hope we will continue to move toward, and I am \nhopeful that with the announcement the President made today, it is a \nfirst step as we work toward those goals.\n  A couple of points are important to make, and I do so every time I \naddress this issue of Iraq. The first is this is not about the United \nStates taking sides in a Sunni-Shia civil war. The future of Iraq \ndepends on the people of Iraq. It is up to them to establish a \ngovernment that functions. It is up to them to provide a secure and \nsafe country where people can prosper. It is up to them to create a \npolitical system and a social system where both Sunni and Shia feel as \nthough they have a voice in the governance of their country. This is \nnot about the United States stepping in and saying, We are on the Shia \nside. In fact, I can tell my colleagues that while this is not uniform, \nthere are many Sunnis within Iraq who do not necessarily sympathize \nwith ISIL and what they are doing. So this is not about the United \nStates engaging itself in a civil war.\n  This is also not about the United States trying to build a country. \nThis is not about the United States going into Iraq and saying, We have \nto rebuild Iraq. This is about counterterrorism and this is about the \nfuture security of the United States.\n  Every time I come to the floor, I remind everyone that the reason 9/\n11 was possible was because Al Qaeda was able to establish a safe haven \nin Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban, and from that safe \nhaven they raised money, they recruited, they plotted, they planned, \nand they ultimately carried out the most devastating terrorist attack \nin U.S. history, and we can never allow another similar safe haven to \ntake root.\n  This is especially true when the group trying to establish such a \nsafe haven--in fact, not just a safe haven but a caliphate run by a \nradical government--is a group whose expressed goal is to establish \nthat caliphate, to use it to terrorize the people of the United States \nby attacking us in the United States, in the hopes of driving us out of \nthe Middle East and then destroying Israel and establishing their brand \nof Islam and forcing it on all the peoples and countries of the region.\n  We cannot allow such a safe haven to take root. If they are \nsuccessful in their goal of creating a new country, a new State, this \nIslamic radical caliphate, we will have in the future grave risks and \npotentially severe and devastating terrorist attacks against Americans \nboth abroad and here in the homeland. This group has a very clear \nmandate. They have been very clear about what their goals are, but in \norder to carry that out successfully, they need an operational space, \nand we cannot allow them to create one in Iraq. That is what this issue \nis about. That is why this issue matters.\n  I know when I say what I have said, I open myself to those voices \nthat say there are warmongers and people who want to go back to war. \nAbsolutely not. On the contrary. What has happened is, after looking at \nthis issue, studying the lessons of the past 20 years and what we have \nlearned after 9/11 especially, it becomes evident to me that we are \ngoing to have to deal with this group. That is not what we are \ndebating. The issue before us that we have to decide is when do we deal \nwith them? Do we deal with them now, when they still have not created \nthat caliphate, or do we deal with them 5 or 10 years down the road \nwhen they have established a safe haven and significant operational \ncapacity? It is going to cost a lot more money, potentially many more \nlives and, in the process, significant terrorist attacks and terrorist \nrisks if we deal with it later. It will cost less money, be more \neffective, and be a lot less dangerous if we deal with it now.\n  That must be our goal, to not allow this group ISIS to establish a \nsafe haven of operation in Iraq, or in Syria for that matter, and then \ngive the people of Iraq the opportunity to decide a future for \nthemselves. That is important, which is why this issue of Iran is \nimportant.\n  I have been asked by reporters and others: Should we be working with \nIran? My opinion, based on all I have learned regarding this situation \nand based on factors that are obvious for anyone to see, is we do not \nshare the same goal Iran does. We don't have the same goal. Iran's goal \nis not simply to defeat ISIL. Iran's goal is to establish a Shia \ngovernment that oppresses Sunnis and that is responsive to them. That \nis their goal. What they want to set up in Iraq is a public government \nunder the control of Iran. That is not our goal, that should not be our \ngoal, and it never has been our goal.\n  Our goal is to ensure that a terrorist organization cannot establish \na safe haven, and our hope is that the Iraqi people can create for \nthemselves a government and a country where both Shia and Sunni can \nlive in peace and harmony among each other. That is up to them. We can \nhelp them do that, but we can't make them do that. What we can do is \neverything we can to ensure that this terrorist group doesn't take \nroot. So I think our goals are completely incompatible with Iran.\n  The other point I would make is we should not do anything to \nlegitimize that regime. That regime is the world's greatest State \nsponsor of terrorism. In virtually every continent on this planet, Iran \nhas a hand in sponsoring terrorism. So I am not sure how we could \npossibly work side by side to wipe out terrorism with a government that \nsponsors terrorism more than any other government on the planet. I \ncaution against that approach as well.\n  To close the loop, I hope we will spend most of our time focused on \nwhat we need to do now and in the future. We have forever to debate who \nwas right and who was wrong about the war in 2003 or the surge in 2007.\n  Also, I hope the announcement the President made today was the first\n\n[[Page S3851]]\n\nstep in a multistep process that will allow us to prevent ISIL from \nestablishing the kingdom, the caliphate, and the safe haven they seek. \nI hope we make clear to the American people what the stakes are for us, \nthat the reason we care about what is happening in Iraq is not because \nwe want to nation build or because we want to force any sort of \ngovernment on the people of Iraq. Their future belongs to them. It is \nbecause we cannot allow a terrorist group that has the stated goal and \nthe increasing capacity of attacking the United States to establish an \noperational space such as Afghanistan was for Al Qaeda before 9/11.\n  I hope we will continue to play the important role the Senate plays \nin speaking out and hoping to give guidance and advice to the Commander \nin Chief. But as I said yesterday, ultimately, the role of leading on \nthis matter corresponds to the President. Only the President of the \nUnited States can come up with a plan that hopefully all of us can \nunite behind because it is that important for our country and for our \nfuture and for our security.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the deteriorating \nsituation in Iraq. There has been considerable debate in recent days \nabout what we want to achieve in that country and the importance of \nachieving so-called political reconciliation in Baghdad. I wish to \npropose three simple principles that should guide any action we take in \nIraq.\n  No. 1, we should do everything possible to secure our people. No. 2, \nwe should defend our national security interests. No. 3, we should not \npartner with the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n  First and foremost, we need to be certain we are doing everything \nhumanly possible to secure the Americans who are still in Iraq. The \ninstability of the situation in the north of that country could quickly \ndevolve into nationwide chaos, and it requires our immediate attention.\n  We need to be developing and implementing an immediate plan to get \nout all nonessential American personnel, to get them to safety now. I \nam deeply concerned, as all of us should be, that our people on the \nground will become pawns in a sectarian conflict we cannot control. I \nam concerned the up to 275 marines who may be deployed to assist in \nembassy security, along with the 300 additional military advisers that \nPresident Obama announced today, will also become targets, isolated in \nBaghdad.\n  It is not at all reassuring to have the security in Baghdad provided \nby either Shia militias, loosely controlled by the al-Maliki \ngovernment, or by the Iranian Quds forces themselves or their agents. \nIf we have to rely on either to keep our people safe, we should not be \nthere. Let me repeat that. If we have to rely on either to keep our \npeople safe, we should not be there.\n  Second, we need to define and then to defend the national security \ninterests of the United States in Iraq. There has been extensive \ndiscussion of ``political reconciliation'' in Iraq and of making any \nAmerican military action contingent on achieving that ephemeral \nobjective. This makes no sense. Although a political solution to Iraq's \ntroubles may have been an appropriate goal in 2005 or 2011, it simply \nmay not be feasible in 2014. The time for this sort of argument would \nhave been 3 years ago when America was the most influential voice in \nBaghdad and we were completing our largest embassy on the planet on the \nbanks of the Tigris River.\n  But we chose to relinquish that influence when we did not \nsuccessfully negotiate a status-of-forces agreement with the Iraqis. \nMuch of the blame for that diplomatic impasse lies with the al-Maliki \ngovernment, but the Obama administration bears considerable \nresponsibility as well. The President campaigned on ``ending the war in \nIraq'' which he defined by removing all of our forces, not winning. So \nimmediate troop withdrawal, not negotiating a proper status-of-forces \nagreement, was the priority. In the words of Secretary Clinton on CNN \non Tuesday, ``We did not get it done.'' The result is that today we \nhave little or no influence in Baghdad.\n  It is not my purpose today to relitigate the history of U.S. \ninvolvement in Iraq but, rather, to propose what we can do with the \ncircumstances in which we find ourselves right now. Given our current \ncircumstances, any attempt to reconcile a Sunni-Shiite religious \nconflict that has waged for more than 1,500 years seems either the \nheight of hubris or naivete or both.\n  Rather than prioritizing an unachievable political solution we have \nno power to effect, it seems much more practical to focus on what is in \nthe actual national security interests of the United States of America. \nThe most acute security threat to the United States in Iraq is the \naggressive movement of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, \nforces out of Syria and into Iraq over the last 6 months. These vicious \nSunni fanatics may be relatively small in number, but they make up for \nit in shear brutality. Although President Obama dismissed their \naggression into Fallujah in January of this year as the terrorist \nequivalent of the ``junior varsity,'' recent events suggest they are of \na much higher capability.\n  Indeed, an obvious question the administration should answer is, has \nthe Obama administration ever armed ISIS? Has the administration given \nlethal weapons to ISIS? We are doing so to rebels who are fighting \nalongside ISIS in Syria. It is an obvious question to ask, whether we \nhave, in fact, armed these radical Islamic terrorists as well.\n  ISIS is much more than a local or even regional threat. They are \namong the worst of the radical jihadists who attacked us on September \n1, 2001, and again on September 11, 2012. They are so bad, in fact, \nthat the ``core Al Qaeda,'' as President Obama likes to call the \nterrorist cells in Pakistan and Afghanistan, have renounced them. Their \ngoal is to establish a new Islamic caliphate in the Middle East and \nnorthern Africa, from Syria to Iraq. They have publicly announced that \nwhen they achieve their ambition in Syria and Iraq, their goal is to \nmove on to Jordan, to Israel, and to the United States of America.\n  Because of their actions and their stated intent, it would seem a \ntargeted mission to seriously degrade the lethality of ISIS could well \nbe in the national security interests of the United States. Such an \naction would not require the commitment of American combat forces, but \nit would require a commitment from the Commander in Chief that this \naction would not be merely a symbolic message or an effort simply to \nperpetuate the al-Maliki government in Baghdad.\n  Instead, it would need to be an expeditious and emphatic \ndemonstration of America's ability to strike at the terrorists at the \ntime and means of our choosing. If the President needs to respond to an \nimminent threat to the national security interests of the United \nStates, or to act to an imminent threat to the lives of Americans in \nIraq, he has the constitutional authority to do so. However, Congress \nhas the constitutional authority to declare war. So if the President is \nplanning on launching a concerted offensive attack that is not \nconstrained by the exigency of the circumstances, he should come to \nCongress to seek and to receive authorization for the use of military \nforce. A precondition for any such mission in Iraq should be the utter \nrejection of any partnership with the Islamic Republic of Iran on which \nthe al-Maliki government is increasingly dependent.\n  Iran has been the implacable enemy of the United States since 1979, \nwhen revolutionaries took 54 American citizens hostage for 444 days, \nsome of the darkest days of our history. Earlier this year, Iran \ndemonstrated that this rapid anti-American hostility is alive and well \nby trying to get a U.S. visa for one of those hostage takers to serve \nas their Ambassador to the United Nations, to live in Manhattan with \ndiplomatic immunity. It was one of my proudest days in the Senate to \nintroduce the legislation countering this action that passed \nunanimously through both Houses of Congress, and that was signed into \nlaw by President Obama, stopping known terrorists from entering the \nUnited States.\n  When push comes to shove, the American people understand that Iran\n\n[[Page S3852]]\n\nis our enemy. We need to bring that same clarity, that same bipartisan \nunity to current circumstances in Iraq.\n  Just because Iran fears ISIS jihadists, it does not follow that we \nshould partner with them in this fight. The enemy of our enemy, in this \ninstance, is not our friend. If we cannot secure our people absent \nIranian involvement, we need to get them out. If we cannot strike ISIS \nin Iraq without Iranian involvement, then we need to look for another \nmeans of doing so.\n  ISIS consists of radical Islamist terrorists who seek to murder \nAmericans. Yet the Iranian regime has over and over demonstrated the \nsame hostile intent. Indeed, it is the leading sponsor of terrorism \nacross the world.\n  It is deeply concerning that not only Secretary of State John Kerry \nbut also former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of \nDefense Chuck Hagel have all signaled in recent days they are actively \ninterested in exploring a partnership with Iran to deal with Iraq.\n  Indeed, today President Obama publicly suggested: ``Iran can play a \nconstructive role.'' This is the height of foolishness. It is deeply \ndisturbing that so many current and former senior Obama administration \nofficials would share this same misguided and naive view.\n  There could be no more ill-advised or counter-productive policy for \nthe United States at this moment than to partner with the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran. Rather than partnering with Iran, we should be all \nthe more mindful of the dangers of taking our eye off the ball of \nIran's nuclear program, as no doubt Tehran hopes we will in this most \nrecent crisis.\n  As grim as the threat of ISIS is, it pales in comparison to the \nthreat of a nuclear-armed Iran, given their long and well-documented \nhistory of state-sponsored terrorism. Indeed, Iran is working now and \nhas been working for years now to develop nuclear ICBMs for one reason \nand one reason only, and that is to strike at America and potentially \nmurder millions of Americans. It would be the height of folly to take \nany action in Iraq that would further embolden Iran, which is already \nmoving to make Iraq a client state in its pursuit of regional hegemony.\n  We already know how that script plays out. We have seen it in our \nally Ukraine, where former President Viktor Yanukovych acted as \nVladimir Putin's stooge and planted pro-Russian agents throughout the \nUkrainian government and armed forces. But the Ukrainian people refused \nto accept Russia's attempt to reintegrate them into a 21st century \nreincarnation of the Soviet Union.\n  They stood in the Maidan Square, a place I visited just a few weeks \nago, and they braved the freezing cold. They braved the murderous army \nsnipers who shot the protesters down in that square, and they stood and \ndemanded freedom. They demanded to stand with America, with Europe, and \nthe West.\n  Iran, in its attempt to create a modern version, a new version of the \nPersian Empire, has attempted a similar play on behalf of so-called \nSupreme Leader Ali Khamenei through the means of the Iraqi regime of \nNouri al-Maliki.\n  Sadly, Iranian forces today permeate both the Government of Iraq and \nthe Iraqi security forces.\n  America has demonstrated, beyond any shadow of doubt, our offer of \nliberty to the people of Iraq. Indeed, thousands of our sons and \ndaughters have given their lives in pursuit of freedom in Iraq. But if \nthe Iraqi Government is more interested in forging a relationship with \nIran than with the United States, we should not and we cannot attempt \nto force them to adhere to our political goals for them.\n  Absent active partners in Iraq who want a closer alliance with \nAmerica and with our allies, our key objective should be, quite simply, \nto secure our people, to counteract terrorist threats to our national \nsecurity, and to make sure that we do not further embolden the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran.\n  These objectives--not the fantasy of resolving the Sunni-Shiite \nconflict that has been raging since the death of Muhammad in 632 A.D. \nor the illusion that we can magically find productive common ground \nwith Iran--should define our policy toward Iraq.\n  I would like to make one final note. It is my hope that my colleagues \nwill think more broadly about what is happening in the world in Iraq, \nin Iran, in Russia, and in Libya. We are being faced with options of \noptions of options that have been created by the bad choices our \nleaders make.\n  Those guiding our foreign policy at the White House, the State \nDepartment, and even, unfortunately, in the Senate have refused to \naddress true dangers posed to Americans at home and abroad. Bad choices \ninevitably leave us with bad options.\n  Refusing to recognize the radical religious extremism of individuals \nwho are committed to jihad and have pledged to murder Americans is a \nbad choice. Refusing to utter the words ``radical Islamic terrorists'' \nis a bad choice. Negotiating with terrorists to release terrorist \nleaders is a bad choice, and considering any kind of deal with Iran is \na very bad choice.\n  In the last 5 years America has receded from leadership in the world. \nInto that vacuum have stepped nations such as Iran, such as Russia, \nsuch as China. As we have abandoned our allies, the consequences have \nbeen to make the world a much more dangerous place. America's \nleadership has never been more critical than it is today.\n  Until the leaders of our government stop making these bad choices, we \nwill continue to be left with bad options.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           CJS Appropriations\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the appropriations \nminibus that many of us were prepared to move forward on today. I am \ndeeply disappointed that the Republican minority is effectively \nblocking another bill on this floor from moving forward for \nconsideration and ultimately approval by the Congress.\n  It is disappointing because I know that the bipartisan work that was \ndone in the committee was absolutely critical and extremely productive. \nThe Appropriations Committee, which I have the privilege of serving on, \npresented us, this Senate, with three very excellent pieces of \nlegislation. I am disappointed that we are not moving forward to pass \nthem. It is also disappointing because this process gives us the \nopportunity to shape the spending priorities of the government, to \nfocus on the needs of the American people, and to do so in a way that \nwill be responsive to their needs and we hope improves their \nopportunities to grow this economy and participate in the economy.\n  Without appropriations bills, we run the risk of being stuck with a \ncontinuing resolution--funding just what we did the last year--perhaps \na little less, perhaps a little more in some areas. But it deprives us \nof focusing on issues that are more sensitive and more critical at this \nmoment to the American public.\n  Chairman Mikulski has done an excellent job leading the \nAppropriations Committee. As I said from the beginning, she was \ndetermined to make it a substantive, respectful, and bipartisan \nprocess. The results are reflected in the unanimous or near unanimous \ncommittee votes on the bills that are coming to this floor in this \nminibus, as we call it. So I thank her, obviously, for her leadership.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues on the relevant subcommittees, \nSenator Murray, in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, \nand Related Agencies Subcommittee; Senator Pryor, the chair of the \nAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and \nRelated Agencies Subcommittee. Together they have prepared balanced \nbills that invest in our people, our infrastructure, and in science.\n  The transportation-HUD bill includes $550 million for the important \nTIGER Discretionary Grant Program, which is shared by the entire \ncountry but has been particularly critical to Rhode Island in helping \nus improve our commercial ports and in jump-starting major road \nprojects, including the replacement of a major bridge, the Providence \nViaduct on route 95.\n  Indeed, it is one of the potential choke points on route 95 that will \nnot only affect Rhode Island, but it will affect Massachusetts, the \nhome of the Presiding Officer. It will affect Connecticut. It will \nbottle up traffic if we don't continue to fix it, improve it, and\n\n[[Page S3853]]\n\nmake it traffic ready for another several decades.\n  The bill also maintains robust support for the Airport Improvement \nProgram. One of the things we are very pleased about is the T.F. Green \nAirport. We are investing about $100 million in safety improvements, a \nrunway extension, and an expansion. I thank Chairman Murray for \nincluding this funding in the bill, this general category funding which \nhas been very helpful to the Rhode Island Airport Corporation as it has \napplied for these grants.\n  I was particularly delighted last month because Chairwoman Mikulski \njoined me at T.F. Green Airport to look at the improvements, to talk \nabout the issues, and to get a firsthand sense of how her efforts and \nSenator Murray's efforts are translating into real projects throughout \nthe United States.\n  The bill also includes more than $3 billion for the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Program, again an important program critical to \nall communities in Rhode Island. It provides more than $2 billion for \nhomeless assistance grants. There is no portion of the country today \nthat is not facing a very real problem with homeless Americans who need \nhelp, assistance, and support.\n  There is $75 million for the Family Self-Sufficiency Program, which \nagain helps people who are struggling not only to find a place to live \nbut also to deal with all of the issues of getting by in a very \ndifficult economy.\n  All of these programs are extremely worthwhile. They serve the \nNation--not in one particular area or in one particular State--and they \ncontribute to our productivity--not just for the moment but looking \nahead.\n  We can take, for example, the Commerce-Justice-Science bill with the \nstrong support for NOAA, including funding for fisheries, aquaculture, \nSea Grant, ocean exploration, and ocean education--again, initiatives \nthat affect my home State of Rhode Island, the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts, the State of Florida, the State of North Carolina, every \ncoastal area, the gulf coast, et cetera, all critical to our country, \nto our productivity, to our commerce, and to the livelihood of so many \nAmericans\n  We are looking also at investments in the National Science \nFoundation, fully funding, for example, the request for the EPSCoR \nProgram at nearly $160 million. This is absolutely critical for many \nreasons, particularly to make that connection between academic \ninstitutions and business enterprises and also to economic development.\n  The bill also supports, with respect to our criminal justice system, \n$376 million for Byrne justice assistance grants and $181 million for \nCOPS hiring grants--actually putting police officers on the street, \nincreasing our ability to deal with crime and making our communities \nmore livable. This is absolutely critical.\n  We look at the Agriculture appropriations bill--and I thank Senator \nPryor--because, today, agriculture includes aquaculture, the commercial \ngrowing, if you will, of shellfish and other seafood products.\n  Again, in my State--but not just in my State, in other parts of the \ncountry--it is a growing and commercially thriving enterprise which \ndeserves support. In fact, because of federal investments, we have been \nable to initiate in Rhode Island aquaculture projects that have taken \non their own lives and own momentum and are extremely productive.\n  I am disappointed we are here today only talking about these \nappropriations bills instead of actually moving forward and passing \nthem.\n  Another topic that is very frustrating is the fact that this body \npassed on a bipartisan basis an extension of unemployment insurance, \nfully paid for, fiscally responsible--a bipartisan bill that went \nthrough all of the rigorous steps that required 60 votes to get \ncloture, and a majority of votes to get final passage. We didn't cut \nany corners. That is what we had to do, and we did it.\n  Unfortunately, it has languished in the House of Representatives so \nnow the extension, which as we passed the bill would have been looking \nbackward and forward several months--now it has been totally eclipsed. \nSo we are back working.\n  I have reached out, and fortunately Senator Dean Heller of Nevada has \nbeen an extraordinarily thoughtful and crucial leader, along with other \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle and colleagues on this side \nof the aisle. So we are beginning again, but I have to express my \nfrustration.\n  Over 3 million Americans now are without benefits that they would \nhave received had we been able to extend unemployment compensation \nbenefits which were terminated December 28 of last year. These are \nmodest benefits, about $300 a week, but for people who are looking \ndesperately for work, it could mean the difference between staying in \ntheir homes or being forced out, repairing their car, having a \ntelephone if they need it--which we all need to communicate to look for \njobs.\n  So we have to start again. Not only is this the right issue for \nindividual Americans--millions of them--but it is the right issue for \nour economy.\n  Economists who look at the unemployment problem will tell us--and in \nfact they did--if we would have extended the program last December for \na full year, this economy would gain 200,000 jobs. We are in no \nposition to turn down 200,000 jobs. In Rhode Island, that is \nparticularly the case. It would have added to our GDP growth, some \nestimates as high as 0.2 percent, again helping to grow the economy.\n  I hope we can rejoin this effort and move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor because for those \nfolks who picked up the Wall Street Journal this morning, this was the \nheadline regarding the health care law: June 19, 2014, ``Large Health \nPlans Set to Raise Rates.''\n  The picture emerging from proposed 2015 insurance rates in the 10 \nStates that have completed their filings, as the States have to do--\nstretching from Rhode Island to Washington State, in all but one of \nthose 10, the largest health insurer in the State is proposing to \nincrease premiums between 8.5 percent and 22.8 percent for next year.\n  That is not what the President of the United States promised the \nAmerican people when he forced through a health care law with only \nDemocrats voting for it in the House and in the Senate. What he said is \nthat by the end of his first term, premiums for families would drop by \n$2,500 per family. That is not what we are seeing: Across the board, \nthe largest insurer in each of those 10 States, anywhere between 8.5 \npercent to 22 percent for next year. It makes us wonder how that is \ngoing to sit with the American public when they are faced with these \nbills.\n  Republicans have been coming to this floor to talk about the health \ncare law that Democrats in the Senate voted for, the President signed, \nand we talked about the many alarming side effects--the alarming side \neffects Americans have been feeling ever since the law has passed.\n  People are still trying to understand the law, and they are asking \nthe question: How is this actually helping me? That is what people want \nto know, is how is the law helping them. Much of what they are hearing \nis not how it is helping them, but how it is hurting them. Once again, \nan alarming side effect in the front page of the newspaper this \nmorning.\n  It seems like just about every day we pick up a newspaper and see \nheadlines about another broken promise by the Democrats who voted for \nthe health care law--Democrats who came to the Senate floor and the \nfloor of the House of Representatives and said this is a good thing.\n  But then, of course, it was Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, who \nsaid: First you have to pass it before you get to find out what is in \nit. As more Americans are finding out what is in it, they continue to \nbe very unhappy with what they are getting.\n  American families all across the country are finding out that the \nPresident's promises didn't come true. They weren't true.\n  As chairman of the Republican policy committee, I have been looking \nat the damaging side effects of the health care law around the country \nand in different States and what I have found meeting people around the \ncountry. Here is what I found in North Carolina:\n  Last Friday there was a headline in the Triangle Business Journal in \nthe\n\n[[Page S3854]]\n\nRaleigh-Durham, NC, area on the Affordable Care Act: ``ACA forcing \nmajority of [North Carolina] employers to change health care \nofferings.''\n  The President said: If you like what you have, you can keep it. The \nheadline in North Carolina is: The law is forcing a majority of \nemployers to change their health care offerings.\n  The article says:\n\n       More than half of North Carolina companies are considering \n     radical changes to the health plans they offer employees----\n\n  Not little changes, not little tweaks, radical changes to the health \nplans they offer employees.\n  ``You might look at raising your deductible to keep premiums lower, \nor look at what you are covering,'' Hegeman says. ``Or charging more in \nterms of co-pay, in order to keep premiums lower.''\n  It quotes one human resources executive says that companies `` . . . \nmight look at raising your deductible to keep premiums lower, or look \nat what you are covering. . . . ''\n  Those are all considerations because the President made a lot of \npromises that are not being able to be kept, and people who actually \nread the law as it was being proposed knew the President's promises \nwere not going to be able to be kept.\n  This is a terrifying side effect of the health care law for many \npeople--people who now in North Carolina are worried about these \nradical changes to their insurance plans. That is what some companies \nare going to have to do to keep down the costs.\n  But for many people, the costs keep going up anyway, and we are \nseeing higher premiums in those 10 States I mentioned in the headlines \ntoday, but specifically in North Carolina, here is what WTVD, a \ntelevision station in Raleigh, reported last month. They did a story \nentitled, ``Blue Cross missing age sales target for ACA could mean \nhigher bills.'' So higher bills for North Carolina.\n  It turns out not enough young and healthy people signed up for the \ninsurance in the State's ObamaCare exchange.\n  The President said: Oh, we will get all these young, healthy people \nsigning up, buying insurance that--in my opinion--they don't need, \ndon't want, can't afford, will never use. The President said: We will \nget all these healthy people signing up.\n  It didn't happen. They missed the sales targets in terms of what they \nexpected in terms of the age of those signing up. So the biggest \ninsurer in the State in North Carolina says it may have to raise rates \nnext year.\n  The news story quoted a woman named Amanda LaRoque. She and her \nhusband own their own business, they pay their own health insurance, \nand they say their premiums have doubled since they signed up for the \nObama health care law. They are now paying $999 a month for two \npeople--almost $1,000 a month for two people.\n  I remember listening to President Obama and President Bill Clinton \nhaving a discussion in New York a couple days before the exchange \nopened. The President was saying: Easier to use than Amazon, and he \nsaid: Cheaper than your cell phone bill.\n  The plan was going to cost less than your cell phone bill.\n  This couple in North Carolina says they are paying almost $1,000 a \nmonth and their rates are going even higher. So it makes us wonder was \nthe President of the United States again trying to mislead the American \npeople intentionally? Did he not understand the law which was written \nbehind closed doors over there in Harry Reid's office? Did he not care? \nDoes he still not care? But that is what people are seeing and \nexperiencing as a result of the President's health care law.\n  But this couple is not the only one paying more because of the health \ncare law. According to a new analysis by the Manhattan Institute, \npeople all over the country are going to have to pay more--much more--\nthan what the President told them, much more than they ever \nanticipated.\n  The Manhattan Institute found that for an average 64-year-old woman \nin North Carolina, her premiums would have been $210 a month in 2013, \nbefore the ObamaCare mandates and everything else kicked in. In 2014, 1 \nyear later and all the mandates, buying insurance through the ObamaCare \nexchange her premiums almost triple to $623 a month. She is paying \nalmost $5,000 a year more this year than last year because of the \nPresident's health care law that the Democrats voted for in the House \nand in the Senate. The President said it would lower premiums by $2,500 \na year. Yet she is seeing her premiums go up by $5,000 a year.\n  For a 27-year-old man, he would have paid an average of $80 a month \nin 2013. Under the President's health care law, $217 a month--an extra \n$1,600 a year than last year. That is not what the President promised \nhim.\n  President Obama then goes and gives a speech not that long ago and \nsaid: Democrats who voted for this law--and there are a lot of Members \nof this body that fit this description. Democrats who voted for this \nlaw should forcefully defend and be proud of it--forcefully defend and \nbe proud, the President of the United States said just a couple weeks \nago. Is there a Senator in this body who is willing to stand and \nforcefully defend the fact that people in North Carolina are paying \ndouble or triple for insurance? Is there anyone who wants to defend \nthis expensive side effect of the health care law?\n  I know some people have been helped by the law. Some people are \npaying less for insurance than they would have before, but many people \nare paying much more. That is because the people who pay less are \ngetting a subsidy from Washington to help hide the rate hikes that \neverybody else is facing.\n  President Ronald Reagan once said, ``Government doesn't solve \nproblems; it subsidizes them.'' That is exactly what is going on with \nthe President's health care law. The Democrats who voted for this \nhealth care law did not solve the problem with our health care system. \nThey just threw more money at it to hide the fact that the law actually \nmade things worse. People wanted reform that gave them access to \nquality care, that gave them affordable care. No one wanted more \nexpensive coverage.\n  I will talk about one more example. That is the devastating side \neffect of smaller paychecks some families will be facing because of the \nDemocrats' health care law. Another side effect, smaller paychecks.\n  The law says employers--including State governments, including local \ngovernments, school districts, communities, counties--have to cover \npeople who work 30 hours a week or more and treat them as full-time \nemployees. They have to cover those people with insurance and treat \nthem as full-time employees. That is what the law considers full-time \nemployees.\n  There was another story in Raleigh, NC, on WTVD. It said State \nagencies--we are not talking about for-profit businesses. State \nagencies are looking at cutting the hours of part-time workers to keep \nthem under that 30-hour limit.\n  The North Carolina Agriculture Department has about 240 part-time \nemployees who are now working more than 30 hours--less than 40, more \nthan 30--240 of these folks at the North Carolina Agriculture \nDepartment.\n  How about the North Carolina Department of Transportation? They have \nalmost 600 people in exactly the same situation. So North Carolina is \ngoing to have to look very closely at what to do with those \nindividuals. If the hours are cut back to under 30 hours, that can mean \nsmaller paychecks.\n  One expert at Duke University told the TV station he expects the \nState will see 300,000 full-time workers be moved to part time. Local \ngovernments, State governments, private employers, they are all having \nto make these same decisions. Why? Because of the health care \nlaw. Those 300,000 workers moved to part time by the definition--not \nwhat the man or woman on the street thinks of as the definition of full \ntime, but what the health care law defines it as. That is a big hit to \npeople's paychecks, and it is another very harmful side effect in the \nhealth care law.\n\n  It didn't have to be that way. Republicans have offered solutions for \npatient-centered health care reform such as increasing the ability of \nsmall businesses to get together, join together, negotiate for better \nrates, expand health savings accounts, allow people to buy insurance \nthat works best for them and their family and shop in other States to \ndo it, and not have to\n\n[[Page S3855]]\n\nbuy this whole big list of insurance the President says they need when \nit is not what their family needs. It is not what they need for their \nkids, for their families, for their spouses, not what they want, not \nwhat they can afford, because the President essentially thinks he knows \nbetter than American families about their own personal situation. \nRepublicans have offered ideas that would give people the care they \nneed from a doctor they choose at lower costs--not lower costs as a \nsubsidy for some people, but lower costs for everybody. That is what we \nare working on, lower cost of care.\n  Republicans are going to keep coming to the floor. We are going to \nkeep offering real solutions for better health care without all of \nthese terrible side effects, because we know the list is there, one \nside effect after another. They are costly, harmful, some are \nirreversible, and nothing that the American people wanted.\n  On the front-page headline today is ``Large Health Plans Set to Raise \nRates.'' Insurance rates in 10 States that have completed their \nfilings, stretching from Rhode Island to Washington State, all but one \nof them, the largest health insurer in the State is proposing to \nincrease premiums between 8.5 and 22 percent for next year. The \nAmerican people will once again realize that the Democrats and the \nPresident who voted for this health care law have broken their trust, \nbroken their promises to the American people, and the American people \ndeserve better.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Madam President, today we celebrate Juneteenth. For those \nwho aren't familiar with this holiday, today marks the 149th \nanniversary of the emancipation of the slaves in Galveston, TX. Two-\nand-a-half years after President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation \ntook effect and 2 months after General Lee's surrender at Appomattox, \nthe slaves of Galveston were still being treated as they were years \nbefore. Union GEN Gordon Granger and his troops arrived in Galveston \nwith one thing in mind, to right this wrong. General Granger addressed \nthe entire city, declaring all slaves in Texas to be free, and granting \nthem ``an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of \nproperty.''\n  Upon receiving the news, the newly freed slaves could not contain \ntheir joy. They were crying, they were hugging, they were celebrating, \nbecause they were previously confined to shackles. They were slaves in \nthe true sense of the word.\n  So today, 149 years later, we once again celebrate the occasion of \nthe emancipation so long overdue. Juneteenth is a reminder of promises \nkept.\n  Although it may be late in coming, it is the duty of a responsible \ngovernment to honor its word and never forget any of its citizens. \nThere are millions of Americans who need help today, right now. They \nare escaping the bonds of hunger, unemployment, and inequality. So may \nwe here in the Senate come to their rescue, just as General Granger did \nfor the slaves of Galveston those many years ago.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wish to commend the Senate for \nunanimously passing S. Res. 474 last week. I am a proud co-sponsor of \nthe resolution authored by Senator Levin, which designates today as \nJuneteenth Independence Day for 2014. The resolution includes specific \nrecognition of Frederick Douglass who was born in the State of Maryland \nin 1818, escaped from slavery and became a leading writer, orator, \npublisher, and one of the United States' most influential advocates for \nabolitionism and the equality of all people.\n  On this 149th anniversary of Juneteenth, America celebrates the end \nof slavery in the United States. Juneteenth--or June 19--is the day in \n1865 when MG Gordon Granger and Union soldiers enforced `General Order \nNo. 3', finally freeing the remaining slaves in the United States.\n  Thanks to the hard work of Americans committed to living up to our \nhighest ideals, we have come a long way since that first Juneteenth. \nThis is a time for joy but also reflection for African Americans. We \nshould use our collective history, and days like Juneteenth, to grow, \nlearn and become more connected to one another. We owe it to those who \nendured the brutal institution of slavery and to those who dedicated \ntheir lives to ending such an injustice.\n  Today, our children study Marylanders like Harriet Tubman and \nFrederick Douglass, both former slaves who helped deliver freedom to \nmillions. As we observe Juneteenth in Maryland and across the country, \nwe also reflect on the reality that human bondage has not been \nabolished worldwide. The continued existence of slavery anywhere is an \naffront to the progress made since that first Juneteenth and a cause \nfor action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3856-7", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3856-S3857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, earlier this week I came to the floor to \ndiscuss ethics in defense procurement contracting, specifically \nrelating to the Joint Strike Fighter. I ask unanimous consent that an \narticle on this\n\n[[Page S3857]]\n\ntopic from Inside Defense be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Inside Defense, May 30, 2014]\n\nCarter: JSF Program Manager Based F-35 Award Fees on Desire To Protect \n                             Lockheed Exec\n\n                           (By Jason Sherman)\n\n       A former Joint Strike Fighter program executive officer was \n     fired in 2010 after explaining that he based the government's \n     decision to award prime contractor Lockheed Martin 85 percent \n     of the potential award fee--when the F-35 program was \n     suffering from major cost growth and schedule delays--on his \n     desire to protect the job of his Lockheed counterpart, \n     according to a former senior Pentagon official.\n       Ashton Carter, deputy defense secretary from 2011 to 2013, \n     on May 16 provided a Harvard University audience a behind-\n     the-scenes account of his efforts in 2009, during his first \n     year as Pentagon acquisition executive, to understand why \n     projected costs for the F-35 aircraft had doubled and why the \n     program was facing schedule delays.\n       At the time, an independent cost estimating team was \n     advising Pentagon leaders that the true cost to develop and \n     procure the planned F-35 fleet would be billions of dollars \n     more than the JSF program office estimated, foreshadowing a \n     $60 billion increase to the F-35's official price tag.\n       Carter said he called in the program manager, whom he does \n     not name during his remarks. At that time, Marine Corps Maj. \n     Gen. David Heinz had recently become the F-35 program \n     manager, in April 2009. His predecessor, from 2006 to 2009, \n     was Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Davis, now a three-star \n     general and the military deputy to the Air Force acquisition \n     executive.\n       ``I want to see the bill, everything that goes into the \n     cost of this airplane,'' Carter said, in a video of his \n     remarks posted on YouTube on May 22. ``The program office \n     didn't know, could not tell me where the money was going.''\n       At that time, the F-35's development was being executed \n     under a cost-plus contract, a vehicle that allows a \n     contractor to pass costs on to the government in addition to \n     seeking an award fee. ``I asked the program manager: `Let me \n     see your award fee history.' I look at the award fee history \n     over 10 years, it is 85 percent a year,'' Carter said.\n       The former deputy defense secretary said he told the \n     program manager the F-35 program was ``a disaster,'' adding, \n     ``You're giving an 85 percent award fee every year, what's \n     going on?''\n       ``And,'' Carter continued, ``he looked me in the eye . . . \n     and said: `I like the program manager on the Lockheed Martin \n     side that I work with and he tells me that if he gets less \n     than 85 percent award fee, he's going to get fired.' ''\n       ``So, this guy was fired,'' Carter said of Heinz. Then-\n     Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced Heinz's dismissal \n     during a Feb. 1, 2010, press conference.\n       Carter subsequently ordered a sweeping technical review of \n     the JSF program and transitioned it to a fixed-price contract \n     in an effort to force Lockheed to shoulder a portion of the \n     costs associated with developmental risks.\n       ``We began a process that was very difficult: to re-educate \n     the Air Force-Navy team that managed this important aircraft \n     so that they knew what the hell they were paying for,'' \n     Carter said in the Harvard speech. ``They had no idea.''\n       In 2013, the Pentagon restructured the award-fee scheme for \n     the Joint Strike Fighter program, setting aside $337 million \n     that Lockheed Martin could earn by achieving specified goals \n     during the balance of the aircraft's development phase.\n       Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the current F-35 \n     program executive officer, told the Senate Armed Services \n     tactical air and land forces subcommittee on April 24, 2013, \n     that a portion of the remaining award fees Lockheed could \n     earn would be tied to the timely delivery of planned aircraft \n     complete with scheduled software and capability improvements. \n     The bulk of the remaining fee is tethered to achieving the \n     current aircraft development plan on time and budget, he \n     said.

Madam President, I wish to honor the life of Laura \nLaPlante--a law student from Hancock, NH, who was preparing to graduate \nfrom the University of Chicago Law School when her life was tragically \ncut short last month.\n  Laura was a student at St. Patrick's School in Jaffrey and at ConVal \nRegional High School in Peterborough, from which she graduated in 2006. \nAfter attending Columbia University, she returned to New Hampshire and \ngraduated in 2010 from UNH--where she was a scholar-athlete who was at \nthe top of her class.\n  Laura continued to distinguish herself as a student in law school, \nwhere she became a campus leader. In addition to serving as the \npresident of the school's chapter of the Federalist Society, she also \nserved as treasurer of the Law School Republicans. Additionally, Laura \ndevoted her time and energy to the Saint Thomas More Society, the Law \nWomen's Caucus, and the Edmund Burke Society.\n  Laura was a vibrant young woman whose kind and generous spirit and \ncommitment to excellence--touched the lives of everyone around her.\n  A high school friend of hers said: ``Laura is the kind of person \neverybody wants to be.''\n  And a former teacher and coach at ConVal said, ``She was the type of \nperson that was always there for you''--adding that Laura was ``very \nselfless.''\n  She brought that same trademark kindness to Chicago, where one of her \nlaw school classmates was quoted as saying: ``Laura was one of those \npeople who would take the time to ask how I'm doing and actually \nlisten.''\n  These are just a few remembrances of this remarkable young woman. She \nwas smart, outgoing, kind, and curious about the world around her. I \nknow that Laura would have been an outstanding lawyer who brought \nintellect and integrity to the legal profession. And I also know that \nshe would have continued to be a leader in her community.\n  Tragically, we will never know the heights that Laura would have \nachieved. She was taken from us far too soon.\n  As Laura's family and friends mourn her loss, I hope and pray that \nthey will be comforted by their warm memories of her. She was a very \nspecial person whose uncommon kindness, caring spirit, and commitment \nto service brightened our world.

As Newark invested in \nhim, so, too, did he invest in Newark--first as a small business owner \nin 1979, and then, in 1985, as a firefighter. Committed to serving as a \nstrong voice for his colleagues, Dave became active in the Newark \nFirefighter's Union, serving as treasurer and vice president, and \nultimately union president.\n  When I became mayor of Newark in 2006, I knew Dave's knowledge and \nexperience would be an asset to my team.\n\n[[Page S3858]]\n\nIndeed, he worked hard to obtain new equipment, shorten response times, \nand streamline the delivery of service to make our fire department more \neffective.

I have served \non the board of trustees of the State Historical Society for some time, \nand I can tell you that Lynn has played a critical role in the \npromotion of the history of our State of Missouri.\n  As a native of DeKalb County, Lynn Wolf Gentzler attended the \nUniversity of Missouri-Columbia and graduated with honors and a degree \nin education. She then went on to earn her master's degree and began a \ncareer as a manuscript specialist at the Western Historical Manuscript \nCollection in Columbia. Over years of dedicated hard work, she rose to \nthe position of senior manuscript specialist and assistant director of \nthe Western Historical Manuscript Collection.\n  She eventually assumed the positions of assistant director of the \nState Historical Society of Missouri and associate editor of the \nMissouri Historical Review in 1990. A year later, she became the \nassociate director of the State Historical Society in Missouri, while \ncontinuing in her role as the associate editor of the Missouri \nHistorical Review. In 2003, the board of trustees for the State \nHistorical Society of Missouri asked Lynn to take up the role of acting \nexecutive director.\n  Lynn Wolf Gentzler is a leader who has demonstrated an incredible \nunderstanding and commitment to the past, present, and future of her \ncommunity. Outside of her work with the Missouri Historical Review, \nLynn's impressive authored and editorial works include entries in the \n``Dictionary of Missouri Biography,'' the ``American National \nBiography,'' and the State Historical Society's publication entitled \n``Marking Missouri History.''

Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act, and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Warren County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Warren County worth over $6.8 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $9.5 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course, my favorite memories of working together include my \nsupport of the great work done by public safety entities in the county, \nworking to improve local transportation infrastructure, as well as a \nstrong partnership with Simpson College.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Central Iowa, we have worked together to grow the economy \nby making targeted investments in important economic development \nprojects, including improved roads and bridges, modernized sewer and \nwater systems, and better housing options for residents of Warren \nCounty. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in \nWarren County, I have fought for more than $1.4 million for \nimprovements to Highway 92, helping to create jobs and expand economic \nopportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Warren County has received over $4.6 million in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Warren County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $367,796.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nWarren County has received over $1.1 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs;\n\n[[Page S3859]]\n\nstrong, progressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Warren County has received more than $1.4 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Warren County's \nfire departments have received over $1.1 million for firefighter safety \nand operations equipment and $175,000 in Department of Justice funding \nto support law enforcement efforts in the county.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed-\ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nWarren County, both those with and without disabilities.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Warren County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Warren \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa.

Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Butler County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Butler County worth over $2.6 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $11 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together has been a \nterrific partnership with the Butler County Rural Electric Cooperative, \nREC, which has done a tremendous job at securing funds for a variety of \nlocal economic development projects. I am particularly proud of the \nwork I have done with the Homeward, Inc. project to provide quality \naffordable housing to Iowans throughout the region. I am pleased to \nhave secured more than $1.9 million over the years to assist in this \nimportant work. I should also single out the outstanding leadership and \ntireless leadership of the former CEO and general manager of the Butler \nCounty REC, Bob Bauman, for his years of service and vision. He is the \nkind of Iowan, who has done so much to help those that have so little, \nthat makes me so proud to have served Iowa in the Senate.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Butler County has received $664,437 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Butler County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $115,000.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nButler County has received over $6 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Butler County has received more than $5.8 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as \nthe methamphetamine epidemic. For instance, Butler County has received \n$449,956 in Community Oriented Policing Services grants. Also, since \n2001, Butler County's fire departments have received over $323,000 for \nfirefighter safety and operations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have\n\n[[Page S3860]]\n\nhad four guiding goals for our fellow citizens with disabilities: equal \nopportunity, full participation, independent living and economic self-\nsufficiency. Nearly a quarter century since passage of the ADA, I see \nremarkable changes in communities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in \ncurb cuts or closed captioned television, but in the full participation \nof people with disabilities in our society and economy, folks who at \nlong last have the opportunity to contribute their talents and to be \nfully included. These changes have increased economic opportunities for \nall citizens of Butler County, both those with and without \ndisabilities. And they make us proud to be a part of a community and \ncountry that respects the worth and civil rights of all of our \ncitizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Butler County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Butler \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives.

Madam President, I ask the Senate to join me \ntoday in honoring the life of Sheila Lumpe, who passed away on June 4, \n2014. Sheila was a much-loved member of the St. Louis community. Sheila \nhas left a legacy of public service that will always be cherished, and \nSt. Louis will not be the same without her.\n  Sheila was born in Strinestown, PA and graduated from high school in \nIndiana where she had moved as a young girl. She attended Indiana \nUniversity to study political science and met a fellow student, Gus \nLumpe. They married and moved to St. Louis in 1965. Sheila served 17 \nyears in the Missouri House representing University City, a suburb of \nSt. Louis. After she retired from the house, the Governor named her the \nState's chief utilities regulator and she served 6 years on the Public \nService Commission. She was a member of the Missouri Humanities Council \nboard of directors and received numerous awards and honors.\n  With four children enrolled in University City schools, Sheila became \ninvolved in the Parent Teacher Association. In 1973, the school board \nwas divided over integration and Sheila's husband Gus encouraged her to \nrun for a seat on the board. Sheila won and spent 8 years on the school \nboard. When her neighbor gave up his house seat to run for Lieutenant \nGovernor, Sheila ran for his seat and won.\n  I had the distinct honor of serving with Sheila in the Missouri \nGeneral Assembly, where her tenure was marked by excellence and \ncommunity involvement and where I learned important lessons about \npublic leadership from her. Sheila became the first woman to lead the \npowerful House Budget Committee and nearly became the first woman \nspeaker of the House.\n  Sheila fought tirelessly for women's rights, equal pay and universal \nhealth care. She helped Planned Parenthood retain funding while in the \nlegislature. Her legislation to expand health care for children passed \nthe year after she left the legislature. Shelia was a role model to not \nonly female legislators, but all legislators. She was regarded highly \nby everyone she interacted with, including those with very different \nviews.\n  Sheila retired from the Public Service Commission and public life in \n2003. She devoted herself to taking care of her husband, who passed \naway in 2009 from Alzheimer's disease. Sheila also passed away from \nAlzheimer's disease. She is survived by her three sons Abraham, Nathan \nand Andrew; daughter, Karen, and six grandchildren.\n  Sheila left an indelible and permanent mark on St. Louis and will be \nfondly remembered and dearly missed. Sheila's life and commitment to \nothers serves as an inspiration to me and to all Missourians. I have \nlost a friend and mentor and our State has truly lost a leader and a \nhero.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in honoring the life and legacy of \nSheila Lumpe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3860-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3860-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3860-4", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13617 OF JUNE 25, 2012, WITH \n  RESPECT TO THE DISPOSITION OF RUSSIAN HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM--PM 45\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

    \n\n[Pages S3864-S3865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Coons, Mr. Isakson, \n        and Mr. Kaine):\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\n  S. 2502. A bill to establish in the United States Agency for \nInternational Development an entity to be known as the United States \nGlobal Development Lab, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Global \nDevelopment Lab and the legislation I am introducing along with \nSenators Boozman, Coons, and Isakson that codifies the Global \nDevelopment Lab and provides the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, USAID, with the flexibility it needs to make the Lab the \ngold standard in global development innovation.\n  This year, the Office of Science & Technology and the Office of \nInnovation & Development Alliances at USAID were abolished to pave the \nway for the Global Development Lab--a new approach to invest, test, and \nbring to scale more effective solutions to the world's biggest \ndevelopment challenges.\n  The Global Development Lab partners with entrepreneurs, experts, \nnongovernmental organizations, NGOs, universities, and science and \nresearch institutions to solve development challenges in a faster, more \ncost-efficient, and more sustainable way. The lab utilizes a pay-for-\nsuccess model, which uses science, technology, and innovation-driven \ncompetitions to expand the number and diversity of solutions to \ndevelopment challenges. This means that instead of issuing grants or \ncontacts, USAID can give a competitor an award only after the \nobjectives of the competition have been achieved.\n  The lab already has an impressive 32 cornerstone partners. These \npartners are businesses, NGOs, foundations, universities, and \ngovernments--all of whom are committed to sharing information and \nexpertise and to bringing innovative development projects to scale. I \nam pleased that two Maryland-based organizations, Johns Hopkins \nUniversity and Catholic Relief Services, are cornerstone partners of \nthe Global Development Lab. Catholic Relief Services intends to work \nwith the lab on food security, global health, climate change, energy, \nand information and communications technology, and it is already using \ngeographic information systems in Haiti to map schools and education \nprograms across the country to better improve education interventions. \nJohns Hopkins University plans to partner with the lab on improving \nhealth care and access to clean and affordable water and energy.\n  The Global Development Lab makes sense: America has a proud history \nof achieving unprecedented gains for humanity through science and \ntechnology. Evidence has shown that when we harness American science, \ninnovation and entrepreneurship, we achieve the greatest leaps in \nsocial and economic development.\n  For example, ninety percent of new HIV infection in children is a \nresult of mother-to-child transmission at birth. When newborns receive \nantiretroviral drugs at a clinic or hospital within 24 hours of birth, \ntheir chances of contracting HIV go from 45 percent to less than 5 \npercent. In regions where pregnant mothers do not have adequate access \nto medical facilities, getting newborns antiretroviral treatment is \nchallenging. In response to this challenge, Dr. Robert Malkin and his \nstudents at Duke's Pratt School of Engineering and Duke's Global Health \nInstitute--also Cornerstone Partners--designed the Pratt Pouch, a low-\ncost foil pouch that preserves a premeasured dose of antiretroviral \nmedication for up to a year without requiring refrigeration. The pouch \nensures accurate pediatric dosing and can be given to mothers to take \nhome with them before birth. Mothers then simply tear open the pouch \nand squeeze the medication directly into their newborn's mouth, \neliminating the need for a syringe and a health professional and \nultimately reducing the likelihood of mother-to-child transmission of \nHIV at birth.\n  This type of innovation is exciting and is exactly what we hope to \nsee more of as we scale up the Global Development Lab and empower it to \nbe the world's most innovative incubator of global development \nprojects.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FLAKE (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2503. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to enter into \nthe Big Sandy River-Planet Ranch Water Rights Settlement Agreement and \nthe Hualapai Tribe Bill Williams River Water Rights Settlement \nAgreement, to provide for the lease of certain land located within \nPlanet Ranch on the Bill Williams River in the State of Arizona to \nbenefit the Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program, \nand to provide for the settlement of specific water rights claims in \nthe Bill Williams River watershed in the State of Arizona; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain and myself I am \npleased to introduced S. 2503, the Bill Williams River Water Rights \nSettlement Act of 2014.\n  This measure would confirm important water rights claims of the \nHualapai Tribe to water in the Bill Williams River watershed; provide \nprotections for the Tribe's culturally significant springs in that \narea; secure a non-federal contribution toward a future settlement of \nthe Tribe's claims in other river basins; provide certainty for \ncontinued water use by the Freeport Minerals Corporation, Freeport, at \nthe Bagdad Mine complex and townsite; and facilitate the transfer of a \nportion of land known as Planet Ranch for use in the Lower Colorado \nRiver Multi-Species Conservation Program or MSCP. It would do all of \nthis without any new spending authorizations.\n  Water users in Arizona have a long history of pro-actively addressing \ncomplex water challenges. Among the State's many accomplishments is the \nresolution, in whole or in part, of water rights claims asserted by 13 \nof the State's 22 federally recognized Indian tribes. This measure \nwould carry forward that strong tradition by recognizing reserved water \nrights to a total of 694 acre-feet per year, afy, on three different \nparcels along the Big Sandy River as well as the Tribe's claims to the \nCofer Hot Springs.\n  For non-Indian communities, this legislation would confirm Freeport's \nright to withdraw 10,055 afy at the Wikieup Wellfield, which serves the \nBagdad Mine and townsite. Achieving this level of certainty with regard \nto water supply would help to ensure continued economic benefits \nthroughout the State.\n  By enabling the transfer of a portion of Planet Ranch to the Lower \nColorado River MSCP, the settlement would help Arizona, California, and \nNevada meet their obligations to both water management and Endangered \nSpecies Act compliance. However, in order to properly effectuate the \ntransfer, Congress must act before five-year window for abandonment and \nforfeiture of Planet Ranch's water rights expires.\n  Finally, this bill would help to set the table for future \nnegotiations regarding the Tribe's claims to water in the lower \nColorado River and the Verde River by securing a non-federal \ncontribution toward those settlement efforts. As those negotiations \ncontinue, I look forward to fully and fairly evaluating any subsequent \nsettlement on its own merits.\n  I am pleased to have the opportunity to work with the parties that \nhave negotiated this settlement, and I am committed to bringing it to \nfruition through congressional enactment.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about an American memory and \nthe absence of a memory, and the lesson I draw both from the memory and \nthe absence compels me to submit a resolution.\n  First, the memory. I would submit that the most known photograph in \nthe history of the United States is the Alfred Eisenstadt photo of an \nAmerican sailor kissing a woman in Times Square on V-J Day, August 14, \n1945, at the end of World War II. If one Googles ``V-J Day photo,'' you \nwill find more than 31 million links. Joy, celebration, gratitude--the \nphoto says it all.\n  It was important to celebrate the end of that war and to thank those \nfrom that ``greatest generation'' who had made it possible by serving, \nand we have continued to celebrate them, most recently in the recent \ncommemoration of the 70th anniversary of D-day.\n  Now the absence of a memory.\n  Where was that photo, where was that iconic moment of joy and \ncelebration at the end of the Vietnam war? There was none. No iconic \nphoto, no ritual moment of celebration and thanks--and that was a \nmistake.\n  This generation of Americans has lived through a war that began in \nthe days after 9/11. I recently heard a student about the same age as \nour pages say, ``While I don't know war, all I've known is war.''\n  The combination of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and \nNew Dawn has lasted 13 years. It is the longest period of war in the \nhistory of the United States.\n  During these 13 years of war, over 2.5 million Americans have been \ndeployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, hundreds of thousands completing \nmultiple tours. This is from an all-volunteer force that comprises less \nthan 1 percent of the American population.\n  More than 6,800 of our armed services have been killed in action, and \nmore than 52,000 have been wounded in action.\n  Now this long period of war and sacrifice is coming to an end. U.S. \ncombat operations in Iraq ceased in 2011, and all U.S. combat \noperations in Afghanistan will end this year, by the end of 2014.\n  Of course, while the combat mission may end, the sense of duty of our \nservicemembers continues and global challenges continue and U.S. troops \nwill remain in Afghanistan in noncombat positions, just as U.S. troops \nremained in Germany and Japan and Korea in noncombat posts.\n  But in a deep and fundamental way, 2014 represents the end of a \nmomentous and generation-defining war. The question for this generation \nof Americans is: How will we commemorate the end of this war?\n  When the war started, it started with a catastrophic attack on the \nWorld Trade Center and on the Pentagon in Virginia, with solemn \nspeeches by the President to Congress and to the American public--\nwhether delivered in the Capitol or standing on piles of rubble at \nGround Zero--with Congress debating and voting to do the most serious \nthing the Nation does, which is go to war.\n  It began as serious undertakings should--with a sense of seriousness \nand purpose and even ritual. That is how this war began in America.\n  How will we choose to end it? Will we take steps to publicly \ncommemorate the end of the war or will we just allow the important \nmoment to pass, unacknowledged and unrecognized, with no iconic moment \nor memory? Will we celebrate with and thank those who have served or \nwill we just turn our attention to the next headline or the next issue \nor the next scandal or the next crisis?\n  I believe that as a generation we do not want to repeat the mistake \nof the Vietnam era and allow the sacrifice of so many to just pass \nunnoticed. So, together with my cosponsors Senators Burr and \nBlumenthal, I submit today a resolution calling on the Nation to hold \nthe special ``welcome home'' commemoration on Veterans Day 2014.\n  November 11 is the day we honor the sacrifice and service of every \ngeneration of American veterans. November 11, 1918, was generally \nregarded as the end of hostilities in World War I, and since 1938 \nAmerica has paused on November 11 to recognize veterans of all wars. \nThis year, after 13 years of war, we wanted to designate November 11, \n2014, as a special ``welcome home'' commemoration for all who have \nserved in the military since September 11.\n  We submit this resolution with the strong support of veterans \norganizations--the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and \nthe Vietnam Veterans of America. The resolution promotes special \nawareness of our post-9/11 veterans. It encourages communities in the \nUnited States to plan activities for Veterans Day 2014 with a special \nfocus on honoring and supporting those who served during this time.\n  I imagine, as mayor, that the Presiding Officer had Veterans Day \ncommemorations in Newark. As Governor, we have them in Virginia, and \ncommunities all over the country are right now planning what they will \ndo on November 11, 2014. This provides our citizens with a formal \nopportunity to present a unified recognition all across this country, \nat a designated moment, of the sacrifices made by our ``greatest \ngeneration.''\n  This resolution is not all we must do for our post-9/11 veterans. We \nowe them a better VA system. We owe them a job market that understands \nand values their skills. And with so many of our colleagues, we will \nkeep working on those issues.\n  This resolution doesn't stand for the end of wars or conflicts. The \ndaily papers will always be filled with wars and rumors of wars around \nthe globe, and we know American troops will continue to stand ready to \nserve in harm's way for our best values. But for everything there is a \nseason, and this year where we finish the war started earlier in this \nmillennium, it is time to welcome home our post-9/11 veterans, to shine \na light on their honor and sacrifice, to celebrate with those who have \nborne the battle, and to remember with affection those who will never \nreturn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/19/senate-section/article/S3866-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3866-S3867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 480--EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES AND SUPPORTING ASSISTANCE \n    FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE HISTORIC FLOODING IN THE WESTERN BALKANS\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Mr. Portman, and Mr. Murphy) submitted\n\n[[Page S3867]]\n\nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                              S.
