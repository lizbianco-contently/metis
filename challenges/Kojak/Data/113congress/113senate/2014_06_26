Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 384, \nS. 2363, the Hagan Sportsmen's legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 384, S. 2363, a bill to \n     protect and enhance opportunities for recreational hunting, \n     fishing, and shooting, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. At 11:45 a.m., the Senate will vote on the nomination of \nCheryl Ann Krause to be U.S. circuit judge, and that will be a cloture \nvote. She has been nominated by the President for the Third Circuit.\n  At 1:45 p.m., we will confirm several additional nominations, but we \nexpect to have only one rollcall vote at that time.\n\n\n                     Measure Placed on the Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, H.R. 3301, I am told, is due for a second \nreading; is that true?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is correct.\n  The clerk will read the bill by title for the second time.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3301) to require approval for the \n     construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of oil or \n     natural gas pipelines or electric transmission facilities at \n     the national boundary of the United States for the import or \n     export of oil, natural gas, or electricity to or from Canada \n     or Mexico, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to any other proceedings at this \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the late comedian Leslie Nielsen said: \n``Doing nothing is very hard to do . . . you never know when you're \nfinished.'' Perhaps that is the case with the Republican-controlled \nHouse of Representatives. They just don't know when to finish doing \nnothing on immigration reform.\n  Today marks the 365th day that the tea party-driven House of \nRepresentatives has sat on their hands refusing to fix our broken \nimmigration system. The Senate was able to pass immigration reform 52 \nweeks ago because both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate \nunderstood the urgent need to amend our Nation's immigration laws. Yet \nfor 12 months--52 weeks--radical Republicans in the House have refused \nto address the real issues affecting the\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\nAmerican immigration system. Instead of obsessing over the President's \ndeportation policies, they should pass this legislation. They have made \nit clear they will not act on immigration reform until they can trust \nthe President--whatever that means--to enforce the law.\n  The bill that passed the Senate 52 weeks ago has the most stringent \nborder security measures in the history of the world. What we have \nagreed to do with the border is unbelievable. So any complaint about \nborder security is just not well taken.\n  It appears to me the Republicans want more deportations and more \nfamilies torn apart. Do they also want more debt? Immigration reform \nwill reduce the debt by $1 trillion. Is the immigration platform by the \nextremists in the Republican Party to deport first and find solutions \nlater or never? I guess that is what it is.\n  Recently, Republican Congressman Darrell Issa circulated a letter \ndemanding that President Obama end a program that prevents young people \nwith longstanding ties to America from being deported. He offers no \nplan to solve our Nation's immigration quandary or to keep families \ntogether--just more deportations.\n\n  There is not anyone who believes this country can fiscally or \nphysically deport 11 million people. The bill Congress passed many \nyears ago in 1985--I guess is when it was--didn't work. It allowed \npeople to come here without proper documentation. We tried a program, \nand it simply hasn't worked--employer sanctions. It doesn't matter how \nwe got to where we are; we have to change things. We must have \ncomprehensive immigration reform. Again, Congressman Issa offers no \nplan to solve our Nation's immigration quandary or keep families \ntogether--just more deportations. They are running out of excuses. \nCongressman Issa and Republicans have gone so far as to turn a \nhumanitarian crisis at our Nation's southern border into a political \ngame.\n  The people coming from Central America to America are trying to \nescape a war-torn and poverty-ridden country. Yesterday, the \nRepublicans reached a new low by accusing these kids--some of them 3 \nyears old--of lying about the reason they have come to the United \nStates. They are fleeing violence, extreme poverty, and they are coming \nbecause they are scared. They are afraid. These children are vulnerable \nand need to be reunited with their parents, and that is what we are \ntrying to do.\n  Our Nation cannot deport our way out of this problem. Immigration \nreform is about families, and we are not the Republican-dominated House \nof Representatives. We, as a nation, value families and see the family \nstructure as a cornerstone of our communities.\n  Undocumented immigrants, regardless of how they got here and why they \nlack the proper documentation, are our neighbors and our classmates. As \nI have just explained, there are 11 million people, and they play a \ncrucial part in our economy and the communities where they live. I \ndon't know why the House Republicans don't realize that. If they did, \nthey would be working to fix our immigration system.\n  Waiting 52 weeks? They have done nothing for 365 days. They claim to \nbe working on jobs bills and legislation to reduce the debt. If that is \nthe case, why don't they do something about raising the minimum wage? \nWhy don't they do something about extended unemployment benefits? Why \ndon't they do something about making it so my daughter, my wife, and \ndaughters and wives and mothers all over America get paid for doing the \nsame work men do? That would be good for the economy. How about student \ndebt. Why don't they do something about the debt students have--$1.3 \ntrillion.\n  Yesterday or the day before Senator Durbin spoke about a company that \nwent bankrupt. They have one school in Nevada. It is a for-profit \nschool that has been ripping off young men and women--some not so \nyoung--for years. Senator Durbin said more than 90 percent of all the \nincome that institution got came from Federal loans, and the default \nrate is extremely high. Why don't we do something about student debt?\n  The fact is the Senate-passed immigration bill reduces the deficit \nand spurs the economy more than all the House bills currently awaiting \nSenate action combined.\n  I urge my Republican friends and the Republican leadership in the \nHouse to stop doing nothing and bring immigration reform to a vote.\n  As the comedian said: ``Doing nothing is very hard to do . . . you \nnever know when you're finished.'' Maybe that is the problem with them. \nPerhaps now is the time for newly appointed House majority leader Kevin \nMcCarthy, who comes from Bakersfield, in the State of California, where \ncomprehensive immigration reform is certainly necessary, to take a \nposition on immigration reform. Will he bring the Senate-passed bill to \na vote? If not, what does he propose?\n  Republicans in the House have a choice of allowing a vote on \ncommonsense immigration reform in July or certainly be the ones to \nblame for not doing it. There is certainly a lot of blame to go around, \nand it is all focused in one direction.\n  The Republicans in the House have wasted enough time already. Bring \nthis legislation before the House for a vote. It would pass \noverwhelmingly. I would bet we could get a majority of the Republican \nvotes, and of course it would get 90 percent of the Democratic votes \nover there. It has enough bipartisan support to pass. So let it come up \nfor consideration. This is a democracy. Let them have a vote. Americans \nwant us to fix this Nation's broken immigration system. So let's do it \nand do it now.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Middle-Class Jobs\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yesterday I talked about how supposedly moderate \nSenate Democrats are supposedly incapable of advancing important \npolicies they claim to support, policies such as approving the Keystone \nPipeline. These Senate Democrats just can't stop talking about how much \nthey love Keystone. Yet they will not stop enabling their own \nDemocratic leadership to block approval of this shovel-ready, job-\ncreation project. They have been doing so for years now. So it is hard \nto take what they say very seriously.\n  That is true when it comes to the Obama administration's war on coal \njobs too. Some of our friends on the other side want their constituents \nto think they will stand up to this elitist war on middle-class jobs. \nThese Senators want everyone to believe they are opposed to this \nadministration's waves of job-killing energy regulations.\n  The truth is it is just the opposite. These Democratic Senators say \nthey are ready to stand and fight, but when push comes to shove we \ncan't find them anywhere. Instead, we continually see them supporting \nthe majority leader and the Democratic Senate leadership that dutifully \ndoes the bidding of President Obama and the far left.\n  On this issue the Democratic leadership has gotten ever more extreme \nin its defense of the war-on-coal jobs. Multiple times I have tried to \noffer legislation that would ease the pain for Kentucky's coal \nfamilies--hard-working Americans who just want to work and put food on \nthe table.\n  I pushed for Senate approval of commonsense bills, such as the Saving \nCoal Jobs Act and the Coal Country Protection Act, but the majority \nleader blocks those efforts at every turn, and none of the so-called \nmoderate Senate Democrats ever come to the floor to assist me in my \nefforts. Every time they choose to follow a party line instead--the \nparty line of the majority leader they support.\n  The most troubling is the majority leader whom these Democrats \nsupport is so determined to stamp out opposition to the President's \njob-killing regulations he has taken to shutting down the legislative \nprocess altogether. His efforts have even begun to affect our committee \nwork.\n\n  Case in point. Just last week Senate Democratic leadership pulled the \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill from committee consideration \nbecause it feared a procoal jobs amendment I wanted to offer that might \nactually pass. We saw yet another example of that this week when Senate \nDemocrats pulled the Financial Services appropriations bill from \ncommittee consideration for the same reason. The Senate Democratic \nleadership apparently doesn't want Members of the Senate, even in \ncommittee--even in committee--to have any real say in the\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\ncontours of the President's energy regulations--regulations that will \naffect millions of our constituents in profound ways.\n  Appropriations bills are exactly what the Senate should be voting on. \nOur constituents sent us here to debate big issues, to amend and \nimprove policies that work, and to repeal the ones that don't. That is \nour job description. But the Democratic majority won't allow us to \nfulfill it.\n  The extremism here is really worrying. But the majority leader \ncouldn't get away with it if the Democrats in his conference who claim \nto be ``moderate'' would actually stand up to him for once. The so-\ncalled moderates could stand up to him when he tries to shut down the \nlegislative process, but they don't. The so-called moderates could \nstand up to him when he blocks every reform of the President's job-\nkilling regulations or when he blocks every effort to approve the \nKeystone Pipeline, but they don't. They won't even stand up to \nPresident Obama when he jets off to speak to partisan groups and \nfriendly audiences that rarely have the best interests of coal country \nat heart.\n  I know the President will also be trying out a new PR campaign today \nto see what life is really like for the middle class--for those beyond \nthe White House gates. But he won't see the consequences of his EPA \nregulations at a political rally. He won't see what his IRS has done to \ngrassroots organizations. He won't hear from the families of veterans \nwho died while waiting for a bureaucrat to hand out a doctor \nappointment. And he won't see the damage ObamaCare has caused for \nworking families.\n  Well, if he is actually serious about this initiative, then he will \ncome to Kentucky to see the tragic effects of his policies firsthand. I \ninvite him to visit with local coal families in my State and hear the \nother side of the story they won't hear from California billionaires. I \ninvite him to meet with the veterans I hear from every day, and I \ninvite him to meet with families such as the Whitehead family from \nAllen County, who write to me about the damage his ObamaCare law has \nalready done to them. But I doubt he will, and I doubt the so-called \nmoderate Senators will push him to do so anyway.\n  So perhaps it is time these Senators stop referring to themselves as \nmoderate at all. If they are not willing to stand up to the majority \nleader or the President when it counts, then they are just another \nparty-line Democrat. It is really too bad, because we Republicans on \nthis side of the aisle want to come to bipartisan solutions on the \nissues affecting so many of our constituents. We want to pass \ncommonsense energy legislation that can create well-paying jobs, \nincrease North American energy independence, and lower utility prices \nfor struggling middle class families. We want to give Congress a say on \nextreme policies from the administration that take aim at middle class \njobs in each of our States. But we can't do any of that without dance \npartners on the Democratic side. And there is hardly a true moderate in \nsight anymore. I can remember when we used to have moderates over on \nthe Democratic side, but we can't find them today. It is a shame for \nour country.\n  I and my party are going to keep fighting for the middle class either \nway, even if we have to continue carrying on the battle for sensible, \ncommonsense solutions all by ourselves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4097-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak on the \nnomination of Cheryl Krause to serve as a judge on the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Cheryl Krause was nominated by the President on February 6, 2014.\n  I want to start with a few thank yous for where we are in this \nprocess. First, Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley. I \nappreciate their expediting the consideration of Cheryl Krause through \ncommittee. They moved that process along very quickly.\n  I thank Leader Reid and Leader McConnell for agreeing to bring Ms. \nKrause's nomination to the Senate floor so quickly. In fact, later this \nmorning my understanding is we have a cloture vote on consideration of \nher nomination.\n  From my point of view, this is part of an ongoing effort I have with \nSenator Casey, my colleague from Pennsylvania--a bipartisan \ncollaboration to make sure we are filling vacancies as they occur, as \nquickly as we responsibly can, to make sure we have as close to a full \ncomplement of Federal judges as we possibly can.\n  So thus far, in the 3\\1/2\\ years I have been in the Senate, Senator \nCasey and I have worked closely, and we have had 10 people who have \ngone through the entire process--from the application process, the \nvetting process, the consideration, the recommendation by Senator Casey \nand myself jointly to the White House, the nomination, and through the \nconfirmation process--10 people who have successfully gone through that \nprocess already. There are four additional candidates, recently \nnominated by the President at the recommendation of Senator Casey and \nmyself, and I am very hopeful the Senate will confirm all four of them \nlater this year.\n  We still have remaining vacancies, and we are working on filling \nthose vacancies as well, but we are making progress, and it is in this \nspirit of bipartisan cooperation in filling vacancies on the Federal \ncourt that Senator Casey and I are both enthusiastically supporting the \nnomination of Ms. Krause to the Third Circuit.\n  I certainly hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle today will \nvote to support her confirmation.\n  Cheryl Krause is an extremely qualified individual. There is no \nquestion about that. She has a wealth of legal experience in both \npublic service and in private practice. In fact, her background is so \nimpressive that the ABA gave her a unanimous well-qualified rating.\n  She has excellent educational credentials. She earned her \nundergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania, where she \ngraduated summa cum laude. She went on to Stanford Law School, where \nshe graduated with highest honors. She clerked for Justice Kennedy on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  She has been a U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, \nwhere she served for 5 years. She has taught at the University of \nPennsylvania Law School. She is currently a partner at the law firm of \nDeckert LLP.\n  So she has a wealth of experience--it is relevant experience--and a \nterrific background. She has been both on the prosecution side and on \nthe defense side, so she understands both perspectives, both of which \nneed to be understood to have a properly balanced perspective on the \ncourt.\n  In addition to a very strong legal record, Cheryl Krause has \ndemonstrated a commitment to serving her community. She served as \ncounsel to the Philadelphia Board of Ethics. She has represented \nchildren with disabilities. She has led Deckert's partnership with Penn \nLaw School in a project that supervises law students representing \nindigent defendants.\n  She comes from a family of public service. Her husband has a \ndistinguished career in the United States military.\n  So, to conclude, I am confident Ms. Krause will serve as an excellent \nFederal appellate judge. She has the crucial qualities we look for in a \ncandidate for such an important post: intelligence, integrity, \nexperience, a\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\ncommitment to public service, and an understanding of and respect for \nthe limited role the judiciary plays in our constitutional system.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee apparently shares my confidence in \nCheryl Krause. They unanimously reported her out of committee, \nunanimously supporting her confirmation.\n  So I am pleased to speak on behalf of this highly qualified nominee, \nand I urge my colleagues to support her confirmation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4098-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4098-S4099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECESS APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the Supreme \nCourt's decision to strike down President Obama's illegal recess \nappointments. Article II, section 2 of the Constitution provides for \nonly two ways in which Presidents may appoint certain officers:\n  First, it provides that the President nominates and, by and with the \nadvice of the Senate, appoints various officers.\n  Second, it permits the President to make temporary appointments when \na vacancy in one of those offices happens when the Senate is in recess.\n  On January 4, 2012, the President made four appointments. They were \npurportedly based on the recess appointments clause. He took this \naction even though they were not made, in the words of the \nConstitution, ``during the recess of the Senate.'' These appointments \nwere blatantly unconstitutional. They were not made with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate, and they were not made ``during the recess of \nthe Senate.'' In December and January of 2011 and 2012, the Senate held \nsessions every 3 days. It did so precisely to prevent the President \nfrom making recess appointments. It followed the very same procedure as \nit had during the term of President Bush, and that was done at the \ninsistence of Majority Leader Reid. President Bush then declined to \nmake recess appointments during these periods, thus respecting the \ndesire of the Senate and the Constitution that we were in session. But \nPresident Obama chose to attempt to make recess appointments despite \nthe existence of the Senate being in session.\n  The Supreme Court said today:\n\n       [F]or purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the \n     Senate is in session when it says it is, provided that, under \n     its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate \n     business.\n\n  That is a quote from the decision.\n  No President in history had ever attempted to make recess \nappointments when the Senate said it was in session. And I am a little \nsurprised, since President Obama had served in the Senate, that he \nwould not know how this had been respected in the past by Presidents.\n  President Obama failed to act ``consistent with the Constitution's \nbroad delegation of authority to the Senate to `determine the Rules of \nits Proceedings,' '' as the Constitution states.\n  These illegal appointments represent just one of the many important \nareas where President Obama has disregarded the laws with his \nphilosophy of the ends justify the means.\n  We should all be thankful the Supreme Court has reined in this kind \nof lawlessness on the part of this administration, and it should also \nbring some confidence that at least from time to time--maybe not as \noften as our constituents think--the checks and balances of government \ndo work.\n  The Supreme Court was called upon to decide whether President Obama \ncould make recess appointments even when the Senate was in pro forma \nsession. Fortunately for the sake of the Constitution and the \nprotection of individual liberty, the Supreme Court said he could not. \nThis is a very significant decision. It is the Supreme Court's biggest \nrebuke of any President--because this was a unanimous decision--since \n1974 when it ordered President Nixon to produce the Watergate tapes. \nThe unanimous decision included both Justices whom even this President \nappointed to the Supreme Court.\n  That shows the disregard in which the President held this body and \nthe Constitution when he made these appointments. Remember, as I just \nsaid, I am a little surprised because at one time he was Senator Barack \nObama.\n  Thanks to the Supreme Court, the use of recess appointments will now \nbe made only in accordance with the views of the writers of the \nConstitution, our Founding Fathers.\n  It is worth keeping in mind what the President, the Justice \nDepartment, and the Senate said at the time of these appointments. The \nPresident said his nominees were pending and he would not wait for the \nSenate to take action if that meant important business would be done. \nSo the President stated in another way that ``I have a pen and a phone, \nand if Congress won't, I will.'' But the Supreme Court has made clear \nthat failure to confirm does not create Presidential appointment power.\n  The appointments were so blatantly unconstitutional that originally \nthere was speculation that the Justice Department had not approved \ntheir legality. But, in fact, the Department's Office of Legal Counsel \nhad provided a legal opinion that claimed to justify the appointments--\nin other words, justify the unconstitutional action of the President. \nThe Department's Office of Legal Counsel's reasoning was preposterous, \nand this unanimous decision backs that up. That office defined the same \nword--``recess''--that appears in the Constitution in two different \nplaces differently and without justification. It claimed that the \nSenate was not available to do business, so that it was in recess when \nthe President signed legislation that the Congress passed during those \npro forma sessions. The Department allowed the President, rather than \nthe Congress, to decide whether the Senate was in session.\n  As today's Supreme Court unanimous decision makes clear, the Office \nof Legal Counsel opinion was an embarrassment, reflecting very poorly \non its author. She had told us in her confirmation hearing that she \nwould not let her loyalty to the President overcome her loyalty to the \nlaw. This Office of Legal Counsel opinion proved otherwise. It said the \nPresident had a power he did not have. He did not have that power, as \nexpressed today by that unanimous decision of the Supreme Court.\n  Those partisans in that office who defended that opinion and its \nauthor should be humbled and should take back their misplaced praise--\nnot that I expect them to do so.\n  The Office of Legal Counsel opinion furthered a trend for that office \nfrom one which gave the President objective advice about his authority \nto one which provided legal justification for whatever action he had \nalready decided he wanted to take. Perhaps now that the office has been \nso thoroughly humiliated, it will hopefully conclude that the \nDepartment and the President will be better served by returning to the \nformer role of that office as a servant of the law and not a servant of \nthe President.\n  The other statements to keep in mind were from Senators. No Senator \nof the President's party criticized President Obama for making these \nclearly unconstitutional appointments, even though they felt we ought \nto protect against President Bush doing that. Rather than protect the \nconstitutional powers of the Senate and the separation of powers, they \nprotected their party's President.\n  Those were not the Senate's best moments. This underscores again the \nneed to change the operation of the Senate. Appointment powers and the \nseparation of powers are not simply constitutional concepts, they are \nthe rule for how the American people are protected from abuse by \ngovernment officials. They exist not so much to protect the branches of \ngovernment but to safeguard individual liberty.\n  I often quote from Federalist Papers, this time from 51. Madison \nwrote that the ``separate and distinct exercise of different powers of \ngovernment'' is ``essential to the preservation of liberty.''\n  President Obama's unconstitutional recess appointments are part of a \npattern in which he thinks that if he cannot otherwise advance his \nagenda, he can unilaterally thwart the law. That is a pretty \nauthoritarian approach to governing. Whether it is with respect to \ndrugs, immigration, recess appointments, health care, and a number of \nother areas, President Obama has concluded he can take unilateral \naction regardless of the law. And, of course, as\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\nwe see in the case of these appointments, the Justice Department has \naided and abetted him.\n  Praise today to the Supreme Court for forcing the President to \nconfront the errors of his ways, for enforcing the constitutional \nstructure that protects our freedom, and maybe cause him to modify that \nstatement he made earlier this year that:\n  ``When Congress won't, I will, because I've got a pen . . . and I've \ngot a telephone . . . ''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as we all know, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, the VA, is in shambles. Two national reports this week have \nhighlighted the fact that bureaucratic ineptitude and incompetence seem \nto be the norm there. Unfortunately, reports that surfaced out of \nPhoenix which led to the resignation of Secretary Shinseki do not seem \nlimited to Arizona.\n  I wish to talk about where we are nationally with this scandal, and \nalso specific instances that have come out of Louisiana I have learned \nabout working directly with whistleblowers and working directly with \nfamilies of veterans whom I am very concerned about who are examples of \nthis same sort of abuse.\n  On Monday, the head of the agency that investigates whistleblower \ncomplaints in the Federal Government, Carolyn Lerner, sent a blistering \nletter to President Obama stating that the VA Office of the Medical \nInspector has repeatedly undermined legitimate whistleblowers by \nconfirming their allegations of wrongdoing but dismissing them as \nhaving no impact on patient care.\n  Lerner's letter lists numerous cases where whistleblowers reported \nnumerous failings at the VA, including examples where drinking water at \nthe VA facility at Grand Junction, CO, was tainted with elevated levels \nof Legionella bacteria, which can cause a form of pneumonia, and \nstandard maintenance and cleaning procedures not being performed at the \nfacility.\n  Also, in Montgomery, AL, a VA pulmonologist portrayed past test \nreadings as current results in more than 1,200 patient files, ``likely \nresulting in inaccurate patient health information being recorded.''\n  In these cases, among many others, VA whistleblowers brought the \ninformation to the special counsel, an independent Federal entity \ncharged with enforcing whistleblower protection laws. The special \ncounsel passed it along to the Office of the Medical Inspector, but \nthat VA medical inspector concluded the hospital's failings, while \naccurately reported by the whistleblowers, didn't threaten veterans \nhealth or safety, even when the VA inspector general had concluded that \nsimilar faults compromised care in other cases.\n  This is deeply troubling and severely cripples any belief that the VA \nis in any way capable of fixing its deep-seated problems on its own.\n  My colleague, Senator Coburn of Oklahoma, whom I have worked with \nclosely in dealing with many of these VA problems, also released his \noversight report on the Department entitled ``Friendly Fire: Death, \nDelay, and Dismay at the VA.'' To say his report is troubling is quite \nan understatement. Some of the key findings I found most troubling in \nthe report were these: the fact that there seems to be a perverse \nculture, his report said, within the Department where veterans are not \nalways the priority and data and employees are manipulated to maintain \nan appearance that all is well.\n  In many cases it also seems bad employees are rewarded with bonuses \nand paid leave, while whistleblowers, health care providers, even \nveterans and their families are subjected to bullying, sexual \nharassment, abuse, and neglect.\n  Senator Coburn's report also highlights criminal activity by VA \nemployees, vast amounts of waste at the VA, the fact that the VA \nactually made waiting lists worse, and the VA Committee, led by Bernie \nSanders, largely ignored these warnings and delay. That committee, \nunder Senator Sanders, has only held two oversight hearings in the last \n4 years.\n  As I said, this is a national scandal. These are national problems. \nThe two reports I alluded to are national reports. But I know from my \nwork in Louisiana that they have consequences, and that similar cases \nexist in Louisiana. I have been deeply involved in a couple that I wish \nto highlight.\n  First, the Overton Brooks scandal in Shreveport, LA. A whistleblower \ncame forward to my office with very troubling information regarding the \nVA hospital in Shreveport called Overton Brooks. The whistleblower is a \nlicensed clinical social worker there, and he accused that VA facility \nof the following: maintaining a secret wait list and manipulating the \nofficial electronic wait list; using gaming strategies to manipulate \nreported wait times--for example, holding appointments without \nscheduling them until capacity opens or entering into the system that \nthe patient requested an out-of-date appointment when that just wasn't \ntrue; providing group therapy appointments to mental health patients, \nand counting these group sessions as an appointment with a primary care \nprovider, which they were clearly not.\n  These aren't just allegations. I have also personally seen emails the \nwhistleblower provided, and that has shown that this secret list could \ncontain up to 2,700 veterans. It also seems to confirm that, while \nwaiting for appointments, 37 of those veterans died.\n  Since hearing these allegations, I have sent a letter demanding a \nfull investigation into Overton Brooks to the inspector general of the \nVA, and I have confirmed that that is happening. That absolutely is \nmoving forward.\n  No veteran who served this country should be put on any secret \nwaiting list. At a time when we are learning more and more about \nrampant mismanagement at the VA across the country, any internal \nallegations such as that should be taken very seriously and clearly \ninvestigated.\n  That brings me to the second case I have personally dealt with and \nlearned about in Louisiana, this case out of the New Orleans area.\n  Gwen Moity Nolan was the daughter of a distinguished veteran. She \ncame to one of my recent townhall meetings in New Orleans, and she \nexplained to me personally that her dad passed away in 2011 while a \npatient at the VA hospital in New Orleans, allegedly in part due to \ndelayed and poor care at the facility.\n  She described the medical treatment there as poor, and that her \nfather's doctor had a terrible attitude and regularly refused to show \nup at the hospital in key situations.\n  She requested that information from the VA, including information \nregarding a supposed investigation into the case of her father, be \ngiven to her.\n  Her dad had passed. What she most wanted was to be sure the VA got \nit--to be sure the VA in New Orleans took some remedial action to \ncorrect the situation. Her case was done. Her case was done in two \nways: First of all, tragically, her father was dead. Her father was \npassed. Secondly, she brought a legal action against the VA, and that \nwas settled for a substantial sum of money which she received, and she \nis not disputing that or reopening that. That is done. But she wanted \nto know that these problems have been addressed.\n  On June 3 I sent a letter to the Acting Secretary of the VA, Sloan \nGibson, demanding this information and the steps the VA has taken to \ncorrect what went wrong.\n  After the New Orleans VA responded by saying ``patient privacy laws \nprohibit us from discussing specific patient information,'' I sent \nanother letter with the pertinent constituent's privacy release form. \nThe patient is dead. The daughter will sign any release form they want. \nThis was clearly stonewalling to avoid giving us appropriate \ninformation.\n  Unfortunately, the VA responded that they cannot share this \ninformation with my office unless very specific criteria are met. Guess \nwhat. They didn't think it was relevant to list the specific criteria \nwe need to meet. Again, more pure stonewalling.\n  This information is extremely important, and I am continuing to fight \nto get my constituents and myself this information about if and how the \nNew Orleans VA fixed these problems. I will\n\n[[Page S4100]]\n\nbe demanding a meeting as soon as possible with the head of the New \nOrleans VA hospital so I can answer those questions directly, and that \nperson had better not stonewall me to my face. That will have very \nnegative consequences. We are setting up that meeting. That meeting \nwill happen, and I will be following up on this New Orleans case.\n  Similarly, I am following up on the Shreveport case that came to \nlight because of the whistleblower. I will be in Shreveport tomorrow, \nmeeting with two significant people directly involved in these issues--\none an official at the VA; the second, someone who has come with \nadditional information to confirm the fears, claims, and concerns of \nthe original whistleblower. So I will be having those meetings in \nShreveport tomorrow.\n  Again, these Louisiana cases that I have been personally involved in \nunderscore the serious scandal at the VA. Every community has these \ncases. Every State has these cases. Every Senator--Republican, \nDemocrat, Independent--has these cases. We need to fix these to \nproperly honor our veterans. We need to ensure that this sort of \nabuse--in some cases, fraud and dishonesty--to the great detriment of \nour veterans never happens again.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker).

Mr. President, almost exactly 1 year ago to this day, \nall of the Members of this Senate came to this Chamber for what each of \nus understood was a historic vote because after years and even decades \nof debate and discussion, a small group of bipartisan Senators--Members \nfrom different backgrounds, different States, and certainly different \nphilosophies--came together to reach an agreement on landmark \nlegislation, a bill that would truly change the lives of millions of \nAmericans. They had reached a deal that would significantly boost our \neconomy, make every one of our communities fundamentally safer, and \nhelp millions of men and women pursue the American dream. But most of \nall, it was a deal that showed the United States was still capable of \nadapting, improving, and striving for perfection.\n  Still, the deal was not perfect. After all, it was a compromise, and \nonce it was reached, it had to survive incredible scrutiny throughout \nthe committee process and then during the floor consideration. But \nsomehow it made it through.\n  So 1 year ago this week when each Member of the Senate came to the \nChamber, we did something we don't normally do: We honored an old \nSenate tradition and actually cast our votes from our desks. That \nnight, we finally passed comprehensive immigration reform through the \nSenate. I well remember the optimism we all shared that night. After \nyears of trying, we had finally passed--with votes from both \nRepublicans and Democrats--legislation that would finally start to fix \nour broken immigration system. It would strengthen our borders, support \nour businesses and, most importantly, provide a real path to \ncitizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants who are forced \nto live in the shadows as Americans in all but name. The Congressional \nBudget Office even estimated that the Senate bill would grow our \neconomy and reduce the deficit by nearly $1 trillion over the next 2 \ndecades.\n  We sent the bill to the House of Representatives knowing the path \nforward there might not be easy, but we heard from Speaker of the House \nJohn Boehner, majority leader Eric Cantor, and dozens of other Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle that they also knew immigration reform had \nto happen this Congress.\n  Well, since then we have watched and we have waited as the Speaker \nand House Republicans simply refuse week after week, month after month \nto take up the Senate bill and move this process forward. For a full \nyear we have witnessed exactly what it looks like when Congress simply \nfails to do its job for the American people.\n  Our broken immigration system is not a hypothetical problem. This \nisn't an obscure, philosophical disagreement over the role of \ngovernment. This is an issue that has real, tangible consequences for \nmillions of Americans. While America has watched House Republicans fail \nto act for a full year, we have seen some of those consequences up \nclose.\n  Since the Senate passed immigration reform, tens of thousands of \npeople--many of them women and children--have been senselessly deported \nfrom this country and separated from their families for no reason other \nthan their undocumented status.\n  Businesses large and small have begged Members of the House to pass \nreform, including tech companies that need to hire the best and \nbrightest from around the world and agricultural businesses that \ndesperately need a stable workforce.\n  Now we are seeing hundreds of unaccompanied young children along our \ncountry's southern border. Many of these children are fleeing horrific \ngang violence in their home countries. They are desperately seeking \nsafety and a new life in the United States. But because of our broken \nimmigration laws, we are nearly helpless to respond and live up to our \nNation's global reputation as a place of safety and fairness and \nfreedom. Although these children broke our immigration laws, they are \nnot criminals. They are simply coming to our country to escape violence \nat home and strive for a better life in America.\n  It is not only along our southern border where our immigration system \nis hurting families and hurting communities. In my home State of \nWashington I have heard from hundreds of families and businesses that \nhave been directly impacted by this broken system, businesses such as \nWest Sound Lumber Company on Orcas Island. It is a small sawmill that \nhas been owned by the Helsell family for more than four decades. West \nSound Lumber is only able to keep its doors open because of one young \nman--Benjamin Nunez-Marquez. He goes by ``Ben.'' Ben is an undocumented \nimmigrant from Mexico, and he arrived on Orcas Island more than a \ndecade ago. He has become a cherished member of that community and an \nexpert sawyer. The Helsells will tell you that they would have to close \ndown if they lost Ben, and that possibility nearly became a reality \nwhen Ben was randomly stopped by an immigration official while he was \ntaking an elderly neighbor to a doctor's appointment out of town. \nAlthough he posed no danger to his community, the Department of \nHomeland Security scheduled him for deportation, which was only \nnarrowly avoided this year after I took his case directly to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security and the Seattle Times told Ben's story \non its front page.\n  We should not be kicking people like Ben Nunez-Marquez out of this \ncountry. We should welcome him, treat him as a human being, and give \nhim an opportunity to become a citizen in the country he loves--our \ncountry.\n  Senseless deportations are not the only symptom of our broken \nimmigration laws. Just this year local headlines and television reports \nin Washington State have revealed very concerning treatment of \nundocumented detainees at the Northwest Detention Center. That \ntreatment led to a widely publicized hunger strike and protest in \ncommunities across my State.\n  This is simply unacceptable. We must demand better than an \nimmigration system that leaves men and women whose only crime is \npursuit of the American dream to be locked up, abused, and discarded \nover the border. These problems are not new, and they are not going \naway.\n  Throughout this year we have heard that House Republicans will have a \nwindow of opportunity to act on immigration reform. Well, we are in \nthat window now. Republican primaries are behind us and the general \nelection is months away, but that window is quickly closing. The \npressure is on House Republicans, and millions of Americans across the \ncountry are hoping they do the right thing. The time to act is now.\n  I think it is time to hope for the best but also plan for the worst. \nPresident Obama has made it clear that he is\n\n[[Page S4101]]\n\nwilling to take administrative action if the House refuses to pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform. I am on the floor of the Senate today \nto lay out my principles of what that action should look like and what \nI will urge the President to do if the worst happens and Republicans in \nthe House do nothing.\n  First of all, the administration should make changes to ensure that \nwhile we are being tough on those who are a threat to our public safety \nor our national security, we are also enforcing our immigration laws in \na smart, humane way for the millions of undocumented immigrants who are \nAmerican in all but name. Frankly, that means changing our priorities. \nIt means focusing our immigration enforcement efforts, including \ndeportations, on actual criminals who are a danger to our communities, \nnot innocent people such as Ben who randomly cross paths with an \nimmigration official and not undocumented immigrants who live in our \ncommunities, attend church alongside us, and whose crime is seeking a \nbetter life in the United States of America.\n\n  It also means we should stop relying on detention centers to lock \naway undocumented immigrants who pose no public safety risk, are \nalready in our country, and are contributing members of their \ncommunity. Rather than simply locking them up under terrible conditions \nand then sending them away, we should take advantage of more humane, \nmore cost-effective methods of enforcement, such as weekly check-ins \nwith our immigration officials.\n  Secondly, we need to reestablish in our immigration system the most \nbasic of American principles: due process of law. For example, if you \nare in our country, absolutely no one should be deported or turned away \nfrom the United States without a hearing before an immigration judge. \nPart of making that a reality is providing the funding for immigration \njudges and access to legal information for undocumented immigrants.\n  The policies at every single Federal agency that deals with \nundocumented immigrants, including ICE, Border Patrol, and any other \nagency, should be reformed so they are consistent, transparent, and \nfair. For far too long the rules have been different from one Federal \nagency to another and the policies have been so convoluted and \nillogical that innocent families are being torn apart.\n  We should also discontinue the use of unconstitutional ICE detainers \nwhen there is no probable cause, as many counties have bravely done in \nthe Pacific Northwest, because not only is holding someone without \nprobable cause a violation of our constitutional rights, it is \nexpensive to local sheriffs and diverts precious law enforcement \nresources away from policing and protecting communities.\n  We should reduce the 100-mile enforcement radius for Border Patrol \nagents and make sure there is not 1 inch of land in this country that \ncan be called a Constitution-free zone.\n  Finally, we must expand prosecutorial discretion and decide that \nbefore we deport someone such as Ben Nunez-Marquez out of this country, \nwe should take a second to use our common sense first. We should build \non the great success the administration has had with DACA--the deferred \naction for childhood arrivals policy--and ensure that Federal agencies \nare focusing their efforts on actual criminals, not families trying to \nmake a life in the United States.\n  None of these actions can solve the underlying problem of a broken \nimmigration system. Only legislation from Congress can do that. If the \ninaction of the House Republicans continues--and I hope it doesn't--we \ncould be left without a choice.\n  Since that historic vote 1 year ago, we have all watched as more and \nmore of our friends and neighbors fall victim to immigration laws that \nwere designed for criminals, not families or our economy. We have seen \nMembers of the House of Representatives choose politics over good \npolicy and completely ignore a full-blown crisis that we have the power \nto change.\n  I look forward to working with President Obama, along with \nRepublicans and Democrats alike in Congress, to make sure our \nimmigration system works. I know so many people here and around the \ncountry join me in hoping the House Republicans step up and do the job \nthe American people expect them to do.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I welcome the Supreme Court's decision \nin the Noel Canning case. It represents a clear rebuke to the \nPresident's brazen power grab--a power grab I was proud to lead the \neffort against. Today's decision was clear, and it was a unanimous--\nunanimous--rebuke of the President of the United States.\n  As my Republican colleagues and I have said all along, President \nObama's so-called recess appointments to the NLRB in 2012 were a wholly \nunprecedented act of lawlessness. The President defied the Senate's \ndetermination that it was meeting regularly, and the Supreme Court \nunanimously--unanimously--agreed with us.\n  Today's ruling is a victory for the Senate, for the American people, \nand for our Constitution.\n  The Court reaffirmed the Senate's clear and constitutional authority \nto prescribe its own rules, including the right to determine for itself \nwhen it is in session. And the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the \nPresident's completely unprecedented assertion of a unilateral \nappointment power--a power the Framers deliberately withheld from his \noffice.\n  Our counsel, Miguel Estrada, did an outstanding job defending the \nSenate and its uniquely important place in our constitutional system. \nBy contrast, our Democratic colleagues shirked their institutional duty \nto defend the Senate. They failed, yet again, to stand up to the \nPresident. Although they failed to defend the Senate when it mattered \nmost, they, their successors, and their constituents will benefit from \ntoday's ruling.\n  The principle at stake in this case should extend well beyond narrow \npartisanship. It should be about more than just one President or one \npolitical party.\n  In closing, the administration's tendency to abide only by the laws \nit likes represents a disturbing and dangerous threat to the rule of \nlaw. That is true whether we are talking about recess appointments or \nObamaCare.\n  So I hope the Obama administration will take away the appropriate \nlessons because the Court's decision today is a clear rebuke of this \nbehavior.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Leahy, Richard J. Durbin, Patty \n           Murray, Jack Reed, Sheldon Whitehouse, Christopher A. \n           Coons, Jeff Merkley, Sherrod Brown, Tom Harkin, Richard \n           Blumenthal, Benjamin L. Cardin, Angus S. King, Jr., \n           Thomas R. Carper, Debbie Stabenow, Elizabeth Warren, \n           Amy Klobuchar.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we will vote to defeat the \nfilibuster against the nomination of Cheryl Krause to serve on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Her nomination has the strong \nbipartisan support of Pennsylvania Senators, Senator Bob Casey and \nSenator Patrick Toomey. The American Bar Association has unanimously \ngiven her their highest rating of ``well qualified.'' The Senate \nJudiciary Committee reported her unanimously by voice vote to the full \nSenate this past April, nearly 3 months ago.\n  Ms. Krause should already have been confirmed and be at work for the \nAmerican people. Instead, Senate Republicans continue to filibuster \nqualified, uncontroversial nominees who in previous years would have \nbeen confirmed without any delay. This is deeply unfair to all \nAmericans seeking access to justice and to the judicial nominees who, \nlike Cheryl Krause, have had distinguished careers in the law. Of the \n54 judicial nominees filibustered this year, 30 have been confirmed \nunanimously, without a single vote against them. These filibusters are \nundeserved, and should stop.\n  Ms. Krause has worked in private practice for over a decade, \nincluding as a partner at Dechert LLP and a shareholder at Hangley, \nAronchick Segal, & Pudlin. Her work has focused on complex criminal \ndefense matters in securities fraud, antitrust, and the Foreign Corrupt \nPractices Act. She has also taught courses on appellate advocacy, cyber \ncrime, and judicial decisionmaking at University of Pennsylvania Law \nSchool and Stanford Law School. Professors from both universities have \nwritten in strong support for her nomination, and I ask consent that \nthese letters be included in the Record.\n  From 1997 to 2002, Ms. Krause served as an assistant U.S. attorney in \nthe Southern District of New York, where she distinguished herself as \nthe lead prosecutor in the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. \nBefore becoming a prosecutor, she worked as an associate at the \nprestigious firm of Davis, Polk, & Wardwell and as a law clerk at \nHeller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe LLP. After graduating with honors \nfrom Stanford Law School, she served as a law clerk to Judge Alex \nKozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1993 \nto 1994 and to Justice Anthony Kennedy of the U.S. Supreme Court from \n1994 to 1995.\n  Her commitment both to the practice of law and to her community in \nPhiladelphia has been admirable. In 2011, as part of partnership \nbetween Dechert LLP and the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia, \nMs. Krause brought a class action lawsuit in the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania on behalf of over 1,000 autistic students within the \nschool district of Pennsylvania challenging the school district's \ntransfer of these students from school to school without adequate \nnotice to parents. After 2 years of litigation, Ms. Krause was \nsuccessful, and the district court required the school district to \nredevelop its policy. Ms. Krause has also helped to launch the \nPhiladelphia Project, a program that provides legal services to \nfamilies of children with disabilities in the school district of \nPhiladelphia.\n  She is well qualified to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit. Her record of accomplishments is unquestionable, as is \nher dedication to the rule of law and the Constitution. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to defeat the filibuster against this excellent \nnominee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Stanford Law School,\n\n                                     Stanford, CA, March 10, 2014.\n     Subject: Nomination of Cheryl A. Krause to the U.S. Court of \n         Appeals for the Third Circuit\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chair, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write \n     as the three former deans and the current dean of Stanford \n     Law School to express our enthusiastic support for Cheryl A. \n     Krause, who has been nominated for the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Ninth Circuit.\n       Cheryl Krause graduated at the top of her class at Stanford \n     Law School in 1993. She was first in her class after her \n     first year of law school, and she and her partner were the \n     champions of the school-wide Kirkwood Moot Court Competition. \n     Ms. Krause herself was selected as the best oral advocate in \n     that final round. Following her graduation from law school, \n     she clerked for Judge Kozinski, now the Chief Judge of the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and for U.S. \n     Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Following her \n     clerkships, she has pursued a wonderfully varied career--as a \n     law teacher, law firm lawyer and partner, and an Assistant \n     United States attorney. She has been repeatedly recognized as \n     one of the finest lawyers in the United States. Along the \n     way, she has somehow found time to perform an enormous amount \n     of pro bono legal representation and has been repeatedly \n     recognized for those contributions as well.\n       We write to tell you about Ms. Krause's reputation at \n     Stanford. That reputation can only be captured through a \n     series of adjectives that faculty use to describe their \n     impression of her: exceptional, stellar, admirable, \n     brilliant, incomparable. She is remembered as an academic \n     stand-out in and out of the classroom, a student leader, a \n     superb young lawyer, and a student who, faculty predicted, \n     would always combine a challenging legal practice with pro \n     bono and public service throughout her career.\n       Faculty members describe her as ``brilliant,'' ``among the \n     small handful of top students I have ever taught'' ``the best \n     student oral advocate I have ever seen,'' ``truly possessing \n     a judicial temperament,'' and ``ideally qualified \n     temperamentally and intellectually suited'' to be a judge. \n     Ms. Krause's career after law school has fulfilled these \n     impressions and predictions and more. She has forged a \n     remarkable path as a lawyer, and it is one that has prepared \n     her well for a career on the bench.\n       We hope that you will give her your most serious \n     consideration. We are optimistic that you will find her \n     record as impressive as that of her former teachers and \n     mentors at Stanford Law School.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul Brest,\n       Professor Emeritus and former Dean, Stanford Law School.\n     Kathleen M. Sullivan,\n       Partner, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, (former Dean, \n     Stanford Law School).\n     Larry Kramer,\n       President, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, (former \n     Dean, Stanford Law School).\n     M. Elizabeth Magill,\n       Dean and Richard E.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: As faculty \n     members at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who have \n     had the privilege of working with Cheryl Ann Krause, we write \n     to express our enthusiastic support of her nomination to the \n     U. S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n       Since she was first appointed a Lecturer in Law in 2003, \n     Cheryl has taught Penn Law courses in cybercrime, evidence, \n     and appellate advocacy, and has guest-lectured in three \n     courses taught by other faculty. As a partner at the Dechert \n     firm, Cheryl has been the lead person teaching our Federal \n     Appellate Litigation Externship, in which Penn Law students \n     are assigned to litigation teams at Dechert working on pro \n     bono cases pending before the Third Circuit. In the early \n     2000s, Cheryl was a Barrister member of the University of \n     Pennsylvania Law School American Inn of Court (an \n     organization that seeks to promote ethics and professionalism \n     by bringing together law students, practitioners, and judges \n     for periodic discussions on legal issues), and she \n     participated in presenting three Inn of Court programs on \n     different topics.\n       In her teaching and mentoring at the Law School, Cheryl has \n     demonstrated the talents that will make her a first-rate \n     judge. Not\n\n[[Page S4103]]\n\n     only does Cheryl bring to her tasks a powerful analytical \n     capacity, but also she has consistently displayed fair-\n     mindedness and intellectual curiosity. Her knack for \n     providing students and young lawyers with rigorous yet \n     constructive feedback signals that she would show respect to \n     the lawyers who appear before the Court while subjecting \n     their contentions to penetrating scrutiny. Cheryl possesses \n     excellent judgment and high integrity, and her interpersonal \n     skills would make her a valued and collegial member of the \n     Court.\n       In sum, we believe that Cheryl's legal acumen, temperament, \n     and experience make her a superb candidate for a seat on the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and we heartily \n     support her nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n         Stephanos Bibas, Professor of Law and Criminology, \n           Director, Supreme Court Clinic; Jill E.

Madam President, I wish to spend a few moments this \nmorning talking about realistic solutions to the ongoing crisis along \nAmerican's southern border.\n  Obviously, I come from a border State where we have 1,200 miles of \ncommon border with the nation of Mexico--which, of course, has been the \ngateway now to this humanitarian wave of unaccompanied children coming \nfrom Central America into the United States. I will talk more about \nthat in detail, but I first want to comment on something the majority \nleader said this morning in his opening remarks.\n  With what has now become his trademark hyperbole and frequent \ndisregard for the facts, the majority leader suggested that the \nRepublican platform was: Deport first, find solutions later--or never.\n  I find that offensive, and it is certainly not true. I can just \nassume that the majority leader has had other things that have taken \nhis attention and he has ignored completely the concrete solutions I \nand others have been promoting, some of which I will talk about here in \na moment.\n  The last thing I would say specifically to this offensive and untrue \ncomment of the majority leader this morning is: If you are truly \nconcerned about this issue, Senator Reid, you might want to focus on \nMembers of your own party. After all, no less than Vice President Joe \nBiden has said of the unaccompanied minors flooding across from the \nU.S.-Mexican border:\n\n       It is necessary to put them back in the hands of a parent \n     in the country from which they came.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Once an individual's case is fully heard, and if he or she \n     does not qualify for asylum, he or she will be removed from \n     the United States and returned home.\n\n  That is Vice President Biden. Perhaps the majority leader should talk \nto him or he could talk to our former Senate colleague Hillary Clinton, \nformer Secretary of State, who said this about these unaccompanied \nchildren:\n\n       [They] should be sent back as soon as it can be determined \n     who the responsible adults in their families are.\n\n  That is former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and, in all \nlikelihood, the Democratic Party's nominee for the President of the \nUnited States in 2016. Perhaps the majority leader should talk to her \nor he could talk to the Secretary of Homeland Security under whose \npurview this issue falls most directly, who said that:\n\n       Under current U.S. laws and policies, anyone who is \n     apprehended crossing our border illegally is a priority for \n     deportation, regardless of age.\n\n  Perhaps the majority leader should pick up the phone and talk to him.\n  So rather than make offensive, politically motivated allegations, \nperhaps the majority leader should get his facts straight, talk to \nleaders of his own political party, and then work with us on this side \nof the aisle to try to find some realistic solutions.\n  As the insurgency rages in Iraq and the border between Syria and Iraq \nhas collapsed and attention here in Washington has turned to other \nparts of the globe, I can say, without a doubt, the attention of my \nconstituents in Texas is still very much focused on what is happening \non our southwestern border and this surge of unaccompanied minor \nchildren who are making a dangerous and treacherous journey from \nCentral America through Mexico and ending up on our doorstep.\n  First of all, though, when the facts began to unfold the \nadministration said that human smuggling operations are responsible for \ncreating a misinformation campaign, and that is why we are seeing this \nsurge of unaccompanied minors.\n  There may actually be an element of truth to that if we think about \nit, because if the human smuggling operations--the drug cartels, \norganizations such as the Zetas and the associated gangs that work with \nthem--make money on each and every migrant who passes through these \ncorridors of human trafficking and human smuggling, then they probably \nare making money--more money the more people who come. They probably \nmake more money with children and women and other migrants whom they \nkidnap and hold for ransom. So there is some element of that.\n  But then we have been told by the administration that the surge is \nentirely the result of gang violence and poverty in Central America, \nand that it has nothing to do with President Obama's policies or his \nperceived commitment to our immigration laws, including the enforcement \nthat only the executive branch can do.\n  A few days ago, however, Secretary of Homeland Security Johnson \npublished what he called ``an open letter to the parents of children \ncrossing our\n\n[[Page S4104]]\n\nSouthwest border,'' in which he implicitly acknowledged that the \nPresident's immigration policies or the perception that he was less \nthan committed to enforcing those policies has indeed become a magnet \nfor illegal border crossings.\n  Referring to the so-called deferred action program President Obama \nannounced in June of 2012--remember the President said, ``I have a pen \nand I have a phone''? Basically saying: I am going to go it alone, I am \nnot going to work with Congress anymore? That was a product of the \nmentality and approach by the President.\n  But referring to the so-called deferred action program that President \nObama announced in June of 2012, Secretary Johnson felt compelled in \nthis open letter to inform his readers that:\n\n       The U.S. Government's Deferred Action for Childhood \n     Arrivals, also called ``DACA,'' does not apply to a child who \n     crosses the U.S. border illegally today, tomorrow or \n     yesterday.\n\n  It doesn't apply. Secretary Johnson reiterated this point in the very \nnext paragraph when he said:\n\n       There is no path to deferred action or citizenship, or one \n     being contemplated by Congress, for a child who crosses our \n     border illegally today.\n\n  If the sole driver of the border crisis was in fact Central American \nviolence and poverty, or smuggling organizations, then there is no \nreason to believe that Secretary Johnson needed to clarify the details \nof U.S. immigration policy. After all, if the migrant surge has nothing \nto do with U.S. policy, as the White House initially insisted, then \nclarifying what that policy is won't affect it at all. But it has \nbecome simply undeniable that President Obama's policies--including his \nunilateral deferred action program, as well as the perception that he \nless than seriously committed to enforcing current law and in fact has \nordered Secretary Johnson to investigate and recommend a further \nrelaxation of his enforcement policies--all of this has played a huge \nrole in creating the perception to tens of thousands of unaccompanied \nchildren that you should risk your life and travel unaccompanied in the \nhands of the cartels to the United States, because there won't be any \nconsequences associated with it.\n\n  It is that perception that the President continues to create by his \nsilence that is the magnet for this illegal immigration.\n  Don't take my word for it. According to an internal Department of \nHomeland Security memo:\n\n       The main reason the subjects chose this particular time to \n     migrate to the United States was to take advantage of the \n     ``new'' U.S. ``Law'' that grants a ``free pass'' or permit . \n     . .\n\n  In other words, they came because of a widespread perception that \nunaccompanied minors and women traveling with children would be allowed \nto stay, even after crossing the border illegally.\n  I think there is more to this story. In fact, what we have learned is \nthat women traveling with children are frequently given a notice to \nappear once they are processed by the Border Patrol--a notice to appear \nfor a hearing in a court that would then determine any claims of asylum \nor then determine whether they can stay in the United States or they \nwould have to return to their country of origin. This is called a \nnotice to appear.\n  Strangely enough, the vast majority of immigrants who get a notice to \nappear never show up. It makes one wonder about the ones who do show \nup, because there is absolutely no followthrough.\n  This is what is perceived, has been this ``permission'' or ``free \npass'' or ``permiso'' in Spanish.\n  Meanwhile, a study by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of \nScience and Technology Directorate concluded that the unaccompanied \nminors:\n\n       . . . are aware of the relative lack of consequences they \n     will receive when apprehended at the U.S. border.\n\n  Relative lack of consequences. In other words, nothing happens to \nthem. If you make it here, you will be able to stay. That is the \nperception.\n  Again, it is puzzling to me that even though the administration's own \ndocuments show a clear reason for the surge, they initially continue to \noffer the public a shifting narrative.\n  There is no doubt that drug- and gang-related violence in Central \nAmerica is bad. It is a matter of tremendous concern for U.S. \npolicymakers. It is terrible, it is heartbreaking, and it is something \nI propose we try to address. I had a great conversation, for example, \non the floor a couple days ago with the senior Senator from California, \nMrs. Feinstein, who said: Maybe there is something we can do, as we \nhave done in the past, in countries such as Colombia, countries such as \nMexico, and elsewhere, where we have worked with our partners there to \ntry to help them restore security and the rule of law. That certainly \nis a conversation I look forward to continuing.\n  But the fact is the violence in Central America didn't just begin a \ncouple years ago. As a matter of fact, the murder rates in Guatemala \nand El Salvador were higher in 2009 than they were in 2012 and 2013. \nBut the massive spike in illegal immigration by unaccompanied minors \ndidn't start until 2012--the very same year, not coincidentally, when \nthe President announced his unilateral deferred action program, again \ncreating the perception that if you came here, you would be able to \nstay. Thus, there is no wonder that people felt as though the \nfloodgates had opened, creating the humanitarian crisis and \noverwhelming the capacity of local, State, and Federal authorities to \ndeal with all of these children.\n  By fiscal year 2013, the number of unaccompanied minors detained on \nour southern border had grown to nearly 25,000--up from 6,500 2 years \nearlier. From 6,500 to 25,000 in 2 years' time.\n  According to the New York Times:\n\n       From October to June 15th, 52,000 unaccompanied minors were \n     caught at the American border with Mexico, twice the number \n     for the same period in the previous year.\n\n  There are estimates that could turn out to be 60,000 or more this \nyear and could double next year. One begins to wonder: Where does this \nend? How does this end?\n  So between the President's refusal to enforce our immigration laws \nand his ever-shifting explanation as to the source of the ongoing \ncrisis, it is no wonder that the President has lost so much credibility \non this issue.\n  Indeed, if the President wants to know why he hasn't been able to \npass immigration reform in the House and the Senate, all he has to do \nis look at the fact that people have lost confidence in his willingness \nto enforce the law.\n  I know the senior Senator from New York has suggested: Well, we \nshould pass an immigration law and postpone its effective date until \nafter President Obama leaves office. I would say that is a shocking \nstatement, it seems to me, which has been reiterated by the majority \nleader Senator Reid.\n  There is an enormous amount of distrust about the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to enforce the law. So I don't care what the \nlaw might ultimately be; if the American people don't believe the \nPresident and the Attorney General and the executive branch will \nenforce the law, we have lost their confidence entirely, and we will \nnever be able to improve and fix our broken immigration system, \nsomething I am committed to do.\n  Given all the different narratives coming out of the White House \nconcerning the surge of unaccompanied minors, I think it would be good \nfor the President to directly address the issue.\n  He has sent Vice President Biden to Central America. That is a \npositive step. I know Secretary Johnson has visited the Rio Grande \nValley and some of these detention centers for unaccompanied minors. \nThat is a positive step. And he has written this open letter to the \nparents of children in Central America discouraging them from sending \ntheir children on this long, perilous journey from Central America to \nthe United States through these drug-smuggling and human-smuggling \ncorridors controlled by the Zetas and other cartels.\n  Yesterday I submitted a resolution with my friend the junior Senator \nfrom Florida, Mr. Rubio, that calls on the President to do five things:\n  No. 1, it calls on the President to publicly declare that the \ndeferred action program he unilaterally announced in June 2012 will not \napply to the recent waves of children who have been illegally crossing \nour southwestern border.\n\n  That is the same thing that Secretary Johnson and others have been \nsaying, but it is different coming from the President of the United \nStates. It\n\n[[Page S4105]]\n\nwill be covered by the press. It will be communicated to parents in \nCentral America: Don't send your children to the United States, making \nthem an additional part of this humanitarian crisis, and subject them \nto all the perils I have talked about repeatedly of that treacherous \ntrip from Central America to the United States.\n  Secondly, this resolution calls on the President to publicly \ndiscourage parents in Central America and Mexico and elsewhere from \nsending their kids on one of the most dangerous migration journeys in \nthe world.\n  Third, it calls on the President to fully and faithfully enforce U.S. \nimmigration laws.\n  I don't know what the facts are, but I do know some of the Members of \nthe House of Representatives--Luis Gutieerrez has very recently said \nthat if we can't pass immigration reform that suits him, he wants the \nPresident to take further unilateral action declining to enforce our \nimmigration laws. That just contributes to the impression that is \ncausing this wave of humanity to come to the United States and creating \nthe humanitarian crisis. It doesn't fix it. It makes it worse.\n  I hope the President is watching and listening and decides that he \nneeds to be the one to make the statement, because only the President \nhas the bully pulpit necessary to deal with this.\n  Fourth, our resolution calls on the President to ensure that States \nsuch as Texas--and I see my colleague from Arizona; I would include \nArizona, California, and other border States--have the resources we \nneed to handle the crisis and to guarantee humane treatment of \nunaccompanied migrant children.\n  Some of my colleagues from Texas visited the facility in Lackland Air \nForce Base on Monday, including Senator Cruz and others, and they \nreported back conditions which, frankly, are very disturbing.\n  Fifth, this resolution calls on the President to work closely with \nMexico and Central American officials to improve security at Mexico's \nsouthern border. Mexico has a 500-mile southern border with Guatemala \nwhich is insecure and porous, through which all of the unaccompanied \nminors from Central America come.\n  I realize how controversial and polarizing the whole discussion about \nimmigration can be, but I suggest we need to try to work together on a \nbipartisan basis to deal with it. Hopefully, by making this above \npartisan politics and doing our job, we can help resolve this immediate \ncrisis, but then we can help regain the public's confidence so they \nwill allow us to take the reasonable steps we know we need to take \nmoving forward to fix our broken immigration laws.\n  I believe passing this resolution would send a powerful message about \nour commitment and the President's commitment to the rule of law, our \ncommitment to resolving the current border crisis, and our commitment \nto saving these young children from unimaginably treacherous journeys \nthrough Mexico which I previously described.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to work together with us to send that \nmessage, and encourage the President to use the bully pulpit to send \nthe message I have outlined.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First, I thank him for the resolution.\n  On behalf of myself and others, I appreciate the representation of \nthe people of Texas who are literally experiencing a crisis on the \nsouthern border of our States--of the Senator's State as well as mine.\n  I note the presence of the Senator from Illinois. There is no greater \nadvocate for the DREAMers, the children who were brought here, not \nwillfully, and I believe that in our immigration reform bill we address \nthat issue in a humane and compassionate fashion.\n  But I ask my colleague now: Isn't it terribly inhumane to see these \nchildren taken from these countries by some of the most unspeakable \npeople on Earth--these coyotes? And their trip along the way these \nhundreds of miles is so cruel and inhumane to many of these children \nthat it is chilling. These coyotes are terrible people. They commit \ncrimes to these people and on these young children. They do terrible \nthings. They sometimes ride on the top of a train where the safety is--\nobviously, their lives are literally in jeopardy.\n  Again, I appreciate the work that has been done on behalf of the \nDREAMers. But shouldn't we care a great deal about these children, even \nif they are not in the United States, for what they are undergoing now? \nAnd isn't it a humanitarian issue of the highest order, and wouldn't we \nbe better served if we told these children and the people who are \nmotivating them and making a lot of money bringing them here--wouldn't \nit be better for us to say: Look, anybody who shows up at our border is \nnot going to be allowed to stay in this country. But if you go to our \nconsulate, if you go to our embassy in the country in which you reside \nand make a case that your life is being threatened, you are being \npersecuted--whatever the conditions are for asylum in our country--then \nthose cases can be judged, and then if it is a humanitarian case that \nwarrants it, we can bring them into the United States of America.\n  But say: If you come to our border, you cross those--how many miles \nis it from the Guatemalan border?\n  Mr. CORNYN. It is 1200 miles.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Don't subject yourself to a 1,200-mile trip, which is \nhazardous to your life and terrible things can happen to you.\n  Why don't we send a message: If you think you deserve asylum, then go \nto the consulate, go to the embassy, and we will have sufficient \npersonnel there to take up your case. And if your case is compelling \nand meets our standards for asylum, then we are going to give it to \nyou. But whatever you do, don't risk your life and your well-being to \ntravel 1,200 miles in the hands of a coyote.\n  I would say to the Senator from Texas, sometimes when we say we have \nto have a secure border and the things we need to do, we are viewed \nsometimes as inhumane.\n\n  My question is: What is more inhumane than what is happening to these \nchildren now? Some of them are only 4, 5, 6 years old. What is more \ninhumane than what is happening to them as we speak?\n  Shouldn't the President of the United States do as the Secretary of \nHomeland Security did yesterday and say: You cannot stay in our country \neven if you show up on the border, but you can apply for humanitarian \nasylum in the United States of America?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate the question. I would say there is nobody in \nthis Chamber who has been more involved in trying to fix our broken \nimmigration laws than the senior Senator from Arizona. And certainly \nthe senior Senator from Illinois has been very much involved. Both of \nthem are members of the so-called Gang of 8 who were the primary \nauthors of the Senate-passed immigration bill.\n  But I would point out that not even under that bill would these \nchildren be covered, because they wouldn't qualify for the so-called \nDREAM Act provisions authored by the senior Senator from Illinois.\n  That is the point the Secretary of Homeland Security has been trying \nto make--this is not a green light to anybody and everybody who wants \nto come to the United States.\n  For their protection, for the protection and safety of the American \npeople, and in the interest of an orderly immigration flow and the rule \nof law, we need people to play by the rules, and it is the perception \nthat there are no rules and that if you make it here, you will be able \nto stay regardless of whether you qualify under the law that created \nthis flood of humanity. The second thing I would say, the Senator is \nexactly right. I think people underestimate the horror inflicted on \nmigrants who are transported from Central America through Mexico up \ninto the United States at the hands of transnational criminal \norganizations. The ``coyotes'' as we always called them are the human \nsmugglers. They now have to pay the cartels for protection or they \ncannot travel through the corridors up through Mexico and the United \nStates. These migrants in the process of being transported here, riding \non the train the Senator alluded to called The Beast, are prone to \naccidents. They could lose their life, leg or limb, be kidnapped, held \nfor ransom. Women will be raped and assaulted. It is horrific.\n\n[[Page S4106]]\n\n  Who in their right mind would subject their family to those sorts of \nhorrors only to end up in the United States when our laws do not permit \ntheir entry into this country? Somehow the President or the Secretary \nof Homeland Security are the only ones who have the bully pulpit who \ncan send that message in a way none of us can to convince them we are \ngoing to enforce our law.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The only way we are going to stop this right now is to \nconvince these people not to listen to the coyotes who are advertising \non regular television in these countries and to convince these people \nthat trip will not lead to the result of being able to stay in the \nUnited States of America. Until that happens, they are going to believe \nthat if they can get here, they can stay here.\n  All of our hearts and sympathies go out to people who live in these \ncountries in terrible conditions. We understand why they want to come \nto the United States of America, but they are on a fool's \nerrand. Meanwhile, they are putting their very lives at risk by taking \nthat arduous journey to Texas from Honduras, Guatemala, or some other \nCentral American country.\n\n  I see my friend--and there is no greater advocate for the DREAMers \nthan Senator Durbin--on the floor. He was one of the earliest and most \noutspoken on this issue. I hope he will join us in recognizing that the \nonly way we can stop this is to make sure people know there is no pot \nof gold at the end of this terrible trip they are on.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I say to the senior Senator from Arizona and the senior \nSenator from Illinois--and I will turn the floor over to Senator Durbin \nin a moment--that there are two big problems: This wave of children is \ncoming and not allowed to legally stay in the United States and thus \nsubject to being returned to their country of origin. Both Vice \nPresident Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that \nis the law of the land.\n  If the President doesn't step up and use his bully pulpit to send \nthis message in a way that none of us can because people pay attention \nto him and not as much to us--I think that is a fair statement--then \nthis wave is going to continue, and it is going to get worse and worse.\n  I ask through the Chair to the senior Senator from Arizona and the \nsenior Senator from Illinois--both of whom I know care passionately and \nare committed to fixing our broken immigration laws, although we have \nhad our differences--how will the American people let us do this if \nthey have lost confidence in the executive branch's willingness to \nenforce the current law? I think it makes it much, much harder.\n  In fact, as I alluded to a moment ago, the majority leader and the \nsenior Senator from New York said: Let's pass immigration reform but \ndelay its implementation until after President Obama leaves office.\n  That sounds like an embarrassing proposal.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will yield in a moment.\n  That has to be embarrassing. It shows a lack of confidence in the \nPresident's commitment to enforce the rule of law. I think it is a \nproblem. I think the President can help mitigate that problem and help \nrestore the impression that you are not going to get a free pass if you \nmake it to our southern border.\n  I will gladly turn the floor over to my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I would like to ask the Senator from \nTexas a question. He said repeatedly that the President is not \nenforcing the existing law. We all acknowledge that there is a \nhumanitarian crisis on our border, and I think we agree more than we \ndisagree, but I do want to question the Senator's premise. Will the \nSenator from Texas tell me which existing law the President is not \nenforcing that has created this crisis?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I say to my friend from Illinois that I tried to make \nclear that the current law bars the entry of these children and people \nacross the border because they would not even meet the terms of the \nPresident's Executive order, that is, if you believe the President's \nExecutive order has the effect of law, which I don't.\n  There are a couple of issues. It is both the impression that the \nPresident is not committed to enforcing the law and the fact that now \nwhen these adults are detained and children are placed with relatives \nin the country, virtually none of them show up for their hearing. So \nthe perception--because we don't have a comprehensive system to enforce \nour immigration laws even after people come to our country--and reality \nof how that works tells them that if they make it here, they will never \nhave to leave.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Sure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator know the origin of the law which \nrequires that an unaccompanied child be turned over within 72 hours by \nthe Department of Homeland Security to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, specifically the Office of Refugee Resettlement? Does \nthe Senator from Texas know who introduced that bill and who signed it \ninto law?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I say to the distinguished Senator through the Chair that \nI don't know who introduced the bill, but I do know who signed it into \nlaw, and that was President George W. Bush.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say through the Presiding Officer that the bill was \nintroduced by the Senator's former colleague from Texas, Richard Armey, \nand signed into law by President George W. Bush, which required what is \ncurrently taking place--that within 72 hours, unaccompanied children \nneed to be taken out of the Department of Homeland Security--a law \nenforcement agency--and placed, through the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, into some protective situation. The President is \nenforcing a law signed by President Bush and authored by the \nCongressman from Texas, Congressman Army.\n  I ask the Senator from Texas through the Chair, on what basis is he \nsaying the President is not enforcing the law?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I say to the Senator from Illinois, here is how it \nworks--I don't think we disagree about the law or the origin of the law \nbut how it works in application. These children are now being placed \nwith family members who may not be documented. They may have entered \nthe country in violation of the immigration law, but because it is \nperceived as a relatively safe place for them to temporarily reside \npending further court proceedings, they place the children with a \nfamily member in the United States. Absent a family member, I presume \nthey will be placed with a legal guardian or foster family or the like \nwhile the legal proceedings go forward.\n  Here is the practical problem: Once they make it here to the United \nStates, if they never return to the court in response to their notice \nto appear, then they are lost forever to the immigration enforcement \nsystem and they become a part of the great American melting pot, never \nto be heard from or seen again unless they commit some other crime. \nThat is how the press reports it in Central America and elsewhere. At \nleast that is the report we hear from migrants themselves. They refer \nto it as a permiso, which is a notice to appear. At that point they \nthink they are home free and never have to show up for their court \nhearing, and that it is as good as permission to enter the country. I \nbelieve that is what actually is happening.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would yield for a question.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I understand what he said, the law governing this \nsituation is a law that was authored by a Republican Congressman from \nTexas, signed into law by a Republican President, George W. Bush, and \nis currently enforced by this President. And what the Senator from \nTexas is suggesting is that the law in and of itself has at least a \nloophole or an opening that if the person doesn't appear in court--the \nyoung child or the parent with the child--then they could be lost in \nour system. The Senator from Texas seems to be suggesting we need to \nchange the law or at least address the law.\n  I have two questions. Will the Senator concede the fact that \nPresident Obama is enforcing the law as it is written? Secondly, what \nwould the Senator do with these children once they show up in the \nUnited States?\n  Let's assume you had a 12-year-old child--which is a case I heard \nlast\n\n[[Page S4107]]\n\nnight--on top of a freight train for 4 days; finally made it into the \nUnited States, possibly at the hands of a coyote or smuggler--I make no \nexcuse for them--pushed across the river, or Rio Grande, in a raft and \ntold to report to the first person in uniform? What would the Senator \nhave us do with the child at that point?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would respond to my friend from \nIllinois and say I would have them enforce the law, which is as the \nSenator has just described. Once the Border Patrol processes the child \nor migrant, then they turn them over to Health and Human Services, \nwhere they can be placed in humanitarian and hopefully clean conditions \nso their interests can be looked after while their legal case proceeds.\n  The problem is not just the fact that there are no consequences once \nthese children or others are released on a notice to appear, which is \nnever enforced, it is also the perception that people--for example, \nthis morning Congressman Luis Gutieerrez said that he was so frustrated \nby our inability to pass immigration reform, that the President needs \nto withhold any deportations or radically, essentially, refuse to \nenforce the law even further.\n  America is the most generous country in the world when it comes to \nour legal immigration system. We naturalize about 800,000 people a \nyear. It has been up to as many as 1 million people. We are very \ngenerous. But it is not too much to insist that people do it through \nlegal means for their protection and ours.\n  The statements the President has been making and the unilateral \nactions he continues to take give the perception he doesn't care what \nCongress says; he is going to go it alone. As a matter of fact, this \nmorning the Supreme Court rebuked the President on an illegal recess \nappointment--unconstitutional recess appointment.\n  I think it is not just the law as it is written on the books, it is \nalso how the law is actually implemented. It is also the further \nperception that the President is going to continue to basically refuse \nto repatriate people who enter the country illegally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I went to the White House last night. \nThe President invited Democratic Members of the Senate, and we met with \nCabinet and staff members. One of the President's close advisers I met \nwith described what she had seen in McCallum, TX, and there were tears \nin her eyes when she told heartbreaking stories of babies, children, \nand infants who are coming to this country. Many of them are in the \nhands of smugglers and coyotes who have gotten money from their parents \nor family to transport them to the border of the United States.\n  She told me the story of a 12-year-old boy, whom I mentioned earlier, \nfrom Guatemala. He was put on the top of a freight train and told to \nhang on for 4 days. For 4 days this 12-year-old boy, scared to death, \nwas on top of this freight train as it barreled through Central America \non its way to the United States. He had with him the name of a relative \nin the United States, and that is it. He was told that as soon as he \ngot across the border, look for somebody in a uniform, don't show any \nresistance, and present yourself, which he did. He now sits in a \nfacility in Texas.\n  This is a horrible humanitarian situation. The numbers that are \ninvolved here--I will give for the record the numbers that have been \nreported, which are worth noting. Some people may think we are talking \nabout hundreds of children. This year, and this year alone, as of June \n15, unaccompanied children apprehended by the Border Patrol: Honduras, \n15,000; Guatemala, 12,000; El Salvador, 11,000; and Mexico, 12,000. \nAlmost 80 percent of these kids come from the countries Honduras, El \nSalvador, and Guatemala.\n  Why are they coming here? They are coming here for a number of \nreasons: No. 1, there is this criminal network that gets money to \ntransport children. They promise the families they will get them to the \nborder. God only knows what will happen to those kids on their way. \nSome of them will die, some of the girls will be raped, and their lives \nmay never be the same. It is a desperate, awful, tragic situation, and \nthere is no getting around the fact that it is occurring.\n  Why are the families doing this? Why would you turn a fourth or fifth \ngrader in your household loose to make that awful, deadly journey? \nWell, part of the reason is those three countries--Honduras, El \nSalvador, and Guatemala--are virtually lawless. They are three of the \ntop five countries in the world when it comes to murder rates. There is \na fear that the gangs in these countries will kill their kids anyway.\n  A young girl from one of these countries said: I ran. I didn't know \nwhat else to do because I was told one of the members of the gang \nwanted to take me on as a girlfriend. I know what happens to girls who \nbecome girlfriends. They are raped, killed, and left in a plastic bag \non the side of the road.\n  Sadly, that is the reality of life for those children in some of \nthese countries.\n  The United States is at the end of this journey and trying to decide \nthe humane thing to do when an infant, a toddler, a 10-year-old, or a \n12-year-old, shows up.\n  There is no easy answer.\n  The one point I wish to make and clarify--and I hope I did it in the \ncourse of my colloquy with my friend and colleague from Texas--this is \nnot a question about whether President Obama has dreamed up a new law \nor is not enforcing an existing law. The President is enforcing the \nexisting law in America, and here is what it says: When an \nunaccompanied child shows up on our border and our Border Patrol takes \nthis child into custody, within 72 hours--we give them some time \nbecause it is not easy--we need to put this child in a different place \noutside of a law enforcement agency. Technically, we need to take them \nout of the police station part of the world and put them in some part \nof the world that is best for a child. That is what they are required \nto do under a law introduced by a Republican Texas Congressman, Dick \nArmey, and signed into law by a Republican President, George W. Bush. \nWhat President Obama is doing is enforcing a law which President Bush \nsigned and was supported by Republicans.\n  So, please, for a second, can we stop the partisanship on this? Let's \nview this not as a political crisis but a humanitarian crisis, and \nlet's acknowledge the obvious. The President has tried in his capacity \nto deal with the immigration issue. He has done more than he wanted to \ndo as President. Last night at a gathering the President said: Does \nanyone think I believe Executive orders are the best way to govern \nAmerica? No. It is better to do it by law. But let me tell my \ncolleagues why he is forced into Executive orders.\n  It was 365 days ago, on the floor of this Senate, that we passed a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill. It was one of my prouder moments \nas a Senator. There were eight of us who wrote the bill and it took us \nmonths: four Republicans, including John McCain, who was just on the \nfloor, my friend Marco Rubio of Florida, Jeff Flake of Arizona, and--I \nam thinking for a second; I blanked on it, but I will think of the \nother one in just a second--Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. So the \nfour Republicans, and on our side of the table we had Chuck Schumer of \nNew York, myself, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, and Michael Bennet of \nColorado.\n  We went at it for months and we wrote the bill. We brought the bill \nto the floor, and we covered virtually every aspect of our broken \nimmigration system, start to finish. It wasn't easy, but we covered it \nall. The bill passed on the floor of the Senate. It got 68 votes. We \nhad 14 Republicans joining the Democrats in passing the bill. It was \nsupported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It was supported by the \nlabor unions, the faith community. Grover Norquist, one of the most \nconservative Republicans in our country, supported it publicly and said \nit was a good idea, and we passed it.\n  We sent it to the House of Representatives 1 year ago. What has \nhappened to comprehensive immigration reform since we sent it 1 year \nago to the House of Representatives? Nothing. Nothing. They refuse to \ncall up the bill for consideration.\n  So when Members come to the floor and talk about how broken our \nimmigration system is, I agree. Many of us tried to fix it, and we did \nit the way we\n\n[[Page S4108]]\n\nshould have--in a bipartisan fashion, give and take, compromise.\n  We are sending, under this new bill, more enforcement to the border \nbetween Texas and Mexico than we have ever seen before. I said somewhat \njokingly that the people at the border can reach out and touch hands, \nthere will be so many of them--figuratively--at our border. That was \nthe price the Republicans insisted on: border enforcement. All right. \nWhat we insisted on was to take the 11 million undocumented in America \ntoday, and if they have been here for at least 2 years, give them a \nchance. Let them come forward, register with the United States who they \nare, where they live, where they work, who is in their household. Let \nthem pay their taxes, let them pay a fine, and let them learn English. \nIf they do those things, we will do a criminal background check to make \nsure they are no threat to anyone in this country, and we will watch \nthem. We will watch them for 13 years--13 years. Then they have a \nchance at legalization.\n  That is what our bill says. They go to the back of the line and they \nwait 13 years while they pay their fines. It is tough. Some of them \nwill not make it to the end of the road, but it is there. It gives them \na chance.\n  So when Members come to the floornd criticize our current immigration \nsystem, I say to them, there was a repair to that system, there was a \nfix to that system. It passed the Senate 1 year ago and Speaker Boehner \nrefuses to call it to the floor of the House. I don't know why.\n  Well, I do know why: Because it would pass. There would be enough \nRepublicans joining Democrats to pass it and we would finally have done \nsomething on the issue of immigration.\n  Now we have before us a resolution by the senior Senator from Texas \nand he suggests we should take it up. The first part of the resolution \nsays the President has to make it clear the DACA Executive order does \nnot apply to the new people coming across the border. Well, that is a \nfact. Those who are coming across the border today can't qualify to \nbecome legal in the United States--not under any existing Executive \norder or under the proposed comprehensive immigration reform we passed \nin the Senate. They can't become citizens. The President saying it \npersonally? I am sure the President would say it personally because he \nsent the Vice President out to Central America to visit the countries \nand tell the leaders there: There is a mistake if your people believe \nthey can stay in this country legally. They cannot.\n  Secondly, he said we have to discourage this migration. I am for \nthat. Who isn't for that? We need to discourage the exploitation of \nthese children and their families and do it in every manner possible. \nSo there is nothing in that suggestion that I think isn't already being \ndone.\n  The third thing is to fully enforce existing law. The point I tried \nto make to the Senator from Texas is the President is fully enforcing \nexisting laws. If people want to change the laws, let's have that \ndebate, but to argue the President is not enforcing existing laws is \nnot correct. He is. Those laws may need to be changed or addressed, but \nhe is dealing with them.\n  I wish to say a word, if I can, about an issue which has come up on \nthe floor and one that is near and dear to my heart. It was 13 years \nago when I got a call to my Chicago office. There was a Korean-American \nmother who had an 18-year-old daughter who was a musical prodigy. She \nplayed classical piano in high school and she had been offered a \nscholarship to the Manhattan School of Music. Her family was a poor \nimmigrant family and this was the chance of a lifetime. When the mother \nand daughter sat down to fill out the application to go to the \nManhattan School of Music, there was a question which asked, What is \nyour citizenship? She turned to her mother and asked, What do I put \nthere? And her mother said, I don't know. We brought you here under a \nvisitor's visa when you were 2 years old and we never filed any papers. \nThe daughter said, What are we going to do? The mother said, We will \ncall Durbin. So they called our office.\n  We looked into the law and the law was clear. The law was clear. This \n18-year-old girl under our law had to leave the United States for 10 \nyears and then apply to come back in. Where was she going to go? Her \nfamily was here. So the mother said to me, What can we do? I told her, \nUnder the law, almost nothing. So that is when I introduced the DREAM \nAct.\n\n  The DREAM Act says if a person is brought here as a child, an infant, \nunder the age of 16, and they completed high school and had no criminal \nrecord of any substance at all, if they served in our military or went \n2 years to college, they had a chance to become an American citizen. \nThat was the DREAM Act. I introduced it 13 years ago--13 years ago. It \nhas passed the House, but it didn't pass the Senate that year. It has \npassed the Senate as part of comprehensive immigration reform, but it \nhasn't passed the House.\n  So several years ago I wrote to the President. I said to the \nPresident, with 22 other Senators, Would you consider issuing an \nExecutive order saying you will not deport these DREAM children, these \nDREAMers--because they are eligible under bills that have passed both \nthe House and Senate--give them a suspension of deportation and allow \nthem to stay in the United States without fear of being deported? He \nsigned the Executive order. So almost 600,000 have stepped forward and \nthey have agreed they will submit the information to our government \nand, in turn, they will be spared deportation.\n  They are getting on with their lives. They are going to school and \ngetting jobs. Amazing things are happening for them. There are great \nstories, and I come to the floor and tell them all the time, but we \nstill don't have the final law. We have the President's Executive order \nwhich gives them a break now, but we still don't have the final law to \nresolve it.\n  I wish to tell a story about one of those DREAMers today. This is \nMarie Gonzalez Deel and her parents Marvin and Marina Gonzalez. Marvin \nand Marina brought Marie from Costa Rica to the United States in 1991 \nwhen Maria was 5 years old. They came to the United States legally on \ntemporary visas and settled in Jefferson City, MO. A lawyer said to \nthem, Put down roots, get a job, and you have a chance to become a \ncitizen.\n  The Gonzalez family bought a house, paid their taxes, and were active \nmembers of their church. Marvin was a mail courier for the Missouri \nGovernor. Marina taught Spanish at a local school, and Maria was at the \ntop of her high school class. They thought they had done everything \nright, but then Maria's family was placed in deportation proceedings. \nThe community of Jefferson City was angry that a good family such as \nthis who was part of their community was facing deportation. They \nrallied around them.\n  I first met Marie in 2005. She was one of the first DREAMers to tell \nher story publicly. Back then it was a pretty courageous thing to do. \nIt still is. At my request, the Department of Homeland Security granted \nher a stay of deportation, but 9 years ago Maria's parents were \ndeported back to Costa Rica.\n  In 2008, Marie graduated from Westminster College in Missouri with a \ndegree in political science and business, but her parents couldn't be \nthere to see her. They had been deported back to Costa Rica. In 2009, \nMarie married her college sweetheart and planned a second ceremony in \nCosta Rica so her parents could be a part of it. On Thanksgiving, 2010, \nshe and her husband flew to Costa Rica. As my colleagues can see from \nthis picture, they were elated to see one another for the first time in \n5 years.\n  Just a few hours later, Marvin, her father, who had prostate cancer, \ncollapsed. He was rushed to the hospital. He passed away later that \nsame day--the day this photograph was taken. Luckily, they got to see \nhim before he passed away. The family held a funeral the next day and \ncarried on with the Costa Rica wedding the following day with an empty \nchair at the head of the table where Marie's father would have been \nseated.\n  Today Marie is the proud mother of an 11-month-old baby girl, \nAraceli. In March 2014, Marie became a citizen of the United States. \nHere is what she wrote to me in a letter:\n\n       I was very blessed and thankful to get the opportunity to \n     stay in the United States on a temporary visa to be able to \n     finish my education, get a job, find my soul mate, and \n     eventually become a citizen, though at the cost of not \n     spending that time with my family and feeling alone for so \n     long. My family was torn apart when I was 18 and will never \n     be able to be reunited. My immigration\n\n[[Page S4109]]\n\n     struggle continues until the day I can once again have my mom \n     at my side. I hope other families don't have to endure this \n     pain.\n\n  There are 11 million stories in America, many of them just like this. \nHard-working men and women, law-abiding families, viable parts of our \nchurches and our communities, who had the courage to leave everything \nbehind and come to this great Nation. Those of us who are immigrants to \nthis country, which includes the Presiding Officer and myself--at least \nmy mother--thank our lucky stars we were given this chance. My mother \nwas an immigrant to this country and her son is a U.S. Senator from \nIllinois. She was brought here at the age of 2. Her naturalization \ncertificate is in my office upstairs. I am very proud of it. It is a \nreminder to me and a reminder to anyone who visits me that this is a \nnation of immigrants. We are a nation that thrives with the diversity \nof our immigration and the energy they bring, the courage they bring, \nleaving everything behind to come to this country. That is the family \nof the Presiding Officer, and that was my family. That is our story, \nbut that is America's story. That is who we are.\n  Have we reached the point where we cannot even discuss future \nimmigration in the House of Representatives? Have we reached a point \nwhere we cannot even bring the matter to the floor for a vote? Are we \ngoing to ignore what that means to this family and millions just like \nthem, what it means to the thousands of kids presenting themselves at \nthe border?\n  We are better than that. America is better than that. When we embrace \nour diversity, when we embrace immigration as part of who we are in \nAmerica, we will be stronger for it and not just in the creation of new \nbusinesses and jobs. These immigrants are some of the hardest working \npeople in America. They take the toughest jobs that a lot of Americans \nwould not touch, but they know that is what an immigrant does.\n  What is their dream? That their babies, their sons and daughters, are \ngoing to have a better life. Thank goodness that story has been \nrepeated over and over and over. That defines who we are in America.\n  Now--1 year later--the House of Representatives is about to throw up \nits hands and walk away from even addressing immigration issues. What a \nheartbreaking situation. What an abdication of responsibility.\n  I know there is a partisan difference between the House and the \nSenate, but I honestly believe that if the Speaker had the political \ncourage to call the comprehensive immigration bill--the bipartisan bill \nthat passed the Senate--we would find enough Republican House Members \nwho would stand and vote with the Democrats and pass it. Sure, there \nwill be critics of the Speaker--he shouldn't have done it--but that is \nwhat leadership calls for, for the Speaker to have that courage and get \nit done. I hope he will.\n  One year is long time to wait--and for these families, years and \nyears, some of them with broken dreams that will never be fulfilled, \nfamilies who have been split up and try to survive. But that is our \nresponsibility, not just for DREAMers but for our country, to make sure \nwe renew this commitment to our diversity and to immigration.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Remembering Howard Baker\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is with great sadness that I \nannounce the passing of one of the Senate's most towering figures, \nSenator Howard Baker.\n  The Senate sends its sincere condolences to the family of Senator \nBaker. In particular, we want to pass along our deep sympathies to his \nwife Nancy Landon Kassebaum Baker. Many of us served alongside Nancy in \nthe Senate, and we know this must be a difficult moment for her.\n  Senator Baker was a true pathbreaker. He served as Tennessee's first \npopularly elected Republican Senator since Reconstruction. He served as \nAmerica's first Republican majority leader since the time of \nEisenhower. He served his Nation with distinction as a member of the \nU.S. Navy, as Chief of Staff to President Reagan, and as our country's \nAmbassador to Japan.\n  Senator Baker truly earned his nickname, the ``Great Conciliator.'' I \nknow he will be remembered with fondness by Members of both political \nparties.\n  Again, let me express the Senate's sympathies to the Baker family. He \nwill be missed by the Senate and by his country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as the distinguished Republican leader has \nsaid, this body--the U.S. Senate--has lost a member of its family, \nTennessean Howard Baker.\n  We know of his long and distinguished career. He served three terms \nin the Senate. He served as minority leader and ended his career as \nmajority leader. He was an earnest man and worked with any and all \nMembers of this body in passing legislation for the good of America.\n  As the Republican leader has mentioned, he worked under the direction \nof President George W. Bush as Ambassador to Japan. He was President \nReagan's Chief of Staff. He was someone who could do everything.\n  He was well liked by Democrats and Republicans. He was a fine man. I \ndid not know him as well as my colleague the Republican leader or of \ncourse the two sitting Tennessee Senators.\n  He enjoyed an illustrious career in public service and it was \naccomplished, everyone said, by his hard work. He loved foreign affairs \nand did a great job. He was motivated by his heartfelt desire to do \ngood in the world. Our thoughts go to his family and his wife, whom I \nhad the good fortune to serve with.\n  I do say this: The two fine men who now serve in the Senate from \nTennessee, I am confident, learned a lot from Howard Baker because the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee is also a person who wants to try to work \nthings out. The junior Senator from Tennessee and I have had many \nconversations. I believe he also wants to be someone who works things \nout.\n  So my sympathy goes to Senator Baker's family and friends, especially \nthe two Senators from Tennessee, who I am sure are heartbroken as a \nresult of the loss of their mentor, friend, one of the great people to \ncome out of Tennessee, and there have been plenty.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to speak very briefly this \nafternoon to acknowledge a hero. I come to the floor just after the \nannouncement has been made about a leader in the Senate, Senator Baker. \nWhile I did not have the privilege of serving at the same time as he, \nmy father did. They were close friends, not only Senator Baker but \nSenator Kassebaum. My heart, my thoughts go out to the family. The \ncontributions clearly from Senator Baker on so many different levels \nare so greatly appreciated.\n\n\n               Tribute to Master Sergeant Roger D. Sparks\n\n  Madam President, I would like to spend just about 5 minutes this \nafternoon speaking of another hero, and this is a man who has \ndemonstrated above and beyond his commitment, his service to the United \nStates. I would like to speak about MSgt Roger D. Sparks.\n\n       It is my duty as a Pararescueman to save lives and to aid \n     the injured. I will be prepared at all times to perform my \n     assigned duties quickly and efficiently, placing these duties \n     before personal desires and comforts. The things I do, that \n     others may live.\n\n  ``The things I do, that others may live''--this is the solemn oath by \nwhich all pararescue airmen pledge their allegiance and dedicate their \nservice to our country. It is the sacred creed of a most honorable \nprofession.\n  Alaskans are extremely proud of the exceptionally heroic achievements \nof the Combat Search and Rescue Airmen assigned to the 176th Wing in \nthe Alaska Air National Guard. These airmen embody the core values of \nthe Air\n\n[[Page S4110]]\n\nForce--integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all they \ndo--and are undoubtedly the best our country has to offer.\n  The National Guard Bureau recently confirmed that the rescue \nsquadrons of the 176th Wing comprise the busiest Combat Search and \nRescue unit in the entire U.S. Air Force. This of course brings great \npride to us as Alaskans. These brave men and women risk their lives \nevery day so others may live, and I am honored to thank them for their \nservice and recognize the extraordinary bravery of one of their own.\n  I am pleased to honor one of these heroic pararescue airmen, \nspecifically a parajumper--or a PJ--one MSgt Roger D. Sparks from the \n212th Rescue Squadron out of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. In the \nnear future, the Air Force will award Sergeant Sparks with the Silver \nStar Medal for gallantry in combat during a daring, lifesaving rescue \nin the face of extreme danger in Afghanistan on November 14, 2010.\n  On that day, Sergeant Sparks--pictured here; the gentleman in the \nbackground; there he is with his pararescue team--responded to cries of \nhelp from an Army platoon pinned down on all sides by a fierce and \ncoordinated Taliban assault.\n  What started as a relatively routine rescue mission--and routine by \ntheir standards is still extremely heroic by any normal standard--this \nrescue mission quickly broke down into a dire situation that claimed \nthe lives of five U.S. soldiers but could have been an absolutely \ncatastrophic loss of life had it not been for the bravery and selfless \nactions of Sergeant Sparks and his team.\n  At the time of this rescue, the PJ team had been providing dedicated \nmedical evacuation support for the 101st Airborne unit during Operation \nBulldog Bite. This was a coalition offensive which was aimed at driving \nthe enemy out of the Watapur Valley in the Kunar Province of \nAfghanistan near its eastern border with Pakistan.\n  Throughout the 5-day operation, the team rescued 49 casualties and \nexecuted 30 hoist operations, most of which were done while they were \nexposed to enemy fire. The most significant of all these missions \nthough took place on November 14.\n  To paraphrase the account from Sergeant Sparks' team commander, Capt. \nKoa Bailey, what began as a relatively routine rescue operation for two \nwounded and one deceased soldier quickly turned into anything but \nroutine. As the rescue team approached the battle zone and took on \nfire, they quickly realized the situation was rapidly deteriorating for \nthe U.S. soldiers on the ground.\n  According to Captain Bailey, a different operator came on the radio, \nindicating that the first operator was hit. You could hear the fear in \nthe guy's voice. While we were listening it went from two to six \nwounded. So with complete disregard for their own safety, Captain \nBailey and Sergeant Sparks were lowered into the battle amidst a hail \nof enemy fire.\n  It was later determined that the hoist line used to lower them into \ncombat was actually even struck by several rounds. As soon as their \nboots hit the ground, a rocket-propelled grenade exploded less than 20 \nfeet away, knocking both airmen to the ground. Quickly gathering \nthemselves, Sergeant Sparks and Captain Bailey took charge of the \nbeleaguered platoon who were trapped in a furious, chaotic fight.\n  Sergeant Sparks and Captain Bailey were on their own to handle the \nsituation the best they could, with extremely limited first aid \nequipment and no ground artillery support. Over the next 5 hours, as \nbombs hammered enemy positions and bullets spattered against the rocks, \nSergeant Sparks abandoned cover to locate, consolidate, and treat the \nwounded.\n  According to his team commander, Sergeant Sparks selflessly exposed \nhimself to destructive enemy fire, in order to save American lives, \ncompetently handling the treatment of nine patients during the worst \npossible mass casualty situation.\n  Taken from the narrative:\n\n       When Sergeant Sparks exhausted his medical supplies, he \n     improvised using belts, T-shirts or boot strings in a \n     desperate attempt to keep his patients alive. After \n     assembling all the casualties in a central location, Sergeant \n     Sparks gathered body armor and positioned it around the \n     helpless soldiers to protect and shield them from enemy fire. \n     Repeatedly returning to the most critically wounded, Sergeant \n     Sparks performed vital medical procedures in a deliberate \n     process to ensure that each of the solders received continued \n     care and attention until airlift arrived.\n       He feverishly triaged chest wounds, punctured lungs, \n     shattered hips, fist-sized blast holes, eviscerated stomachs, \n     and arterial bleeders with extremely limited medical supplies \n     and only the light of the moon piercing the darkness of the \n     remote mountaintop. Upon return of evacuation aircraft, \n     Sergeant Sparks directed the hoisting of the most critically \n     injured and briefed the crews on each casualty's injuries and \n     medical requirements, choosing to remain behind until the \n     last man departed.\n\n  Sergeant Spark's quick and composed actions ensured nine solders \nreceived medical care as quickly as possible amidst constant enemy fire \nand despite extremely limited resources. Sergeant Sparks' leadership \nand courageous actions saved lives and allowed the remainder of the \ninfantry platoon to continue with their assigned mission. His \nextraordinary efforts under direct fire and in immediate danger to his \nown life resulted in saving four American lives and one host nation \ncivilian as well as returning four soldiers killed in action to their \nfamilies.\n  Tragically, the fierce battle ultimately claimed the lives of five \nsolders that day. All told, only eight soldiers of the platoon involved \nin the 6-hour battle were left with no visible wounds. However, if it \nwere not for the courage and selfless action of Sergeant Sparks, \nCaptain Bailey, and the entire rescue team, the loss of life would have \nbeen much higher.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to honor Sergeant Sparks' brave \nteammates, who also disregarded their own personal safety throughout \ntheir support of Operation Bulldog Bite so that others might live. \nThese men are: SSgt Aaron Parcha, SSgt Jimmy Settle, SSgt Ted \nSierocinski, TSgt Brandon Hill, MSgt Brandon Stuemke, SMSgt Christopher \n``Doug'' Widener, Capt. Marcus Maris, and Capt. Koaalii Bailey.\n  There were many heroes on that day, including these pararescuemen and \nthe soldiers that were engaged in battle. But I am particularly honored \nto congratulate MSgt Roger Sparks on the award of the Silver Star and \nthank him and his family for their dedicated and selfless service to \nour Nation.\n  As with all the members of the 176th Wing, I am absolutely in awe of \nhis achievement, eternally grateful for his service, and sincerely \nproud to have him serving in the great State of Alaska.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of Master Sergeant \nSparks' Silver Star Medal citation be printed in the Record.\n\n\n CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE SILVER STAR TO ROGER D. SPARKS\n\n       Master Sergeant Roger D. Sparks distinguished himself by \n     gallantry in connection with military operations against an \n     armed enemy of the United States as a Pararescue Jumper \n     assigned to the 212th Rescue Squadron in the Watapur Valley, \n     Afghanistan on 14 November 2010. On that date, Sergeant \n     Sparks responded to a call in support of Operation BULLDOG \n     BITE and the Army's 101st Airborne Division. While in the \n     air, circling the objective, the ground situation grew \n     extremely hostile and the number of casualties increased from \n     two to six. As a result of the increased fighting in the \n     area, Sergeant Sparks' team took the lead position for the \n     evacuation mission. With limited information regarding the \n     ground situation, Sergeant Sparks and Captain Bailey began \n     their 40 foot descent from the helicopter via a hoist to the \n     ground and immediately began taking enemy fire. Bullets flew \n     by the two pararescuers and the lowering cable was hit three \n     times while they dangled in the air. They yelled for rapid \n     descent and the flight engineer lowered them to the ground \n     with enemy rounds flying all around. Upon reaching the \n     ground, the pair was assaulted with a rocket propelled \n     grenade. Exploding just 20 feet away, the blast knocked them \n     both off their feet. As the gunner engaged the enemy with \n     danger close rounds, Sergeant Sparks ran approximately 70 \n     yards uphill, to take cover. As he approached the tree, it \n     was blown to pieces by another enemy fired rocket propelled \n     grenade. Still under intense enemy fire, with bombs hammering \n     danger close enemy positions, Sergeant Sparks abandoned cover \n     to provide aid to the wounded. Despite continued enemy fire \n     and with no concern for his personal safety, Sergeant Sparks \n     immediately performed lifesaving measures for nine wounded \n     Soldiers. He feverishly triaged chest wounds, punctured \n     lungs, shattered hips, fist sized blast holes, eviscerated \n     stomachs, and arterial bleeders with limited medical supplies \n     and only the light of the moon. Upon return of evacuation \n     aircraft, Sergeant Sparks directed evacuation of the injured \n     while briefing crews on each casualty's injuries and\n\n[[Page S4111]]\n\n     medical needs; choosing to remain behind until the last man \n     departed. His extraordinary efforts under direct, immediate \n     danger to his own life resulted in saving four American \n     lives, one Host Nation civilian and returning four Soldiers \n     killed in action to their families. By his gallantry and \n     devotion to duty, Sergeant Sparks has reflected great credit \n     upon himself and the United States Air Force.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                        Remembering Howard Baker\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak about the missing \ngirls from Nigeria who on the 73rd day are still held in captivity. But \nbefore I do, as a Senator I would like to express my sorrow to hear \nabout the passing of one of the great Senators, Howard Baker of \nTennessee.\n  Many Senators will come to the floor to extol what a great Senator he \nwas, what a great leader he was. I also want to take a moment to \nexpress my sympathy to his widow, another Senator, Senator Nancy \nKassebaum. When I came to the Senate, there was only one other woman, \nand that was Senator Nancy Kassebaum, then representing the great State \nof Kansas. She was a great friend to me. We served on the HELP \nCommittee. We worked together over many years. Then Senator Kassebaum \nretired.\n  She thought she was going back to Kansas, but she found herself in \nthe arms of Howard Baker. We watched a love story unfold that was so \nendearing to many of us. Senator Ted Kennedy and I were invited to the \nwedding of Howard Baker and Nancy Kassebaum. After the vows there was a \nbeautiful reception and they played the music. Howard and Nancy twirled \nand whirled around the floor. Then they turned to the crowd. Ted \nKennedy and I rushed out. I grabbed Howard, he grabbed Nancy, and we \ndid the bipartisan boogie through the night.\n  Those were the days that one remembers. That is the kind of spirit \nthe Senate had. That is the kind of spirit that Senator Howard Baker \nhad--that you could argue, you could debate, and so on, but deep down \nthe Senate should be the saucer that cools irrational passions of the \ntime. He was a great leader. He created this atmosphere of being able \nto come together and solve problems. So whether it was on the Senate \nfloor or whether it was on the dance floor, he really spoke about the \nneed for bipartisanship. Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker is exactly the \nsame way.\n  So remembering with such fondness, we want to express our condolences \nabout him and certainly to her as just one woman to another.\n\n\n                        Nigerian School Children\n\n  I also come to the floor today to talk about another sadness, the \nsadness about the fact that the Nigerian school girls who were abducted \nby Boko Haram continue to be held in captivity. I come to the floor to \nsay that just because it is not in the headline does not mean that \nthese girls are not still in danger for what has happened to them.\n  We need to continue to speak up and speak out. That is not to \nminimize Iraq. That is not to minimize Iran. This is not to minimize \nall of the other problems facing the world. But we all had Web sites \nand hashtags and so on saying: Bring our girls back home. I am here \ntoday saying to Boko Haram: We have not forgotten. We are proud that \nour President sent 80 troops to Chad to assist in the effort to locate \nthese kidnapped girls.\n  We understand that there continues to be the search effort. We do not \nwant it to be a recovery effort. We need it to be a rescue effort. \nThese girls were kidnapped. It is despicable. It is unacceptable. They \nare threatening to sell these girls into trafficking. Now after holding \nthem for 73 days, I have no idea what they have had to endure.\n  It goes on. They are continuing to kidnap children. They are \nkidnapping girls, some as young as 3 and 4. That was the other day. \nThey are also kidnapping little boys. What kind of organization is \nthis? Now, in response to the violence there, I know we, the women of \nthe Senate, signed a letter to President Obama asking for international \nsanctions against Boko Haram, and that they be added to the U.N. Al \nQaeda sanctions list. The United Nations actually acted. They actually \nacted promptly. So now they are on the terrorist list. We need to take \nall of the appropriate actions that support the sanctions that go with \nit.\n  I am hopeful we can find these girls. But we cannot stop our advocacy \nfor them, for close to 100 girls, and now for the new children that \nhave been kidnapped--boys as well as girls.\n  We need to be able to take all necessary international steps that are \nlegal to be able to rescue them and bring them home. Now this terrible, \nterrible situation has also generated the conversation about the \neducation of children around the world, particularly girls. For some \nreason, there are those around the world who do not want to see girls \nget a basic education. Malala, who wrote her book about it, took a \nbullet wound in her brain because she wanted to go to school, because \nshe wanted to learn to read. As she said: One child, one book at a \ntime, we can change the world.\n  We have put money in the Federal checkbook in foreign ops to really \nhelp with the education of the children around the world. Right now \nthere are 62 million girls throughout the world who are not in school. \nThey are not in school for two reasons. They are not in school because \nof the lack of capacity, like books and teachers, and they are not in \nschool because of the bigotry against them.\n  We need to do something. I know that we are moving towards a vote. I \nsay to Boko Haram: Let these girls go. Let's bring them back home. I \nsay for those who are searching for them: Do not lose heart. We have \ngot to deal with that. But we also have to come to grips with the fact \nthat we cannot let millions of girls around the world not have access \nto education. Education is as important as water. We need water to \nlive. You need education to make a life for yourself.\n  We look forward to working with our colleagues across the aisle. We \nhope to move the foreign ops bill that has money in the Federal \ncheckbook to do this. When we return from the break I will have more to \nsay. I hope it will be: Thank God we found them and we brought them \nback to their mothers and fathers.\n  Millions of these girls who fight for their right to attend school \nare risking their lives.

RES. 487\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the facts \nregarding the ongoing IRS scandal that the Obama administration refuses \nto investigate, refuses to prosecute, refuses to address with honesty \nand integrity. I want to talk about the facts we know and the facts we \ndon't know, and how we as the Senate can demonstrate fidelity to law \nand the integrity of the U.S. Government.\n  Let's talk about what we know.\n  We know that more than 1 year ago on May 14, 2013, the inspector \ngeneral of the Treasury Department said that beginning in 2010 the IRS \nhad improperly targeted conservative citizen groups, tea party groups, \npro-Israel groups, and pro-life groups. The day the inspector general's \nreport was made public, President Obama had described what occurred as \n``intolerable and inexcusable.'' As President Obama put it: ``Americans \nhave a right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it.''\n  Well, if President Obama was speaking the truth when he said over a \nyear ago that Americans have a right to be angry about this, then today \nafter over a year of obstruction of justice, of refusing to investigate \nor prosecute what happened under President Obama's own standard, the \nAmericans have a right to be far more than angry about it.\n  Likewise, the very same day the inspector general report came out, \nAttorney General Eric Holder said the IRS targeting the conservative \ngroups was ``outrageous and unacceptable.'' That was more than a year \nago.\n  What has happened in the year and 2 months that have passed since \nthen? Although both the President and the Attorney General profess \noutrage and anger, not a single person has been indicted--not a single \nperson. Although both the President and the Attorney General said they \nwould investigate this matter, it has been publicly reported that no \nindictments are planned. In fact, President Obama went on national \ntelevision during the Super Bowl and categorically stated, ``There was \nnot even a smidgeon of corruption to be found at the IRS.''\n  How far we had come from the day the scandal broke when he said he \nwas angry and the American people had a right to be angry. Fast forward \na few months later and he goes on television and says there is not a \nsmidgeon of corruption.\n  That is a remarkable statement for the President to have made, \nbecause Attorney General Eric Holder 4 days earlier had told the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that there was an ongoing investigation being \nconducted at the IRS.\n  President Obama's comments and Eric Holder's comments are facially \ninconsistent. Either Eric Holder was telling the truth, that there is, \nin fact, a meaningful ongoing investigation, or President Obama was \ntelling the truth when he said conclusively there is not a smidgeon of \ncorruption. One or the other was not telling the truth or perhaps \nPresident Obama was simply prejudging the investigation. Perhaps \nPresident Obama was simply attempting to influence its outcome, making \nclear that the outcome desired from the White House is that there is \nnot a smidgeon of corruption. What happened to the American people \nhaving a right to be angry? Now the President is instead telling \ninvestigators the conclusion they should reach.\n  Regardless, it is beyond dispute that the Obama administration, the \nJustice Department, has not held anyone accountable for this gross \nabuse of power.\n  In a hearing in January of this year, Attorney General Eric Holder \nrefused to answer whether even a single victim of the wrongful \ntargeting has been interviewed.\n  Let me repeat that. The victims who were targeted wrongly by the \nIRS--the citizens--for exercising their political free speech rights, \nthe Attorney General refused to answer if they had even bothered to \ninterview any of those citizens.\n  We also note some of the emails that have been made public give the \nappearance that the Department of Justice may have been directly \ninvolved in the illegal targeting of citizen groups based on their \npolitical views.\n  Most stunningly, we know that the lead attorney investigating this \nmatter is a major Democratic donor and a major donor to President \nObama. Indeed, she has given over $6,000 to President Obama and \nDemocrats in recent years.\n  No reasonable person would trust John Mitchell to investigate Richard \nNixon. Yet the Obama administration is telling the American people the \ninvestigation into the wrongful targeting of conservatives will be led \nby a major Obama Democratic donor. That is contemptuous. It is \ncontemptuous of the law; it is contemptuous of the American people. One \nwould think that if you appoint a major Obama donor to lead the \ninvestigation, it is likely that the victims would not be interviewed, \nthat no one would be indicted. And, wonder of wonders, what has \nhappened? The victims have not been interviewed and no one has been \nindicted.\n  But that is not all. We have seen Lois Lerner, the head of the IRS \noffice that illegally targeted conservative citizens, go before \nCongress and repeatedly plead the Fifth. When a senior government \nofficial takes the Fifth, that is an action that should be taken very \nseriously. Yet it seems in this town partisan politics trumps fidelity \nto law. What Lois Lerner said in the House of Representatives by \npleading the Fifth is effectively standing there saying, ``If I answer \nyour question, I may well implicate myself in criminal conduct.'' That \nis chilling.\n  Let me note with sadness that the Democratic Members of this Chamber \nseem to have no concern about a senior IRS official pleading the Fifth \nrepeatedly because truthfully answering the questions could implicate \nher in criminal conduct.\n  Throughout it all Americans have been told that the Obama \nadministration would find out what happened and would take the \nnecessary actions.\n  Indeed, the new head of the IRS, Commissioner John Koskinen, promised \nas much. Now we find out that this new Commissioner is also a major \ndonor to President Obama and Democratic causes. This new Commissioner \nof the IRS has given nearly $100,000 to the Democratic Party, including \n$7,300 to President Obama. What fairminded person would entrust not one \nbut two major Obama donors to investigate how the IRS used political \npower to go after the enemies of President Obama? Not one but two--the \nlead lawyers in the Department of Justice heading up the \nnoninvestigation that is not interviewing the victims, that is not \nindicting anyone, and the head of the IRS giving nearly $100,000 to \nDemocratic causes.\n  We received even more striking news, that Commissioner Koskinen tells \nus the IRS lost Lois Lerner's emails. Oops, sorry. The dog ate my \nhomework.\n  Madam President, if you or I tried that in our IRS returns, they \nwouldn't accept that excuse from a citizen. We are told the hard drive \ncrashed and the documents are irretrievable under any circumstances. We \nalso know the IRS didn't follow the law when it failed to\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\nreport the hard drive crash that we are told occurred. But make no \nmistake, these emails haven't just been lost. These emails have been \ndeleted, taped over, and the hard drive physically destroyed ccording \nto public news reports. This is Rosemary Woods, when you have Federal \nGovernment officials destroying evidence. In the ordinary parlance that \nis called obstruction of justice. The hard drive magically collapses, \nmagically crashes, and is physically destroyed right after the \ninvestigation begins and, I would remind you, the investigation that \nhas resulted in Lois Lerner pleading the Fifth twice.\n  We are supposed to believe that the emails from the IRS officials in \ncharge of the division that illegally targeted political organizations \nand has repeatedly pleaded the Fifth to avoid incriminating herself, \nthat her emails have simply vanished innocuously. It happens. It \nhappens to people in the middle of illegal acts. Their records \nmagically disappear right when the investigators are seeking to \ndiscover them.\n  This is an outrage. This is a scandal. This is an insult to anyone \nconcerned about the rule of law, and no one in the Senate, regardless \nof political party, should stand by and accept this.\n  But it doesn't end there.\n  On Wednesday it was reported that Lois Lerner flagged a speaking \ninvitation for Republican Senator Charles Grassley for examination. \nSenator Grassley is the highest ranking Republican on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee who has been a strong and powerful voice for \naccountability at the Department of Justice. It is curious that she \nwould be so eager to subject Senator Grassley for extra scrutiny based \non a speaking invitation.\n  Right now, today, the White House is in control of Democrats. There \nwill come a time when Democrats no longer control the White House and \nthe administration. I would ask every Democratic Member of this body, \nhow comfortable are you with the precedent that the IRS can single out \nDemocratic Senators who might disagree with the President's political \nposition? The targeting of Chuck Grassley, the singling out of Chuck \nGrassley, ought to trouble every single Member of this body.\n  On Tuesday it was reported that the IRS agreed to pay $50,000 in \ndamages to the National Organization for Marriage because the IRS \nadmittedly unlawfully released confidential information of members of \nthat group to its political opposition.\n  Let me repeat that. IRS officials have publicly admitted--this is not \ninference, this is not suggestion, this is what they have admitted--\nthat they leaked personal tax information for the purpose of \nintimidating a conservative group to the political opposition of that \ngroup. That is textbook abuse of power. And I would note the $50,000 \nfine--which, by the way, has been paid by U.S. taxpayers--the $50,000 \nfine does nothing to address the partisan political corruption at the \nIRS, the abuse of power, or the coverup. A fine does not signal the \nproblem has been fixed.\n  I would note, by the way, where are the Democratic Members of this \nbody standing and saying it is wrong for the IRS to illegally hand over \npersonal information from individual taxpayers for partisan purposes to \ntheir political opponents?\n  I want to underscore that the IRS has admitted they did this and paid \na $50,000 fine and the Democratic Members of this body are apparently \nnot troubled at all. If they are troubled, they keep their troubles \nvery quiet and to themselves.\n  Americans need a guarantee that the IRS will never be used again to \ntarget an administration's political enemy.\n  When a Republican President, Richard Nixon, attempted to use the IRS \nto target his political enemies, it was wrong. It was an abuse of \npower, and he was rightfully condemned on both sides of the aisle. Both \nDemocrats and Republicans stood up to President Nixon when he attempted \nto use the IRS to target his political enemies and said: This is wrong.\n  The Obama administration didn't just attempt to do so, it succeeded. \nIt carried out a concerted effort and targeted those who were perceived \nto be political enemies of the President and targeted those individual \ncitizens. The administration then put two major Democratic donors in \ncharge of the investigation and covered up the truth, including \nconveniently losing emails from the central player in this figure who \nhas twice pleaded the Fifth.\n  It was wrong when Richard Nixon tried to use the IRS to target his \npolitical enemies, and it was wrong when the Obama administration tried \nand succeeded to do the same. The difference is when Richard Nixon did \nso, Republicans had the courage to stand up to Members of their own \nparty. It saddens me that there is not a single Democratic Member of \nthis body who has had the courage to stand up to their own party and \nsay: This abuse of power--using the IRS to target citizens for \npolitical beliefs--is wrong.\n  We need a special prosecutor with meaningful independence to make \nsure justice is served and that our constitutional rights to free \nspeech, to assembly, and to privacy are protected.\n  It saddens me to say that the U.S. Department of Justice, under \nAttorney General Eric Holder, has become the most partisan Department \nof Justice in the history of our country. I say this as a former \nassociate deputy attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice. I \ncan tell you there are Democratic alumni across this country who are \nsaddened and heartbroken to see the Department of Justice becoming \neffectively an arm of the Democratic National Committee.\n  IRS officials have stonewalled at every turn, and we should not wait \na single minute to put an end to the intimidation and bullying of the \nAmerican people. These are not the actions of a government that \nrespects its citizens. We need to restore that respect, that government \nofficials work for the people and not the other way around.\n  The Department of Justice has a storied history. There is a history \nof attorneys general standing up to political pressure, even against \nthe Presidents who have appointed them. Listen, political pressure in \nthis town is nothing new and attorneys general throughout history have \nhad a special mettle of being willing to look into the eyes of the \nPresident who appointed them and willing to say: I care more about the \nrule of law than any partisan allegiance I might have.\n  When President Richard Nixon faced charges of abusing government \npower for partisan ends, his attorney general Elliot Richardson, a \nRepublican, appointed Archibald Cox as special prosecutor. Likewise, \nwhen President Bill Clinton faced charges of ethical impropriety, his \nattorney general Janet Reno, a Democrat, appointed Robert Fiske as \nindependent counsel. Sadly, the current attorney general has refused to \nlive up to that bipartisan tradition of independence, of integrity, and \nof fidelity to law.\n  I have repeatedly called on Attorney General Eric Holder to remove \nthe investigation from the hands of a major Obama donor and put it \ninstead in the hands of a special prosecutor with meaningful \nindependence who, at a minimum, is not a major Democratic donor. Even \nthe very slightest respect for the rule of law would suggest that the \nattorney general should not be part and parcel of the political and \npartisan coverup.\n  Therefore, in a few moments I intend to ask for unanimous consent to \ncall up a Senate resolution expressing the opinion of the Senate that \nthe Attorney General should appoint a special prosecutor to investigate \nand prosecute--if the facts support--the IRS targeting of Americans and \nits potential coverup of those actions.\n  When I asked the Attorney General whether the Department of Justice \ninvestigated the direct involvement of political appointees at the \nWhite House--up to and including the President--Attorney General Holder \nrefused to answer that question. That is always the hardest thing for \nan attorney general to do: Ask the question that raises partisan peril. \nThat is why attorneys general are supposed to be nonpartisan and owe \ntheir fidelity to the Constitution and the laws of this United States \nand to the American people.\n  The House of Representatives has passed a similar resolution to the \none I am submitting. It was sponsored by Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio \non May 7, 2014. The resolution passed in the House 250 to 168. Twenty-\nsix Democrats voted in favor of the resolution.\n  Why is it that Democrats in the House of Representatives can muster \nup the courage to stand up to the partisan pressure from the White \nHouse.\n\n[[Page S4115]]\n\nYet in the Senate we hear crickets chirping. This used to be the body \npraised for its independence and for its ability to stand up to abuse \nof power.\n  Just today the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Obama \nadministration for the 12th time in the last 2 years in its assertion \nof overbroad executive authority. This time it asserted that the \nPresident unconstitutionally attempted to circumvent the checks and \nbalances of the Constitution by unilaterally appointing recess \nappointments while the Senate was not in recess.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously, by a vote of 9 to 0, said the \nPresident's actions were unconstitutional in that case, and once again, \nas with the IRS, my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle were \nsilent. How is it there is no longer a Robert Byrd, that there is no \nlonger a Ted Kennedy, that there are no longer any Democrats who will \ndefend the institutional integrity of the Senate? How is it when the \nSupreme Court concludes unanimously that the President's intrusion on \nthe Senate's constitutional authority is unconstitutional not a single \nSenate Democrat has the courage to stand up to this President? How is \nit in the face of a senior IRS official repeatedly pleading the Fifth, \nhow is it in the face of the IRS admitting it wrongfully handed over \nprivate personal IRS tax data to the political opponents of a citizens \ngroup and paid a $50,000 fine for it, how is it that not a single \nDemocratic Senator does not have the courage to speak up? At what point \ndoes it become too much? At what point does it become embarrassing?\n  Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley, whom I might note is a \nliberal and voted for President Obama in 2008, said that President \nObama has become the embodiment of the imperial President. He described \nhow Barack Obama has become the President Richard Nixon always wished \nhe could be. I am sorry to say that he has done so with the active \naiding and abetting of 55 Democratic Members of this Senate because \nwhen Democratic Members of this Senate or any Member of this Senate \nstands by and allows the President to trample on the rule of law, then \nany one of us who remains silent is explicit in undermining the \nConstitution.\n\n  This resolution should be unanimous. If the tables were turned and \nthis were a Republican President and a Republican Attorney General had \nappointed a major Republican donor to lead the investigation into the \nwrongful targeting of Democrats and destroyed emails and hard drives \nand publicly admitted to leaking private citizen information to the \npolitical opponents of Democrats, the Democratic side of this Chamber \nwould rightly be lighting their hair on fire.\n  If this were a Republican administration, every media outlet would \nhave banner headlines every single day. I can assure you that at least \nsome Republican Senators would be standing up and saying this abuse of \npower is wrong.\n  This resolution should be unanimous because everyone should agree \nthat an investigation should be beyond reproach and should not be \nhanded over to major Democratic donors.\n  If the allegation--which the report of the inspector general of \nTreasury has already confirmed in significant respect--is of abuse of \ngovernment power of the IRS to target citizens for their political \nbeliefs, then you cannot entrust the investigation to someone who is \npartisan and has a political interest in protecting the party in power. \nIf Attorney General Eric Holder continues to refuse to appoint a \nspecial prosecutor, he should be impeached.\n  When an attorney general refuses to enforce the rule of law, mocks \nthe rule of law, and corrupts the Department of Justice by conducting a \nnakedly partisan investigation to cover up political wrongdoing, that \nconduct, by any reasonable measure, constitutes high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.\n  Attorney General Eric Holder has the opportunity to do the right \nthing. He can appoint a special prosecutor with meaningful independence \nwho is not a major Obama donor. Yet every time the Attorney General has \nbeen called on to do this, he has defiantly said no. In fact, he said \nin writing in his discretion, no. If Attorney General Eric Holder \ncontinues to refuse to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the \nabuse of power by the IRS against the American people, he should be \nimpeached.\n  I agree with President Obama when he said on the day this scandal \nbroke, the American people have a right to be angry. If the American \npeople had a right to be angry over a year ago when the scandal broke, \nthe fact that it has now been covered up and the fact that a partisan \ninvestigation has refused to begin to scratch the surface of what \nhappened should make the American people more than angry. It should \nmove them to action. It should move them to accountability. It should \nmove them to hold the officials of our government responsible.\n  Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 487. I further ask consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nmade and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nwhich oversees the IRS, I have a question as to whether bringing in a \nspecial prosecutor would be a good use of taxpayer money in this case. \nI am going to spend a few minutes laying out what is actually going on \nwith respect to this matter.\n  There are already five IRS investigations that have either concluded \nor are ongoing. There was the original Treasury inspector general \naudit, in addition to ongoing investigations by four congressional \ncommittees, the Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and the \nSenate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  The Senate Finance Committee, the committee I chair, has been \nconducting a bipartisan investigation for more than a year. I repeat: \nThis is a bipartisan investigation. In fact, the committee's report was \nessentially ready to be released last week when the IRS informed us \nthat some emails were missing because of a hard drive crash. So that \ncolleagues understand just how bipartisan our effort has been, Senator \nHatch and I have worked closely on this every step of the way since I \nhad the honor of becoming the chair of the Finance Committee. When we \nheard of the hard drive problem, the two of us, a Democrat and a \nRepublican, immediately asked the IRS Commissioner to come to my office \nwhere we asked pointed questions of Commissioner Koskinen. We didn't \nwait 10 days. We didn't wait a week. The two of us, a Democrat and a \nRepublican, felt it was an important part of our committee's bipartisan \ninquiry, so we had Mr. Koskinen come to our office. And this has just \nbeen one example--it happens to be very recent--of the bipartisan \nefforts that have been made looking into this matter.\n  The Finance Committee staff, Democrats and Republicans, have reviewed \nover 700,000 pages of documents and interviewed 30 IRS employees. Those \ninterviews were done jointly. We had Democrats and Republicans doing \nthem together. Now, as we continue to look at how this is going to \nunfold, the Treasury Department Inspector General--that is Mr. Russell \nGeorge--has agreed to investigate the most recent matter, and he \nbriefed our staff just yesterday on the work plan for getting their \ninvestigation done promptly. Once the committee determines what \nhappened with the hard drive crashes, then the committee will, again on \na bipartisan basis, move forward with releasing our report--the report \nthat was almost ready to be released when the IRS informed us that the \nemails were missing because of a hard drive crash and when Senator \nHatch and I together brought Mr. Koskinen immediately to my office.\n  I heard my colleague say that things would be different if this were \na Republican administration. Well, I want it understood--I want every \nSenator to understand this. Senator Hatch and I would be doing exactly \nwhat we are doing now, with the same diligence, if it was a Republican \nadministration. That, in my view, is the bottom line, because that is \nwhat bipartisanship is\n\n[[Page S4116]]\n\nall about. That is the way an important inquiry ought to be handled.\n  There is nothing of value that a special prosecutor would bring to \nthe table, and it certainly would involve significant cost to American \ntaxpayers. In fact, many of us can remember special prosecutors abusing \ntheir power, spending millions of dollars of taxpayer money, and going \non for years and years without concluding their investigations. Too \noften, special prosecutors have turned into lawyers' full employment \nprograms. They ought to be reserved for when there is evidence of \ncriminal wrongdoing inside the government. It would be premature to \nappoint a special prosecutor with the bipartisan Finance Committee \nreport almost finished.\n  I will just close by saying I am a pretty bipartisan fellow. In fact, \nsometimes I get a fair amount of criticism for being too bipartisan. I \nwant it understood this is a bipartisan inquiry that is being done by \nthe book. Senator Hatch and I are looking at these matters together. We \ntalk about it frequently. Those witnesses were interviewed together. We \nbrought Mr. Koskinen in immediately. My view is that it would be \npremature to appoint a special prosecutor with the bipartisan Finance \nCommittee report almost finished.\n  If we look at this in terms of what is at issue now, we can bring the \nfacts to light with our own investigators and our own bipartisan \ninquiry and avoid the special prosecutor disasters of the past.\n  I object to the Senator's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I thank my friend from Oregon for his \nimpassioned comments. I would note for the Record a few things he did \nnot say. My friend from Oregon chose not to say a word about the fact \nthat Lois Lerner, a senior IRS official, has twice pleaded the Fifth in \nfront of the House of Representatives. To that he had not a single \nresponse.\n  My friend from Oregon chose to say not a word to the fact that the \nIRS singled out Senator Chuck Grassley for special scrutiny. To that, \nhe said not a word.\n  My friend from Oregon chose to say not a word to the fact that the \nIRS has now admitted to illegally handing over private personal \ninformation from a citizen group to its political opponents for \npartisan political purposes, and has paid a $50,000 fine. That is not \nan allegation. That is not a theory. That is what the IRS has admitted \nto and paid a $50,000 fine for with taxpayer funds. Yet I am sorry to \nsay my friend from Oregon had not a word to say about that abuse of \npower.\n  I mentioned before that from the Democratic Members of this Chamber, \nwhen it comes to the abuse of power by the Obama administration, there \nare crickets chirping.\n\n       Now, I am pleased that my friend from Oregon and the \n     Finance Committee has engaged in an investigation of what \n     occurred. We don't know what that investigation will \n     conclude. But I find it interesting that he said it is \n     premature for a special prosecutor. Fourteen months ago was \n     when President Obama said: I am angry and the American people \n     have a right to be angry--14 months ago. Fourteen months and \n     not a single person has been indicted. Fourteen months and \n     most of the victims haven't been interviewed. Fourteen months \n     they have publicly announced they don't intend to indict \n     anyone. Yet, it is premature. If the American people had a \n     right to be angry 14 months ago, which is what President \n     Obama told us, what should we feel 14 months later after \n     partisan stonewalling and obstruction of justice? The \n     American people had a right to be angry.\n\n  I would note a Senate committee is conducting an investigation and \nwill issue a report, but the Senate committee can't indict anyone. The \nSenate committee can't prosecute anyone. My friend from Oregon says it \nis premature to have a special prosecutor because, apparently, holding \npeople who break the laws, who commit criminal conduct to abuse IRS \npower to target individual citizens based on their political views--\napparently, holding them accountable--is not a priority for a single \nDemocratic member of this Chamber. That saddens me.\n  It saddens me that we don't have 100 Senators in this room saying, \nregardless of what party we are in, it is an embarrassment to have this \n``investigation''--and I put that word in quotes, because a real \ninvestigation involves interviewing the victims; a real investigation \ninvolves following the evidence where it leads. I would note my friend \nfrom Oregon, in describing the Senate committee's investigation, \nmentioned that they interviewed some IRS employees, but notably absent \nfrom whom he said they interviewed was anyone at the White House, \nanyone political. Apparently, they were not interviewed. We don't know. \nBut he didn't mention them if they were.\n\n  It is an embarrassment that this so-called investigation is led by a \npartisan Democratic donor who has given over $6,000 to President Obama \nand Democrats. It is an embarrassment that the IRS obstruction of \njustice is led by a major Democratic donor who has given nearly \n$100,000. Every one of us takes an oath to the Constitution. Every one \nof us owes fidelity to rule of law. When we have the Department of \nJustice behaving like an arm of the DNC, protecting the political \ninterests of the White House instead of upholding the law, it \nundermines the liberty of every American. I am saddened that Democratic \nMembers of this Chamber will not stand up and say: I have a higher \nobligation to the Constitution and the rule of law and the American \npeople than I have to my Democratic Party. That is a sad state of \naffairs, but it is also a state of affairs that is outraging the \nAmerican people, that is waking up the American people.\n  President Obama had it right when he said 14 months ago the American \npeople are right to be angry about this. He was correct. And when \nelected officials, when appointed officials of the Obama administration \nmock the rule of law, demonstrate contempt for Congress, and abuse \ntheir power against the individual citizenry, against we the people, \nthe people have a natural and immediate remedy that is available in \nNovember every 2 years. This November, I am confident the American \npeople will follow the President's advice and demonstrate that they are \nangry about the abuse of power and even angrier about the partisan \ncoverup in which all 55 Democratic Senators have actively aided and \nabetted.\n  If Attorney General Eric Holder is unwilling to appoint a special \nprosecutor, if he insists on keeping this prosecution in the control of \na major Obama donor, then Attorney General Eric Holder should be \nimpeached, because the rule of law matters more than any partisan \npolitical problem.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, first of all, let me thank the Senator \nfrom Texas for raising this issue of the IRS. I have commented over the \nlast few days that if this was, in fact, a Republican administration \nthat had been engaged in this issue, this would have led every newscast \nin America. It would have been leading every newscast in America for \nthe last week. It would have been compared to Watergate. Instead, what \nwe have seen is the American news media, by and large, has largely \nignored it.\n  One of the commentators last night on television added up all the \nminutes they dedicated to a soccer player who bit some other competitor \ncompared to the amount of time they have dedicated to the fact that one \nof the most powerful agencies of the U.S. Government not just destroyed \nrecords, potentially--but even now we have been given news they tried \nto target a U.S. Senator for an internal audit--and the soccer player \nwon. He got a lot more attention. There was a lot more news coverage \npaid to the guy who bit somebody than to the issue of the IRS.\n  So I thank the Senator from Texas for raising it here today before we \nhead to our respective States for the Fourth of July because it is an \nissue that deserves our attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4116-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4116-S4117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORLD CUP SOCCER\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. There is another issue that deserves our attention. By the \nway, on the subject of soccer, since I am on it, I will confess I am \nnot an expert on soccer, nor have I, frankly, historically been an \nenormous fan. To me football means you wear a helmet and some shoulder \npads and you run into\n\n[[Page S4117]]\n\neach other pretty hard. But I have grown in admiration of the game \ngiven the following it has internationally and given the performance of \nour team, and I wish to congratulate Team USA. Despite losing today's \ngame, they have achieved the honor of advancing into the round of 16 in \nthe World Cup as we all watched and are excited about those prospects \nand are encouraged about the future of U.S. soccer and our prospects in \nthe world cup.\n  So congratulations to them, to their families and to all fans of U.S. \nsoccer all over the world and here in Washington cheering them on. If \nthere is one thing that brought us together here this week, it is that, \nand we are grateful for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4117-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4117-S4118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               VENEZUELA\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, there is a topic I would like to discuss \nbefore we leave for the Fourth of July recess and return to our States. \nOne is an enormous story in my home State and, in particular, in my \nhometown of Miami, and that is the ongoing crisis in Venezuela. I have \nbeen talking about it for the better part of 3 months with regard to \nwhat is occurring there. It is pretty straightforward. There is an \nauthoritarian government in Venezuela that has cracked down on the \npeople in Venezuela, has crushed any sort of political dissent or tried \nto crush any form of political dissent. If a person is an outspoken \ncritic of the Venezuelan government, they either wind up in jail or in \nexile.\n  In fact, the President of Venezuela, someone who won a fraudulent \nelection just a year and a half ago, has now begun to turn on people in \nhis own party when they dare to criticize him.\n  But the evidence is clear. First of all, the Venezuelan economy today \nis a disaster. The state of the Venezuela economy today is increasingly \nreminiscent of what is happening in Cuba: shortages of basic items, the \ninability to buy a bar of soap or toilet paper or toothpaste. The \nshortages are extraordinary.\n  We are talking about one of the richest countries in the hemisphere--\na nation blessed with a talented and educated population and with \nnatural resources, and particularly oil--and this guy in charge of that \ncountry has ruined Venezuela and its economy. That in and of itself is \nworthy of condemnation.\n  But what is even more apparent is how he has cracked down on \npolitical dissent in Venezuela. We have documented how over 40 people \nhave now lost their lives in protests on Venezuela--by the way, \nprotests that began when a student was sexually assaulted at a \nuniversity. They protested the lack of security, and the security \nforces of Venezuela responded--not by going after the assailants but by \ngoing after the student protesters. Since then, opposition leaders have \nbeen jailed, Members of the opposition in the Parliament have been \nremoved from their seats, and Venezuela continues to spiral out of \ncontrol.\n  There have been gross human rights violations in Venezuela at the \ndirection of the Venezuelan Government by organisms of the Venezuelan \nGovernment and extragovernmental organizations as well.\n  So in light of what is happening in Venezuela, and in light of the \nfact that so many people who live in Florida are impacted deeply by \nwhat is happening in Venezuela--because they are originally from there, \nbecause they have family there or because they conduct business there \nor because they care about what happens in our hemisphere--because of \nall of these things, not only have I been talking about this issue on \nthe Senate floor but we began to take action.\n  The first thing we did was we passed a resolution from this Senate--\nand I thank my colleagues; it passed unanimously--condemning these \nhuman rights violations. I know sometimes we sit around here and \nwonder: What is the point of these resolutions?\n  They matter. I cannot tell you how many people are aware of what we \nhave done here in the Senate, just speaking out and condemning these \nviolations and making it very clear whose side we are on. We are on the \nside of the democratic aspirations and the rights of the people of \nVenezuela.\n  The second thing we did is we worked through the process here because \nunlike the way Maduro runs his government in Venezuela, here we have a \nrepublic and this Senate is an important part of that republic. We \nfiled a bill to sanction individuals--not the government, not the \ncountry--individuals in the Venezuelan Government responsible for these \nhuman rights violations. In fact, in the committee I named 25 of them. \nThat piece of legislation--that law--sanctioning the leaders in \nVenezuela passed the committee almost unanimously with bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Let me take a moment to thank Senator Menendez, the chairman of that \ncommittee, for his leadership on this issue and my colleague from \nFlorida Bill Nelson for his leadership on this issue, even though he is \nnot on the committee. When we held a hearing on the issue of Venezuela, \nhe went to the hearing and he attended an event we did in Miami with \nthe Venezuelan community to talk about this reality.\n  That bill passed out of our committee. In addition to passing out of \nthis committee, a very similar bill passed out of the House under the \nleadership of Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen. Both the Senate and the \nHouse--and they passed it off the floor of the House.\n  So the Venezuelan sanctions bill is ready for action here on the \nfloor of the Senate. Knowing that it was a noncontroversial issue, that \nthere is almost unanimous support for it, I have attempted to pass this \nbill by something we call unanimous consent, which basically means that \nthe cloakrooms call the respective offices and they ask all of the \nMembers: We are going to try to pass this bill. Do you have an \nobjection? The reason why we do it that way is so we can save time so \nwe have the time available to debate these other issues that are before \nus--especially on an issue that is not controversial. We pass a lot of \nlaw around here that way.\n  Unfortunately, there have been some objections--one from each side. I \nam happy to report that one of those two objections has been removed. \nIt came from the Democratic side. The majority removed their objection. \nSo it appears this bill is ready to move forward, but for the objection \nof one colleague of ours, who has the right to object, and who, quite \nfrankly, has objections to it that he believes strongly about and we \nare respectful of.\n  What I am asking for at this point is--given that objection--when we \ncome back from the recess, I am hoping that one way or another we will \nget a chance to vote. This is an issue that virtually every Member of \nthe Senate but for one or two--at this point it appears one--is \nsupportive of. I hope we can pass it because it is important. It will \nmatter. This is not sanctions, for example, like the ones we have seen \nin the past on other countries. These are extremely targeted. These are \ntargeted against individuals in the Venezuelan Government who have \ndirected or carried out gross human rights violations.\n  They will be impactful because many of these people in the Venezuelan \nGovernment who are conducting these human rights violations actually \nspend their weekends in the United States. They fly on the private jets \nthey bought with stolen money to the United States to stay in their \nfancy condominiums or their mansions. They shop at our stores. They \nparade up our streets. And then Monday morning they go back to work \nfull time violating human rights.\n  So these sanctions will matter. These human rights violators in \nVenezuela have investments in the United States. In fact, when they \nsteal money from Venezuela, often times they use straw companies and \nstraw purchasers to invest that money in our economy--predominantly in \nFlorida, but also in other places.\n  There is no reason in the world why they should not be sanctioned for \nwhat they have done. There is no reason in the world why we should not \nbe going after these individuals for what they have done.\n  One of the cornerstones of our foreign policy must always be the \nprotection of human rights anywhere in the world where they are \nchallenged or oppressed. This gives us an opportunity to speak in a \nclear voice in a part of the world that, quite frankly, both parties \nhave been guilty of neglecting. I have spent plenty of time around here \ntalking about what is going on in Syria and what is going on in Iraq, \nand that\n\n[[Page S4118]]\n\nis a very dangerous issue that is occurring there. The counterterrorism \nrisks that are posed by ISIL in Iraq and Syria are dramatic and deserve \na lot of attention. We have spent time on the floor talking about what \nhas happened in Ukraine and Russia's illegal actions with regard to \nCrimea, and they deserve attention. We have spent some time even \ntalking about the Chinese ambitions in the Asian-Pacific region and \ntheir illegitimate territorial claims.\n  The only thing I am saying is that what happens in the Western \nHemisphere matters too--that human rights violations in Venezuela are \njust as important as human rights violations in Africa or Europe or \nAsia or any other part of the world. Sometimes I feel as if they do not \nget the attention they deserve around here.\n\n  This is our opportunity to show that this hemisphere is important and \nthat what happens in our hemisphere matters. I want you to know that \nthe people of Venezuela--particularly those students and those who \ndesire a democratic and respectful future--they are watching. Every \nsingle time we do something on Venezuela here, we hear it in phone \ncalls, on Twitter, on Facebook, in visits to our office and in emails \nand in letters. They are watching, they are listening, and they are \naware.\n  What I want people in the world to know and people in the hemisphere \nto know is that America does not simply care about stability; we also \ncare about democracy and freedom and about human rights. This is our \nopportunity to put action where our words are.\n  So I sincerely hope that when we return here in about 8 or 9 days we \ncan find a way forward to get a vote on this. If we are unable to do \nthis through the unanimous consent process, which they call a hotline, \nmy intentions are to come to this floor and offer it as what they call \na live unanimous consent, where I will stand here and do what the \nSenator from Texas just did--or tried to do--with regard to the IRS \nissue.\n  I intend to come to this floor and propose this bill and ask for \nunanimous consent. If someone objects, then we will have a debate about \nthat objection. Should that fail, then I hope we can have a vote \nscheduled. I promise it will not take any more than 15 minutes--or 10 \nif you want to limit the vote to 10 minutes. But let's get this done.\n  This is important. We have worked this the appropriate way. Often \ntimes, people come to the floor in the Senate and they pull a bill out \nof their pocket and say: Let's file it for messaging purposes. This is \nreal. This is impactful. The House has already passed a version of \nthis. Doesn't this issue at least deserve 10 minutes of the Senate's \ntime?\n  So we are going to try to get this done one more time through \nunanimous approval. And we are going to work over the next 10 days to \nhopefully get everyone's support. But if we cannot do it that way, I \nhope we can schedule a vote on the Senate floor on this bill so we can \ngo after and sanction those criminals in Venezuela who are stealing the \nmoney of the Venezuelan people and using the strength and the power of \nthat government to attack their own people. I hope that will be a \npriority for us when we return. It deserves that attention.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to address this issue today, and I wish \nfor all my colleagues the next 10 days will be fruitful in your return \nto your home States, and I look forward to working with you on these \nissues when we return.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4118-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4118-S4119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MASSACHUSETTS BUFFER ZONE\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, since 1973, when the Supreme Court \ndecided that a woman's right to choose was constitutionally protected, \nwomen's health clinics across the country have been targeted by \nviolence and other criminal activities by extremists.\n  The crimes are alarming: harassment, arson, acid attacks, \nobstruction, violent threats, and even murder. Women's safety has been \nrepeatedly put at risk simply for exercising a constitutional right.\n  In the past 10 years, there have been approximately 75,000 incidents \nof violence against abortion providers in the United States. That is \nunacceptable. We should always remember that each of these victims of \nviolence has a name, a family, and a story.\n  In 1994, a gunman killed two people and wounded five others at two \nclinics in Massachusetts. One of these victims was 25-year-old Shannon \nLowney, a daughter of public schoolteachers, a beloved sister, and a \nvolunteer who worked domestically and internationally with poor \nfamilies and children.\n  Shannon worked as a receptionist and Spanish translator at Planned \nParenthood in Brookline, MA. She worked there not for the pay but \nbecause she fundamentally believed women had a right to affordable \nhealth care. She wanted to do her part to ensure that patients at a \nvulnerable and stressful time in life were greeted with a smile. Five \ndays after Christmas in 1994 she was fatally shot in the neck at a \nPlanned Parenthood clinic by an extremist protester.\n  Shannon's story is just one of the many tragedies caused by violence \nagainst women exercising their rights.\n  In 2007, after the laws on the books proved inadequate, Massachusetts \nensured that there would be fair and balanced laws that created a \nbuffer zone of 35 feet around the entry of reproductive health care \nfacilities.\n  This law was intended to protect people such as Shannon and the \nthousands of women and staff who visit and work at clinics.\n  The buffer zone law worked. Massachusetts women could exercise their \nfundamental right to health care without running a gauntlet of abuse. \nAccording to a survey of reproductive health care centers across the \ncountry, a majority of facilities with buffer zones experienced a \ndecrease in criminal activity after the buffer zone was instituted.\n  Today the Supreme Court of the United States took away those buffer \nzones of safety when it struck down the Massachusetts buffer zone law, \neffectively undoing the historic progress we have made in ensuring that \nwomen are protected when accessing reproductive health care and \nexercising their constitutional rights.\n  Today's Supreme Court ruling puts women at risk simply for exercising \ntheir constitutional rights. Shannon's brother Liam visited me on the \nday that this case was argued before the Supreme Court. Their family is \nrepresentative of what has happened across this country in terms of the \nendangerment of women when they seek to exercise their constitutional \nrights.\n  So today is a sad day. It is not just a sad day for America but in \nparticular for Shannon's family because they put a lot on the line to \nensure that this case was brought before the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  The Court's decision makes it more difficult for States to guarantee \nwomen's reproductive rights and more likely that acts of violence and \nintimidation against women seeking reproductive health care will occur.\n  With reproductive rights under attack across the country like never \nbefore, it is imperative that we ensure the basic safety of all women \nand staff at Planned Parenthood and other health facilities.\n  We should be expanding access to safe reproductive health care for \nwomen, not restricting it. That is unfortunately what today is going to \nrepresent in the history of health care for women in our country.\n  The Presiding Officer is a national leader on these issues, fighting \nfor the rights of women. I stand with her and with the other Members of \nthe Senate but, more importantly, also with ordinary families across \nthis country and Planned Parenthood and all the women in Massachusetts \nand this country who believe every woman seeking reproductive health \ncare should be safe and protected.\n  I am proud that all Massachusetts law enforcement officials will \ncontinue to use every legal tool available to ensure the safety and \nprivacy of women and clinic staff. Today is a historic day. \nUnfortunately, it is one of which our country should not be proud.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4119]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4119-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4119-S4124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TERRORIST THREATS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, Senator McCain and I have decided to \ncome down before the Fourth of July break to talk about two issues that \nare very important to our national security.\n  The first issue I would like to discuss is the threat we face as a \nnation from terrorist safe havens in Syria and now Iraq.\n  The President has indicated in recent days that it is unacceptable to \nallow terrorist organizations such as ISIS to have safe havens from \nwhich to launch attacks against our country.\n  Mr. President, we agree. What are you doing about it? I understand \nIraq is complicated. I understand you would need a new government in \nIraq that Sunnis could buy into to probably turn Iraq around. That is a \nproblem, but that is a separate problem from safe havens that can be \nused to launch attacks against the United States. Please do not turn \nover to the Iraqi politicians the timeline as to whether we will act to \nprotect ourselves.\n  This is the FBI Director: ``My concern is that people can go to \nSyria, develop new relationships, learn new techniques and become far \nmore dangerous, and then flow back.''\n  Americans are now in Syria. Some 7,500 foreign fighters from 50 \ncountries have gone to Syria. They are now in Iraq. The Islamic State \nin Iraq and Syria was kicked out by Al Qaeda. These are the most \nextreme people on the planet. They have now gone into Iraq and taken \nlarge territories and up to $500 million in resources. They had a $30 \nmillion-a-year budget. They have more money than they ever dreamed of. \nTheir desire to hit the homeland is growing. Last week the leader of \nthis group said: We will be coming to America next.\n  Mr. President, do not use the political problems in Baghdad as an \nexcuse not to act when it comes to denying safe havens to terrorists \nwho have espoused attacking our country. Where is your plan to dislodge \nthese people in Syria and Iraq? Where is your plan to deal with the \nsafe haven issue? Where is your plan to hit a terrorist organization \nthat is desirous of hitting us?\n  Mr. President, you cannot have it both ways. You cannot alert us as a \nnation that we are threatened by a safe haven in Iraq and Syria and do \nnothing about it. I understand the political complexities that exist in \nIraq, but I also understand the need to deal with the safe haven issue. \nWhat do you envision as a solution to the safe haven problem in Syria \nand Iraq? When are we going to act? Is there no military component \navailable to the United States to hit a terrorist organization that is \noperating out in the open in Syria and Iraq, that represents a direct \nthreat to our homeland?\n  Mr. President, now is the time for you to come up with a plan to deal \nwith the safe havens. That issue is separate and apart from dealing \nwith the political complications and the meltdown in Iraq. You have \nsaid and the Director of National Security Mr. Clapper has said that \nSyria is an apocalyptic state; it is in a very bad way; that the \njihadists in Syria represent a direct threat to our homeland.\n  The same jihadists in Syria have moved now into Iraq. Three years ago \nwhen Senator McCain was urging airstrikes and that a safe zone be \nestablished, there were fewer than 1,000 foreign fighters in Syria. \nToday we think there are up to 26,000 ISIS types in Syria. Now they are \nmoving to Iraq at lightning speed, taking town after town, amassing \nresources in terms of military hardware and money that will make them \nnot just a terrorist organization but a terrorist army.\n\n  Mr. President, there is a terrorist army on the march in Iraq and \nSyria. They have indicated they want to hit our Nation. They want to \nstrike us in the region, throughout the world, and here at home. You \nseem to have no plan. We want to help you. We understand this is \ncomplicated, but you, as Commander in Chief above all others, have a \nduty to come up with a solution to this problem. You have defined the \nproblem well, but you have done nothing to solve the problem. We stand \nready to help you solve that problem.\n  Now, as we try to figure out where to go in Iraq and what is the \nright strategy, the one thing that is important to me is not to rewrite \nhistory. I do not want to dwell on the past, but I am not going to sit \non the sidelines and let this administration--which, as Senator Obama, \nSenator Clinton, and Senator Kerry, was all over the Bush \nadministration for the mistakes they made. That is the way the \npolitical process works.\n  When the Iraq war was going poorly on President Bush's watch, Senator \nMcCain called for the Republican-appointed Secretary of Defense to \nresign. I would argue that Senator McCain above all others has been \nconsistent when it comes to Iraq. It does not matter who is making the \nmistake; if he believes one is being made, he will speak up.\n  The line that there were just a few dead-enders in Iraq was not true. \nThe reason we knew it was not true is that Senator McCain and I went to \nIraq numerous times. The first time we went, we were in an SUV with a \nthree-car convoy. We went down to Baghdad, had dinner, and went \nshopping. Every time thereafter, the security was tighter, our ability \nto leave the base was restricted, and the people on the ground who were \nfighting the war were telling us: This thing is not going well. Every \ntime we would hear from the Bush administration that the media was \nmisrepresenting the truth and that this was just a few dead-enders, we \nknew better. We spoke up.\n  Abu Ghraib was a direct result of being overwhelmed by circumstances \non the ground. We thought that once the Iraqi Army disbanded and Saddam \nHussein was displaced, we would be able to handle Iraq with a few \nthousand troops. The Bush administration was wrong in that calculation. \nSenator McCain spoke up, and the surge did work.\n  To President Bush's undying credit: You corrected the mistakes that \nhappened on your watch. You kept an open mind. You changed strategy \nbecause the strategy you originally pursued had failed.\n  President Obama, your strategy has failed. The idea of abandoning \nIraq, disengaging politically and militarily, has come home to haunt us \nas a nation.\n  Senator McCain and I said back in 2011: If we do not leave a residual \nforce behind as an insurance policy for our own national security \ninterests, we will regret it.\n  Madam President, 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers, well placed, would have \ngiven the capacity to the Iraqi Army to allow them to be more \neffective, and what we see on the ground today would have never \nhappened. I am convinced that ISIS would never be in Iraq the way they \nare today if there had been an American military component--10,000 to \n15,000--providing capacity and expertise to an Iraqi army that is \nliterally falling apart.\n  I am convinced today that if we had continued to push the Iraqi \npolitical system to reconcile, we would not be where we are today. Dave \nPetraeus and Ryan Crocker--one general and one diplomat--spent hours \nevery day of the week practically pushing the Sunnis, the Shias, and \nthe Kurds to solve their problems with the political process. It was \nworking.\n  In 2010 we made a fateful mistake. We allowed Syria to go bad. Syria \nbecame the supply center for Al Qaeda in Iraq, which was on its back. \nIn 2010 the surge had worked. Al Qaeda in Iraq, which was the \npredecessor to ISIS, was completely devastated. They are back in the \ngame for three reasons: Syria became a failed state. We had a chance to \nstop that and did not. They were being resupplied from Syria with \nequipment and fighters. We decided to disengage from Iraq politically. \nWe had a hands-off approach to the political problems in Baghdad. We \nwithdrew our troops all from 2010 to 2011. Those three things became a \nperfect storm to lead us to where we are today.\n  We do want to look forward because looking backward does not solve \nthe problem. But here is what we will not accept. We will not accept a \nrewriting of history. When this administration says the reason we have \nno troops in Iraq today is because of the Iraqis, that is an absolutely \nfalse statement.\n  In May of 2011 Senator McCain and I, at the request of Secretary \nClinton,\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\nwent to Iraq to talk about a follow-on agreement, a strategic \npartnership agreement that had in its making a military component that \nwould give legal protections to our troops who were left behind.\n  I remember this as if it were yesterday. We were in a meeting with \nPrime Minister Malaki. We were talking about leaving troops behind and \nwhether the Iraqis would give us the legal protections we needed \nbecause I told Prime Minister Malaki: No American politician is going \nto allow soldiers to be left behind in a foreign country without legal \nprotection.\n  If a person was charged with a crime in Iraq, given the inventory in \ntheir legal system, I did not feel comfortable allowing that soldier to \ngo into the Iraqi legal system. We would deal with disciplinary \nproblems.\n  He turned to me and said: How many soldiers are you talking about?\n  I turned to Ambassador Jeffrey, the U.S. Ambassador, General Austin, \nthe commander, and said: What is the answer?\n  They replied to me: We are still working on that.\n  The Prime Minister of Iraq laughed. This was in May of 2011. We could \nnot tell the Prime Minister of Iraq how many troops we were talking \nabout.\n  We went to the Kurdish portion of Iraq and talked to President \nBarzani. He would have accepted any amount of troops we wanted to leave \nbehind. He was openly embracing the follow-on force.\n  We met with Mr. Allawi, one of the leaders of the Iraqiya Sunni bloc, \nwho was very open minded to a follow-on force.\n  The day after we left Iraq, Prime Minister Malaki issued a statement \nsaying that if the other parties would agree, he would agree to a \nfollow-on force.\n  On November 15, 2011, we had a hearing with General Dempsey and \nSecretary Panetta in the Armed Services Committee. We asked the \nfollowing question: Was it the Iraqis who rejected a follow-on force, \noriginally envisioned to be 18,000 or 19,000?\n  The bottom-line number from the Pentagon was 10,000.\n  I asked the question. Was it the Iraqis who said: No, we do not want \n18,000. That is too many.\n  The numbers kept going down to finally 3,000.\n  Senator McCain asked the question.\n  The answer was: The reduction in numbers that we will be willing to \noffer to the Iraqis did not come from a rejection by Iraq but by a \nreduction of the numbers by the White House.\n  In other words, the cascading effect of the numbers from 18,000 to \n3,000 was not because Iraq said no; it was because the White House kept \nchanging the numbers to the point that the force envisioned would be \nineffective and fail.\n  Those are the facts.\n  Senator McCain will address the statements by the President before, \nduring, and after, but I am here to tell you, without any doubt in my \nmind, the reason we don't have troops in Iraq after 2011 is because the \nObama administration wanted to get to zero. They wanted to honor our \ncampaign promise to get us out of Iraq.\n  They did so, and now they are trying to blame the Iraqis. They are \ntrying to rewrite history. I can understand why they don't want to own \nwhat happened in Iraq. I can't understand why we would let them get \naway with it, and I am not going to let them get away with it.\n  Going forward, we have a mess on our hands, and I want to help the \nPresident where I can.\n  But, Mr. President, you were very good at questioning the policies of \nthe Bush administration, and you held nothing back. I am here to tell \nyou I know what you are saying about Iraq is not true.\n  On October 21, during a conference call with staff, Denis McDonough \nand Tony Blinken--former National Security Adviser to Biden and now \nNational Security Council--briefing staff members about the problems \nwith legal immunity was asked a question by Senator McCain's staff \nperson: If you could get a legal agreement that we felt was solid, \nwould you leave any troops behind, and they said no.\n  So we are going to write them a letter. There are several of our \nstaff who were on that phone call and we are going to ask Mr. McDonough \nand Mr. Blinken: Did you say that, and they can say whatever they want \nto, but I have people I know and I trust who were on that phone call \nand they know what was said.\n  With that, I will turn it over to Senator McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask my colleague one question before we go on; \nthat is, in addition to this overwhelming information in which the \nSenator and I were deeply involved that proves conclusively that the \nPresident of the United States did not want to leave a single troop \nmember behind in Iraq and succeeded in doing so, did the Senator from \nSouth Carolina ever hear the President of the United States, either \nbefore the decision was made, during or after--did the Senator ever \nhear any record of him saying he wanted to leave a residual force \nbehind?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Quite the opposite. If we go back and look at the tape \naround this debate, the President basically said: We left Iraq and we \nare not going to be bogged down by Iraq.\n  There was no regret that I am so sorry we couldn't convince the \nIraqis to leave a residual force behind because that would have been \nthe best outcome for Iraq and the United States, and I regret that we \ncould not get there and they will regret their decision.\n  None of that happened. It was all about the last combat soldier is \nout. We are done with Iraq. We have given them all the help we can give \nthem. We are going to move on, and we are not going to be bogged down.\n  Now the place is going to hell. It is a direct threat to the United \nStates, and they are trying to rewrite history--and I think it was \nOctober.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The President of the United States, in the last couple of \ndays--please correct me--it was the first time he said it was Iraqis \nwho did not want to leave a force behind.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Iraqis did not want to leave a force behind.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes; he was saying they did not.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the following quotes, including October 2012.\n  I quote the President of the United States:\n\n       What I would not have done is left 10,000 troops in Iraq \n     [as Candidate Romney proposed], that would tie us down. That \n     certainly would not help us in the Middle East.\n\n  Jay Carney said on October 1, 2012:\n\n       When President Obama took office, the Iraq War had been \n     going on for years and he had campaigned with a promise to \n     end that war, and he has done that.\n\n  One of my favorites is December 2011:\n\n       In the coming days the last American soldiers will cross \n     the border out of Iraq. . . . with honor and with their heads \n     held high. After nearly nine years, our war in Iraq ends this \n     month.\n\n  Anyway, the list goes on. In fact, the President campaigned for \nreelection in 2012 on the premise that he had gotten us out of Iraq.\n  The Senator from South Carolina and I predicted this would happen if \nwe didn't leave a residual force behind. I say to my colleagues again, \nif we repeat this same total pullout of Afghanistan, we are going to \nsee this same movie in Afghanistan.\n  So I plead with the President of the United States, please revisit \nyour decision that every American troop be pulled out.\n  The Afghans do not have the capability, whether air assets, intel or \nother capabilities, to defend themselves against an enemy that has a \nsanctuary in Pakistan.\n  I plead with the President of the United States, do not make the same \nmistake in Afghanistan.\n  I point out again, at the end of the surge we had won the conflict in \nIraq. The conflict was won, and instead obviously we blew it.\n  I would like to talk for a few minutes with my colleague from South \nCarolina because we need to understand what is happening in Iraq. In \nthe last 3 to 4 weeks, this whole part of Iraq has been taken over by \nthe forces of ISIS.\n\n  The second largest city in all of Iraq, Mosul, has been taken over, \nwhich triggered 500,000 refugees--500,000 refugees left Mosul.\n  Tal Afar--a major city, Kirkuk, where the Kurdish forces came in and \ntook over Kirkuk and made it now part of the Kurdish part of Iraq.\n  What is most concerning, I say to my colleagues--and I know the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\nfrom South Carolina and I have been focusing on this--is the Jordanian-\nIraq border. The border crossings from Iraq into Jordan have been taken \nover by ISIS.\n  As we know, Jordan is a small country. It is overburdened now with \nhundreds of thousands of refugees. It has significant problems on the \nSyrian side of its border. This can be a terribly destabilizing factor \nto our--probably outside of Israel--strongest and best ally in the \nentire Middle East.\n  Ramadi, Fallujah, every Iraq veteran will remember Ramadi and \nFallujah. Every Iraq veteran will remember the second battle of \nFallujah where we lost 96 brave soldiers and marines and over 600 \nwounded. Now the black flags of Al Qaeda fly over Ramadi and Fallujah. \nThe border to Syria no longer exists, my friends.\n  If we look at Syria, all the way to Aleppo, all the way around, a \npart of the Middle East that is larger than the State of Indiana is now \novertaken by the richest and most powerful terrorist organization in \nhistory; that is, ISIS.\n  We cannot address Iraq, if we do, without addressing Syria, as well \nas the movement of men and equipment back and forth. By the way, the \nSunni don't like these people. They are the most radical form of Islam. \nThey don't like them, but they prefer them to the government--the \nShiite-run government by Maliki--which has been systematically \ndiscriminating against them.\n  So what do we need to do? As the Senator from South Carolina said, \nwhat we want is Maliki to be in a transition government that \ntransitions him out of power, but we cannot wait until that happens.\n  By the way, they have also taken a place just north of Baghdad where \nthe largest oil refinery is, Baiji, that provides energy to the 7 \nmillion people in Baghdad, and they have also come to a place called \nHaditha, where a dam is that holds a water supply. If they get hold of \nboth of those places, they basically have a stranglehold on Baghdad \nitself.\n  This is serious.\n  So what has the President of the United States and the administration \ndecided to do? Send 90, 200 or 250 people over to Iraq and with the \nstated purpose of ``assessing the situation.''\n  Those of my friends and colleagues who have been to Iraq know it is a \nflat desert area, including very hot now. These people, these ISIS \nforces, are moving in convoys of 100, 200, 300 vehicles.\n  They can be taken out by air power. Right now the President of the \nUnited States has refused to do that, but they can be taken out by air \npower.\n  Air power does not determine conflicts, but air power has a profound \npsychological effect on your adversary. We have drones, and we have the \nair capability to take out a lot of these forces.\n  Remember, they are probably at a maximum of about 10,000, and as the \nSenator from South Carolina said, they started out with about 1,000, \nbut don't forget they are moving back and forth between Syria and Iraq \nin this now huge area. They are moving on Baghdad.\n  I don't know exactly what is going on. I don't believe they can take \nBaghdad with a frontal assault. I do believe it is possible that they \ncould cause assassinations, bombings, breakdowns in electricity, and \nbreakdown in law and order. In other words, this place where we \nsacrificed roughly 4,450 American lives is now in the hands of the \nlargest terrorist organization in history.\n  I say to the President of the United States: We can't wait. If the \nnext 2 weeks that the administration says they are going to use to \nassess this situation is wasted in assessment, I don't know what is \ngoing to happen in Iraq. I don't know what is going to happen to \nJordan. I don't know what is going to happen as far as the continued \nincreasing influence of the Iranians.\n  Published reports today indicate there are Iranian forces, Iranian \nassistance all through Iran.\n  An article from the New York Times, ``Iran Secretly Sending Drones \nand Supplies into Iraq, U.S. Officials Say,'' states:\n\n       Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the head of Iran's paramilitary Quds \n     Force, has visited Iraq at least twice to help Iraqi military \n     advisers plot strategy. And Iran has deployed about a dozen \n     other Quds Force officers to advise Iraqi commanders, and \n     help mobilize more than 2,000 Shiite militiamen from southern \n     Iraq, American officials said.\n       Iranian transport planes have also been making two daily \n     flights of military equipment and supplies to Baghdad--70 \n     tons per flight--for Iraqi security forces.\n\n  While the United States is assessing, Iranians are exercising more \nand more influence.\n  I have also been told--and I cannot verify it--that the Russians are \nnow offering to provide assistance to Maliki.\n  There has to be a transition government. There has to be a transition \nof Maliki out of government, but to wait until that happens, it may be \ntoo late.\n  I would ask my colleague from South Carolina, are you concerned about \nthe Iranian influence and what do you believe is the situation that \ncould evolve on the Jordanian border?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If you listen to the people who are launching these \nattacks, they say they are going to Jordan. What are they trying to \naccomplish? Bizarre as it may sound to the average American, they have \na very specific plan and it sort of goes like this: They want to purify \ntheir religion. They are Sunnis. They have a version of Islam, Sunni \nIslam that is beyond horrific, that is a woman's worst nightmare.\n  If you want to find a world of women, go to Syria, Iraq, and \neventually Afghanistan, I am afraid. You would not believe what these \npeople are capable of doing, what they will do to a person who smokes. \nThey will chop your finger off. I mean, they will kill children in \nfront of their parents.\n  These people represent the worst in humanity. My fear is, the \nPresident's fear, that the stronger they get over there the more \nexposed we are over here.\n  So, Mr. President, if you believe it is not in our national security \ninterests to allow these folks to have a safe haven in Syria and now in \nIraq, what are you doing about it? You have political problems in Iraq, \nI have got that, but why does that prevent us from attacking these \npeople in Syria where their leadership resides and where their supply \ndepots are? There has to come a time when this country is going to \ncommit to defending itself.\n  My goal is to keep the war over there so it doesn't come back here.\n  Senator McCain, 3 years ago now almost, urged us to act in a way that \nwould have allowed the moderate forces of the opposition to be \nempowered and to avoid where we are today. We chose not to act, at our \nown peril.\n  So I make this crystal clear, this area Senator McCain has described \nin Iraq represents a terrorist safe haven in the hands of people who \nwant to attack us here at home.\n  I am not making that up. The Director of National Intelligence, the \nFBI Director, and Jeh Johnson, the head of Homeland Security, have all \nsaid Syria represents a threat to the homeland.\n  Well, if a Syrian enclave and safe haven represents a threat to the \nhomeland, an Iraqi enclave bigger and richer surely represents a threat \nto the homeland, and the President admitted as much. So I don't want to \nhear any more discussions about we have to wait until Iraq gets its \nhouse in order until we protect American national security interests.\n  As to Jordan, now is the time in a bipartisan fashion for the \nCongress to speak with one voice and tell the world and everyone in the \nregion that we will defend Jordan. The King of Jordan is the last \nmoderate voice in the Middle East surrounding Israel. The King of \nJordan has been the most faithful ally to America. The King of Jordan \nhas been effectively engaged with Israel. The King of Jordan represents \nthe best hope in the Middle East.\n  If we allow a terrorist army--not an organization, now, an army of \ncommitted jihadists--to invade that country and put the King at risk, \nthat will be one of the great tragedies in modern history. I think it \nis now time to let the terrorist army know: You are not going into \nJordan, and say it in such a fashion as to not give Iraq away. But if \nwe don't reinforce Jordan quickly, it would be a mistake.\n  I have high confidence in the Jordanian military, but let me say \nthis: It is in our interests for the King to survive; it is in our \ninterests for Jordan to flourish; it is in our interests for ISIS to be \nstopped in their tracks in Iraq; it is in our interests for them to be \nwiped off the face of the Earth to the extent possible; it is in our \ninterests to go on the offensive before it is too late.\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\n  One thing I can say I have learned from 9/11 is thinking and \nbelieving if we ignore them they will ignore us is a very bad mistake. \nOn September 10, 2001, the day before 9/11, we didn't have one soldier \nin Afghanistan, we didn't even have an ambassador, and we sent no money \nin terms of assistance to the Taliban. We were completely disengaged \nfrom Afghanistan. How well did that work?\n  Anytime you disengage from people that bloodthirsty and you believe \nit will not come back to haunt you, you are making a mistake. Anytime a \ngroup will kill women in a soccer stadium for sport and we think we are \nsafe if we ignore them, we are making the mistake for the ages.\n  These people, the ISIS, represent a depraved form of humanity in the \ncategory of the Nazis. And what are we doing about it?\n  I am tired of ceding city after city, country after country to \nradical Islam. Now is the time to fight back--fight back as if it meant \nfighting for your home and your family, because it does--fight back \nover there so we don't have to fight them here. And they are coming \nhere. If you don't believe me, ask them.\n  The best way to keep them from coming here is to align ourselves with \npeople over there who do not want their agenda for their family and are \nwilling to fight along our side. Right now, who feels comfortable \nfighting with America? Right now, our enemies are emboldened, our \nfriends are afraid.\n  Now is the time to turn this around, Mr. President. You are waiting \nand waiting and thinking and thinking, and they are on the march. I \nknow this is complicated, but the one thing that is not complicated is \nthat the terrorist organization you said could not have safe haven has \nthe largest safe haven in the history of the world. They are richer \nthan they have ever been, they are more powerful than they have ever \nbeen, and you are doing nothing about it. You need to do something \nabout it before it is too late, and we stand ready to help you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to emphasize with my colleague from South \nCarolina, continuously we hear from the President of the United States \nthat those of us who are in strong disagreement with his strategy--\nwell, there is none. The fact is there is no strategy.\n  We keep being accused of wanting to send ``thousands of troops'' on \nthe ground in Syria or in Iraq. That is patently false. I know of no \none who shares our concern who wants to send ground combat troops into \nIraq. So I wish the President of the United States would stop saying \nthat.\n  Second of all, what we do want is we want some people who can be \nforward air controllers, some of our special forces people, to direct \nthese air strikes against what is movement of these hundreds of \nvehicles in convoy across open desert. It can be done.\n  The next thing I wish to emphasize is how dangerous it is becoming, \nparticularly at the most holy Shiite shrines of Samarra and Karbala. \nThose two are the holiest shrines of the Shia. If ISIS comes into those \nholy sites and destroys them, we are going to see this thing explode \neven more.\n  There are many other things I would like to say, but I don't want to \ncontinue too much longer on this, but to point out again, this is not \njust an Iraq problem. This is the border which runs along between Syria \nand Iraq. We cannot address just the Iraqi side.\n  Lately, interestingly, Bashar Assad has been using his air power to \nattack ISIS. If the United States does not become involved, then people \nsuch as Bashar al-Assad, people such as the Iranians will fill that \nvacuum. It is time for us to act.\n  What do I mean by that?\n  First of all, why don't we send Ryan Crocker and David Petraeus back \nto Baghdad. They are the smartest people I have ever known, and \neverybody agrees with that: Send them back to Baghdad and sit down with \nMaliki. Also, send some military planning teams that can assess the \nsituation and address the needs of the Iraqi military, those that can \nstill function effectively. Go ahead and orchestrate the air strikes, \nand understand that the problem in Syria is going to have to be \naddressed as well. So there are concrete steps that every military \nleader I know advocates as a way of turning this around.\n\n  There is no good option. Because of the situation we are in, there is \nno good option. But the worst option is what the administration is \ndoing today, which is nothing, except sending a few advisers over to \ngive some assessment of the situation.\n  No one wants to get back into any conflict. No American wants to do \nthat. I am the last one who wants to do that. But we have to understand \nwhat our Director of National Intelligence has told us, what our \nSecretary of Homeland Security has told us, what our common sense and \neyes will tell us: If you have a terrorist organization that has \nhundreds of millions of dollars, that has control of an area the size \nof the State of Indiana where they are consolidating power and they \nhave promised they will attack us--the United States can't afford \nanother 9/11. We can't afford to see these jihadists pouring out of \nSyria and Iraq into Europe and into the United States of America, \nbecause these extremists have flowed in from all of these countries.\n  The President of the United States can make the American people aware \nof this threat, and that we have to take action, without sending ground \ncombat troops into the conflict. And I am confident--because the memory \nof 9/11 has not faded in the memory of the people of this country. We \nremember that tragedy graphically. All of us remember where we were \nthat day. But this is a clear and present danger, and it is long time \noverdue for the United States to react as the strongest and most \npowerful Nation in the world.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the article from the Atlantic by Peter Beinart entitled \n``Obama's Disastrous Iraq Policy: An Autopsy.''\n  I further ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an op-\ned by Dennis Ross, one of the most respected individuals on the entire \nMiddle East, entitled ``Op-ed: To contain ISIS, think Iraq--but also \nthink Syria.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Atlantic, June 25, 2014]\n\n               Obama's Disastrous Iraq Policy: An Autopsy\n\n                           (By Peter Beinart)\n\n       Yes, the Iraq War was a disaster of historic proportions. \n     Yes, seeing its architects return to prime time to smugly \n     slam President Obama while taking no responsibility for their \n     own, far greater, failures is infuriating.\n       But sooner or later, honest liberals will have to admit \n     that Obama's Iraq policy has been a disaster. Since the \n     president took office, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki \n     has grown ever more tyrannical and ever more sectarian, \n     driving his country's Sunnis toward revolt. Since Obama took \n     office, Iraq watchers--including those within his own \n     administration--have warned that unless the United States \n     pushed hard for inclusive government, the country would slide \n     back into civil war. Yet the White House has been so eager to \n     put Iraq in America's rearview mirror that, publicly at \n     least, it has given Maliki an almost-free pass. Until now, \n     when it may be too late.\n       Obama inherited an Iraq where better security had created \n     an opportunity for better government. The Bush \n     administration's troop ``surge'' did not solve the country's \n     underlying divisions. But by retaking Sunni areas from \n     insurgents, it gave Iraq's politicians the chance to forge a \n     government inclusive enough to keep the country together.\n       The problem was that Maliki wasn't interested in such a \n     government. Rather than integrate the Sunni Awakening \n     fighters who had helped subdue al-Qaeda into Iraq's army, \n     Maliki arrested them. In the run-up to his 2010 reelection \n     bid, Maliki's Electoral Commission disqualified more than \n     500, mostly Sunni, candidates on charges that they had ties \n     to Saddam Hussein's Baath Party.\n       For the Obama administration, however, tangling with Maliki \n     meant investing time and energy in Iraq, a country it \n     desperately wanted to pivot away from. A few months before \n     the 2010 elections, according to Dexter Filkins in The New \n     Yorker, ``American diplomats in Iraq sent a rare dissenting \n     cable to Washington, complaining that the U.S., with its \n     combination of support and indifference, was encouraging \n     Maliki's authoritarian tendencies.''\n       When Iraqis went to the polls in March 2010, they gave a \n     narrow plurality to the Iraqiya List, an alliance of parties \n     that enjoyed significant Sunni support but was led by Ayad \n     Allawi, a secular Shiite. Under pressure from Maliki, \n     however, an Iraqi judge allowed the prime minister's Dawa \n     Party--which had finished a close second--to form a \n     government instead. According to Emma Sky, chief political \n     adviser to General Raymond Odierno, who commanded U.S. forces \n     in Iraq, American officials knew this violated Iraq's \n     constitution. But they never publicly challenged Maliki's \n     power grab, which was backed by Iran, perhaps because they \n     believed his claim that Iraq's Shiites\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\n     would never accept a Sunni-aligned government. ``The \n     message'' that America's acquiescence ``sent to Iraq's people \n     and politicians alike,'' wrote the Brookings Institution's \n     Kenneth Pollack, ``was that the United States under the new \n     Obama administration was no longer going to enforce the rules \n     of the democratic road . . . [This] undermined the reform of \n     Iraqi politics and resurrected the specter of the failed \n     state and the civil war.'' According to Filkins, one American \n     diplomat in Iraq resigned in disgust.\n       By that fall, to its credit, the U.S. had helped craft an \n     agreement in which Maliki remained prime minister but Iraqiya \n     controlled key ministries. Yet as Ned Parker, the Reuters \n     bureau chief in Baghdad, later detailed, ``Washington quickly \n     disengaged from actually ensuring that the provisions of the \n     deal were implemented.'' In his book, The Dispensable Nation, \n     Vali Nasr, who worked at the State Department at the time, \n     notes that the ``fragile power-sharing arrangement . . . \n     required close American management. But the Obama \n     administration had no time or energy for that. Instead it \n     anxiously eyed the exits, with its one thought to get out. It \n     stopped protecting the political process just when talk of \n     American withdrawal turned the heat back up under the long-\n     simmering power struggle that pitted the Shias, Sunnis, and \n     Kurds against one another.''\n       Under an agreement signed by George W. Bush, the U.S. was \n     to withdraw forces from Iraq by the end of 2011. American \n     military officials, fearful that Iraq might unravel without \n     U.S. supervision, wanted to keep 20,000 to 25,000 troops in \n     the country after that. Obama now claims that maintaining any \n     residual force was impossible because Iraq's parliament would \n     not give U.S. soldiers immunity from prosecution. Given how \n     unpopular America's military presence was among ordinary \n     Iraqis, that may well be true. But we can't fully know \n     because Obama--eager to tout a full withdrawal from Iraq in \n     his reelection campaign--didn't push hard to keep troops in \n     the country. As a former senior White House official told \n     Peter Baker of The New York Times, ``We really didn't want to \n     be there and [Maliki] really didn't want us there . . . [Y]ou \n     had a president who was going to be running for re-election, \n     and getting out of Iraq was going to be a big statement.''\n       In recent days, Republicans have slammed Obama for \n     withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq. But the real problem with \n     America's military withdrawal was that it exacerbated a \n     diplomatic withdrawal that had been underway since Obama took \n     office.\n       The decline of U.S. leverage in Iraq simply reinforced the \n     attitude Obama had held since 2009: Let Maliki do whatever he \n     wants so long as he keeps Iraq off the front page.\n       On December 12, 2011, just days before the final U.S. \n     troops departed Iraq, Maliki visited the White House. \n     According to Nasr, he told Obama that Vice President Tariq \n     al-Hashimi, an Iraqiya leader and the highest-ranking Sunni \n     in his government, supported terrorism. Maliki, argues Nasr, \n     was testing Obama, probing to see how the U.S. would react if \n     he began cleansing his government of Sunnis. Obama replied \n     that it was a domestic Iraqi affair. After the meeting, Nasr \n     claims, Maliki told aides, ``See! The Americans don't care.''\n       In public remarks after the meeting, Obama praised Maliki \n     for leading ``Iraq's most inclusive government yet.'' Iraq's \n     Deputy Prime Minister, Saleh al-Mutlaq, another Sunni, told \n     CNN he was ``shocked'' by the president's comments. ``There \n     will be a day,'' he predicted, ``whereby the Americans will \n     realize that they were deceived by al-Maliki . . . and they \n     will regret that.''\n       A week later, the Iraqi government issued a warrant for \n     Hashimi's arrest. Thirteen of his bodyguards were arrested \n     and tortured. Hashimi fled the country and, while in exile, \n     was sentenced to death.\n       ``Over the next 18 months,'' writes Pollack, ``many Sunni \n     leaders were arrested or driven from politics, including some \n     of the most non-sectarian, non-violent, practical and \n     technocratic.'' Enraged by Maliki's behavior, and emboldened \n     by the prospect of a Sunni takeover in neighboring Syria, \n     Iraqi Sunnis began reconnecting with their old jihadist \n     allies. Yet, in public at least, the Obama administration \n     still acted as if all was well.\n       In March 2013, Maliki sent troops to arrest Rafi Issawi, \n     Iraq's former finance minister and a well-regarded Sunni \n     moderate who had criticized the prime minister's growing \n     authoritarianism. In a Los Angeles Times op-ed later that \n     month, Iraq expert Henri Barkey called the move ``another \n     nail in the coffin for a unified Iraq.'' Iraq, he warned, \n     ``is on its way to dissolution, and the United States is \n     doing nothing to stop it'' because ``Washington seems \n     petrified about crossing Maliki.''\n       That fall, Maliki prepared to visit the White House again. \n     Three days before he arrived, Emma Sky, the former adviser to \n     General Odierno, co-authored a New York Times op-ed entitled \n     ``Maliki's Democratic Farce,'' in which she argued that, \n     ``Too often, Mr. Maliki has misinterpreted American backing \n     for his government as a carte blanche for uncompromising \n     behavior.'' The day before Maliki arrived, six senators--\n     including Democrats Carl Levin and Robert Menendez--sent the \n     White House a letter warning that, ``by too often pursuing a \n     sectarian and authoritarian agenda, Prime Minister Maliki and \n     his allies are disenfranchising Sunni Iraqis . . . This \n     failure of governance is driving many Sunni Iraqis into the \n     arms of Al-Qaeda.''\n       Still, in his public remarks, Obama didn't even hint that \n     Maliki was doing anything wrong. After meeting his Iraqi \n     counterpart on November 1, Obama told the press that, ``we \n     appreciate Prime Minister Maliki's commitment to . . . \n     ensuring a strong, prosperous, inclusive, and democratic \n     Iraq,'' and declared ``that we were encouraged by the work \n     that Prime Minister Maliki has done in the past to ensure \n     that all people inside of Iraq--Sunni, Shia, and Kurd--feel \n     that they have a voice in their government.'' A former senior \n     administration official told me that, privately, the \n     administration pushed Maliki hard to be more inclusive. If \n     so, it did not work. In late December, less than two months \n     after Maliki's White House visit, Iraqi troops arrested yet \n     another prominent Sunni critic, Ahmed al-Alwani, chairman of \n     the Iraqi parliament's economics committee, killing five of \n     Alwani's guards in the process.\n       By this January, jihadist rebels from the Islamic State of \n     Iraq and Syria (ISIS, or ISIL) had taken control of much of \n     largely Sunni Anbar province. Vice President Biden--the \n     administration's point man on Iraq--was now talking to Maliki \n     frequently. But according to White House summaries of Biden's \n     calls, he still spent more time praising the Iraqi leader \n     than pressuring him. On January 8, the vice president \n     ``encouraged the Prime Minister to continue the Iraqi \n     government's outreach to local, tribal, and national \n     leaders.'' On January 18, ``The two leaders agreed on the \n     importance of the Iraqi government's continued outreach to \n     local and tribal leaders in Anbar province.'' On January 26, \n     ``The Vice President commended the Government of Iraq's \n     commitment to integrate tribal forces fighting AQI/ISIL into \n     Iraqi security forces.'' (The emphases are mine.) For his \n     part, Obama has not spoken to Maliki since their meeting last \n     November.\n       Finally, last Thursday, in what was widely interpreted as \n     an invitation for Iraqis to push Maliki aside, Obama \n     declared, ``that whether he is prime minister or any other \n     leader aspires to lead the country, that it has to be an \n     agenda in which Sunni, Shia and Kurd all feel that they have \n     the opportunity to advance their interest through the \n     political process.'' Obama also noted that, ``The government \n     in Baghdad has not sufficiently reached out to some of the \n     [Sunni] tribes and been able to bring them into a process \n     that, you know, gives them a sense of being part of--of a \n     unity government or a single nation-state.''\n       That's certainly true. The problem is that it took Obama \n     five years to publicly say so--or do anything about it--\n     despite pleas from numerous Iraq experts, some close to his \n     own administration. This inaction was abetted by American \n     journalists. Many of us proved strikingly indifferent to a \n     country about which we once claimed to care deeply.\n       In recent days, many liberals have rushed to Obama's \n     defense simply because they are so galled to hear people like \n     Dick Cheney and Bill Kristol lecturing anyone on Iraq. That's \n     a mistake. While far less egregious than George W. Bush's \n     errors, Obama's have been egregious enough. By ignoring Iraq, \n     and refusing to defend democratic principles there, he has \n     helped spawn the disaster we see today. It's time people who \n     aren't Republican operatives began saying so.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, June 23, 2014]\n\n           To Contain ISIS, Think Iraq--But Also Think Syria\n\n                            (By Dennis Ross)\n\n       The conflict in Iraq will not be settled any time soon. \n     Although the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and \n     its Sunni allies may not be about to march on Baghdad, they \n     are continuing to expand their control over much of northern \n     and western Iraq. The military and diplomatic steps that \n     President Obama has ordered reflect the U.S. need to prevent \n     ISIS from embedding itself in more of Iraq. Whether they will \n     work, however, is another matter.\n       Iraq is a mess today. The president is right to expect the \n     Iraqi government to take the lead in its own defense He is \n     right to insist that Iraq's government must become more \n     inclusive and less sectarian. And he is right to be wary of \n     getting sucked into a sectarian conflict in which we take \n     sides.\n       The same calculus has guided the United States in Syria. \n     There, our fears of the costs of action--even limited \n     military support for the opposition--led us to ignore the \n     costs of inaction. We hoped that sanctions, a political \n     process and humanitarian assistance would make it possible to \n     affect the reality in Syria. It did not. Those who argued \n     that the price would go up in human and strategic terms--and \n     that we needed to affect the balance of power within the \n     opposition and between it and the regime of President Bashar \n     Assad--were right.\n       Today, the costs in terms of spillover in the region and \n     the consequences of radical Islamists, particularly ISIS, \n     coming to dominate the opposition are clear. Syria is a \n     disaster, there is no border between Syria and Iraq, and the \n     re-emergence of a terrible sectarian conflict in Iraq is \n     inextricably linked to Syria. There will be no effective or \n     enduring answer to the ISIS threat in Iraq without also \n     taking steps in Syria to deny it a sanctuary and a recruiting \n     base.\n       If nothing else, this should tell us that our response to \n     the current crisis in Iraq must be guided by a broader \n     strategy toward the region, one that has clear objectives in \n     Iraq and Syria and takes into account that resisting ISIS \n     cannot make it appear that we are\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\n     suddenly partners with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. The \n     fact that the Iranians also have reason to fear ISIS means we \n     have converging but not identical interests.\n       The Iranians have used radical Shiite militias--Hezbollah, \n     Kataib Hezbollah and Asaib Ahl al Haq--in Syria and Iraq. The \n     latter two--armed, trained and funded by the Iranians--were \n     responsible for killing hundreds of American soldiers in \n     Iraq. We should be talking to Iraq's neighbors, including \n     Iran, about what we and they can do to help stabilize Iraq \n     and defeat ISIS.\n       But Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Jordan will not be \n     responsive if they think fighting ISIS means the U.S. is \n     prepared to leave the Sunnis vulnerable to Iran and its \n     Shiite-backed militias. If Iran wants stability in Iraq and \n     not an ongoing sectarian war on its border, it will need to \n     accept that although the Shiites will hold many of the levers \n     of power, they must also be prepared to share them.\n       In Iraq, if the U.S. is to help blunt ISIS, the central \n     government must give Sunnis and Kurds a sense of inclusion \n     and a stake in working with Baghdad and the military. Prime \n     Minister Nouri Maliki's conspiratorial, authoritarian \n     approach has made that impossible. We should make any \n     coordinated military action with the Iraqi government \n     contingent on Maliki actually taking such steps, including \n     appointing a government of national unity, empowering a Sunni \n     defense minister and permitting the Kurds to export their \n     oil. Absent that, we may still choose to target ISIS forces \n     if there is a need, but without regard to what the Iraqi \n     government may seek.\n       As for Syria, though we must deny ISIS sanctuary there, the \n     U.S. cannot partner with the Assad regime. The simple fact is \n     that so long as Assad remains in power, he will be a magnet \n     for every jihadi worldwide to join the holy war against him. \n     No country in the region is immune from the fallout of the \n     conflict in Syria, and we all face the danger of those who go \n     to fight in Syria returning to their home countries to foment \n     violence.\n       Though President Obama has spoken about ramping up our \n     support for the opposition in Syria, we are late to that \n     effort. It is time for the United States to assume the \n     responsibility of quarterbacking the entire assistance effort \n     to ensure that more meaningful aid--lethal, training, \n     intelligence, money and humanitarian--not only gets to those \n     who are fighting both ISIS and the Assad regime but is fully \n     coordinated and complementary.\n       The broader point is that Washington's actions toward ISIS \n     now must be taken with both Iraq and Syria in mind and be \n     guided by a strategy geared toward weakening those forces \n     that threaten the U.S. and its regional friends. The more we \n     take this approach and highlight the costs to Iran of its \n     current posture, the more the Iranians may see that their \n     interests could be served by a political outcome of greater \n     balance in Syria and Iraq. There will be risks to acting, but \n     by now we have seen the costs of inaction, and they are only \n     likely to grow over time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate my dear friend Senator Coons' \npatience.\n  At this time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4124-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4124-S4126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, something important, something unusual, \nsomething worth noting happened this week, happened yesterday in this \nChamber that I don't want to let pass without a few moments of comment.\n  Yesterday a broad bipartisan majority of this Senate came together to \npass the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.\n  First, I congratulate Senators Murray, Isakson, Harkin, and Alexander \nwho led so capably on this bill. Senators Murray, a Democrat of \nWashington, and Isakson, a Republican of Georgia, spent years working \nthrough the details, policy, and language, and months making sure that \nthey got this bill to a point where the Senate and the House in a \nbipartisan, bicameral way could adopt legislation.\n  What is this about? It is about something simple, important, and \npowerful: investing in America's workforce so we can compete with \nanyone around the world in the 21st century.\n  This is an area I have focused on a lot here in the Senate which I \nbelieve is critical to our Nation, our competitiveness, to \nstrengthening our middle class, and to growing good jobs.\n  In manufacturing, it is a core challenge for us to ensure that our \nworkers have the training employers are looking for, and that our \nmanufacturing companies are globally competitive. Manufacturing is \nimportant to America, to our future, to our middle class, to our \ncommunities, and to our families because it pays well, it drives \ninnovation, it contributes greatly to other sectors in our economy and \nin communities.\n  That is why a few months ago I launched the Manufacturing Jobs for \nAmerica initiative that has brought together dozens of Senators. We \ninitially pulled together Democrats from across my caucus to introduce \n34 bills, some of the best and broadest ideas we could bring to the \ntable about how to accelerate America's recovery of employment and \nsteady growth in manufacturing. Roughly half of these bills are \nbipartisan.\n  Part of the goal of this Manufacturing Jobs for America initiative \nwas to put good ideas out on the floor and get them in the mix as we \ndebate things going forward. So I wish to take a moment today and \ncelebrate that the ideas of many of our partners in this campaign, \nideas drawn from many of the bills that are part of this initiative, \nended up being important parts of the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act that was passed this week.\n  Let me briefly touch on the five most important who contributed ideas \nthat were embedded in this bill that passed.\n  First, the Adult Education and Economic Growth Act which was \nsponsored by Senators Reed and Brown. In our rapidly changing economy, \nensuring we can train Americans of all ages for all jobs is critical. \nSenator Reed's bill takes an important step in that direction by \ninvesting in adult education, expanding access to technology and \ndigital literacy skills and improving the coordination of State and \nlocal programs.\n  A bill that was endorsed by the National Association of Manufacturers \nis the AMERICA Works Act, sponsored by Senators Hagan and Heller.\n  Another challenge we face is ensuring employers can quickly recognize \nwhether a worker has the skills they need. So Senator Hagan's bill \nhelped solve this by ensuring we prioritize programs that invest in \ntraining that delivers portable national and industry-recognized \ncredentials. This encourages job training programs to match the skills \nof workers with the needs of local employers, training individuals for \nthe jobs currently available in their communities right now.\n  A third bill that contributed importantly to this bill that was \nenacted here yesterday, adopted by the Senate yesterday, was the \nCommunity College to Career Fund Act, sponsored by Senator Franken and \nSenator Begich. Senator Franken came to the floor yesterday and gave \nanother passionate, important floor speech in support of these ideas. \nIt is something that as I presided--and I have been with Senator \nFranken in caucus and have heard him speak many times. It is about \nequipping workers with the skills they need by investing in \npartnerships between our community colleges and our employers. Senator \nFranken, Senator Begich, myself and others have seen this work in our \nhome communities. We have seen community colleges learn from \nmanufacturers what today are the actual relevant modern manufacturing \nskills they need and then deliver customized training courses that make \na difference in the skills, in the lives, in the college affordability \nand access of those who seek to join today's manufacturing workforce.\n  The fourth bill, the On-the-Job Training Act, cosponsored by Senators \nShaheen and Cochran, contributes to the idea that we need to invest in \non-the-job training. Because of Senator Shaheen's leadership on this \nbill, we will now make new and important investments so workers can \nlearn what they need to do in the job that needs to be filled, rather \nthan in an academic setting and then search the skills that may match \nthe skills they learn. On-the-job training in this bill sponsored by \nShaheen and Cochran is an important contribution to modernizing \nAmerica's workplace skills.\n  The last, the SECTORS Act, cosponsored by Senators Brown and Collins, \nis a provision that helps meet the fundamental challenge of connecting \nour schools with our businesses by requiring State and local workforce \ninvestment boards to establish sector-based partnerships.\n  With all of these bills there is an important and common theme. In \nthe 21st century, rapid economic change is a given. In order to \ncompete, in order to grow our economy and grow employment, in order to \nbe productive and to have a successful and growing workforce, we need \nto be able to adapt as\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n\nquickly as our economy does and we need to invest in modernizing the \nskills of the American worker.\n  With the passage of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \nyesterday, we have made a strong statement that in a bipartisan way we \nare willing to invest in America's workers, the jobs of today and the \njobs of tomorrow. This is just one of many encouraging moments here in \nthe Senate that sometimes go without note or commentary in our \ncommunities at home, but I thought it was important to bring to the \nfloor today this range of five different bills, three of them \nbipartisan, all of them strong, whose ideas were part of the package \nadopted on the floor yesterday and that I am confident will be adopted \nby the House and signed into law by our President. This Senate can, \nwill, should continue to make bipartisan progress in investing in \nAmerican manufacturing.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I strongly support the bicameral, \nbipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, WIOA. This long \nover-due reauthorization will help Americans to develop the skills \nnecessary to participate in today's global economy. I would be remiss \nif I did not commend the leaders of the Senate Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Committee--especially Senators Harkin, Alexander, Murray, \nand Isakson--for their hard work on crafting this important jobs bill \nwhich will benefit job seekers and their families, employers, and the \neconomy. Their House counterparts--Representatives John Kline, George \nMiller, Virginia Foxx, and Rubeen Hinojosa of the House Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce--also deserve our praise and thanks.\n  Congress passed the Workforce Investment Act, WIA, in 1998. It \nexpired in 2003, but Congress has relied on annual appropriations bills \nto extend WIA's authorization 1 year at a time. These appropriations \nbills often have made modest policy changes. Some of the policy changes \nhave been retained in subsequent years but continuity isn't guaranteed. \nThis patchwork approach to improving our workforce education and \ndevelopment system is far from ideal, especially as the labor market \nchanges rapidly in response to the global economy.\n  As our Nation continues the long, arduous climb out of the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression, effective education and workforce \ndevelopment opportunities are vital to sustaining a building and \nsustaining a vibrant middle class. The Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act will allow local workforce investment boards to create \na system which prepares workers for the 21st-century labor market and \nhelps employers find the skilled labor needed to compete and create \ngood jobs here in the United States.\n  Let me provide a report on the workforce development progress we have \nmade in Maryland. The Workforce Investment Network for Maryland is \ncomprised of Maryland's 12 workforce investment area/workforce \ninvestment boards. The network reports assisting more than 216,000 \nMarylanders with job placement assessment, job search workshops, resume \npreparation, and myriad other services from July 2012 to June 2013. \nNearly 16,000 job seekers completed job training programs, with several \nthousand receiving nationally recognized certificates and credentials. \nThrough an aggressive outreach process, the Workforce Investment \nNetwork for Maryland engaged more than 7,700 businesses and was able to \nmatch nearly 44,000 jobs seekers with employers.\n  In Maryland, our local workforce investment boards know how to \nrespond to the needs of the local community. The field of cyber \nsecurity is projected to grow by 41 percent over the next 8 years, and \njobs in this expanding field pay a median hourly wage of $38 per hour. \nMaryland is a hotbed of activity in the cyber security field since it \nis home to the U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency, the \nDefense Information Systems Agency, the Navy Fleet Cyber Command, and \nhundreds of Federal contractors and private technology companies. In an \neffort to address the lack skilled cyber security workers and increase \nthe number of qualified workers in the pipeline, a three-way \npartnership--the Pathways to Cybersecurity Careers Consortium--was \ncreated to bring together the efforts of six workforce development \nagencies, three community colleges, and the local business community. \nThe partnership, led by Anne Arundel Workforce Development Corporation, \nwas awarded a $4.9 million community-based job training grant to create \nthe Pathways to Cyber Security Program. The grant was intended to \nassist 1,000 new, dislocated, underemployed, recently separated \nveterans, and incumbent workers in obtaining cyber security \ncertifications identified as critical industry shortages by regional \nbusinesses and government agencies. I am proud to report that nearly \n1,150 workers have received training in the program, 755 program \nparticipants have received cyber security certifications, and 721 \nprogram graduates have been hired by an employer or improved their \nskills with an existing employer. Some of the graduates of the cyber \nsecurity programs have begun to work with a number of Federal agencies \nin my home State.\n  As I have traveled across Maryland, I have seen firsthand the \npositive effect of effective programs in action. This past March, I had \nthe opportunity to visit students at Chesapeake College's Continuing \nEducation & Workforce Training Culinary Arts Program. The students in \nthe culinary arts program learn the principles of food preparation, \nobtain a nationally recognized safe food handling certificate, and \nfinish the program ready to enter the workforce in local area hotels \nand restaurants. Having tasted a number of dishes the students \nprepared, I can tell you their training is going well. I was impressed \nby the dedication and enthusiasm of the students. One of them travels \nmore than 2 hours by bus, one way, to attend class each day. I am \nconfident these men and women will continue to hone their skills and \nenhance their employment prospects.\n  Our Nation's at-risk youth present special challenges we must \novercome. Aaron Sierak, a resident of Aberdeen, MD, dropped out of high \nschool during his junior year. After he became discouraged about his \nfuture and expressed a desire to change, he learned about the \nReconnecting Youth dropout recovery program run by the Harford County \nPublic Schools in partnership with the Susquehanna Workforce Network. \nThe Susquehanna Workforce Network helped Aaron obtain his GED, enroll \nin Harford Community College, and obtain a Pell grant to help cover the \ncost of his first year of tuition. Aaron now plans to obtain an \nassociate's degree and registered nursing certification so he can find \nwork in a high-demand--and rewarding--occupation.\n  The Workplace Innovation and Opportunity Act improves upon the \nexisting youth services that helped put Aaron back on a path to \neconomic mobility and a middle-class livelihood. WIOA places a priority \non out-of-school youth by requiring that 75 percent of youth services \nfunding at the State and local level be targeted to career pathways for \nyouth, dropout recovery efforts, and education and training programs \nthat lead to the attainment of a high school diploma and a recognized \npostsecondary credential.\n  The Workplace Innovation and Opportunity Act is bipartisan, bicameral \nlegislation that will improve our workforce development system and help \nput Americans back to work, preparing workers for the 21st-century \nworkforce and helping businesses find the skilled employees they need \nto compete and create even more domestic jobs. WIOA creates a \nstreamlined workforce development system by eliminating 15 existing \nduplicative programs. It applies a single set of outcome metrics to \nevery Federal workforce program under the act. It creates smaller, \nnimbler, and more strategic State and local workforce development \nboards. It integrates intake, case management, and reporting systems \nand strengthens program evaluations. And it eliminates the ``sequence \nof services.'' Finally, WIOA empowers local boards to tailor services \nto their region's employment and workforce needs with on-the-job, \nincumbent worker, and customized training and pay-for-performance \ncontracts.\n  According to the Georgetown University Center on Education and the \nWorkforce, by 2022 the supply of United States workers with \npostsecondary\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\neducation--including 6.8 million workers with bachelor's degrees and \n4.3 million workers with a postsecondary vocational certificate, some \ncollege credits, or an associate's degree--will fall short of the \ndemand for workers with those credentials by 11 million. This mismatch \nwill impede our economic growth and harm our international \ncompetitiveness. It also represents a huge lost opportunity for \nmillions of hard-working Americans and their families. To maintain our \nposition as the world's economic leader, we need to educate and train \nour workers to fill the skilled jobs of the knowledge-based economy. \nAnd the workforce development system needs to pivot from short-term \ncrisis intervention to long-term human capital development. WIOA does \nthat, and the substitute amendment the Senate has passed demonstrates \nthat here in Congress, we can come together to work on legislation that \nwill boost the economic recovery and help all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4126-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  WIOA\n\n  Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate voted this week \nto improve job training in the United States. The Workforce Innovation \nand Opportunity Act, WIOA, is the result of a commitment in both \nparties and both Chambers to modernize our workforce development system \nto ensure American competitiveness. The last time a Workforce \nInvestment Act reauthorization was signed into law was in 1998, far too \nlong ago, and the significant skills gap we face as a Nation is \nevidence that our fragmented system simply is not working.\n  Despite the billions of taxpayer dollars we invest annually on \nFederal job training programs, there are 4.5 million unfilled jobs and \na staggering 10 million unemployed Americans. We need to bridge this \ngap, and WIOA helps get us there by reducing bureaucracy and providing \nAmerican workers with a more flexible and effective workforce training \nsystem. Over the past year, I have heard from businesses, elected State \nand local leaders, and families back home about the critical need for \nreforms to our job training system, and I am glad to have had the \nchance to work on this bill and be a part of this process in the \nSenate.\n  This legislation incorporates many reforms contained in the SKILLS \nAct, which I introduced in the Senate earlier this year, including the \nelimination of 15 programs identified as duplicative or ineffective and \ncountless Federal mandates on States and local boards. In addition, \nWIOA establishes common performance metrics and requires independent \nevaluations every 4 years of all workforce programs to ensure \neffectiveness and accountability to taxpayers. By reducing bureaucracy \nand enhancing flexibility, WIOA eliminates delays that hinder job \nseekers from immediately accessing job training services and reentering \nthe workforce.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' work on this important issue and look \nforward to swift passage of WIOA in both Chambers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4126-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4126-S4127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUNETEENTH REMEMBRANCE\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, last Friday was Juneteenth, which marks \nfour of the most important days in our Nation's long and continuing \nmarch toward racial justice and civil rights in this country.\n  First, on June 19, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation \nProclamation abolished slavery in all U.S. territories. Then 3 years \nlater, a month after the end of our Civil War, Union soldiers arrived \nin Galveston, TX, to free the last of our Nation's slaves. Nearly a \ncentury later on June 19, 1963, with Jim Crow laws still a stain on the \nmoral fabric of our country, President John F. Kennedy sent his Civil \nRights Act of 1963 to Congress. And the following year, as the Nation \nmourned JFK's loss, President Johnson shepherded the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964 to final passage.\n  As we mark these days in our Nation's history, from the end of our \ndarkest period to some of the most important pieces of civil rights \nlegislation passed, we know we still have farther to go.\n  It is appropriate that we do so this year especially, that we mark \nJune 19 and these five moments across our Nation's history, because as \na result of the Supreme Court's decision last year, the Shelby County \ncase, a key piece of President Johnson's Voting Rights Act of 1965 \nstands in bad need of repair and revision; and, in fact, the Voting \nRights Act itself is at risk of becoming a dead letter in the future of \nvoting in our country.\n  Two years ago I had the opportunity to join many of my colleagues in \nthe House and the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, in returning to \nSelma to the site of Bloody Sunday, to the march across the Edmund \nPettus Bridge. Many Members of Congress got a chance to hear again from \nCongressman Lewis about the events of that day, that day that was \netched into the consciousness of this country and mobilized millions to \nspeak out to their representatives and Senators and move this Congress \nfinally to enact legislation that would unlock the key to the ballot \nbox across the country.\n  I was so proud earlier this year to join with Chairman Leahy of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and with Senator Dick Durbin, Congressman \nLewis, icon of the Civil Rights movement, Congressman John Conyers, and \nRepublican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, to introduce a bill that \nwould restore the core protections made possible in the original Voting \nRights Act.\n  The bill we introduced doesn't look at discrimination through the \nlens of the past. It focuses on modern-day violations, not the things \nthat happened 50 years ago. It takes up the challenge laid down by the \nSupreme Court and comes up with a new formula and a new approach that \nmakes voting rights and elections more transparent and has been \ncarefully crafted to be both effective and to pass this Congress. It is \na voting rights bill that is modern, to confront modern voting rights \nchallenges.\n  As a country we have come a long way since 1965, but we are not where \nwe need to be yet. As much as we don't want to admit it or confront it, \nracial discrimination in voting is not a relic of the past, but a \ntragic reality of today. Just yesterday the Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing on what to do to address the loss of a key part of the \nVoting Rights Act that is known as preclearance.\n  In 2013 the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the Voting Rights \nAct, a bill that each and every Senate Republican voted for in 2006. \nLet me be clear about that. Again, in 2006 this body unanimously \nreauthorized the Voting Rights Act. Yet in 2013 the Supreme Court \nstruck down an essential provision of that very act.\n  The Voting Rights Act and leadership to address the challenges of \ncivil rights in this country have long been bipartisan in nature. My \nown family and friends who are Republicans are justifiably proud of \ntheir party's leadership role in addressing the darkest days and the \nbiggest challenges in civil rights in the last century in this country. \nBut today we are struggling in this body to find a single Republican \ncosponsor for this important and necessary bill. I ask my friends: Is \nthis because there is nothing that remains to be done? Is that 2006 \nact, unanimously passed by this body, so obsolete that there is no \nlegislative response necessary to Shelby?\n  I think a response is necessary. A month after the Supreme Court's \ndecision, North Carolina passed a restrictive, a deeply restrictive, \nvoting law that in addition to a strict photo ID requirement reduces \nearly voting and forbids local jurisdictions flexibility in setting \nhours for early voting, among other restrictions. After the Shelby \nCounty decision, in Pasadena, TX, that city's voters adopted a plan to \nreduce the number of single-member districts from eight to six, adding \ntwo at-large representatives, a change nearly certain to reduce Latino \nrepresentation on their city council. Hours after the decision, the \nState of Texas announced plans to implement its photo ID law that had \nlong been blocked under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Again and \nagain, shortly following the Shelby County decision, jurisdictions \nmoved to implement discriminatory voting changes that had previously \nbeen blocked under section 5. Something needs to be done. I would \nsuggest to my colleagues, if you don't like this proposal, please come \nforward with something you can support, with something that looks \nforward, not back; that has a formula that protects voting as the\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\nmost sacred and foundational right of our Republic and allows us to \ncome together. History will not look kindly on our inaction.\n  Two days ago we honored the memory of Dr. King and Coretta Scott King \nwith a Congressional Gold Medal. What better way to honor their legacy \nthan to come together and strengthen the rights they fought so hard to \nsecure for every American?\n  Voting is fundamental, and ensuring that every American has the right \nto vote is at the core of what makes our democracy vibrant.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together and \nto find a way forward for us to put voting rights first and to restore \nthe important legacy of June 19 from across so many incidents in so \nmany years and to move us forward on a positive path.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. President, could I ask my colleague's indulgence for one last 2-\nminute speech?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was to be recognized before, but I \nwill be glad to, but would like the 15 minutes or so I was allowed to \nhave even though it may back up after me.\n  So, Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that Senator Coons \nbe allowed an additional 2 minutes and I be allowed 15 minutes \nthereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COONS. I object, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4127-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMBASSADORIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, when we send American Ambassadors to nearly \nevery country around the world, we are able to strengthen democracy and \nprotect our national security. Ambassadors are voices for American \nvalues and the interests we share with other nations. Simply put, they \nare critical to promoting our foreign policy, our economic and security \ninterests, and our leadership in the world. Yet when--because of \npartisan politics and gridlock at home--we fail to confirm ambassadors, \nwe send a dangerous message about our lack of interest in the world and \nour lack of interest to diplomacy.\n  I have the privilege of chairing the African Affairs Subcommittee of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Through my work as chair, as \nwell as time I spent earlier in my life in Africa, I have seen up close \nboth the incredible opportunities in the continent of Africa as well as \nthe stark challenges.\n  For instance, today, this decade, 7 of the 10 fastest growing \neconomies in the world are in Africa. Yet right now 1 in 5 American \nembassies of the 54 countries on that continent lacks a confirmed \nambassador. Africa faces serious security challenges. Boko Haram in \nNigeria, which has recently kidnapped hundreds of girls and burned down \nchurches and schools is just one example. Yet as the countries \nbordering that troubled area of Nigeria try to coordinate a response to \nensure that conflict doesn't spill over borders, we lack confirmed \nambassadors in the adjacent nations of Niger and Cameroon.\n  In Namibia, where we also don't have a confirmed ambassador, the \nUnited States is dedicating $50 million to combat HIV and Aids. We need \nan ambassador to oversee those funds and make sure they are \nappropriately used.\n  I will briefly review some of the numbers and facts. Our nominees to \nthe countries of Namibia, Cameroon, and Niger have waited for a vote \nfor 330 days--almost a year. Our nominee to Sierra Leone has waited 352 \ndays, our nominee to Mauritania has waited 289 days, and our nominee to \nGabon has waited 287 days.\n  In the long absence of ambassadors, professional career Foreign \nService officers, capable and competent Deputy Chiefs of Mission assume \nthis role on an interim basis. I am deeply concerned that with the \nAugust turnover for Foreign Service officers quickly approaching, many \nof our embassies will also be left without a DCM at the helm.\n  This is inexcusable. It hurts our economy, our national security, and \nour leadership to leave these posts unfilled and the ambassadorial \nnominees unconfirmed for so long.\n  I have great hope for Africa's future. Across the continent there are \nemerging democracies, growing economies, and although there are some \nsecurity challenges, I am optimistic we can meet them in partnership \nwith Africa's leaders.\n  When we fail to send career public servants to serve as our \nambassadors, we send the message that we are not serious about these \nchallenges and are not willing to invest in these partnerships.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together across the aisle to devote \nourselves to getting our ambassadorial nominees to Africa confirmed. \nThis transcends partisanship, and it is a task we should turn to \npromptly.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Alabama \nfor allowing me to go ahead of him in cue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4127-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4127-S4129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, we say that America is a nation of \nimmigrants, and, of course, that is true. There is no other country in \nthe world for which immigration is so central to its history and its \nidentity. Let's take a moment to reflect on what that really means.\n  Here is a photo. I am afraid it is not a very good quality. I took it \nmyself. It is a photo that I took at a naturalization ceremony held for \nActive Duty servicemembers in Fort Carson, CO. The 13 soldiers and \nspouses who became U.S. citizens on that day represented 11 different \ncountries of origin even though they are wearing our uniform.\n  They came from all over the world: Colombia, Haiti, Malaysia, Mexico, \nNicaragua, China, the Philippines, South Korea, Togo, Ukraine, and the \nUnited Kingdom. They all came for this pursuit of the American dream, \nand they all came to serve this country. They are going to be the \npeople who help us determine our future.\n  The same is true with the refugees fleeing persecution from around \nthe world. The parents seeking opportunity for their children and those \nstepping forward to serve and sacrifice for our shared values have made \nthis country the America we love. But our existing immigration policies \ndo not reflect this history or the values that shaped it. Instead, it \nis a mess of unintended consequences that hurts our businesses, rips \nfamilies apart, and keeps us at a competitive disadvantage with the \nrest of the world.\n  Tomorrow marks 365 days--1 year--since the Senate acted to fix these \nproblems and passed bipartisan immigration reform. Yet here we are \nstill waiting for the House of Representatives to do the same. The \nHouse's inaction is costing our Nation. It has cost us, among other \nthings, $13.4 billion in lost revenue in this last year alone. With \neach additional day that passes, we lose another $37 million of \nrevenue.\n  What is most frustrating about this to me is that we agree--on both \nsides of the aisle--that our current immigration system is broken. We \nagree that our immigration system is critical for our economy and for \nour country.\n  In June of last year we passed a bill in this Chamber with strong \nbipartisan support. It won the support of a broad coalition of \nRepublicans and Democrats. It also has the support of countless \norganizations, from migrant workers to farmers and ranchers, from law \nenforcement agencies to the faith community, Latino leaders across this \ncountry, and the Chamber of Commerce to labor unions.\n  Often I tell those who despair about the lack of leadership in \nCongress that there is a model we can learn from, and it is the \nbipartisan work that was done on this bill. I cannot say enough about \nthe Republican Members of the Gang of 8 who negotiated a bill over \nseven or eight months, knowing what the base of their party might say \nabout the fact that they were in that room but still willing to do it \nbecause it was right to do for their country and it was right to do for \ntheir party--in that order.\n  In this job I have had the opportunity to meet with a diverse cross \nsection of\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nColoradans throughout the State, each struggling beneath the weight of \na broken immigration system. I have spoken with peach growers on the \nWestern Slope, vegetable growers in Brighton, and melon farmers in the \nSan Luis Valley--farmers such as Philip Davis from Mesa Winds Farm and \nWinery in Western Colorado who cannot get the seasonal workers he \nneeds. He will tell you how hard he and his family have had to work to \nfill these gaps, and how every single day they have to keep fighting to \nprevent their 36-acre farm from closing.\n  A legal, reliable, competent workforce for our Nation's farms and \nranches is essential for Colorado's $40 billion agricultural industry, \nand it is essential for our agricultural industry across the country. \nMaybe that is the reason why both the United Farm Workers union and the \ngrowers all across the United States of America endorsed this bill.\n  I have heard from Colorado's high-tech companies such as Full \nContact, a tech startup in Boulder, CO, that acquired a company \noverseas. They have been unable to hire the talented engineers they \nneed to grow their businesses and add jobs.\n  I have also heard from Colorado's dedicated teachers and \nadministrators who work tirelessly to teach the next generation of \nentrepreneurs and innovators--teachers such as Mary Edwin from Colorado \nSprings. Mary, a graduate of Johns Hopkins with a master's degree in \neducation, will likely be forced to return home to Nigeria, leaving \nbehind the children she works with at Turman Elementary School, all on \naccount of our broken, outdated visa system.\n  This year on April 7, approximately 6 months before the 2015 fiscal \nyear even begins, the government announced it had already reached its \nstatutory cap on H-1B petitions for H-1B visas. It has also reached its \nexemption for 20,000 advanced-degree holders. These are exactly the \ntype of workers our State and the national economy require.\n  I will paint a picture of what our country would look like if the \nSenate's immigration bill were actually enacted. First, millions of \npeople who came to this country for a better life, including young \npeople whose parents brought them here as children, would have the \nopportunity to enter a tough but fair pathway to citizenship. With a \npath in place, we would see higher wages, greater consumption of goods \nand increased revenue. It would reduce our debt by nearly $1 trillion--\neven in Washington that is real money--over 20 years, and increase our \neconomic growth by roughly 5.4 percent over that period of time.\n  Next, our bill would put in place an efficient and flexible visa \nsystem that would enable us to compete in a changing 21st century \nglobal economy. Talented entrepreneurs and innovators from around the \nworld would have the opportunity to stay here in order to create jobs \nand fuel our economy. High-skilled workers in math and science, and \nlower-skilled workers in industries such as hospitality and tourism \nwould come into the country to fill jobs where there are no available \nU.S. workers.\n  We would provide stability for our agricultural industry with a new \nstreamlined program for agricultural workers--one that is more usable \nfor employers and protects our workers.\n\n  Our borders would be more secure. There is one border security bill \nthat has passed the Congress, and that is the bill passed by the \nSenate. It allows for new fencing, doubling the number of border \nagents, and increased spending on new technology. We would have full \nsituational awareness on the border in order to allow us to intercept \nthreats rapidly and successfully. And with the mandatory employment \nverification system and more effective entry-exit system, we would \nprevent future waves of illegal immigration.\n  A huge number of people who are here entered the country legally; we \njust don't know where they are. We ought to have a system that tells us \nthat. These are all changes that our Nation urgently needs.\n  In the time since the Senate passed the bill, we heard a litany of \nreasons why it can't pass the House. They say the Senate bill doesn't \nhave support in the House. If Speaker Boehner put the bill on the floor \ntomorrow, it would pass. They say the Senate bill is too long, too big, \ntoo comprehensive. I, for one, am willing to consider looking at this \nbill in smaller pieces as long as all the problems with the system are \naddressed. But the House has not produced--never mind voted--on a \nsingle bill, much less a series of smaller bills.\n  They say they want more border security, but what do they know about \nthe border that our Republican colleagues from Arizona, John McCain and \nJeff Flake, don't know? What do they know about the border that Senator \nFlake and Senator McCain don't know? We have 21,000 border agents, and \nwe are putting another 21,000 on the border if this bill were passed. \nWe spend more money on the border than we do on all other Federal law \nenforcement combined, but they say there is not enough border \nsecurity--not that they passed a border security bill. The only folks \nwho have passed a border security bill are right here in the Senate. We \nshould ask them how many more agents they need, and how many more \nbillions of dollars we should spend.\n  If the House wants to secure the border first, which the Senate bill \ndoes, let's see their legislation. We are waiting. I, for one, would \nlike to see them think about customs agents and trade instead of adding \nmore billions of dollars at the border.\n  The most common excuse we have heard is that the House has not had \ntime to pass a bill. The House was only scheduled to work 9 days last \nSeptember. Ultimately, they came back for a few extra days to shut the \ngovernment down.\n  In the year since the Senate passed the bill, the House has found the \ntime to vote 17 times to repeal, delay or dismantle the health care \nbill--54 times in total in the last 4 years. They voted to name 20 post \noffices and an assortment of 20 other government buildings. They have \nheld five separate House committee hearings. They produced three \ndifferent public reports and passed one resolution on the topic of \nBenghazi--a topic that has never come up in most of our town hall \nmeetings.\n  What I hear in Colorado over and over is we have to stop excuses, \nstop posturing, and pass a bill--a good bipartisan bill, and that is \nwhat the House of Representatives ought to be doing now. Fixing our \nbroken immigration system is long overdue, and I believe that the \nbipartisan solution crafted in our Senate bill will fix it just fine. \nIt is time for the House to act.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague, again, for \nhis patience and kindness in allowing me to go first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague. I would note \nhe didn't mention and wasn't mentioned in the effort to pass the Gang \nof 8 bill, which was dead on arrival in the House, the American worker. \nThe numbers just came out yesterday, a revision of the economic \nnumbers--our gross domestic product showed a decline in the first \nquarter of 2.9 percent, a GDP decline of 2.9 percent, which is the \nlargest we have seen since the recession hit--those dramatic days.\n  We are not creating jobs in this country. Wages are not going up. We \ndo not need to be surging the number of immigrants coming into the \ncountry. We don't need to be passing a law such as the Gang of 8 bill \nthat would double the H-1B workers brought into America, increase by 50 \npercent the annual flow, add another 500,000 so-called backlog workers, \nin addition to legalizing some 11 million-plus, at a time when \nAmericans are having wages fall and jobs are very difficult to find.\n  For example, I would note that workforce participation levels have \nfallen to their lowest point since the 1970s. This is a dramatic \ndecline in the number of people working and the numbers continue to \nslide. Since 2009, we have had a decline in median income for families \nin America of $2,300.\n  They suggest repeatedly that this legislation we have brought to the \nfloor was focused primarily on melon harvesters, but that is not so. \nAbout 80 percent of the people who would be given legal status and \nwould be allowed to come to America to work under the guest worker \nprogram would not be on the farms. They would be taking jobs in plants \nand factories all over America, reducing the need for businesses to \nincrease wages for a change and try to attract people into some of \nthese more\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\ndifficult jobs. It is not that people won't do this work; it is that \nthe wages aren't sufficient to take care of them and their families.\n  We need wages to rise. We have a loose labor market, not a tight \nlabor market. People are having a hard time finding jobs. We are \ntalking about a dramatic increase in the number of workers at a time \nwhen the economy is struggling, workers are hurting, wages are down, \nand unemployment is up.\n  I just want to dispute that. I want to push back on it. That has been \nmy analysis from the beginning.\n  Oh, we need more high-tech workers, they say, and businesses say that \ntoo. But what do the numbers show? Professor Harold Salzman at Rutgers \ndid a report that said we are actually graduating about 500,000 STEM \ngraduates--science, technology, engineering, mathematics--about 500,000 \ngraduate a year, but we only have jobs for fewer than half of them. \nMost STEM graduates are not working in their fields. They haven't been \nable to find the kind of work for which they trained. One of the \nreasons is that a substantial number of those jobs are taken by H-1B \nworkers who are brought in not to immigrate to America to create jobs, \nI say to my colleagues; they come in on the H-1B visa, which is a \nlimited period of time, they work at lower wages, and they return to \ntheir country. They are not on a path to be permanent citizens. But it \nis a great asset to businesses that don't want to hire, perhaps--it \nseems--people and put them on a career path where they might be \nexpected to get pay raises in the years to come.\n  So I will challenge even that fact. I talked to a business person \nrecently about a factory they have. The work sounded pretty good to me. \nHe wants to bring in foreign workers to Alabama. Well, we have \nunemployment in Alabama. We have people on unemployment insurance. We \nhave people on welfare and food stamps and assistance who need to be \ntaking those jobs.\n  So the first responsibility of a congress, a senate, when they \nconsider an immigration bill is what is in the interests of the \nAmerican people. I don't believe it is wrong to discuss that. We have \nto ask what is in our national interests, the interests of our people, \nand this is not a time to be doubling the H-1B workers into America. It \nis just not. And more and more scientific, peer-reviewed, excellent \nstudies are coming out on that.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Durbin. I know he is exceedingly busy. My \nintention is to make a unanimous consent request that we actually do \nsomething about the crisis we have on the border.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4129-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4129-S4130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS--S. 202 AND S. 91\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the \nJudiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. 202, the \nAccountability Through Electronic Verification Act; that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of the measure; I ask further \nthat the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the \nmotion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  For the information of all Senators, S. 202, introduced by Senator \nGrassley and of which I am a cosponsor, amends the Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to make an E-Verify \nprogram permanent. This is critical to protecting jobs and wages of \nAmerican workers. It requires the government to at least run a cursory \ncomputer check to determine whether a person applied for a job is \nlegally in this country.\n  I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Alabama?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, a year ago \ntoday on the floor of the Senate we passed the comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill, and 68 Senators--14 Republicans and all of the \nDemocrats--voted for it. We sent it to the House of Representatives. \nIncluded in that bill was a requirement that all employers use a \nmandatory electronic employment verification system to verify that all \ntheir employees were legal. Job applicants were required to show \nidentifying documents, such as passport, driver's license, biometric \nwork authorization card, including a photo ID. Any employer who \ncontinued to employ undocumented immigrants faced serious penalties. \nThat would end the hiring of undocumented workers, which the Senator \nfrom Alabama has spoken to. E-Verify, though, has to be part of \ncomprehensive immigration reform; otherwise, it would devastate the \neconomy and hurt innocent workers. This was included in the bill, and \nwe said there would be no path to citizenship until we have established \nthis as a nationwide standard to verify that workers truly were not \nundocumented.\n\n  That bill came to the floor a year ago. The Senator from Alabama \nvoted against it. It passed. It went to the House of Representatives. \nIt has languished for 1 solid year. House Speaker John Boehner will not \ncall that bill because he knows it will pass. We are not going to take \nthat bill apart piece by piece, as the Senator from Alabama suggests.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator from Illinois \nfor his articulate response. I would note that the E-Verify program \nshould already have been fully implemented long ago. If it is so good, \nwhy don't we bring it up and pass it now? Why do we have to pass along \nwith it a bill that will double the number of guest workers in the \ncountry and would increase immigration and also had many other flaws in \nit?\n  So I ask unanimous consent--and this will be my last unanimous \nconsent request this evening--that the Committee on Finance be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 91, the Child Tax Credit \nIntegrity Preservation Act of 2013; that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of the measure; I ask further that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed and that the motion to \nreconsider be considered and laid upon the table with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  For the information of all Senators, S. 91, introduced by Senator \nVitter and which I cosponsored, would close a loophole in the law that \npermits illegal aliens to illegally and improperly receive cash tax \ncredits from the Internal Revenue Service, according to the Treasury \nDepartment's own inspector general. The IRS sent illegal aliens $4.2 \nbillion in additional child tax credit payments in 2010. The cost has \nquadrupled in 5 years. In one instance, four illegal aliens \nfraudulently claimed benefits for 20 children they claimed lived with \nthem in the same trailer and received from the IRS $29,000 in refunds.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that this bill be passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \ncircumstance is this: If a person is legally required to pay income \ntaxes in America, a person is legally entitled to some deductions and \ncredits. One of those credits which a person is entitled to is a child \ntax credit. If a person has a minor child, that person pays less in \ntaxes in America.\n  What the Senator from Alabama and this bill try to do is restrict the \navailability of this child tax credit to some workers in America. I \nthink they have gone too far. I want to make sure working families with \nsmall children have the helping hand of our Tax Code. I want to stop \nany fraud in any program in our Tax Code, but I don't believe this bill \nis a balanced approach to solving the problem, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Illinois. I would have to say that the inspector general of \nPresident Obama's own U.S. Treasury Department has said this is a clear \nabuse. They have written a detailed letter on why it ought to be \nclosed. I am flabbergasted and amazed that we would sit by and allow $4 \nbillion in child tax credit payments to go out that are not justified. \nWe have been told this. Why is it that we won't even respond to this \nlittle problem?\n  It is one reason I brought it up today--because I want the American \npeople to know this Congress, this Democratic majority is not willing \nto\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\ntake any steps to confront the problems we have with regard to \nimmigration unless they get a massive increase that satisfies activist \ngroups, business interests, and their own political interests.\n  It is not in the interests of the American people. We need to do the \nright thing for our country based on law, on principles, on fairness. \nThat is what we need to do. People who come to the country illegally \naren't entitled to get child tax credits. I would think certainly not \nfor children who don't exist. Nobody is going out and checking to see \nif children are in the home. They are just claiming this. The numbers \nhave surged in recent years. The inspector general expressed great \nconcern about that--how it went from $1 billion to $4 billion. That is \na lot of money, $4 billion in 1 year, subsidizing, encouraging further \nillegal entry into America.\n  The first thing any country ought to do to control its borders, its \nsovereignty, its legal integrity, is not to provide financial benefit \nto people who violate the law and then give them benefits that are \nunlawful. That is beyond comprehension.\n  I want to say to my colleagues, the last few weeks it is becoming \nmore and more clear that we have chaos at the border--all a direct \nresult of the President and his administrative officials who have told \nthe world we have no intention, basically, of deporting people who \nenter the country unlawfully, particularly the young people. And has \nthat been heard? Have people around the world heard what has been said? \nYes. And they are coming in unbelievable numbers, creating a \nhumanitarian crisis, creating a crisis of law for America, and creating \na financial crisis. The President's Fiscal Year 2015 Budget request \n$868 million for the Unaccompanied Alien Children program at HHS. Now \nthat cost is expected to be $2.28 billion, based on the numbers today. \nIn 2011 there were 6,000 apprehended children trying to come into \nAmerica illegally. This year they say it could reach 90,000 or higher. \n90,000 from 6,000? It is a direct result of the unwillingness of \nPresident Obama to look the American people in the eye, tell the people \nthroughout the entire world: We believe in immigration. We have a \nlawful system of immigration. Please apply. Wait your turn. If you \nqualify, you will be able to come to America, and we are going to do it \nfairly and objectively and treat everybody with respect, but do not \ncome unlawfully. Do not give money to some smuggler. Do not attempt to \nsneak over our border across the desert and place your lives at risk \nbecause it is against our law, and we will apprehend you and we will \npromptly deport you and you will lose all the money you have invested \nin this effort. Just do not do it.\n\n  They refuse to say that with clarity. Secretary Johnson was before \nthe Judiciary Committee and I asked him about it. He almost refused to \nsay: Don't come to America because it is against our law. He said: \nDon't come because it is dangerous. That is not the kind of message we \nneed to hear from our leaders. The first thing a law enforcement \nofficer should do--and the President is the chief law enforcement \nofficer--but the Secretary of Homeland Security has the Border Patrol, \nhe has Immigration and Customs enforcement officers, he has the \nCitizenship and Immigration Service. That is who is supposed to be \nenforcing our immigration law. He will not say that with clarity and he \nwill not communicate it with clarity.\n  Vice President Biden supposedly made a statement in Central America \nabout it. It was weak. It just was not strong. What is it? Do they want \nthe illegality to continue? Do they believe in open borders? This \nCongress, this Senate is about to recess having done not one thing \nabout it, and the humanitarian crisis continues on the border.\n  These children, some of them are young. Some of them are 16, 17, 18, \n19, 20, 21, and they claim to be 17. Who knows. They are not carrying \nbirth certificates with them. It is creating an incredible crisis. One \nreporter said the Border Patrol, instead of enforcing the law, are \nchanging diapers. This is a very dangerous situation. Our entire legal \nsystem is crumbling about us, and the chief law enforcement officer in \nAmerica--the President--alone is the one who can bring order to it.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security works for the President. If he \ndoes not get on it, he needs to be out of there. The President needs to \nsay: Get this thing under control. What are we paying you for?\n  What about the officers and agents? What do they think? Our officers \nand agents are stunned. There is report after report of senior officers \nsaying they have never seen anything like this. It is a direct result \nof the inconsistent message we are sending. They are saying a message \nis only part of the solution. It has to be backed up with words.\n  So how is it happening today? A child and an adult cross the border. \nWhat are they doing today? They are going straight up--this is, I know, \nhard to believe--they go straight to the Border Patrol officer and turn \nthemselves in. What does the Immigration officer do? He takes them into \ncustody. If they have a child, the adult has to stay with the child, \nand then they put them in a shelter. Then they give them a hearing \ndate. The hearing date is down the road. They have a backlog. So what \ndo they do then? They release them. They allow them to go someplace \nwhere somebody will take them in, which is what they desire to begin \nwith. Then they are told to appear at court at some given date in the \nfuture.\n  Nobody is going to investigate if they do not show up, or to see \nwhere they are, and there is nobody to investigate it. We are talking \nabout a huge increase--by tens of thousands--of people coming into the \ncountry, in addition to the 11 million who are already here. So this is \na guaranteed failure. That is what everybody has been telling us who \nknows anything about it.\n  The ICE officers, the Immigration and Customs enforcement officers--\ntheir association went so far two years ago to file a lawsuit in \nFederal court. What did they say? They said this administration is \nviolating the laws of America and the Constitution by directing them \nnot to enforce the laws they had sworn to uphold. The Federal judge was \nvery sympathetic with them. He eventually ruled there was not standing \nfor this lawsuit to proceed, but he was very sympathetic with the \nmerits of their claim because that is exactly what has happened.\n  We have a situation where the President of the United States, based \non the DREAM Act--the idea that we would provide legal status to \neverybody who was brought here under, I think, 18, that we would \nprovide basically a legal status and a pathway to citizenship--that \nbill came up before the Senate and has been voted down three times by \nthe Senate.\n  So what did the President do? He directed that the law not be \nenforced as to them, even though the law remains on the books. That is \npart of the message that was heard in Central America, and that is \nencouraging people to come unlawfully to America.\n  So we are not against immigration. We do need a certain number of \nfarmworkers. We do need and will accept validated people who come with \nskills who are ready to go to work. We should do that, and we have a \ngenerous policy, but we should not be doubling it, as the Gang of 8 \nbill did. We just do not have the jobs for them. If we had low \nunemployment, rising wages, and a shortage of workers, I think we could \njustify a generous immigration policy perhaps but not now. Canada is \nnot doing this. England is not doing this. They are reducing, right \nnow, the number of people who are allowed into their countries. They \nfeel an obligation to see that their people get the jobs first.\n  The whole matter is disturbing to me, that we are at a point where \nthe law is not being enforced properly in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4130-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4130-S4131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECESS APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today, a unanimous Supreme Court ruled \nagainst the President's unconstitutional recess appointments in a \ndramatic repudiation of the White House's position. Nine to zero they \nruled. It was an obvious decision, in my opinion. It was breathtaking \nthat the President of the United States would appoint members to the \nNational Labor Relations Board who have to come before the Senate for \nconfirmation under the Constitution--we have the advice and consent \nauthority--and he did not want to do that, so he just appointed them \nand claimed we were in recess. We were\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\nnot in recess. It was not a close question. He just did it. So it took \nover 2 years of a lawsuit, and finally the Supreme Court has now ruled. \nA lower court ruled against the President some months ago. The \nPresident clearly and deliberately violated article II of the \nConstitution in circumventing the advice and consent clause.\n  At the time of these appointments, the Senate had determined it was \nnot in recess. We determined we were not in recess, and the Court \naffirmed that determination. The question of whether the Senate is in \nsession is up to the Senate, not the President. So the President has to \nyield to the Senate's authority to determine its own rules and \nprocedures. This is basic law, it seems to me.\n  Unfortunately, the President has made it clear that he will only \nfollow the letter of the law when it is not an impediment to whatever \nagenda he has at the time.\n  Just today, the White House displayed again its lack of respect for \nour constitutional traditions. In a rather brazen display of candor, \nthe new White House spokesman today explained the administration's \nrationale for moving unilaterally to rewrite America's immigration \nlaws. Here is what Josh Earnest had to say. Hear me, colleagues. This \nis a direct threat to the integrity of our constitutional separation of \npowers. It is not far different from what the President said before, \nbut it was today.\n\n       [W]e're not just going to sit around and wait interminably \n     for Congress. . . .\n\n  How about that: We are not going to sit around and wait on Congress. \nWe do not have to fool with Congress.\n  We have been waiting 1 year already. The President has tasked his \nSecretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson with reviewing what options \nare available to the President, what is at his disposal using his \nExecutive authority to try to address some of the problems that have \nbeen created by our broken immigration system.\n  So this is about as close as you can get to an open admission that \nthe administration does not believe it has an obligation to follow the \nlaw. You cannot just eviscerate whole code sections of the law claiming \nthat you have authority to decide what you want to prosecute and what \nyou do not. Jonathan Turley, the great law professor, has hammered this \nidea. He is a liberal. He voted for President Obama in 2008. He has \nhammered this idea. This is an abuse of Executive power.\n  We are seeing the results of this on our borders right now. In 2011, \nwe had 6,000 illegal immigrant youth from Central America apprehended. \nThis year, we may hit more than 90,000. Next year, projections are as \nhigh as 130,000, costing billions of dollars to take care of them. That \nwould be more than a 2,000-percent increase.\n  The President's policies are directly responsible for this crisis. \nThey just are. He has acted unilaterally to suspend immigration \nenforcement and has sent the signal to the world that our borders are \nopen and that if you get here unlawfully and borough in, you will be \nable to stay here.\n  As former ICE Director John Sandweg said: ``If you are a run-of-the-\nmill immigrant here illegally, your odds of getting deported are close \nto zero.''\n  I asked Homeland Secretary Johnson about this during his testimony, \nto say clearly to the world: Do not come unlawfully. You must follow \nthe laws of the country. If you come unlawfully, you will be sent back \nhome. He refused to even say that in my presence with any clarity.\n  Here is what the New York Times reported on April 10:\n\n       With detention facilities, asylum offices and immigration \n     courts overwhelmed, enough migrants have been released \n     temporarily in the United States that back home in Central \n     America people have heard that those who make it to American \n     soil have a good chance of staying. ``Word has gotten out \n     that we're giving people permission and walking them out the \n     door,'' said Chris Cabrera, a Border Patrol agent who is vice \n     president of the local of the National Border Patrol Council, \n     the agent's union. ``So they're coming across in droves.''\n\n  That is exactly what has happened. It is a national tragedy. It is a \nhuman tragedy for those children. It is costing them money, placing \ntheir lives at risk, and we are not able to handle them effectively.\n  Colleagues, I have a timeline over 17 pages long of the ways \nsystematically this administration has ignored or simply suspended \nimmigration law by issuing orders to the officers not to do their duty \nessentially.\n  So 1 week before the Fourth of July holiday, America cannot even \nprotect its own borders, and what do our Democratic colleagues wish to \ndo? They want to adjourn this Chamber, go home to their barbecues, work \non their reelection campaigns, and promise while they are home they are \nfighting to end the lawlessness at the border, while doing nothing, \nwhile actually doing nothing but objecting to legislation that would \nmake a real difference.\n  I see my colleague Senator Sanders and I will wrap up.\n  I believe we were elected, colleagues, to protect this country and \nits people and the laws of our country. A critical component of \nnational sovereignty is a control over your borders. We have passed \nimmigration laws that are on the books and not being enforced. We on \nthe Republican side have opposed immigration laws that would reduce the \nillegality that cannot even see the light of day on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  So I am asking my colleagues, we ought to stay here. Why do we not \nstay here and work on this crisis? I intend to request that we do so--\nand have done so--and offered unanimous consents to bring up \nlegislation that would help improve the situation. But that has been \nobjected to.\n  Our taxpayers are overstressed. If we want to get this country back \non track, we need to control this border and enforce the Nation's laws \nin a fair and equitable way that allows generous immigration to \nAmerica, that treats people fairly and decently, but is not an open \nborder, where people can come by the tens of thousands unlawfully.\n  How can any of us relax at an Independence Day barbeque next week \nknowing at this very moment the Nation's sovereignty is being eroded? I \nthink we have failed in our session. We have not responded to the \ncrisis that is on our border. We could have made real progress. But \nthere is a lack of will and a lack of willingness to act. I am \ndisappointed to see that fact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as chairman of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I would hope that every American understands that \nthe cost of war does not end when the last shots are fired or when the \nlast missiles are launched. The cost of war continues until the last \nveteran receives the care and benefits he or she has earned on the \nbattlefield.\n  War is an incredibly expensive proposition in terms of human life, \nhuman suffering, and in financial terms. In my very strong view, if we \nare not prepared to take care of those men and women who went to war, \nthen we should not send them to war in the first place. Taking care of \nveterans is a cost of war, period.\n  In terms of Iraq and Afghanistan, the human cost of those wars is \nalmost 7,000 dead. The cost of war is 530,000 veterans seeking care at \nthe VA in 2013 for post-traumatic stress disorder, not to mention those \nstruggling with traumatic brain injury.\n  The cost of war is too many servicemembers coming home with missing \narms and legs, lost eyesight, or lost hearing. The cost of war includes \nveterans each day dying by suicide, high rates of divorce, wives trying \nto rebuild their lives after losing their husbands, kids growing up in \none-parent homes, and a too high rate of unemployment for returning \nservicemembers. Those are some of the real costs of war that this \nCongress cannot ignore.\n  Several weeks ago, Senator McCain and I hammered out an agreement \nwhich I think goes a significant way to address many of the serious \nproblems facing the VA. I am very proud that the Sanders-McCain bill \npassed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support, with a vote of \n93 to 3. In terms of funding, very importantly, by a vote of 75 to 19, \nan overwhelming vote, the Senate made it crystal clear that the current \ncrisis in the VA, the crisis facing veterans who are not getting health \ncare in a timely manner, is an emergency and should be paid for through \nemergency funding. I am very proud that in a bipartisan way the Senate \nmade that important vote.\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\n  In the last 4 years we have seen a significant increase in the number \nof veterans utilizing VA health care. In addition, many of our other \nveterans from World War II, Korea, and Vietnam require a greater amount \nof care as they age.\n  Further, a recent VA audit revealed that more than 57,000 veterans \nare on too-long waiting lists in order to be scheduled for medical \nappointments.\n  In addition to that, there are many other veterans who were never put \non a list in the first place, which is what this whole scandal is \nlargely about.\n  Clearly, these waiting lists and veterans not getting care in a \ntimely manner are unacceptable and must be dealt with immediately, not \n6 months from now, not a year from now, not in a great debate about \nnational priorities. This is a crisis which must be dealt with now. I \ncould not agree with Senator John McCain more when he said on the \nSenate floor during this debate:\n\n       If there is a definition of emergency, I would say that \n     this legislation fits that. It is an emergency. It is an \n     emergency what is happening to our veterans and the men and \n     women who have served this country. We need to pass this \n     legislation and get it to conference with the House as soon \n     as possible.\n\n  Senator McCain is right. I concur with what he said. We need to get \nthis legislation moving as soon as possible and get it to the \nPresident's desk. Veterans in this country must get quality care and \nthey must get that health care in a timely manner. We need to provide \nthe funding the VA needs to accomplish that goal and do it as quickly \nas we can.\n  The simple truth is that the VA needs more doctors, the VA needs more \nnurses, it needs more mental health providers, and in certain parts of \nthis country more space for a growing patient population. That is the \nreality.\n  Does the Veterans' Administration need better management? You bet it \ndoes. Does it need to be more efficient, more accountable? Absolutely. \nBut at the end of the day, if you do not have the doctors and the \nnurses and the medical staff you need, there will continue to be \nwaiting lines unacceptably long and veterans will not get the care they \nneed.\n  I received, as did the chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, a letter on June 17 which was signed by virtually every \nmajor veterans organization. That is the American Legion, the DAV, the \nVFW, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans, and many other \norganizations. They made a number of very important points in their \nletter talking about the kind of legislation we need to pass. I want to \nquote from one section of their letter, which they entitled ``Protect \nand Preserve the VA Health Care System.''\n\n       Any legislative, regulatory or administrative changes \n     designed to respond to the VA health access crisis, whether \n     temporary or permanent, must protect, preserve and strengthen \n     the VA health care system so that it remains capable of \n     providing a full continuum of high-quality, timely health \n     care to all enrolled veterans . . .\n\n  Then the letter continues:\n\n       Unless the legislation simultaneously sets VA on a path to \n     intelligently strengthen health care delivery, expand access \n     and capacity, reallocate resources and ensure that overall VA \n     funding matches its mission, the current problems confronting \n     VA and veterans will inevitably recur.\n\n  In other words, what they are saying is that unless we strengthen the \nVA, give them the staffing and the space they need, this problem of \nwaiting periods of time will continue. In order to address the long \nwaiting periods, the Senate legislation says to veterans around the \ncountry that if you cannot get into a VA facility in a timely manner, \nyou will be able to get the care you need outside of the VA. That means \naccess to private doctors, community health centers, or Department of \nDefense or Indian Health Service facilities.\n  Furthermore, what the bill says is to veterans who live 40 miles or \nmore from a VA facility, that if they choose, they also have the option \nof seeking care outside of the VA.\n  Just as the letter from the veterans service organizations \narticulated, it is critical to address the current waiting period \ncrisis. But we also have to make sure that that crisis does not \ncontinue to occur. We do that by providing the VA the tools it needs to \nensure sufficient capacity for veterans seeking care at VA medical \nfacilities. Clearly, no medical program can work unless we have the \nnecessary medical staff.\n  Today, the VA has thousands of vacancies for health care providers. \nThese vacancies, along with an untold shortage of health care providers \nto meet the demands of veterans who want to get VA care, has a direct \nimpact on the ability to get veterans in the door for appointments. To \nfill these positions, the Senate bill provides for the hiring of VA \ndoctors and nurses, and it does so in an expedited fashion by ensuring \nVA's hiring efforts are not hamstrung by Federal bureaucracy.\n  During the discussion of VA health care, let us not forget that today \nalone some 230,000 veterans will walk in the doors of VA facilities for \nhealth care--230,000 veterans today, 6.5 million veterans in a year. \nWhile it is absolutely true that not every veteran is satisfied by the \ncare he or she is getting, the overwhelming majority--well over 90 \npercent of them--believe they receive high quality care. Over and over, \nI hear from Vermont veterans and veterans across the country who say \nthat once they get into the system the care is good.\n  That is just not my view, it is the view of virtually all of the \nmajor veterans organizations and a number of independent studies that \nhave compared VA health care with that in the private sector. We owe it \nto these veterans, to our veterans, to fix the current problems and \nbolster the system to ensure that quality care is available in the VA \nfor years and decades to come.\n  I have heard a lot of criticism of the VA. Much of that criticism is \nvalid. But when we talk about VA health care, we must put it in the \ncontext of health care in the United States of America. Does anyone \nseriously believe the VA is the only health care institution in America \nthat has problems? It is absolutely the case that not everybody outside \nof the VA gets timely, quality, affordable health care. That is just \nnot the reality.\n  Today some 40 million Americans have no health insurance. According \nto a Harvard study of a few years ago, 45,000 Americans die each year \nbecause they do not get to the doctor when they should. That is outside \nof the VA.\n  But it is more than that. Let me read you a few headlines from the \nlast couple of weeks. I make this point not to argue the whole health \ncare debate again but to say that anyone who thinks it is only the VA \nthat has health care problems does not understand what is happening \nwith health care in America.\n  Here is a quote from a few weeks ago.\n\n       A report released Monday by a respected think tank--\n\n  That is the Commonwealth Fund.\n\n     --ranks the United States dead last in the quality of its \n     health care system when compared with ten other Western \n     industrialized nations.\n\n  Then the report further tells us that the United States has \nmaintained this dubious distinction while spending far more per capita \non health care than any other country. We are spending far more on \nhealth care than any other country.\n  Let me read you another headline published September 20, 2013 by \nFierceHealthCare. ``Hospital Medical Errors Now the Third Leading Cause \nof Death in US.''\n\n       Medical errors leading to patient death are much higher \n     than previously thought and may be as high as 400,000 deaths \n     a year, according to a new study in the Journal of Patient \n     Safety.\n\n  I mention all of this to make clear that the VA, of course, has its \nproblems. Our job is to strengthen the VA, to provide better \naccountability, to make sure that incompetent and dishonest people are \nnot working in the VA. But we also have to make sure the VA has the \ndoctors, the nurses, and the other health care providers it needs in \norder to provide the quality of care our veterans deserve.\n  The last point I want to make. I hope very much the House will agree \nwith the Senate that we are in an emergency.\n  It is absolutely imperative that we move as quickly as possible to \nget the funding we need so that all veterans enrolled in the VA health \ncare system get quality care in a timely manner.\n  I hope very much that we don't once again have a major debate about \nwhether we are going to cut food\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\nstamps or education or roads and bridges in order to fund the Veterans' \nAdministration. When this Congress voted to go to war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, it said that it was an emergency. Some of us disagreed \nwith that, and I don't want to debate the Iraq war again, but when \nCongress said it is an emergency that we go to war, well, if it is an \nemergency that we go to war, it is more of an emergency that we take \ncare of the men and women who fought in those wars. If you don't \nbelieve that is the case, don't send Americans off to war. Taking care \nof veterans is a cost of war.\n  I hope very much that we don't go back to the same old, same old of \nhaving a debate where some people say: Well, if you want to fund VA \nhealth care, you are going to have to cut education or cut Medicaid or \ncut Medicare or cut some other program. That is not the issue. This is \nan emergency. Our veterans have put their lives on the line. Now is the \ntime for us to defend them, and we have to get this legislation moving.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, I rise today to talk about three young \nboys--three young boys who are now in the hands of terrorists. This \nshould be on the front page of every paper in the United States because \nthis is an issue that is as vital to us as it is to the nation of \nIsrael.\n  On Thursday night, June 12, three Jewish teenagers--Naftali Fraenkel, \nGilad Shaar and Eyal Yifrah--were kidnapped. You can see all three of \nthese boys in the photos beside me.\n  Today, Thursday June 26, marks the 14th day of their abduction. Just \nimagine if these were your children or any child you know. Just imagine \nif it were your child who was kidnapped for 14 days and you don't know \nwhere they are or even whether they are still alive.\n  These boys--all smart, hard-working, diligent students--were taken on \ntheir way home from school. They were waiting at the bus stop. They \nwere only 5 minutes away from their school--one of the finest yeshivas \nin Israel. These boys weren't doing anything wrong. They are innocent \nschoolchildren.\n  Yet today it has been reported that Israel's Shin Bet identified two \nkey suspects in the abduction. These two individuals are members of \nHamas--a vicious terrorist organization that seeks Israel's destruction \nand has launched thousands of rockets into Israel, killing innocent \ncivilians. These rockets have also killed dozens of Americans in \nIsrael. Now they have kidnapped three school boys. Sadly, this is \nbusiness as usual for Hamas. This is the same terrorist organization \nwith which the Palestinian Authority recently joined in a so-called \n``unity'' government.\n  Israel has been tirelessly looking for these two men since the \nkidnapping. They come from families who have broader ties to Hamas. In \na telling statement to the Times of Israel, the mother of one of the \ntwo alleged terrorists claims she did not know of her son's actions, \nbut she said she would be ``proud of him and hoped he would continue to \nevade capture.'' A mother, proud of her son for kidnapping three school \nboys.\n  Hamas leader Khaled Mashal spoke about the kidnappings on Monday, \nsaying, ``I bless those who did it because it is a moral obligation to \nfree prisoners from Israeli jails.'' This is a leader of Hamas now \nparked effectively in the unity government of the Palestinian Authority \nblessing those who have kidnapped three school boys because this is the \nkind of activity that Hamas terrorists support, the kidnapping of \ninnocent schoolchildren.\n  Since the kidnapping, there have been no pictures or videos made \navailable of the kidnapped boys. Their families are in the dark without \nany knowledge of where their boys are or what conditions they are being \nheld in.\n  Rachel Fraenkel, the mother of Naftali Fraenkel, spoke before the \nUnited Nations Human Rights Council on June 24. Rachel said:\n\n       My son texted me--said he's on his way home--and then he's \n     gone. Every mother's nightmare is waiting and waiting \n     endlessly for her child to come home.\n\n  She then pleaded for more action to be taken to find the boys, \nconcluding:\n\n       We just want them back in our homes, in their beds. We just \n     want to hug them . . .\n\n  All of us should stand with Rachel as she stands with her son who has \nbeen kidnapped.\n  I also want to tell the world about these three boys.\n  Rachel's son Naftali is 16 years old. His grandparents have lived in \nBrooklyn, and Brooklyn has been a second home to him. He is the oldest \nof seven children. He likes playing the guitar, basketball, and Ping-\nPong. Indeed, there is even a video of him on YouTube playing Ping-\nPong. I have to say he is pretty good. He is a talented and gifted \nstudent who is on track to take the biology matriculation exams. His \nteachers say Naftali is brilliant, one of the best they have ever had, \nand his mother said his personality is a delightful combination of both \nserious and fun.\n  Gilad Shaar, who was with Naftali that day--also coming home from \nschool--was likewise abducted. Like Naftali, Gilad is 16 years old. \n``Gil'' means happiness and ``ad'' means forever. His name literally \nmeans ``happiness forever,'' and he is a source of joy to those who \nmeet him.\n  His aunt Leehy Shaar, whom I had the privilege of meeting and \nvisiting earlier this week, said, ``He has a smile that brings light to \nthe world''--quite fitting for a boy named ``happiness forever.'' She \nsaid, ``We want him home where he belongs, with his family, who so \ndearly loves him.''\n\n  Gilad has five sisters, and he is described by them as a caring and \nloving brother. He is the family's only son, and he has family in Los \nAngeles and in New York. Gilad is witty. He loves to read, watch \nmovies, and recently he finished a scuba diving course, but he is also \na talented cook. He enjoys baking his sisters cakes and pastries.\n  We don't know where Gilad is right now.\n  Then there is Eyal Yifrah, the third boy kidnapped that day. He is 19 \nyears old and is the oldest of six children. He is a role model for \ntheir family, and he is loved by friends who say they would like to \nhave him as a brother. He loves sports. He should be cheering the World \nCup games today--like so many other teenagers--with his friends. A \ngregarious fellow, he likes to cook, travel, play guitar, and sing. \nIndeed, you can find videos of him on YouTube singing a song that he \nhimself wrote. Eyal should be home singing again.\n  There can be no more illusions that Hamas has any role in any future \ngovernment formed by the Palestinian Authority. They must not receive \nany further recognition or legitimization. Hamas is a violent terrorist \norganization ready and eager to brutalize the most innocent. Hamas is a \nterrorist organization that kidnapped three innocent school boys.\n  Hamas, give those boys back.\n  Hamas, give those boys back now.\n  The full weight of the world should bear down on Hamas to give them \nback safely and immediately. If they do not, we should use all \navailable means to stand unequivocally with Israel for however long it \ntakes to find these boys and to bring them home. These are teenagers \nwho were targeted for who they are, who have done no wrong, who have \ndone nothing that comes near to deserving what happened to them that \nday while waiting at the bus stop to go home from school.\n  It is easy for us to become desensitized to violence, desensitized to \nterrorism. It is easy for us to forget that these are three teenage \nboys whose families desperately want their boys back. I ask that all of \nus lift them up in prayer. I pray for their safe return. I pray they \nwill soon be home with the families who so dearly love them and miss \nthem, and I pray that God will cover them with a shield of heavenly \nprotection. I pray that America will stand strong, will shine a light \nand do everything possible to apprehend the terrorists and bring these \nboys home.\n  Thank you, and God bless you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in \nmorning business, and I appreciate the wonderful courtesy of my friend \nSenator Carl Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, next week I look forward to traveling to \nIndia, where I look forward to meeting with Prime Minister Modi, his \nnational security team, and other Indian leaders. I am excited to be \nreturning to New Delhi, and I am so hopeful about what the Prime \nMinister's election could mean for the revitalization of India's \neconomy, its rising power, and for the renewal of the U.S.-India \nstrategic partnership.\n  National elections in India are always a remarkable affair. Over \nseveral weeks hundreds of millions of people peacefully elect their \nleaders--the largest exercise of democracy on the planet. But even by \nIndian standards, the recent election that brought to power Prime \nMinister Modi and his party, the BJP, was a landmark event. It was the \nfirst time in 30 years that one Indian political party won enough seats \nto govern without forming a coalition with another party. This gives \nthe Prime Minister a historic mandate for change, which Indians clearly \ncrave.\n  I want Prime Minister Modi to succeed because I want India to \nsucceed. It is no secret that the past few years have been challenging \nones for India--political gridlock, a flagging economy, financial \ndifficulties, and more. It is not my place or that of any other \nAmerican to tell India how to realize its full potential. That is for \nthe Indians to decide. Our concern is simply that India does realize \nits full potential, for the United States has a stake in India's \nsuccess. Indeed, a strong, confident, and future-oriented India is \nindispensable for a vibrant U.S.-India strategic partnership.\n  It is also no secret that India and the United States have not been \nreaching our full potential as strategic partners over the past few \nyears, and there is plenty of blame to be shared on both sides for \nthat. Too often recently we have slipped back into a transactional \nrelationship, one defined more by competitive concession seeking than \nby achieving shared strategic goals.\n  We need to lift our sights again. To help us do so, I think we need \nto remind ourselves why the United States and India embarked on this \npartnership in the first place. It was never simply about the \npersonalities involved, although the personal commitment of leaders in \nboth countries has been indispensable at every turn. No, the real \nreason India and the United States have resolved to develop the \nstrategic partnership is because each country has determined \nindependently that doing so is in its national interests.\n  It is because we have been guided by our national interests that the \nprogress of our partnership has consistently enjoyed bipartisan support \nin the United States and in India.\n  This endeavor began with closer cooperation between a Democratic \nadministration in Washington and a BJP-led government in New Delhi. It \ndeepened dramatically during the last decade under a Republican and a \nCongress-led government. It reached historic heights with the \nconclusion of our civil nuclear agreement--thanks to the bold \nleadership of President Bush and Prime Minister Singh. This foundation \nof shared national interests has sustained our partnership under \nPresident Obama, and it is the common ground on which we can build for \nthe future as a new prime minister takes office in New Delhi.\n  When it comes to the national interests of the United States, the \nlogic of a strategic partnership with India is powerful. India will \nsoon become the world's most populous nation. It has a young, \nincreasingly skilled workforce that can lead India to become one of the \nworld's largest economies. It is a nuclear power and possesses the \nworld's second largest military, which is becoming even more capable \nand technologically sophisticated. It shares strategic interests with \nus on issues as diverse and vital as defeating terrorism and extremism, \nstrengthening a rules-based international order in Asia, securing \nglobal energy supplies, and sustaining global economic growth.\n  India and the United States not only share common interests, we also \nshare common values, the values of human rights, individual liberty, \nand democratic limits on state power, but also the values of our \nsocieties--creativity and critical thinking, risk-taking and \nentrepreneurialism and social mobility--values that continue to deepen \nthe interdependence of our peoples across every field of human \nendeavor. It is because of these shared values we are confident that \nIndia's continued rise as a democratic great power--whether tomorrow or \n25 years from now--will be peaceful and thus can advance critical U.S. \nnational interests. That is why, contrary to the old dictates of \nrealpolitik, we seek not to limit India's rise but to bolster and \ncatalyze it--economically, geopolitically, and, yes, militarily.\n  It is my hope that Prime Minister Modi and his government will \nrecognize how a deeper strategic partnership with the United States \nserves India's national interests, especially in light of current \neconomic and geopolitical challenges.\n  For example, a top priority for India is the modernization of its \narmed forces. This is an area where U.S. defense capabilities, \ntechnologies, and cooperation--especially between our defense \nindustries--can benefit India enormously. Similarly, greater bilateral \ntrade and investment can be a key driver of economic growth in India, \nwhich seems to be what Indian citizens want most from their new \ngovernment. Likewise, as India seeks to further its ``Look East'' \npolicy and deepen its relationships with major like-minded powers in \nAsia--especially Japan, but also Australia, the Philippines, the \nRepublic of Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam. Those countries are often \nU.S. allies and partners as well, and our collective ability to work in \nconcert can only magnify India's influence and advance its interests.\n  Put simply, I see three strategic interests that India and the United \nStates clearly share, and these should be the priorities of a \nreinvigorated partnership:\n  First, to shape the development of South Asia as a region of \nsovereign democratic states that contribute to one another's security \nand prosperity; second, to create a preponderance of power in the Asia-\nPacific region that favors free societies, free markets, free trade, \nand free comments; and, finally, to strengthen a liberal international \norder and an open global economy that safeguards human dignity and \nfosters peaceful development.\n  As we seek to take our strategic partnership with India to the next \nlevel, it is important for U.S. leaders to reach out personally to \nPrime Minister Modi, especially in light of recent history. That is \nlargely why I am traveling to India next week, and that is why I am \npleased President Obama invited the Prime Minister to visit Washington. \nI wish he had extended that invitation sooner, but it is positive \nnonetheless. When the Prime Minister comes to Washington, I urge our \ncongressional leaders to invite him to address a joint session of \nCongress. I can imagine no more compelling scene than the elected \nleader of the world's largest democracy addressing the elected \nrepresentatives of the world's oldest democracy.\n  Yet we must be clear-eyed about those issues that could weaken our \nstrategic partnership. One is Afghanistan. Before it was a safe haven \nfor the terrorists who attacked America on September 11, 2001, \nAfghanistan was a base of terrorists that targeted India. Our Indian \nfriends remember this well, even if we do not. For this reason I am \ndeeply concerned about the consequences of the President's plan to pull \nall of our troops out of Afghanistan by 2016, not only for U.S. \nnational security but also for the national security of our friends in \nIndia.\n  If Afghanistan goes the way of Iraq in the absence of U.S. forces, it \nwould leave India with a clear and present danger on its periphery. It \nwould constrain India's rise and its ability to devote resources and \nattention to shared foreign policy challenges elsewhere in Asia and \nbeyond. It could push India toward deeper cooperation with Russia and \nIran in order to manage the threats posed by a deteriorating \nAfghanistan. And it would erode India's perception of the credibility \nand capability of U.S. power and America's reliability as a strategic \npartner.\n  The bottom line here is clear: India and the United States have a \nshared interest in working together to end the scourge of extremism and \nterrorism that threatens stability, freedom, and prosperity across \nSouth Asia and beyond. The President's current plan to\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\ndisengage from Afghanistan is a step backward from this goal, and thus \ndoes not serve the U.S.-India strategic partnership.\n  For all of these reasons and more, I hope the President will be open \nto reevaluating and revising his withdrawal plan in light of conditions \non the ground.\n  Another hurdle on which our partnership could stumble is our resolve \nto see it through amid domestic political concerns and short-term \npriorities that threaten to push our nations apart. For most of the \nlast century, the logic of a U.S.-India partnership was compelling, but \nits achievements eluded us. We have finally begun to explore the real \npotential of this partnership over the past two decades, but we have \nbarely scratched the surface, and the gains we have made remain fragile \nand reversible, as our largely stalled progress over the past few years \ncan attest.\n\n  If India and the United States are to build a truly strategic \npartnership, we must each commit to it and defend it in equal measure. \nWe must each build the public support needed to sustain our strategic \npriorities, and we must resist the domestic forces in each of our \ncountries that would turn our strategic relationship into a \ntransactional one--one defined not by the shared strategic goals we \nachieved together but by what parochial concessions we extract from one \nanother. If we fail in these challenges, we will fall far short of our \npotential, as we have before.\n  It is this simple: If the 21st century is defined more by peace than \nwar, more by prosperity than misery, and more by freedom than tyranny, \nI believe future historians will look back and point to the fact that a \nstrategic partnership was consummated between the world's two \npreeminent democratic powers: India and the United States. If we keep \nthis vision of our relationship always uppermost in our minds, there is \nno dispute we cannot resolve, no investment in each other's success we \ncannot make, and nothing we cannot accomplish together.\n  I thank my beloved friend from Michigan for allowing me to speak, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Arizona for \nnot only his remarks but also the thoughtfulness of his remarks on the \nU.S.-India relationship. I listened to them carefully and am glad to \njoin in and look forward to his report. We have had a historic \nrelationship with India as the two preeminent democracies, and we have \na great opportunity to build on this relationship. I know my friend \nfrom Arizona has contributed vitally to that effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4135-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Recent events in Iraq have created great concern. The \nterritorial gains by the ISIL, a violent extremist group, are not just \na threat to Iraq's security but a security challenge to the entire \nregion, and indeed to the United States. By its words and deeds, ISIL \nhas made clear that it is deeply hostile to American interests and to \nuniversal values of freedom and human rights. That hostility can easily \ntranslate into plans and threats against us.\n  Faced by these developments, President Obama's decision to send a \nsmall number of U.S. military advisers is prudent. They will help \nassess the situation on the ground, they will support Iraqi efforts to \ndefeat the Islamic militants Iraq faces, and help the Iraqis make best \nuse of the intelligence support we are providing.\n  The President is right to say that U.S. troops will not return to \nground combat in Iraq. The President is also right to say it is not our \nplace to choose Iraq's leaders, because doing so is only likely to feed \ndistrust and suspicion, and there is already too much of that in Iraq \nand in the Middle East.\n  What we can do is promote moves toward the political unity that is so \nessential for Iraq if it is going to weather the crisis and make \nprogress toward a stable, democratic society. The problem in Iraq has \nnot been a lack of direct U.S. military involvement but, rather, a lack \nof inclusiveness on the part of Iraqi leaders. That is why I believe we \nshould not consider any direct action on our part, such as air strikes, \nunless three very specific conditions have been met:\n  First, that our military leaders tell us we have effective options \nthat can help change the momentum on the ground in Iraq. In other \nwords, only if our military leaders believe we can identify high-value \ntargets--that striking them could have a measurable impact on the \nability of the Iraqi security forces to stop and reverse the advances \nof the ISIL on the ground, and that we can strike them with minimal \nrisk of civilian casualties and without dragging us further into the \nconflict.\n  Second, any additional military action on our part should come only \nwith the clear public support of our friends and allies in the region--\nparticularly moderate Arab leaders of neighboring countries. The United \nStates has engaged in a comprehensive diplomatic effort to coordinate \nour response with Iraq's neighbors. If our strategy is to have the \neffect we want, it is essential that we have broad support in the \nregion.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we should not act unless \nleaders of all elements of Iraqi society--Shia, Sunni, Kurds, and \nreligious minorities--join together in a formal request for more direct \nsupport.\n  There is an obvious need for Iraqi leaders to form an inclusive unity \ngovernment for their country's long-term success. But that process is \nlikely to take some time, weeks or even months. But a unified formal \nstatement requesting our further military assistance would be an \nimportant signal that Iraq's leaders understand the need to come \ntogether.\n  It could not only be a sign that additional action on our part would \nbe effective but also could be an important step toward creation of a \nnational unity government.\n  So far, the signs that Iraqi leaders are prepared to take the steps \nthey need to take are mixed at best. Prime Minister Maliki, who has too \noften governed in a sectarian and authoritarian manner, delivered a \nspeech recently in which he said national unity is essential to \nconfront ISIL--which is true--but then he signaled little willingness \nto reach out to other groups. A number of prominent Shia leaders \nportrayed the conflict in starkly sectarian terms, and Shia militias, \nincluding those under the control of Moktada al-Sadr, have marched \nthrough the streets of Baghdad. There is little doubt also that Iran is \npursuing its own sectarian agenda in the region. Some Iraqi Sunni \nleaders too have made statements that promote sectarian interests over \nthe common good, and there are also fears that the Kurdish minority may \nexploit the situation. But on the other hand there have also been some \nsigns that the Iraqi leaders recognize the need to confront the ISIL \nthreat not as Sunnis or Shia or Kurds but together as Iraqis.\n\n  Iraq's most influential Shia clerk, Ali Sistani, has called on all \nIraqis ``to exercise the highest degree of restraint and work on \nstrengthening the bonds of love between each other, and to avoid any \nkind of sectarian behavior that may affect the unity of the Iraqi \nnation,'' spreading the message that ``this army [the Iraqi Army] does \nnot belong to the Shia. It belongs to all of Iraq. It is for the Shia, \nthe Sunni, the Kurds and the Christians.'' That is the message from Ali \nSistani--a very powerful message and a unifying message in contrast to \nthe messages that should come, for instance, from Mr. Sadr.\n  The United States has national security interests in Iraq, but \nfurther military involvement there will not serve those interests \nunless Iraq begins to move toward the inclusiveness and unity that is \nnecessary if our involvement is to have a positive impact. Put another \nway, we cannot save Iraqis from themselves. Only if Iraq's leaders \nbegin to unify their nation can help from us really matter.\n  The ISIL is a vicious enemy. It is also the common enemy of all \nIraqis--of all Iraqis and of Iraq's neighbors. If this vicious common \nenemy cannot unite Iraqis in a common cause, than our assistance, \nincluding airstrikes, won't matter. Only a unified Iraq governed by \nelected leaders who seek to rule in the interest of all their people \ncan stand up to this threat.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to commend the holding of the \nSupreme Court's decision this morning in NLRB vs. Noel Canning. The \nCourt's decision is a critical victory for the principle that we are a \nnation of laws, not of men. It is a vindication of the fundamental \nnotion that the Constitution binds us all, including even the \nPresident, and it is a triumph for the rightful prerogatives of this \ninstitution, the U.S. Senate, the authority of which has been under \nsiege throughout the Obama years.\n  One of the most important powers endowed in this body by the \nConstitution is the requirement that nominations of principal officers \nreceive the advice and consent of the Senate. The confirmation process \nprovides Members of the Senate with a wide range of tools--up to and \nincluding outright refusal to confirm a nominee--in order to influence \nthe proper execution of the laws we pass. When aggregated, these tools \namount to a critical check on the workings of the executive branch.\n  The Senate's advice and consent rule did not rise from accident--far \nfrom it. As the Supreme Court has explained, quoting the famed \nhistorian Gordon Wood, ``The manipulation of official appointments had \nlong been one of the American revolutionary generation's greatest \ngrievances against executive power, because the power of appointment to \noffices was deemed the most insidious and powerful weapon of 18th \ncentury despotism.''\n  The Founders' worry about the dangers of the Executive appointment \npower should ring true today given many of the Obama administration's \nactions, including a radical set of National Labor Relations Board \nnominees who promised to tip the balance of the Board toward an extreme \nand divisive agenda, hurting both employers and employees, and a \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau Director nominee poised to \nexercise unprecedented and unchecked power thanks to the dangerous \nprovisions of Dodd-Frank--no checks on his removal, no congressional \ncontrol over his budget, and no effective judicial review. These are \nexactly the sorts of circumstances that motivated the Founders' \nconcerns about an unchecked appointment power in the Executive. They \nare the very reasons the Presidential nominees must obtain the Senate's \nconsent before taking office.\n  The only exception to this body's power to decline its consent to a \nnomination is the President's power ``to fill up all Vacancies that may \nhappen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which \nshall expire at the End of their next Session.'' But the President's \npower to make recess appointments is wholly contingent on what the \nConstitution terms ``the Recess of the Senate'' actually occurring, and \nthe power to decide when that happens rests squarely with the \nlegislative branch.\n  This is the obvious consequence of the Senate's constitutional \npower--conferred in article I, section 5--to determine the rules of its \nproceedings. And it is well supported by longstanding practice and \nprecedent, acknowledged by the executive branch going as far back as \n1790. Consider what would happen if the President could unilaterally \ndetermine when the recess of the Senate occurs. With no check on the \nPresident's discretion to declare the Senate in recess, he could employ \nthe recess appointment power whenever the Senate refused to give \nimmediate and unencumbered consent to his or her nominees. The advice-\nand-consent process would become a dead letter. The exception would \nswallow the rule, and the Senate would be deprived of a central tool \nour Nation's Founders specifically conferred to prevent Executive \nmischief.\n  The Founders realized the severity of this threat. They had fought \nroyal abuses of the appointment power, asserting in the Declaration of \nIndependence how the King's government had ``erected a multitude of new \noffices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and \neat out their substance.'' As Hamilton explained in Federalist 69, \n``They deliberately chose not to give the President the King's often-\nabused power to discontinue a session of the legislature.''\n  So concerned were the Framers with the legislature's power to control \nits own sittings that the Constitution gave each House the power to \nprevent the other from adjourning for more than 3 days. In essence, the \nSenate and the House of Representatives both have the power to prevent \nthe recess of the Senate and thereby avoid the activation of the \nPresident's recess appointment power.\n  So when the Senate was confronted by the prospect of an out-of-\ncontrol National Labor Relations Board and an unchecked Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau led by President Obama's appointees, we \nwere facing threats that our Founders had themselves faced and for \nwhich they had specifically provided us with the tools to resist. When \nwe refused to act as quickly as the administration wanted and merely \nrubberstamp these nominees, we acted exactly as the Constitution's \nFramers had intended. And the House of Representatives wisely refused \nto consent to a recess of the annual session of the Senate, thereby \nrefusing to grant the President authority to make lawful recess \nappointments.\n\n  I don't relish rejecting nominees--quite the contrary. Over the past \n38 years, I have voted for the vast majority of nominees from each of \nthe six Presidents under whom I have served and with whom I have served \nalongside, including President Obama. But scrutinizing the President's \nnominees and occasionally withholding consent when circumstances \nwarrant represents Congress fulfilling, not abdicating, its \nconstitutional responsibilities.\n  So when faced with our legitimate and lawful use of the powers \nendowed in the legislative branch by the Constitution, what did the \nObama administration do? Did it seek to accommodate our concerns about \nthe unconstitutional structure and unprecedented powers of the CFPB? \nDid the President seek to help develop a compromise package of the NLRB \nnominees, as Ted Kennedy and I always did? Sadly, no. Instead, \nPresident Obama simply proclaimed that he ``wouldn't take no for an \nanswer'' despite what the Constitution may say. He chose instead to \nuse--or rather abuse--the recess appointment power to install these \nfour nominees, including two who had been nominated only 2 weeks \nbefore--hardly long enough for the Senate to vet them thoroughly. But, \nof course, we were not in ``the Recess of the Senate'' that the \nConstitution requires to activate the recess appointment power. Even \nthe Solicitor General admitted that a 3-day adjournment was too short \nto allow the President to bypass the Senate lawfully.\n  Instead, President Obama audaciously claimed the power to decide for \nhimself when the Senate was in recess and determined that in his \npersonal opinion, our so-called pro forma sessions during this period \ndid not really count as sessions of the Senate, at least for the \npurposes of the Constitution's requirements.\n  But during these sessions the Senate was fully capable of engaging in \nits business. Indeed, during a similar session the previous fall, the \nSenate twice passed legislation that President Obama himself signed. We \nhave also used these sessions to appoint conferees, to read calendar \nbills, and to engage in other such activity characteristic of the \nSenate operating in session. While the Senate planned to conduct no \nsubsequent business under a unanimous consent agreement, even the Obama \nadministration admitted\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\nthat there was a possibility that we might decide otherwise. Whether \nthe Senate chooses to conduct business has no relevance here. Instead, \nit is the ability of the Senate to conduct business if it so chooses \nthat matters.\n  Faced with this reality, the Obama administration even argued that \nthe Senate, by refusing to adjourn for more than 3 days, could not deny \nthe President his recess appointment power--as if he was owed the \nopportunity to use this power.\n  This argument turns basic structure of Presidential appointments on \nits head, as if our advice-and-consent role were merely an \ninconvenience to be avoided rather than the organizing principle of how \nthe entire constitutional process is designed to work. The Constitution \ndoes not create in the President an endlessly flexible power to bypass \nCongress when he disagrees with us. In fact, it does exactly the \nopposite: It vests in Congress both the power and the responsibility to \nresist a President's ill-advised policies and Executive overreach.\n  The actions and arguments advanced by the Obama administration \nrepresent a direct assault on the Constitution's division of powers \nbetween the different branches. This brazen power grab takes President \nObama's already audacious overreach to a new level.\n  I applaud the Supreme Court's willingness to fulfill its \nconstitutional obligations and check this abuse of power by the White \nHouse. While I agree most with the reasoning of Justice Scalia's \nconcurrence, which respects the fixed and discernible meaning of the \nConstitution's text and its controlling power, the unanimous nature of \nthis decision reflects just how egregious the President's action was.\n  But those of us who care about checking the Obama administration's \noverreach cannot place our faith in the courts alone, although they \nmust play an important role. Too often this administration has been \ncrafty in implementing its breaches of the law to avoid judicial \nreview, frequently structuring its overreach to prevent any plaintiff \nfrom having any legal standing to sue in court. This White House has \neven used its role in the legislative process to advance provisions \nthat eliminate the potential for judicial review, as it did in Dodd-\nFrank. And when the courts have found legitimate occasion to scrutinize \nPresident Obama's overreach, the administration has often fought to \nkeep litigants out of court, as in the Fast and Furious litigation.\n  Perhaps most disturbing is what happened with the DC Circuit, the \nsecond most important court in the land that oversees our massive \nregulatory state, the court that originally held the President's \nappointments unconstitutional. When the DC Circuit tried to hold the \nObama administration accountable to the law and the Constitution, \nPresident Obama and his allies sought--in their own words--to ``switch \nthe majority'' on the court and to ``fill up the D.C. Circuit one way \nor another.''\n  In the rush to eliminate any possible judicial obstacle to \naccountability by packing the DC Circuit, the Obama administration ran \nroughshod over the rules and traditions of this body by blowing up the \nfilibuster. Whether through unilaterally changing the Senate rules or \nabusing the recess appointment power, the President and his allies have \ndemonstrated a willingness to work untold and permanent damage to the \ninstitutions of this great body and to our constitutional system \nitself.\n  With such a powerful and aggressive President, no single institution \ncan restore the constitutional checks on President Obama's often \nlawless exercise of power. Restoring constitutional government will \nrequire great effort by all of us: The courts, the Congress, and most \nimportantly the voting public. That is why it is essential for my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand and defend the \ninstitutional prerogatives of the Senate. That is every Senator's sworn \nduty under the Constitution.\n  Many of my colleagues--even those with whom I rarely agree--have the \npotential to be great Senators, worthy stewards of this institution, \nzealous guardians of its prerogatives and true defenders of its role in \nour constitutional system of government.\n  Sadly, whether blinded by partisan loyalty to the President or too \ninexperienced to understand the Senate from any other perspective than \nhaving a like-minded Senate majority and President, my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have allowed--even facilitated--this \nadministration's attempts to break down the constitutional checks on \nExecutive power. Bob Byrd must be rolling over in his grave. He would \nnever allow the Senate's power to be as diluted and dissipated as it \nhas been during this Presidency. He would have stood up to them. He \nwould have taken the Senate's prerogatives and made them very clear to \nthis President and anybody else who tried to invade the Senate's \nprerogatives--and I might add constitutional prerogatives at that.\n  We must all realize what is at stake. This is not some petty turf \nwar. As Madison warned in Federalist 47, ``The accumulation of all \npowers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, \nwhether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, \nor elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.''\n  To disregard this central principle of constitutional government is \nto abolish the barriers protecting us from arbitrary government action \nand to undermine the rule of law.\n  We in the Congress should make no apology for protecting the legal \nprerogatives of the body in which we serve, for as Madison counseled in \nFederalist 51: ``[t]he great security against a gradual concentration \nof the several powers in the same department consists of giving to \nthose who administer each department the necessary constitutional means \nand personal motives to resist encroachments of the others.''\n  If this body--and constitutional government generally--are to \nmaintain a meaningful role in preserving liberty, we must all realize \nthe importance of connecting the President's unlawful and illegitimate \nattempts to assert power. We must use the rightful and legitimate \nconstitutional authorities that the Founders gave us to stand and fight \nback.\n  This is important. This is not just a battle between the two sides. \nThis is not just an itty-bitty, little problem. This is one that has \nthwarted the intentions of the Founders to have three separated powers, \neach with its own duties and responsibilities, not infringed by the \nother powers that disregard the duties and responsibilities of the \nlegislative branch.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

And for almost my entire time as majority leader here \nin this body, one of the people I have depended on is Meredith Mellody. \nIsn't that a great name, Meredith Mellody. She has been an important \npart of the Democratic floor staff for that entire time.\n  For 8 years she has been here in the Senate, working late hours on \nthe floor, sending me, among other things, the wrapup--she did that for \na while--what happened during the day. It is tedious, but it is \nimportant, and we did it every day. She has been in the cloakroom \nmaking sure the wheels of this body continue turning. She comes from a \npolitical family. She comes, as I recall, from Scranton.\n  Anyway, I am grateful for her hard work and her dedication over the \nyears. We all depend on her and have depended on her, and we are very \nthankful for her service.\n  She is leaving the Senate to pursue opportunities in the private \nsector, and that is important. But the main reason she is leaving--that \nI don't question, anyway, recognizing this is very important to her, \nand it is probably one of the most important things she has ever done--\nif not the most important--she is going to get married. I have already \ncongratulated her.\n  But it is really sad to see these people who have become a part of \nour family go. She is going to be successful in\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\nher future endeavors in the private sector.\n  I certainly wish you, Meredith, the best in the future. You are a \nwonderful person. You are kind, thoughtful, and considerate always. You \nare never rude to anyone. And the pressure that is on each of you to do \nthis yesterday, do it right now, and do it sooner than you are capable \nof doing it--you have always been polite and never rude to anyone.\n  So I am grateful to you for your service to the Senate and, in doing \nthat, your service to the country.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, one year ago tomorrow, the Senate came \ntogether to pass historic legislation to reform our broken immigration \nsystem. We did so with a strong bipartisan vote and after weeks of \nexhaustive work. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and \nImmigration Modernization Act would unite families, spur the economy, \nand help protect our borders. Above all else, this historic legislation \nwould create an immigration system that is worthy of our American \nvalues.\n  Today, our system does not reflect the values we hold as a nation. It \nis devastating that after 1 year, the House has yet to pass desperately \nneeded immigration reform. The cost of inaction is all around us, from \nthe millions of workers who are forced to live in the shadows without \nfully contributing to our economy, to the foreign-born students who are \ntaking their skills overseas when they graduate instead of investing \ntheir talents here, to the uncertainty that continues to plague our \nagricultural and dairy industries because of unstable work visa \nprograms. Families are being torn apart by deportations, and visa \napplicants around the world find themselves stuck in limbo because of \nour lengthy visa backlogs. However, nowhere is the cost of inaction \nmore evident than in the faces of the young children sleeping on cold \nfloors in detention centers on our border.\n  The humanitarian crisis at the border is growing, and we have a moral \nduty to address it. I was glad this body came together last year to \nsupport my bipartisan Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization \nAct, which included important new provisions to improve the treatment \nof unaccompanied children at our border. This vital legislation, signed \ninto law as part of the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act of 2013 provides additional advocates and support \nfor the unaccompanied youngsters who come to our border often fleeing \nviolence and abuse in their country of origin. I was proud when the \nRepublican-controlled House voted overwhelmingly to support these \nimportant protections for unaccompanied minors. But they address just \none piece of a rapidly growing problem. To truly address the crisis we \nare seeing today, the Republican House must act to pass bipartisan and \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  Those Republican critics who claim we must first secure our border \nbefore the House will vote on immigration reform should actually read \nthe bipartisan Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration \nModernization Act that the Senate passed last year. The bill would \ndouble the number of Border Patrol agents and authorize the completion \nof a 700-mile wall at the southern border. This language was a \nRepublican demand during Senate consideration of the legislation. While \nI did not agree with it, I voted to authorize this so-called border \nsurge because I supported the broader reform that would do so much for \nthe families and DREAMers who contribute to the fabric of this Nation. \nBorder security measures take up an entire title of the legislation, \nallocating billions of dollars to border security in addition to the \nconsiderable expenditures already authorized by existing law. Those \nmeasures are reinforced by ``triggers'' that must be satisfied before \nundocumented individuals may apply for permanent residence under the \nbill. These issues were hard-fought in the Senate, and the result was \nlegislation that dramatically reshaped the landscape for border \nenforcement. So I say again, those who claim we must secure our border \nbefore passing immigration reform should look at the bill this Senate \npassed with broad bipartisan support a year ago.\n  Americans have seen too much inaction in Washington. The issue before \nus is too important to simply put off for another time. Just as House \nRepublican leaders set aside partisanship to do what is right by \npassing the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Act, they should again \nrecognize that a majority of the Chamber supports passing comprehensive \nimmigration reform. Immigration reform should not be held back due to \npartisan caucus rules that say only legislation supported by the \nmajority of Republicans can be considered. All Members, Democrats and \nRepublicans, should have the courage to vote. House Republican leaders \ncast aside partisanship and showed their courage last year by bringing \nthe Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Act to the floor. They should do \nso again today.\n  Legislating is about making tough choices. It is not about standing \non the sidelines and complaining that this solution is not perfect. It \nis about supporting efforts that move this country forward. The \nbipartisan legislation we passed had the support of businesses, \ncommunity and faith leaders. It received support from groups ranging \nfrom the chamber of commerce and Americans for Tax Reform to law \nenforcement, university presidents, civil rights groups, and community \nadvocates. Voices from across the Nation and the political spectrum \ncame together in support of enacting long-overdue reforms.\n  I have been privileged to serve in this great body for nearly four \ndecades because of the trust of the people of Vermont. In my time here, \nI have rarely seen such commitment to an issue as I did last year to \ncomprehensive immigration reform. What was initially a proposal from \nthe so-called Gang of 8 went through an extensive committee and floor \nprocess to allow every Senator to offer their input. The result was an \nhistoric bill supported by 68 Senators from both sides of the aisle. I \ncongratulate those Senators for their hard work to pass this historic \nlegislation. They share my belief that the status quo is not an option. \nPresident Obama, who has called the crisis at the border an ``urgent \nhumanitarian situation,'' knows that maintaining the system we have in \nplace today is not an option. We need a long-term plan to address the \nmany problems in our immigration system and to ensure that in the \nfuture we have the tools to address crises like the one we are seeing \nnow. That solution lies in passing the Senate immigration bill.\n  There is still time this year to accomplish meaningful and historic \nreform. I urge Republican leaders in the House not to waste another day \nand to bring up the bipartisan Border Security, Economic Opportunity, \nand Immigration Modernization Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4138-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4138-S4139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ECUADORAN AMAZON OIL DRILLING\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I wish to call attention to a recent \ndecision by the Ecuadoran Government to issue a permit for oil drilling \nin the Yasuni reserve in the Amazon region. This should raise alarm \nbells in the international community for a number of reasons.\n  It was not long ago that President Correa was supporting a lawsuit \nagainst Chevron, citing contamination that resulted from oil \nexploration by Texaco, the previous owner of the\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\nwells, in the Amazon region of Ecuador. That case, while fraught with \nallegations of corruption and ethical violations, shone a spotlight on \nthe undeniable environmental damage, water contamination, and health \nproblems associated with those oil wells, as well as on the rich \nbiodiversity and indigenous populations in that region.\n  But the Correa administration has now backstepped, deciding to allow \nthe state-run oil company Petroamazonas to begin exploratory drilling. \nGiven the history, one can only be concerned about the threat this \nposes to one of the most biologically diverse regions in the world and \nthe people who live there.\n  I am also disappointed by the circumstances leading up to the \ndecision to begin oil production. Having failed in its far-fetched \nattempt to elicit contributions from the international community in \nexchange for halting plans to drill in the reserve, the Correa \nadministration is moving ahead with this ill-conceived project. In \nother words, if someone else won't pay to prevent the Ecuadoran \nGovernment from potentially despoiling their own forests, they will \ndrill there themselves despite the grave problems that occurred in the \npast.\n  Nobody questions Ecuador's need for energy. Nobody doubts Ecuador's \nright to drill for oil. But we all have a responsibility to protect \nareas especially rich in biodiversity for future generations. We also \nhave a responsibility to respect vulnerable indigenous cultures. While \nno country, including the United States, can claim perfection in \nenvironmental stewardship, we need to collectively learn from our \nmistakes and avoid repeating them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4139-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4139-S4140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to mark the 5-year anniversary of \nthe Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. This legislation \nwas a landmark in the decades-long fight against the No. 1 cause of \npreventable death in the United States--tobacco use.\n  The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act passed in \n2009--15 years after Dr. Kessler, the FDA Commissioner, began trying to \nregulate tobacco and 45 years after the Surgeon General's landmark \nreport on tobacco use and lung cancer. For the first time in history, \nthis law gave the FDA the authority to regulate the manufacturing, \nmarketing, and sale of tobacco products.\n  One express aim of the law was to reduce rates of tobacco use among \nchildren. The law achieved this by restricting sales to minors, banning \nflavored cigarettes, banning tobacco-brand sponsorships of sport and \nentertainment events, banning free samples, restricting advertisements \nto children, and more.\n  The results speak for themselves. Just this month, the CDC reported \nthat cigarette smoking among U.S. high school students has dropped to \nthe lowest level in 22 years. According to the National Youth Risk \nBehavior Survey, the percentage of students who reported smoking a \ncigarette in the last 30 days fell from 27.5 percent in 1991 to 15.7 \npercent in 2013. In Illinois, the percentage of students who are \ncurrent smokers dropped by more than half between 1993 and 2013.\n  The FDA's implementation of this law is incomplete, and it needs to \nact now to reverse worrying trends. The CDC reports that e-cigarette \nuse among middle and high school students more than doubled in 1 year, \nfrom 2011 to 2012. The same study found that one in five middle school \nstudents who reported using e-cigarettes had never tried conventional \ncigarettes. E-cigarettes could be a gateway to nicotine addiction and \nsmoking. A new study released in the JAMA Pediatrics goes even further. \nThis study found that middle and high school students who used e-\ncigarettes were more likely to smoke traditional cigarettes and less \nlikely to quit smoking. If current smoking trends continue, 5.6 million \nAmerican kids will die prematurely from a smoking-related illness.\n  I commend FDA for its most recent efforts to bring e-cigarettes, \ncigars, pipes, and other forms of tobacco under its authority. However, \nFDA's proposed regulations remain dangerously silent on one of the most \npressing questions of all--the marketing of these addictive products to \nchildren.\n  In April, ten of my congressional colleagues and I released a report \ndocumenting how leading e-cigarette manufacturers are marketing e-\ncigarettes to young people. The industry is deploying the same \nadvertising techniques it used to hook previous generations of \ncigarette smokers. Many of these companies hired glamorous celebrities \nto push their brands through TV and radio ads, and sponsored events \nwith heavy social media promotion. For example, NJOY advertised its \nproducts during the Super Bowl, the Academy Awards, and on ESPN--all \nprograms with substantial children and teen viewership. In just 2 \nyears, from 2012 to 2013, 6 of the surveyed companies sponsored or \nprovided free samples at 348 events--many geared toward youth \naudiences.\n  These e-cigarette companies have even revived cartoon characters in a \nway that calls to mind Joe Camel--the deadliest cartoon of the 20th \ncentury. While many of these companies argue that they do not market to \nchildren, a robust analysis recently published in the journal \nPediatrics suggests otherwise. Between 2011 and 2013, exposure to e-\ncigarette marketing by children aged 12 to 17 rose 256 percent. Mr. \nPresident, 24 million children saw these ads. Not only is the marketing \nand packaging intended to appeal to young people, so is the product \nitself. Let me read a list of e-cigarette flavors being marketed \ntoday--vivid vanilla, gummy bears, chocolate treat, and cherry crush. \nIn the face of this mounting evidence, rather than accelerating its \nefforts, the FDA bowed to industry pressure last week and extended the \ncomment period on its proposed regulations. Every day, 3,200 kids smoke \ntheir first cigarette. Every day that the FDA fails to take action \ncosts lives.\n  As we move to protect kids from new threats like e-cigarettes, we \nalso have to redouble our fight against tobacco use in the military. \nNearly 30 years have passed since the first Department of Defense \nreport on high rates of tobacco use among servicemembers and its \ndevastating impact on readiness, productivity, and medical costs. While \noverall rates of use have declined significantly, smoking rates among \nservicemembers are nearly 20 percent higher than civilian rates. The \nuse of smokeless tobacco is more than 450 percent higher for \nservicemembers than civilians. One in three military smokers began \ndoing so after enlisting.\n  The Department of Defense spends more than $1.6 billion every year on \ntobacco-related medical care and lost days of work, and the VA spends \nan additional $5 billion a year to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease, primarily caused by smoking.\n  In 1993, after reading about the dangers of secondhand smoke, CAPT \nStanley W. Bryant, commander of the U.S.S. Roosevelt, declared that his \nship would be smoke-free. He said, ``I'm the commanding officer of \nthese kids and I can't have them inhaling secondhand smoke. I wouldn't \nput them in the line of fire. I'm not going to put them in the line of \nsmoke.'' Captain Bryant is one of many leaders in our Armed Forces who \nhave tried to protect the men and women under their command from the \ndangers of tobacco, but at every turn, their efforts have come under \nfire from the tobacco industry and its allies. Even Bryant's victory \nwas short-lived. Within the year the tobacco industry forced in a new \ntobacco policy that stripped ships' captains of their authority over \nships' stores and mandated that cigarettes be sold on ships.\n  One of the central problems is the widespread availability of cheap \ntobacco products on military installations and ships. The Department of \nDefense policy requires that exchanges set tobacco prices 5 percent \nbelow the lowest local competitor. In practice, these discounts are \ngreater. A 19-year-old soldier walking into a PX can buy a pack of \nMarlboro cigarettes for 25 percent less, on average, than at the \nnearest Walmart, according to a recent study in JAMA. These discounts \nare deadly. Extensive research shows that raising tobacco prices is one \nof the most effective ways to reduce use. Efforts to end these \ndiscounts began in the late 1980s, but nearly every attempt has been \nblocked due to industry pressure.\n  This spring, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced that he is \nconsidering a ban on tobacco sales at all\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nbases and ships. As the Department of Defense has acknowledged, our \nultimate goal should be a tobacco-free military. When I asked about \nthis last week at a hearing, I was heartened to hear that Secretary of \nDefense Chuck Hagel was conducting a Department-wide review of tobacco \nsale policies. I urge Secretaries Hagel and Mabus to set concrete \ngoals, policies, and timelines--starting with an end to these discounts \nthat cost lives just as surely as do wars.\n  The Tobacco Control Act is one of this administration's greatest \nlegacies. I urge the administration to continue its leadership by \nprotecting children from e-cigarettes and our men and women in uniform \nfrom the harms of smoking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4140-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4140-S4141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CONGO\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about what this \nCongress did to help one of the world's most forgotten yet most deadly \nconflicts--that in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Former Kansas \nSenator Sam Brownback invited me to eastern Congo almost 10 years ago \nand later I returned with Senator Sherrod Brown in 2010.\n  The Democratic Republic of Congo is a nation of breathtaking natural \nbeauty, rich in a vast array of resources. It is also a badly broken \ncountry, weak in governance and dominated by relentless poverty, \nwarlords, pillaging soldiers, and horrific, almost incomprehensible, \nviolence. A barbaric civil war spanning more than a decade in Congo is \nthe most lethal conflict since World War II.\n  Eastern Congo is known as the ``Rape Capital of the World.'' In fact, \naccording to the United Nations, regional war and rape leaves an \nestimated 1,000 or more women assaulted every day in the Congo. That is \n12 percent of all Congolese women.\n  I will try to describe the city of Goma in eastern Congo to those who \nhaven't been there. It is almost impossible. Imagine one of the poorest \nplaces on Earth, where people are literally starving, where they are \nfacing the scourge of disease, where malaria and AIDS cut short the \nlives of far too many. Imagine a nearby active volcano. Then \nsuperimpose over that the misfortune of ongoing war and unrest that has \nravaged the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo for years \nand resulted in millions of deaths and unspeakable sexual violence. \nArmed militias, some left over from the genocide in Rwanda, continue to \noperate in the region, terrorizing civilians and inflicting horrific \nbrutality.\n  The United Nations has a 20,000-member peacekeeping force in the area \nwith an impressive new mandate to bring stability, but it can only do \nso much. The area is still very fragile, awash in weapons, warlords, \nand competing regional interests. It is also rich in valuable minerals \nthat are found in our every-day electronics, jewelry, and other \nproducts.\n  It has been said that the Congo war contains ``wars within wars''--\nand that is true. But fueling much of the violence is a bloody contest \nfor control of these vast mineral resources.\n  Most people probably don't realize that many of the products we use \nand wear every day, from automobiles to our cell phones and even our \nwedding rings, may use one of these minerals--and that there is a \npossibility it was mined using forced labor from an area of great \nviolence.\n  We can not begin to solve the problems of eastern Congo without \ntackling a key source of funding for armed groups, which is the mining \nof conflict minerals, including tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. We \nas a nation and as consumers, as well as industries that use these \nminerals, have a responsibility to ensure that our economic activity \ndoes not support such violence.\n  NGOs like the Enough Project have led the way in informing the \nAmerican people about what goes into the jewelry, electronics, and \nmanufacturing equipment they wear and use.\n  That is why I joined with Senators Brownback and Feingold and \nCongressman Jim McDermott to support legislation that would help stem \nthe flow of proceeds from illegally mined minerals into those \nperpetuating unspeakable violence. That law passed almost 4 years ago. \nIts requirement is simple: If a company registered in the United States \nuses any of a small list of key minerals from the Congo (tin, tantalum, \ntungsten, and gold)--minerals known to be involved in the conflict \nareas--then such usage must be reported in that company's SEC \ndisclosure. Companies can also include information showing steps taken \nto ensure the minerals are legitimately mined and sourced and that by \nresponsibly sourcing these minerals, they are not contributing to the \nregion's violence.\n  It is not a ban on using the materials or a requirement to source \nresponsibly. Instead it was a reasonable step--a reporting \nrequirement--to shed some light on the issue and to encourage companies \nusing these minerals to source them responsibly.\n  It took some time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nthoughtfully craft the rule for this law. And disappointingly, as is \nincreasingly too often the case with the rulemaking process, some tried \nto gut the law in court.\n  But the law was upheld repeatedly in court, moved forward as enacted \nby Congress. The first filing reports were submitted to the SEC early \nthis month. This is a milestone.\n  A look at these filings shows us that some companies have been \nworking for several years already to use their collective financial \nincentives to foster clean and legitimate supply chains out of eastern \nCongo. And I want to commend a few of these companies for taking such \nan early and responsible lead on this issue, including Apple, Intel, \nand electronics components manufacturer Kemet, which has a branch of \nits business in my home State of Illinois.\n  For example, Intel has created its first conflict-free computer chip, \nwhile still using responsibly sourced minerals from Congo, and took its \nreporting a step further by voluntarily submitting it to third-party \naudits. Under the Conflict-Free Smelter program, the number of \ninternational smelters operating free from conflict minerals continues \nto grow, with almost 90 smelters--40 percent of the world's total \nsmelters--being certified as conflict-free and over 150 companies and \nindustry associations participating in the program. After being \nrefined, the origins of the material become difficult to track, as \nthese smelters purchase materials from a variety of sources. The \nsmelter or refiner therefore represents a critical point in the supply \nchain where we can look for assurances about whether or not the \nmaterial has been purchased from conflict-free sources. Apple has \nconfirmed that its entire tantalum supply chain is conflict free.\n  Another leader in the electronics industry has been Motorola \nSolutions, headquartered in Schaumberg, IL. Motorola Solutions emerged \nearly as a company dedicated to cleaning up its supply chain, and to do \nso, it helped establish Solutions for Hope, dedicated to developing a \n``closed-pipe'' supply chain. In the Rubaya region of the North Kivu \nprovince in the DRC, it has done just that. Tantalum mines in Rubaya \nwere directly funding the leader of the vicious M23 rebel group, Bosco \nNtaganda. Through persistent effort, diligent monitoring and the \nbanding together of other likeminded corporations, those 17 mines are \nnow certified conflict-free, and most importantly, M23 has laid down \nits arms and Bosco Ntaganda stands before the International Criminal \nCourt to face charges for the atrocities he and his comrades committed.\n  According to the Enough Project's recent report on the impact of this \nlegislation, armed groups and the Congolese army are no longer present \nat two-thirds of tin, tantalum and tungsten mines surveyed in eastern \nCongo. And as you may have seen recently, Dutch smart phone \nmanufacturer Fairphone is making its products with conflict-free raw \nmaterials. Fairphone has already sold 35,000 units and is hoping to \nexpand production as more consumers embrace conflict-free electronics. \nFairphone and others are leading by example, and proving that conflict-\nfree is not only possible, but it can be profitable too.\n  This was the whole point of the legislation. And consumers will \nfinally have an option to invest in and purchase from those companies \nthat are making a good-faith effort to source from this war stricken \narea responsibly.\n  I thank my many colleagues here in the Congress on both sides of the \naisle\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\nwho helped make this bill a reality and the many responsible companies \nthat are taking steps to help ensure their sourcing of minerals does \nnot contribute to the horrific violence in mineral-rich Congo. The \nCongolese people have suffered entirely too much, and I sincerely \nbelieve that these efforts will be part of the long-term solution to \nthe quest for stability and peace in their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4141-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECESS APPOINTMENT DECISION\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I wish to applaud the Supreme Court's \nunanimous decision that the President's January 4, 2012 appointments to \nthe NLRB were unconstitutional. As you know, I was the Ranking Member \non the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in 2012, \nand when these appointments were made I expressed my concern with the \nadministration's contempt for small businesses and the Senate's \nconfirmation and vetting process. I was also proud to cosign an amicus \nbrief led by our Republican leader against these pro-forma session \nappointments.\n  The Appointments Clause of our Constitution provides that ``the \nPresident shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the \nSenate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, \nJudges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United \nStates, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and \nwhich shall be established by law.'' Today the Supreme Court validated \nthe Senate's important advice and consent role in the confirmation \nprocess.\n  These unconstitutional appointments are just one example of the \nexecutive branch overreach that Americans face every day under this \nadministration. In his State of the Union address, President Obama said \nthat since he is unable to rely on Congress to rubber stamp his agenda, \nhe intends to use executive orders to avoid the legislative process \naltogether. This is certainly not a new practice for him: President \nObama has issued more executive orders and economically significant \nrules and regulations than President George W. Bush, Clinton or Reagan. \nI hope today's Supreme Court decision will serve as the impetus that \nbrings my colleagues together to say enough is enough.\n  One issue we need to stand up to the administration about is its war \non coal. Earlier this month the EPA issued new regulations that try to \nforce a backdoor cap and tax proposal on Americans that Congress has \nrejected. Senators on both sides of the aisle realized a couple of \nyears ago that coal is one of our best sources of energy and that cap \nand tax was an extremely expensive and bad idea. I urge those Senators \nto come together again and make the President withdraw his cap and tax \nregulation.\n  Another issue we need to stand up to the President about is his \nattempt to control all our water. In March the EPA proposed a new rule \nthat could allow the administration to regulate all bodies of water, no \nmatter how small, and regardless of whether the water is on public or \nprivate property. We have already experienced that attempt at control \nin Wyoming, where the EPA tried to fine an individual up to $75,000 per \nday for the pond he built on his private property. Mark Twain once \nsaid, ``in the West, whiskey is for drinking. Water is for fighting \nover.'' I urge my Western State colleagues to come together and make \nthe President withdraw his waters of the United States regulation.\n  We do not have to wait for the Supreme Court to act on these examples \nof executive overreach. The Congressional Review Act provides an \nexpedited procedure for us to consider a resolution of disapproval of \nthe President's rules. Under the CRA, before any final rule can become \neffective it must be filed with each House of Congress and GAO. Within \n60 days after Congress receives an agency's rule, we can introduce a \nresolution of disapproval to nullify the rule. The CRA also guarantees \nus a vote because 30 of us can sign a petition to discharge the \nresolution from Committee, and the motion to proceed to the resolution \nis not subject to amendment, motion to postpone, or motion to proceed \nto other business. I hope I have 29 colleagues willing to join me in \nsigning petitions to discharge resolutions of disapproval regarding \nboth of these rules.\n  There are also areas where the administration is not acting when it \nshould, and I hope my colleagues will push the administration to spend \nits time taking actions that help, not hurt, America.\n  Officials from the IRS, Treasury Department, and White House did not \ntell Congress when they realized IRS emails had been lost that were \nrelevant to bipartisan committee investigations. The administration \nknew about those emails for at least 2 months before the Senate Finance \nCommittee was informed. I urge my colleagues to come together and \ninsist on full disclosure from the administration regarding allegations \nof political targeting by the IRS. A Finance Committee hearing about \nthe lost IRS emails would be an excellent step in getting to the bottom \nof this issue.\n  The administration has not approved the Keystone Pipeline application \nthat has been pending for more than 5 years. The State Department has \ndone five reviews of the project and determined that the pipeline would \ncause no significant environmental impacts. The pipeline would create \nabout 42,000 jobs. Our Energy Committee has passed legislation to build \nthe pipeline. A bipartisan group of at least 55 Senators say they want \nto build the pipeline. I urge that group to come together and insist \nthe President let the pipeline go forward.\n  These are not the only areas where the President has acted when he \nshould not have, and has not acted when he should have. But they are \nimportant to Wyoming and America, and I urge my colleagues to stand up \nto the executive branch now rather than waiting for the Supreme Court \non another issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4141-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4141-S4142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       STOPPING SCHOOL TRAGEDIES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN Mr. President, every morning around our Nation, as young \npeople walk into their schools, they are reminded of our Nation's \nepidemic of gun violence. The sights and sounds of an American school \nday--lockers closing, the morning bell--now compete with more \ndisconcerting scenes: metal detectors, security cameras, and armed \nguards. Students interrupt math and science lessons to participate in \nactive shooter drills. Parents everywhere ask the same, legitimate \nquestion: Are my kids safe in their school?\n  They are right to be concerned. On June 10, a 15-year-old boy in \nOregon brought a military-style assault rifle, nine magazines of \nammunition, a handgun, and a knife to his high school. There, he \nmurdered a classmate and exchanged gunfire with police before taking \nhis own life. Several reports have counted this as the 74th instance of \na shot being fired inside or near an American school since the tragic \nevents of December 14, 2012, when a mentally deranged individual stole \nthe lives of 27 people, 20 of them children, at Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool in Newtown, Connecticut. The only number of such instances that \nAmerica should accept is zero.\n  It does not have to continue this way. The Newtown shooting, along \nwith so many other horrific instances, created overwhelming consensus \namong Americans that Congress needs to act to stop this senseless gun \nviolence. Polls now routinely show that more than 90 percent of the \nAmerican public supports the passage of legislation to require simple \nbackground checks to be conducted on all gun sales. Recent reports have \nshown that 95 percent of internal medicine physicians in our Nation \nagree. And 76 percent of these physicians believe that gun safety \nlegislation would ``help to reduce the risk for gun-related injuries or \ndeath.'' Organizations outside of government have engaged in important \nwork to reduce gun violence in our society, including a recent \ninitiative spearheaded by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence \nthat encourages parents to keep their kids safe by asking a simple \nquestion: ``Is there an unlocked gun where my child plays?''\n  But as long as Congress continues to ignore the American people, the \nfundamental problems remain. Today, in places all around our Nation, a \nconvicted felon, a domestic abuser, a dangerously mentally ill \nindividual, or a confused and angry teenager can still buy a firearm \nfrom an unlicensed dealer without undergoing any sort of background \ncheck. And at almost any time, a mentally ill young person can\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\ntake their parent's military-style assault weapons, designed for no \npurpose other than murder, and commit an unspeakable atrocity, as \nhappened that sad day in Newtown.\n  Our country is not a war zone. Our Founding Fathers did not set forth \nto create a nation where parents walk through school hallways wondering \nif the doors and windows are thick enough. Or where communities turn on \ntheir televisions to tragic news, day after day, and have the same \nthought: ``That could be us next time.''\n  It is long past time for Congress to live up to our responsibility to \nprotect the American people. I urge my colleagues to take up and pass \nurgently needed, commonsense legislation to reduce gun violence in our \nsociety. The American people deserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4142-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, on June 7, 1776, Virginian Richard Henry \nLee introduced a motion in the Second Continental Congress to declare \nthe 13 American colonies' independence from Great Britain. Four days \nlater, Congress established a committee--the Committee of Five--to \ndraft a statement proclaiming and justifying American independence. The \nCommittee consisted of John Adams (Massachusetts), Benjamin Franklin \n(Pennsylvania), Thomas Jefferson (Virginia), Robert Livingston (New \nYork), and Roger Sherman (Connecticut) and assigned the duty of writing \nthe first draft to Thomas Jefferson. The Committee left no minutes so \nwe aren't sure how many iterations of the document were drafted before \nthe Committee presented the final version to Congress on June 28, \n1776--an action immortalized by the artist John Trumbull in a painting \nthat hangs in the Capitol Rotunda.\n  On Monday, July 1, 1776, the Committee of the Whole debated the Lee \nResolution. Jefferson wrote that they were ``exhausted by a debate of \nnine hours, during which all the powers of the soul had been distended \nwith the magnitude of the object.'' The Committee of the Whole voted 9-\n2 to adopt the Lee Resolution. The following day--July 2, 1776--\nCongress heard the report of the Committee of the Whole and declared \nthe sovereign status of the American colonies. The Declaration of \nIndependence was given its second reading before Congress adjourned for \nthe day. On July 3, 1776, the Declaration received its third reading \nand final edits. The text's formal adoption was deferred until the \nfollowing morning--July 4, 1776. That evening, the Committee of Five \nreconvened to prepare the final ``fair copy'' of the document, which \nwas delivered to the 29-year-old Irish immigrant printer John Dunlap, \nwith orders from John Hancock to print ``broadside'' copies. Dunlap \nworked into the night setting the type and running off 200 or so \nbroadside sheets--now known as the Dunlap broadsides--which became the \nfirst published copies of the Declaration of Independence. Twenty-six \nof the original Dunlap broadsides--or fragments of them--are extant. \nHere in Washington, the Library of Congress has two and the National \nArchives has one. In January 1777, Congress commissioned publisher Mary \nKatherine Goddard to produce a new broadside of the Declaration of \nIndependence that listed the individuals who signed it.\n  And so, here we are 238 years later, preparing once again to \ncelebrate the birth of our Nation and the document that proclaimed it. \nWe will have appropriate celebrations from the National Mall to small \ntowns across America. We will gather with families and friends in \ncommunities large and small to relax and refresh ourselves. And we will \nreflect on the blessings of liberty that have been bequeathed to us. We \nmust never take those blessings for granted. Americans have fought and \ndied to defend them and people around the world have fought and died to \nobtain them.\n  We cannot calculate what we owe to Thomas Jefferson and the Committee \nof Five. But, as Abraham Lincoln summoned all Americans in 1863 at \nGettysburg, we can dedicate ourselves to the ``great task remaining \nbefore us . . . that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of \nfreedom--and that government of the people, by the people, for the \npeople, shall not perish from the earth.'' The stakes are high, for as \nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt remarked in his fireside chat on \nMay 26, 1940, ``We defend and build a way of life, not for America \nalone, but for all mankind.'' That is our unique and solemn \nresponsibility as Americans, and our cherished privilege.\n  I wish all of my colleagues, my fellow Marylanders, and all Americans \na happy and safe Fourth of July.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4142-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4142-S4144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    50TH ANNIVERSARY OF FREEDOM SUMMER AND CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wish to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of Freedom Summer and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and to \ntalk for a few minutes about how Senators can work together to make \nthis a more perfect Union and guarantee equal justice under the law to \nall Americans.\n  Freedom Summer was a campaign in Mississippi to register Black voters \nduring the summer of 1964. In 1964, most Black voters were \ndisenfranchised by law or practice in Mississippi, notwithstanding the \n15th Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified in 1870. The \n15th Amendment provides that ``the rights of citizens of the United \nStates to vote shall not be denied or abridged by . . . any State on \naccount of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.''\n  On January 23, 1964, the States ratified the 24th Amendment to the \nConstitution, which provides that ``the rights of citizens of the \nUnited States to vote in any primary or other [Federal] election . . . \nshall not be denied or abridged . . . by any State by reason of failure \nto pay any poll tax or other tax.''\n  The Freedom Summer voting rights initiative was led by the Student \nNonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC, with the support of the \nCouncil of Federated Organizations, COFO, which included the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP, the Congress \nof Racial Equality, referred to in this preamble as the CORE, and the \nSouthern Christian Leadership Conference, SCLC.\n  Thousands of students and activists participated in 2-week \norientation sessions in preparation for the voter registration drive in \nMississippi. In 1962, at 6.7 percent of the State's Black population, \nMississippi had one of the lowest percentages of Black registered \nvoters in the country.\n  Tragically, three civil rights volunteers lost their lives in their \nattempts to secure voting rights for Blacks. Andrew Goodman was a White \n20-year-old anthropology major from Queens College who volunteered for \nthe Freedom Summer project. James Chaney was a 21-year-old Black man \nfrom Meridian, MS, who became a civil rights activist, joining the CORE \nin 1963 to work on voter registration and education. Michael ``Mickey'' \nSchwerner was a 24-year-old White man from Brooklyn, NY, who was a CORE \nfield secretary in Mississippi and a veteran of the civil rights \nmovement.\n  On the morning of June 21, 1964, the three men left the CORE office \nin Meridian, MS, and set out for Longdale, MS, where they were to \ninvestigate the recent burning of the Mount Zion Methodist Church, a \nBlack church that had been functioning as a freedom school to promote \neducation and voter registration. The three civil rights workers were \nbeaten, shot, and killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan, after being \nturned over by local police.\n  The national uproar in response to these brave men's deaths, which \noccurred shortly before enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \nhelped build the momentum and national consensus necessary to bring \nabout passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  So as we celebrate the anniversaries of these landmarks pieces of \ncivil rights legislation, we are reminded that there is more work to be \ndone. As former Senator Ted Kennedy used to say, ``Civil rights is the \ngreat unfinished business of America.''\n  One year ago this week the Supreme Court issued its decision in \nShelby County v. Holder, which struck down section 4 of the Voting \nRights Act, invalidating the coverage formula that determines which \njurisdictions are subject to the preclearance provisions of the act.\n  Congress must act to reverse the erroneous decision by the Supreme \nCourt which overturned several important\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\nprecedents in a fit of judicial activism. As much as we wish it wasn't \nso, racism has not disappeared from America and there continue to be \nindividuals and groups who would use our voting system to deliberately \nminimize the rights of minority voters. Congress overwhelmingly \nreauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006 after building an extensive \nrecord that made a compelling case for the continued need to protect \nminority voters from discrimination. I strongly agree with Justice \nGinsburg's dissent that `in truth, the evolution of voting \ndiscrimination into more subtle second-generation barriers is powerful \nevidence that a remedy as effective as preclearance remains vital to \nprotect minority voting rights and prevent backsliding.' '' I am deeply \ndisappointed that the Court put voting rights in jeopardy by ignoring \nreality and disregarding the power of Congress to enforce the 15th \nAmendment of the Constitution by appropriate legislation.\n  I am pleased that the Judiciary Committee held a hearing this week on \npotential legislative responses to the Supreme Court's decision in \nShelby County v. Holder, and I hope Congress can take up and pass a \nlegislative fix before the midterm elections.\n  Congress should also take up and pass the Democracy Restoration Act, \nDRA, S. 2235, which I have introduced. The Democracy Restoration Act \nwould restore voting rights in Federal elections to approximately 5.8 \nmillion citizens who have been released from prison and are back living \nin their communities.\n  After the Civil War, Congress enacted and the States ratified the \n15th Amendment, which provides that ``the right of citizens of the \nUnited States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United \nStates or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition \nof servitude. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by \nappropriate legislation.''\n  Unfortunately, many States passed laws during the Jim Crow period \nafter the Civil War to make it more difficult for newly freed slaves to \nvote in elections. Such laws included poll taxes, literacy tests, and \ndisenfranchisement measures.\n  Some disenfranchisement measures applied to misdemeanor convictions \nand in practice could result in lifetime disenfranchisement, even for \nindividuals that successfully reintegrated into their communities as \nlaw-abiding citizens.\n  Shortly thereafter Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \nwhich swept away numerous State laws and procedures that had denied \nAfrican Americans and other minorities their constitutional right to \nvote. For example, the act outlawed the use of literacy or history \ntests that voters had to pass before registering to vote or casting \ntheir ballot.\n  The act specifically prohibits States from imposing any ``voting \nqualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or \nprocedure . . . . . to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the \nUnited States to vote on account of race or color.'' Congress \noverwhelmingly reauthorized the act in 2006, which was signed into law \nby President George W. Bush. Congress is now working on legislation to \nrevitalize the VRA after recent Supreme Court decisions curtailed its \nreach.\n  In 2014, I am concerned that there are still several areas where the \nlegacy of Jim Crow laws and State disenfranchisement statutes lead to \nunfairness in Federal elections. First, State laws governing the \nrestoration of voting rights vary widely throughout the country, such \nthat persons in some States can easily regain their voting rights, \nwhile in other States persons effectively lose their right to vote \npermanently. Second, these State disenfranchisement laws have a \ndisproportionate impact on racial and ethnic minorities. Third, this \npatchwork of State laws results in the lack of a uniform standard for \neligibility to vote in Federal elections, and leads to an unfair \ndisparity and unequal participation in Federal elections based solely \non residence. Finally, studies indicate that former prisoners who have \nvoting rights restored are less likely to reoffend, and \ndisenfranchisement hinders their rehabilitation and reintegration into \ntheir community.\n  In 35 States, convicted individuals may not vote while they are on \nparole. In 11 States, a conviction can result in lifetime \ndisenfranchisement. Several States require prisoners to seek \ndiscretionary pardons from Governors, or action by the parole or pardon \nboard, in order to regain their right to vote. Several States deny the \nright to vote to individuals convicted of certain misdemeanors. States \nare slowly moving to repeal or loosen many of these barriers to voting \nfor ex-prisoners.\n  An estimated 5,850,000 citizens of the United States, or about 1 in \n40 adults in the United States, currently cannot vote as a result of a \nfelony conviction. Of the 5,850,000 citizens barred from voting, only \n25 percent are in prison. By contrast, 75 percent of the \ndisenfranchised reside in their communities while on probation or \nparole after having completed their sentences. Approximately 2,600,000 \ncitizens who have completed their sentences remain disenfranchised due \nto restrictive State laws. In six states--Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, \nMississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia--more than 7 percent of the total \npopulation is disenfranchised.\n  Studies show that a growing number of African-American men, for \nexample, will be disenfranchised at some point in their life, partly \ndue to mandatory minimum sentencing laws that have a disproportionate \nimpact on minorities. Latino citizens are disproportionately \ndisenfranchised as well.\n  Congress has addressed part of this problem by enacting the Fair \nSentencing Act to partially reduce the sentencing disparity between \ncrack cocaine and powder cocaine convictions. Congress is now \nconsidering legislation that would more broadly revise mandatory \nsentencing procedures and create a fairer system of sentencing. While I \nwelcome these steps, I believe that Congress should take stronger \naction now to remedy this particular problem.\n  The legislation would restore voting rights to prisoners after their \nrelease from incarceration. It requires that prisons receiving Federal \nfunds notify people about their right to vote in Federal elections when \nthey are leaving prison, sentenced to probation, or convicted of a \nmisdemeanor.\n  The legislation is narrowly crafted to apply to Federal elections, \nand retains the States' authorities to generally establish voting \nqualifications. This legislation is consistent with congressional \nauthority under the Constitution and voting rights statutes.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has been endorsed by a large \ncoalition of public interest organizations, including civil rights and \nreform organizations; religious and faith-based organizations; and law \nenforcement and criminal justice organizations.\n  In particular I want to thank the Brennan Center for Justice, the \nACLU, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the \nNAACP for their work on this legislation.\n  This legislation is designed to reduce recidivism rates and help \nreintegrate ex-prisoners back into society. When prisoners are \nreleased, they are expected to obey the law, get a job, and pay taxes \nas they are rehabilitated and reintegrated into their community. With \nthese responsibilities and obligations of citizenship should also come \nthe rights of citizenship, including the right to vote.\n  In 2008, President George W. Bush signed the Second Chance Act into \nlaw, after overwhelming approval and strong bipartisan support in \nCongress. The legislation expanded the Prison Re-Entry Initiative, by \nproviding job training, placement services, transitional housing, drug \ntreatment, medical care, and faith-based mentoring.\n  At the signing ceremony, President Bush said: ``We believe that even \nthose who have struggled with a dark past can find brighter days ahead. \nOne way we act on that belief is by helping former prisoners who have \npaid for their crimes. We help them build new lives as productive \nmembers of our society.''\n  The Democracy Restoration Act is fully consistent with the goals of \nthe Second Chance Act, as Congress and the States seek to reduce \nrecidivism rates, strengthen the quality of life in our communities and \nmake them safer, and reduce the burden on taxpayers.\n  More recently, in a February 2014 speech, Attorney General Eric \nHolder called on elected officials to reexamine disenfranchisement \nstatutes and enact reforms to restore voting rights.\n  I urge Congress to continue the fight to protect and expand civil \nrights in\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\nthis country, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Freedom Summer \nand the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and as we strive to make this a more \nperfect union.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4144-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wish to speak on behalf of our service \nmen and women suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD. \nTomorrow--June 27--is National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness \nDay, so designated by the U.S. Senate in a unanimous action 2 years \nago. I am calling on all of my colleagues in this body to redouble our \nefforts to help veterans and servicemembers who are struggling with \nPTSD each and every day. I remain committed to provide all necessary \nassistance to people who have this problem as the result of their \nfaithful military service because it is one of the solemn obligations \nwe have as a nation. For this reason I supported Senator Heitkamp's bi-\npartisan resolution designating June as National Post-Traumatic Stress \nDisorder--PTSD--Awareness Month.\n  With the military drawdown currently underway, I am concerned that \nour Nation will not adequately address the PTSD-related issues that \nmany of our veterans and servicemembers face. I find it deeply \ntroubling that, on average, 22 veterans commit suicide every day. \nFurthermore, veterans who have post-traumatic stress are at greater \nrisk for drug abuse and alcoholism. The abuse of these substances often \namounts to a form of a self-medication because the servicemember or \nveteran is unable or unwilling to seek help.\n  I strongly believe that Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Day \nis an important step in highlighting these issues. Our challenge is to \nhelp every veteran suffering from these invisible wounds seek help and \ncope with their very real injury. There is a perceived stigma that \nmakes veterans reluctant to seek help and feeds negative perceptions \nwhich can cause employers not to hire veterans. Educating veterans and \nthe public about this affliction and the support networks available \nwill bring to light a very real and deadly epidemic among \nservicemembers. Too often we say ``thank you'' to servicemembers and \nveterans without really knowing what we are thanking them for, because \nwe don't bother to understand their struggles. Addressing this \ndisconnect would make a world of difference in helping this population \nmitigate the effects of post-traumatic stress.\n  The work being done today to address this issue proves that post-\ntraumatic stress does not have to be a permanently disabling condition. \nWithin my own State of Maryland, organizations such as Fort Detrick's \nArmy Medical Research & Materiel Command are making amazing advances in \ndeveloping post-traumatic stress treatments that were unimaginable just \na few years ago. As for present treatments, the Warrior Canine \nConnection is an excellent example of an organization that is helping \nveterans here and now. This organization, located in Brookeville, \nprovides therapeutic working dogs to veterans and servicemembers, and \nit also conducts research that strives to further improve upon the \npositive effects that these service animals have on the veterans and \nservicemembers. The Warrior Canine Connection has helped countless \nveterans relieve the symptoms of post-traumatic stress, enabling them \nto regain their status as healthy and productive members of our \nsociety.\n  I am not at all surprised that these servicemembers and veterans have \nbounced back wonderfully after being treated for their post-traumatic \nstress. If a soldier, sailor, airmen or Marine is able to excel on the \nbattlefield, then I see no reason why that same person should not be \nable to excel in the classroom, in a hospital, or in the boardroom. I \nrefuse to believe that our veterans and servicemembers are ``damaged \ngoods'' because of their military service.\n  One only needs to look at our history to see that our society \nbenefits greatly when we provide our veterans and servicemembers with \nthe assistance they need to transition successfully to civilian life. \nDuring World War II, American servicemembers encountered some of the \nmost difficult combat conditions in human history. Yet when World War \nII veterans returned home, did they become a burden to their nation \nbecause of those combat experiences? Not at all. Returning World War II \nveterans spearheaded the work that made our country more prosperous \nthan it had ever been. Veterans can be the engine to a great economy \nthat sustains a flourishing middle class. I believe World War II \nveterans were able to succeed in the civilian workforce because after \nthe war, they returned to a society that understood and genuinely \nrespected their military service.\n  This week I had the privilege of visiting the Veterans Health Care \nSystem in Baltimore, MD. America cannot break our promise to those who \nhave sacrificed so much to protect our great Nation. We have seen \nbipartisan progress toward correcting the systemic problems facing our \nveterans' health care system, and I am encouraged by the additional \nstaff and resources being deployed in Baltimore. Most Maryland veterans \nare receiving quality health care at world-class facilities close to \nhome. But the wounds inflicted by this national breach of trust will \ntake more time to heal as we renew and fulfill our commitment to care \nfor the health and well-being of our veterans.\n  I am continually in awe of the extraordinary men and women serving at \nthe Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who make it their \ndaily mission to provide the highest level of support to our wounded, \nill, and injured servicemembers and their families. A testament to \ntheir commitment is the Department of Defense Deployment Health \nClinical Center in Bethesda, MD, which has developed an intensive, 3-\nweek, multi-disciplinary treatment program called The Specialized Care \nProgram. This program is designed for servicemembers experiencing PTSD \nor experiencing difficulties readjusting to life upon redeployment \nafter serving in Operations IRAQ or ENDURING FREEDOM. This program is \nfor patients who have had other treatments for PTSD, or perhaps \ndepression, but who continue to experience symptoms that interfere with \ntheir ability to function.\n  In light of the upcoming July 4 holiday, providing assistance to \nveterans who have served our Nation so diligently must be a priority. \nAs we celebrate our Independence Day, we must also address the needs of \nthose who have defended our liberty and have allowed it to thrive. \nWithout the men and women who fought for the United States' freedom in \n1776 and those who bravely do so today, our country simply would not \nexist. With this in mind, we as Americans ought to support our veterans \nto the best of our abilities and present them with the necessary \nassistance and resources they may require. Whether we succeed in this \nendeavor will be a significant measure of our Nation's fidelity towards \nour veterans and its moral character. I am committed to making sure \nthis population receives treatment for post-traumatic stress, should \nthey need it. The United States is the strongest nation in the world \nbecause of our veterans and servicemembers. We owe it to bring them \nback home not just in body, but in mind and spirit, as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4144-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4144-S4145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RWANDA\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, rising from the ashes of the 1994 \ngenocide, the Rwandan people can be proud of the progress their country \nhas made over the past two decades. Through reconciliation and \nresilience, Rwanda has entered a new phase of economic growth and is \nworking to protect civilians in other countries through its vital \ncontributions to global peacekeeping missions. The world has cheered \nthese successes, but today we have cause for concern.\n  To cement its legacy as a world leader and model for development, \nthere is in Rwanda today a clear need to ensure space for a thriving \ncivil society--a hallmark of any democracy. I am deeply troubled by \nreports of shrinking space for dissenting voices. Rwanda's domestic \nhuman rights movement has been profoundly constrained by a combination \nof intimidation and stigmatization, threats, harassment, arbitrary \narrests and detentions, infiltration, and administrative obstacles. The \ngovernment's actions to censor domestic and international human rights\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\ngroups appear to be part of a broader pattern of intolerance of \ncriticism.\n  In 2013, the United States, the United Kingdom, the United Nations \nHuman Rights Council, Amnesty International, and Freedom House all \nexpressed concern over the interference of the Rwandan Government in \ndetermining the leadership of the Rwandan League for the Promotion and \nDefense of Human Rights, one of the last remaining independent advocacy \norganizations in the country. This has effectively curtailed domestic \ncivil society initiatives to monitor human rights abuses.\n  In June of this year, the U.S. State Department cited its deep \nconcern over the arrest and disappearance of dozens of Rwandan citizens \nover a period of 2 months, citing incommunicado detention and a lack of \ndue process, as well as the threatening of journalists.\n  Also in June, Human Rights Watch, HRW, an organization that has \nworked on Rwanda for more than 20 years and documented the 1994 \ngenocide, was accused by the Ministry of Justice of political bias and \ncollaboration with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, \nFDLR, some of whose members participated in the genocide and committed \nhorrific human rights abuses in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, \nDRC. These accusations come in the wake of a May HRW critique of the \nRwandan Government's actions, including forced disappearances, and \ndiscount HRW's constant critique of the FDLR's egregious human rights \nrecord in the DRC. HRW, the last independent international organization \nbased in Kigali speaking out against human rights abuses, appears at \nincreasing risk of not being able to do its job, and perhaps even of \nbeing shut down.\n  Rwanda's past should not be used as an excuse to suppress free speech \nand independent reporting in Rwanda today. Dissent is an important tool \nfor citizens in holding their elected leaders accountable. Peaceful, \nlaw-abiding individuals and organizations should not be labeled as \nconspirators or enemies of state because they question the government. \nFreedom of expression and due process are rights that should extend to \nall Rwandans and its visitors--including journalists, human rights \nadvocates, opposition members, and everyday citizens alike.\n  Rwanda has made great strides, but there is still work to do. As \nRwanda faces its newest challenges, the United States stands with its \npeople and remains committed to their success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4145-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4145-S4146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Specialist Dylan J.

Dylan \ndied 3 years ago today, June 26, 2011, of injuries suffered from an \nimprovised explosive device in Diyala Province, Iraq, in support of \nOperation New Dawn.\n  Dylan was born November 07, 1990, in Tulsa, OK. His father Jeff \nJohnson said Dylan ``had aspired to military service for years and \ndressed as a soldier for Halloween six years running.'' After Dylan \ngraduated from Jenks High School, he joined the military in August \n2009, largely inspired by the men on both sides of his family who \nserved with the military during World War II and Korea.\n  After completing basic training at Fort Knox, KY, Dylan was assigned \nto the 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 2d Brigade Combat Team, 1st \nCavalry Division in Fort Hood, TX.\n  Specialist Johnson departed on Memorial Day 2011 for his first \noverseas deployment and arrived in Iraq June 2. On June 26, 2011, Dylan \ntragically died of injuries he sustained when insurgents attacked his \narmored vehicle with an improvised explosive device. One other soldier \nin the vehicle was killed alongside of Dylan.\n  ``Dylan possessed a kind spirit and was a bit reserved in my world \nliterature class,'' said teacher, Ron Acebo. ``We all ache for the loss \nof this young life and grieve with his family. As teachers, we all hold \nhopes and dreams for our students. We do not know what he could have \nachieved but we are humbled that he had made the supreme sacrifice for \nhis country. . . . and that is how he will be remembered.''\n  A memorial service was held July 6, 2011, at Kirk of the Hills Church \nin Tulsa, OK and he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on August \n9, 2011.\n  At a ceremony on his birthday in 2013, the State of Oklahoma \ndedicated to his memory the bridge on U.S. 75 across Polecat Creek, \njust south of Main Street in Jenks, OK. A sign reading ``Specialist \nDylan Johnson Memorial Bridge'' was emplaced on the structure, and his \nfather asked those gathered to remember Oklahoma's other fallen \nsoldiers when they cross it.\n  Dylans's military honors include the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, \nthe Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and \nthe Iraqi Campaign Medal with Combat Service Star.\n  In addition to his father, Dylan is survived by his mother Joy Sehl; \nhis stepmother Lynda Johnson; two sisters, Alexandra Johnson and \nKathryn Sehl; and two stepsisters, Brittany Dinan and Brooke Dinan. All \nare of Tulsa, OK.\n  Today we remember Army SPC Dylan J.

Morris\n\n  Madam President, I now wish to remember the life and sacrifice of a \nremarkable young man, Army SPC Jordan M. Morris. Along with 4 other \nsoldiers, Jordan died August 11, 2011 of injuries he sustained from an \nimprovised explosive device in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Jordan was born in Elk City, OK on February 12, 1988, and later moved \nto Ripley, OK. While attending Ripley High School, he was a member of \nthe baseball team, National Honor Society, 4-H, and served as Student \nCouncil president. He was concurrently enrolled and graduated from the \nOklahoma School of Science and Math. As an active member of the \nHillcrest Baptist Church, he was very involved with the youth group and \nenjoyed spending time serving others on various mission trips.\n  After graduating as class valedictorian from Ripley High School in \n2006, he fulfilled a dream he had from the age of 8 as he was accepted \nto the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Jordan spent 4 years at \nWest Point, majoring in mechanical engineering. Friend Caleb Eytcheson \nsaid Jordan ``wanted to be the best, and he knew West Point is where \nthey trained the best. He wanted to serve his country,'' he said.\n  Jordan joined the Army in January 2011, serving as an infantryman. \nAfter completing training at Fort Benning, GA he was assigned to 1st \nBattalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th \nMountain Division, Fort Drum, NY. On May 5, 2011, Jordan deployed to \nAfghanistan.\n  Doug Scott, assistant principal of Ripley High School said Morris was \nintelligent, had a great sense of humor and was very popular in school. \n``He showed his unselfish side by going overseas,'' Scott said.\n  Jordan's baseball coach, Donnie Hoffman said: ``The world is not as \ngood a place, when you lose people with the character that he was. The \nlegacy he leaves behind was the way he led his life, the character, the \ndiscipline, the dedication, the honor.''\n  Jordan was buried August 20, 2011 at Palmer Marler Funeral Home in \nStillwater, OK.\n  Jordan is survived by his parents Brett and Nita (Faber) Morris of \nStillwater; two brothers Levi James and Jesse Isaac Morris of \nStillwater; grandparents Wilma Faber, of Tulsa, James and Patricia \nMorris, of Broken Arrow; numerous aunts, uncles, cousins and friends, \nas well as his former West Point classmates and fellow soldiers in the \n1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th \nMountain Division.\n  Today we remember Army SPC Jordan M.

Specialist Seals died \nAugust 16, 2011 of non-combat injuries at Forward Operating Base \nLightening in Paktika Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry \nRegiment, 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Oklahoma National Guard.\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\n  Joshua was born April 10, 1990, in Glendale, AZ and later moved to \nPorter, OK. While attending Porter High School he played football, was \nan honor roll student and a member of the academic team. He was also \nactive in Wagoner County 4-H and showed Dutch rabbits.\n  He joined the military as a truck driver in 2008 while still in high \nschool.

Myles Deering, Oklahoma's adjutant general. ``As we \nmourn his loss in the days ahead, we will be forever honored and proud \nthat he chose to serve his country and the people of Oklahoma in the \nNational Guard.''\n  Principal Larry Shackelford described him as a great student and a \nwonderful young man with a bright outlook.\n  A memorial and burial service was held August 27, 2011 at Greenwood \nCemetery in Porter, OK.\n  Specialist Seals is survived by his parents Rhonda and Stanley; wife \nAndrina; and siblings Jeremy, Sarah and James.\n  Today we remember Army SPC Joshua M.

Wickliff-Chacin\n\n  Madam President, I pay tribute to a true American hero, Army SPC \nJames T. Wickliff-Chacin of Edmond, OK who died on September 20, 2013 \nserving our nation in Pul-E-Alam, Afghanistan. Specialist Wickliff-\nChacin was assigned to 6th Squadron, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade \nCombat Team, Fort Stewart, GA.\n  James died at Brook Army Medical Center in San Antonio, TX of \ninjuries sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near \nhis dismounted patrol during combat operations in Pul-E-Alam, \nAfghanistan on August 12, 2013. He was 22 years old.\n  Born February 18, 1991 in Venezuela, James moved to Oklahoma with his \nfamily in 2006. He graduated from Edmond Santa Fe High School in 2010. \nAfter graduation, he enlisted as an infantryman in the Army in June \n2010 and arrived at his unit in October 2010.\n  ``He had a good future,'' his father said. ``He had all the scores to \ngo to whatever college he wanted.'' But James wanted to join the Army. \nFriends said he was proud of his service even before he graduated from \nhigh school.\n  ``I remember him as a young man who very much wanted to go into the \nmilitary,'' said his former high school principal Jason Brown. The \nfollowing year, before graduation, James had asked ahead of time if the \nschool was going to do anything to recognize students who would be \nserving in the military. ``I told him he would have to wait but he was \nin for a surprise,'' Brown said. ``During graduation we always asked \nfor those individuals to stand up who wanted to go into the military. I \ndistinctly remember looking for and finding him in the audience and he \nwas smiling ear to ear.''\n  This was his second deployment; he previously deployed to Iraq from \nMarch to June 2011.\n  In May 2013, James wrote on his Facebook page ``I am proud to carry \nthe legacy of my family. We are warriors at heart that fight against \nall odds to protect those who need us. There is nothing else that I \nwould rather be doing with my life.''\n  James was laid to rest at Fort Sill National Cemetery, Elgin, OK on \nOctober 3, 2013. He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and the \nArmy Commendation Medal of Valor.\n  Today we remember Army SPC James T. Wickliff-Chacin, a young man who \nloved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for \nfreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4146-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ANDREA FOUBERG\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Madam President, I wish to honor the town of \nUnity, NH. This great American community is celebrating the 250th \nanniversary of its founding, and I am proud to recognize this historic \nevent.\n  Located in Sullivan County in the western part of the State, the town \nof Unity includes the villages of Unity, East and West Unity, and \nQuaker City. The origins of Unity date back to 1753 when the territory \nthen known as Buckingham was chartered through a series of grants from \nNew Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth and the Massachusetts \ngovernment. Unfortunately, this grew territorial tension among the \nlocal residents, so in 1764 the town of Unity was formally \nincorporated. Today Unity is home to approximately 1,700 New Hampshire \nresidents who take great pride in living their lives as their town name \nintended them to, in unity.\n  The Unity Town Hall, which today serves as the official location for \nUnity Town Hall meetings, was constructed in 1831. It was originally a \nBaptist meeting house, but the town of Unity purchased the building for \n$25.00 in 1877. It has since undergone renovation but still stands \nproudly today where in the bell tower hangs a famed Revere Bell which \nwill ring forth in celebration of Unity on July 11, 2014.\n  Unity is an example of a quintessential New Hampshire town whose \ncitizens embody everything that it means to be great Americans. So \ntoday we honor the 250th anniversary of Unity, NH. We commend its \ncitizens and recognize their accomplishments, their love of country, \nand their spirit of independence. But more importantly, we look forward \nto the next 250 years and the great things this town will have to \noffer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4146-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4146-S4147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING WILD TOUCH TAXIDERMY\n\n Mr. RISCH. Madam President, more and more small businesses \nacross America have started to pursue opportunities outside of our \nborders by extending their markets globally. According to the Small \nBusiness Administration, almost 96 percent of consumers reside outside \nof the United States. The benefits to small businesses that export are \ncompelling. According to a report by the Institute for International \nEconomics, U.S. exporting firms grow 2 to 4 percent faster in employing \nthan their nonexporting counterparts, offer better opportunities for \nadvancement, expand their annual total sales faster, and are nearly 8.5 \npercent less likely to go out of business.\n  Today, I would like to recognize one such U.S. small business that \nhas experienced growth in revenues and employment because they have \npursued exporting opportunities across the globe. Wild Touch Taxidermy \nin Meridian, ID, a small business dedicated to quality products, has \nachieved an outstanding reputation both domestically and overseas.\n  Licensed since 1985, Wild Touch Taxidermy specializes in custom \ntaxidermy for customers who desire a unique and high-quality trophy. \nFamily owned and operated by Kelly and Sharon Adams, Wild Touch \nTaxidermy lives up to their motto, ``We Do It All.'' The small \ntaxidermy business offers a high-quality way to preserve and display \ntrophy animals of all sizes and from any country, including skull \nmounts, old mounts, tan hides, and clean skulls. Wild Touch Taxidermy \noperates in a federally approved facility with U.S. Department of \nAgriculture permission, allowing them to receive restricted and out-of-\ncountry imports and enabling them to expand their business \ninternationally.\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\n  To bolster its success, Wild Touch Taxidermy took full advantage of \nexport assistance through the Idaho Department of Commerce, which \nconnected the business to Taiwanese buyers through its trade office in \nTaipei. The business's exposure to the Asian market allowed them to \nexpand the business to China. Wild Touch Taxidermy was also provided \ngrant funds through the Small Business Administration's State Trade and \nExport Promotion Program, which seeks to grow the number of U.S. small \nbusinesses that export their goods and services to foreign buyers. The \nadditional aid for 2 years allowed the owners to attend several trade \nshows and trade missions in Taiwan and China, which resulted in a boost \nto the business's profitability and international presence. Utilizing \nSTEP grants, Wild Touch Taxidermy's actual export sales for year one \nleveraged a return on investment of 15 to 1 and actual export sales for \nyear two leveraged a return on investment of 74 to 1, with anticipation \nof more sales in the international market.\n  With 29 years of experience, Wild Touch Taxidermy has achieved a \nreputation of excellence both domestically and internationally. Wild \nTouch Taxidermy's dedication to quality, persistence in pursuing new \nopportunities, and their efficient use of export assistance have \nallowed their business to catapult to the next level. I congratulate \nKelly and Sharon Adams and wish them an abundance of success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4147-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JONES COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Jones County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Jones County worth over $870,000 \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought hard to support, which have provided more than $5.6 million to \nthe local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together is the \ncommunity's work to secure funding through the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency for programs I fought for to mitigate and prepare for \nnatural disasters and provide safety equipment and training for \nfirefighters.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nJones County has received over $2.9 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as \nthe methamphetamine epidemic. During the mid-to-late 1990's, cities in \nJones County received $311,465 in Community Oriented Policing Services \ngrants. Also, since 2001, Jones County's fire departments have received \nover $985,443 for firefighter safety and operations equipment.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Jones County has received $750,273 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Jones County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $82,973.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Jones County has received more than $687,000 \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nJones County, both those with and without disabilities. And they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Jones County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Jones \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4147-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4147-S4148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WAYNE COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs.

Madam President, today I wish to recognize the \nNevada National Guard's 45th Detachment of the Operational Support \nAirlift Agency, DET 45 OSAA, located at Reno-Stead airport. On June \n6th, this unit departed for Joint Base Bagram, Afghanistan, where they \nwill be serving for the next 9 months.\n  While tensions continue to rise in the Middle East, I am both humbled \nand honored that these brave men and women are willing to go into \nharm's way to put the needs of our country before their own. We owe our \nrespect and gratitude to these soldiers, who are sacrificing so much to \ndefend our freedoms. The DET 45 OSAA unit has a flawless reputation for \nproviding safely executed flight operations both nationally and \ninternationally without any accidents for the past 20 years, which has \nearned them a spot among the top 10 units for the past 10 years. I, \nalong with my fellow Nevadans are honored that the DET 45 OSAA Unit \ncall Nevada home. We as a nation are fortunate to have men and women, \nlike those in the DET 45 OSAA unit, to serve and protect us.\n  The Nevada National Guard's 45th Detachment plays an integral role \nwithin the Operational Support Airlift Agency's mission by providing \nhigh priority, short notice fixed wing air transport support to \npassengers and cargo for all components and members of the Department \nof Defense. DET 45 OSAA has supported many missions both nationally and \nabroad. From 2003 to 2010 the unit flew missions in Cuba in support of \nSpecial Forces operations, and were deployed to Iraq and Kuwait \nsupporting Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the \nUnited States Africa Command. The DET 45 OSAA unit has also supported \nground forces by flying an intelligence, surveillance and \nreconnaissance mission with the King Air 300 series Medium Altitude \nReconnaissance\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\nand Surveillance System aircraft.

Madam President, today I wish to recognize a \nveterans volunteer program within Las Vegas known as Squadbay for their \ncontinued dedication to help their fellow servicemembers transition \nback from the battlefield to their communities. This unique program \ncomprised of Marine Corps combat veterans provides recently discharged \nveterans with a mission, which uses newly acquired battlefield skills, \nand provides housing and other resources.\n  There is no way to adequately thank the men and women who lay down \ntheir lives for our freedoms, but the founders and volunteers at \nSquadbay have developed a way to assist our Nation's veterans in need \nby affording them various ways to use their training to benefit others. \nI commend this organization's continued dedication to serving Marine \ncombat veterans needing to process traumatic experiences while \nsimultaneously affecting a positive change in the lives of those in \nneed of humanitarian assistance. Squadbay was founded by Lu Lobello, a \nbrave veteran living in Las Vegas who realized the importance of having \na mission after returning home from combat in Baghdad. Lu serves as a \nshining example of putting one's community before oneself.\n  With its first mission in 2013 to the Philippines after Typhoon \nYolanda, Squadbay's service extends far beyond our Nation's borders. By \nallowing veterans the ability to continue using their combat training \nin a new environment, with a new mission that mirrors the values of \ntheir military experience, Squadbay is working to create a seamless \ntransition to civilian life for our veterans. By providing a safe and \nsocial space for combat veterans to come together and the opportunity \nto embark on humanitarian aid missions, they are affording these brave \nmen and women an opportunity to work through any issues brought on by \nexperiencing combat.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I know the \nstruggles that our veterans face after returning home from the \nbattlefield. Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these \nbrave individuals but to ensure they receive the quality care they have \nearned and deserve. I remain committed to upholding this promise for \nour veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation.

Madam President, on June 24, my hometown of Detroit \nand the State of Michigan lost a great friend and public servant. \nIndeed, the loss of Michael George at the age of 81 was a tremendous \nloss for all those who admire hard work, dedication, generosity, and \ncommitment to making the world a better place.\n  The son of immigrants, Mike was best known to many through his \nsuccessful business ventures. He built a small, family-owned dairy \nbusiness into Melody Farms, one of the largest and most successful \ndairy producers and distributors in the country.\n  Had that been his only endeavor, we would have called Mike's life \nwell-lived. But Mike was more than a businessman. He became a leader in \nDetroit's Chaldean community. Chaldeans--Catholics originating mainly \nfrom Iraq--settled in large numbers in Detroit along with other \nimmigrants from the Middle East. Mike was deeply proud of his Chaldean \nheritage. He helped found the Chaldean Iraqi Association of Michigan, \nand chaired the Chaldean Federation of America. He helped hundreds of \nChaldean-owned businesses to grow. And as religious minorities came \nunder increasing persecution in the Middle East, he became a leader in \nhelping to settle endangered Iraqi Christians in the United States.\n  Mike didn't just serve the Chaldean community. He was passionately \ncommitted to Detroit and its rebirth. He served on countless charitable \nfoundation boards and supported a host of worthy causes.\n  Mike George was a walking, talking personification of the American \nDream. He was a friend to the city of Detroit. He was a friend to me. \nBarbara and I join Mike's legion of friends in Michigan and around the \ncountry extending our condolences to his wife Najat, and his family and \nfriends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4149-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4149-S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ROY BAHR\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I wish to commemorate the \nservice of a patriot and decorated Soldier, COL Roy W. Bahr. Roy joined \nthe U.S. Army in 1950 after the onset of the Korean War. Shortly after \ngraduating from Officer Candidate School, he deployed to Korea and \nserved as an infantry platoon leader. Following his deployment, Colonel \nBahr volunteered for U.S. Army Special Forces and went on to serve with \nthe 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) in Vietnam. There, he was \nassigned as the commander of Forward Operating Base 3, Khe Sanh, \nleading elements of Military Assistance Command Vietnam--Studies and \nObservations Group, MACVSOG.\n  MACVSOG was tasked with conducting highly classified operations \nthroughout Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war. This highly decorated \nunit was responsible for gathering critical intelligence throughout the \nconflict and was so effective that the North Vietnamese had to divert \ntens of thousands of troops in an attempt to counter MACVSOG \noperations. Consequently, MACVSOG's casualty rates were higher than any \nAmerican unit since the American Civil War.\n  Only the best and most highly skilled commanders were involved with \nMACVSOG. During Colonel Bahr's time with MACVSOG, he commanded forward \noperating bases at Phu Bai, Kontum, and Khe Sanh. Colonel Bahr was \nresponsible for dozens of reconnaissance teams and special reaction \nforces that often worked clandestinely in enemy occupied territory with \nlimited support. It is difficult to fully articulate the risk incurred \nby Colonel Bahr and his men, or the difficulty of their missions, as \nthey heroically served our Nation.\n  Colonel Bahr commanded MACVSOG, FOB-3 during the height of the siege \nat Khe Sanh in 1968. Under constant bombardment, Colonel Bahr's \nreconnaissance teams were given full authority to operate outside the \ncompound during what would become one of the largest battles of the \nVietnam war. Colonel Bahr's unit, in concert with a large contingent of \nU.S. Marines, fought to prevent the North Vietnamese units from \noverrunning the combat base at Khe Sanh.\n  Later in the conflict, Colonel Bahr organized and led a force to \nrelieve an American operating base at Da Nang after it came under \nassault by North Vietnamese sappers on August 22 and 23, 1968. The \nNorth Vietnamese attack on Da Nang was the single deadliest day for \nU.S. Army Special Forces during the war. Colonel Bahr's relief effort \nand subsequent pursuit of remaining enemy personnel was critical in \ngaining full control of the base and saving American lives.\n  In early 1961, while visiting Fort Bragg, President Kennedy stated, \n``The Green Beret is a symbol of excellence, a badge of courage, a mark \nof distinction in the fight for freedom.'' COL\n\n[[Page S4150]]\n\nRoy W. Bahr's devotion to duty and professional leadership as a \ncommander, a warrior and a Green Beret exemplifies this mark of \ndistinction. Roy's life is testament to the highest attributes of \nAmerican service, individual bravery, and patriotism, and I am glad to \nhave this opportunity to thank him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4150-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO HUGH McVEY\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I wish to congratulate Hugh \nMcVey on his retirement and to thank him for his many years of \nleadership and service to the field of labor. For over 40 years, Hugh \nhas been a champion of workers' rights and has fought tirelessly to \nimprove the lives of Missouri's workers and their families. It is my \npleasure to honor him today.\n  A native of St. Louis, MO, Hugh comes from a working family of 11 \nchildren. His family's strong labor background encouraged him to get \ninvolved. His uncle Duke was president of the Missouri AFL-CIO for many \nyears until Hugh succeeded him in 1999. Hugh considered his father and \nuncle his closest friends and respected their advice and support.\n  Hugh attended Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. While there, \nhe became involved with the operating engineers and was the group \nsteward and later chief steward for Local 148 out of Collinsville, IL. \nHe then became the business agent and assistant business manager for \nthe same local.\n  After his time with the operating engineers, McVey worked for Union \nElectric, now Ameren, for 23 years and joined Operating Engineers Local \n1148 in 1974. In 1997, Hugh relocated to Jefferson City, when he was \nelected executive vice president of the Missouri AFL-CIO. In 1999, he \nwas elected President, and served for 17 years before his retirement \nthis July.\n  During Hugh's tenure as president of the Missouri AFL-CIO, the \norganization was instrumental in advocating for the union rights \nExecutive order, the Affordable Care Act, and the ``Made in Missouri'' \njobs package. Hugh's effective leadership shaped the Missouri AFL-CIO \ninto the outstanding organization it is today. As president, Hugh \ncontinued to attend local meetings and listened to workers' concerns. \nHe effectively recruited candidates for local offices and worked with \nlegislators on pending legislation that would impact the worker. Hugh \nconsiders the labor movement his life's work, never a job. Hugh is \ncompletely dedicated to ensuring that workers get a fair day's pay and \nreasonable benefits. His passion to help working families is \nunparalleled.\n  Hugh and his wife Peggy have three daughters: Megan, Maureen, and \nColleen. I know they will enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with \nhim.\n  It is my pleasure to honor my friend Hugh McVey today. His dedicated \nleadership has improved the quality of the workplace for Missourians. \nHe has touched the lives of many, and improved the quality of our \ncommunity at large.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and honoring Hugh \nMcVey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4150-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING HERMAN DILLON, SR.\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I wish to honor Mr. Herman \nDillon, Sr., who passed away on Friday, May 23, 2014. Mr. Dillon, \nSenior was the tribal council chairman of the Puyallup Tribe of Indians \nin my home State of Washington and at the time of his passing had \ndedicated an astounding 35 years to the tribal council.\n  Mr. Dillon, Senior served his tribe and his country throughout his \nlife. He joined the Navy Reserves at 17, at the tail end of World War \nII. Following 4 years in the Navy Reserves, he was drafted by the Army \nand served for 2 years guarding the port and prisoner of war camps in \nPuson during the Korean war. Of course, his life of service did not end \nthere, and he was first elected to the Puyallup Tribal Council in 1971. \nIn the time since he was first elected to the tribal council, Mr. \nDillon, Senior experienced a number of historical changes. He saw his \nfellow tribal members get arrested for exercising their treaty-\nprotected right to fish in the Puyallup River, and on February 12, \n1974, Judge Boldt of the U.S. District Court for the Western District \nof Washington issued a decision affirming the rights of Washington \ntreaty tribes to take up to half of the harvestable fish in Washington \nState fishing waters. Of course, he also served on the tribal council \nas the tribe experienced a time of great economic development and \ndiversification of their business interests in an effort to set \nthemselves on a path to economic sustainability.\n  I had the pleasure of working with Mr. Dillon, Senior throughout my \ntime in the Senate. I was always impressed by his leadership, \nintegrity, and dedication to the Puyallup people. He was their champion \non issues from health care to the construction of a new tribal justice \ncenter. He also led by example, earning his GED when he was 50 years \nold and fostering children in his home. Even into his ninth decade of \nlife, Mr. Dillon, Senior continued to advocate for his tribal community \nand was dedicated to solutions that would help his Tribe better \nthemselves.\n  Washington State and our country lost a great tribal leader in May, \nand I am grateful I had the opportunity to work with Mr. Dillon, Senior \nand advocate on the Puyallup Tribe's behalf in Washington, DC. My \nthoughts are with Darlene Dillon, Mr. Dillon, Senior's, wife of over 40 \nyears, his 12 children, the children whose lives he changed through \nfostering, his entire extended family, and the Puyallup Tribe of \nIndians. We are all better for having known him and will work to carry \nhis legacy forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4150-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO EMMA-SUE ISHOL\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Madam President, I wish to recognize the remarkable \nwork of the Warriors and Quiet Waters Foundation.\n  Located in Bozeman, MT, the Warriors and Quiet Waters Foundation \nhelps reintegrate combat-injured veterans and active servicemembers \nupon their return from deployment through fly fishing and other high-\nquality therapeutic recreation throughout Southwest Montana.\n  As the Senate's only Iraq war combat veteran, I know firsthand the \ncost of war. Men and women who were injured in combat pay a price for \nthe rest of their lives. Our Nation must now heal a new generation of \nAmerican heroes that carry with them wounds that are both visible and \ninvisible.\n  As a nation, we took our citizens and turned them into the best \nwarriors the world has ever seen. Now, it is time we take those \nwarriors and turn them back into citizens.\n  In 2007, the Warriors and Quiet Waters Foundation left shore with 14 \nwounded veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to drop a line in \none of Montana's pristine rivers.\n  The goal was to build hope, facilitate camaraderie, and find serenity \nthrough fly fishing. That is exactly what they accomplished.\n  Commanded by retired Marine Col. Eric Hastings and Dr. Volney Steele, \nWarriors and Quiet Waters has provided over 300 veterans and their \nspouses a fly fishing experience complete with world-class guides on \nsome of our Nation's blue ribbon streams.\n  But, the mission is not complete.\n  More than 50,000 American servicemembers have been injured in combat \nover the past 13 years, and thousands more suffer from post-traumatic \nstress and traumatic brain injuries as a result of their service to our \nNation.\n  The Warriors and Quiet Waters Foundation has identified a model for \nthe difficult reintegration process that so many of our young veterans \nwill be going through as a result of a decade of war.\n  Their commitment to those who served so bravely on our behalf is more \nthan commendable--it is inspiring and is a strong example of how we can \nfulfill our Nation's responsibility to those who have served.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4151-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4151-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4151-4", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on June 25, 2014, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker had signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1681.

A bill to provide legal certainty to property owners along \nthe Red River in Texas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Red River Private Property \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) In 1923, the Supreme Court found the border between \n     Texas and Oklahoma to be: ``the water-washed and relatively \n     permanent elevation or acclivity at the outer line of the \n     river bed which separates the bed from the adjacent upland, \n     whether valley or hill, and serves to confine the waters \n     within the bed and to preserve the course of the river, and \n     that the boundary intended is on and along the bank at the \n     average or mean level attained by the waters in the periods \n     when they reach and wash the bank without overflowing it. \n     When we speak of the bed, we include all of the area which is \n     kept practically bare of vegetation by the wash of the waters \n     of the river from year to year in their onward course, \n     although parts of it are left dry for months at a time, and \n     we exclude the lateral valleys, which have the \n     characteristics of relatively fast land and usually are \n     covered by upland grasses and vegetation, although \n     temporarily overflowed in exceptional instances when the \n     river is at flood.''.\n       (2) This would become known as the ``gradient boundary''.\n       (3) This decision makes clear that, absent water that is \n     physically touching the bank, the high bluff or ``ancient \n     bank'' along the southern edge of the Red River is not the \n     boundary between Texas and Oklahoma.\n       (4) In 2000, Public Law 106-288 ratified the Red River \n     Boundary Compact agreed to and signed into State law by Texas \n     and Oklahoma that sets the boundary between the States to be \n     the vegetation line on the south bank of the Red River, \n     except for the Texoma area where the boundary is established \n     pursuant to procedures provided for in the Compact.\n       (5) Therefore, the Bureau of Land Management should have no \n     claim to land that is either south of the ``gradient \n     boundary'' established by the Supreme Court or south of the \n     vegetation line on the southern bank of the Red River \n     pursuant to Public Law 106-288 whereby landowners have proof \n     of their right, title, and interest to the land and have been \n     paying property taxes accordingly.\n\n     SEC. 3. ISSUANCE OF QUIT CLAIM DEEDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall relinquish and shall \n     transfer by quit claim deed all right, title, and interest of \n     the United States in and to Red River lands to any claimant \n     who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that \n     official county or State records indicate that the claimant \n     holds all right, title, and interest to those lands.\n       (b) Public Notification.--The Secretary shall publish in \n     the Federal Register and on official and appropriate Web \n     sites the process to receive written and/or electronic \n     submissions of the documents required under subsection (a). \n     The Secretary shall treat all proper notifications received \n     from the claimant as fulfilling the satisfaction requirements \n     under subsection (a).\n       (c) Standard of Approval.--The Secretary shall accept all \n     official county and State records as filed in the county on \n     the date of submission proving right, title, and interest.\n       (d) Time Period for Approval or Disapproval of Request.--\n     The Secretary shall approve or disapprove a request for a \n     quit claim deed under subsection (a) not later than 120 days \n     after the date on which the written request is received by \n     the Secretary. If the Secretary fails to approve or \n     disapprove such a request by the end of such 120-day period, \n     the request shall be deemed to be approved.\n\n     SEC. 4. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN.\n\n       The Secretary shall ensure that no parcels of Red River \n     lands are treated as Federal land for the purpose of any \n     resource management plan until the Secretary has ensured that \n     such parcels are not subject to transfer under section 3.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For the purposes of this Act--\n       (1) the term ``Red River lands'' means lands along the \n     approximately 539-mile stretch of the Red River between the \n     States of Texas and Oklahoma; and\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n     Interior, acting through the Director of Bureau of Land \n     Management.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Reed, Ms. Warren, Ms. \n        Baldwin, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 2540.

A bill to establish the Railroad Emergency Services \nPreparedness, Operational Needs, and Safety Evaluation (RESPONSE) \nSubcommittee under the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National \nAdvisory Council to provide recommendations on emergency responder \ntraining and resources relating to hazardous materials incidents \ninvolving railroads, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, on December 30, 2013, outside of \nCasselton, ND, a train carrying crude oil derailed setting off a series \nof explosions and fire. The first on the scene that day were our local \nfirst responders from the Casselton Fire Department, a small volunteer \ndepartment.\n  Whether floods, tornados, accidents, or man-made incidents, our local \nfirst responders are on the front line and we need to make sure they \nare trained and prepared to handle anything that may come their way and \nthat they have the equipment necessary to do their jobs effectively and \nefficiently. The incident in Casselton and others across the country \nhave shined a bright light on the need to make sure our local first \nresponders are prepared specifically for emerging threats and hazards.\n  Only a few short years ago, trains carried very little crude. And \nwhen crude was carried by rail, it was in relatively small amounts \nmixed in with a variety of other commodities and container shipments. \nSince that time, our country has experienced impressive economic growth \nin the oil industry, but with that important growth we have seen an \nexponential increase in shipments of crude by rail. According to the \nAssociation of American Railroads, the number of carloads carrying \ncrude oil on major freight railroads in the U.S. grew by more than \n6,000 percent between 2008 and 2013. Now, we are seeing entire trains \nof linked tanker cars carrying more than half a million barrels of \ncrude to market.\n  As we witnessed in Casselton, had the first responders not had the \ntraining they did, this disaster could have been much worse. It's \nimportant that our local first responders have access to training to \nprepare them for these emerging threats and hazards. Traffic continues \nto increase on our rail system, and we must make sure local first \nresponders in our communities are equipped to respond quickly and \nappropriately.\n  To improve first responder training, I am introducing the RESPONSE \nAct to bring together relevant agencies, emergency responders, \ntechnical experts and the private sector under FEMA's National Advisory \nCouncil to review the training, resources, best practices and unmet \nneeds on emergency response to railroad hazmat incidents, including \ncrude oil transport. This group would be tasked with reviewing current \ntraining, funding, existing emergency response plans and providing \nrecommendations on steps to enhance emergency responder training and \nimprove the allocation of resources to meet the needs.\n  Our local first responders are on the front lines and will be the \nfirst to respond in an emergency. We need to make sure they are \nequipped with the knowledge and training to protect our communities. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Nelson, Mrs. \n        McCaskill, Mr. Levin, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Franken, Mr. Brown, Ms. \n        Baldwin, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Markey, Mr. Merkley, \n        Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Schatz, Ms. Warren, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2548. A bill to require the Commodity Futures Trading commission \nto take certain emergency action to eliminate excessive speculation in \nenergy markets; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as we are about to begin the Fourth of \nJuly district work period in my State and throughout this country, many \npeople are going to be getting into their automobiles and they are \ngoing to be traveling. In general, people who live in rural States such \nas Vermont don't have the option of getting on a subway. They don't \nhave the option of getting on a bus to get to work. They use their \nautomobile. In Vermont and all across this country, people who are \ndriving have noticed that the price of gasoline at the pump has soared \nand is today much higher than it used to be.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, the national \naverage retail price for regular unleaded gasoline is $3.70 a gallon--\nthe highest price for this time of year since 2008. According to the \nAAA, drivers in three States have paid over $4 a gallon at the pump for \nmore than a month, and those States are Hawaii, California, and Alaska. \nIn my home State of Vermont, the current average for a gallon of gas is \nabout $3.73.\n  When the price of gasoline goes up, a lot of people get hurt and the \neconomy gets impacted. But mostly it affects working people who have no \nother option but traveling by car, and many of\n\n[[Page S4159]]\n\nthese workers are making $10, $12, $15 an hour; and many of these \nworkers have seen declines in their wages in recent years. Yet, in \norder to get to work to make a living, they have to get in the car and \nthey have no choice but to pay soaring gas prices.\n  While gas prices are soaring, people should not be shocked or will \nnot be shocked to know that the big oil companies, which have racked up \n$1.2 trillion in profits since 2001, are now telling us that the reason \ngas prices are going up is because of the volatile situation in Iraq. \nThat is why suddenly gas prices have gone up--because of the conflict \nin Iraq.\n  The American people are sick and tired of hearing from the big oil \ncompanies using every excuse they possibly can. If it is snowing, the \nprice of gas goes up. If there is conflict in the Middle East, the \nprice of gas goes up. If it is raining, if it is sunny, if it is \nsomebody's birthday, the price of gas goes up. Interestingly enough, we \ndon't see that same logic when the price of gas should be going down, \nbut it always seems to be going up. Meanwhile, the five biggest oil \ncompanies in America--again, not too surprisingly--continue to make \nhuge profits. During the first quarter of this year, ExxonMobil made a \nprofit of $9.1 billion--the first quarter; Shell made $7.3 billion, \nChevron made $4.5 billion, and ConocoPhillips made $2.1 billion. The \nprice of gas at the pump soars and the major oil companies make huge \nprofits.\n  Last year, these five major oil companies--ExxonMobil, Shell, \nChevron, ConocoPhillips--made $93 billion in profits. ExxonMobil alone \nmade nearly $33 billion in profits in 2013.\n  So in the State of Vermont and all over this country, working people \nare seeing, in many cases, declines in their wages. Yet they have to \nget to work. Meanwhile, the price of oil, the price of gas soars, and \nthe oil companies make out like bandits.\n  Here is the interesting point: When I was in high school--and I \nsuspect kids all over the country are still being taught this--we \nlearned about a theory called supply and demand. What supply and demand \nis about is when there is a lot of supply and limited demand, prices go \ndown. When there is limited supply and a lot of demand, prices go up.\n  Well, guess what. To nobody's surprise, that is not the way it works \nin the oil industry. Today, there is more supply and less demand for \ngasoline than there was 5 years ago when the average price of a gallon \nof gas was just $2.69 a gallon. So let me repeat that. More supply, \nless demand, and today the price of a gallon of gas is $3.70 a gallon, \nbut 5 years ago it was $2.69 a gallon. Where is the logic of supply and \ndemand? Where is that process?\n  According to the EIA, there has been a 9 million barrel increase in \nthe supply of gasoline over the past 5 years--a 9 million barrel \nincrease. Since 2009, the United States has increased gasoline supplies \nby 4.3 percent. Supply has gone up. What about demand? According to the \nEIA, the United States is consuming 96,000 fewer barrels of gasoline \nthan it did in 2009--a 1-percent drop in demand compared to 5 years \nago. If the supply and demand theory were true, gasoline prices would \nbe a bit lower--a bit lower--than they were 5 years ago--somewhere \nperhaps in the neighborhood of $2.69 a gallon. Instead, despite the \nincrease in supply, despite the lowering of demand, the average price \nfor a gallon of gas in the United States has gone up by nearly 38 \npercent over the last 5 years, from $2.69 a gallon to $3.70 a gallon. \nLet me repeat. Since 2009 the supply of gasoline has gone up by more \nthan 4 percent and demand for gasoline has gone down by 1 percent. Yet \nprices at the pump are up by nearly 38 percent.\n  People say: We need more oil, we need more gas. It doesn't matter--\nsupply up, demand down, prices of gas at the pump soaring.\n  The truth is the high gasoline prices have less to do with supply and \ndemand and more to do with Wall Street speculators driving prices up in \nthe energy futures market. Over a decade ago, speculators only \ncontrolled about 30 to 40 percent of the oil futures market. Today, \nWall Street speculators control about 80 percent of this market. Let me \nrepeat. Wall Street speculators control about 80 percent of the oil \nfutures market, even though many of them will never use a drop of the \noil. People think that when people own oil on the oil futures market, \nthey actually own it because they are going to use it. Maybe it is the \nairline industry; maybe it is the trucking industry; maybe it is oil \nfuel dealers. Wrong. The oil futures market is controlled by \nspeculators who never use the end product and whose only goal in life \nis to drive prices up to make a huge profit, and that is exactly what \nthey do.\n  We, as the elected officials of this country, who are presumably \nrepresenting working families around America, have a responsibility to \ndo everything we can to make sure the price of gasoline at the pump is \nbased on the fundamentals of supply and demand and not Wall Street \ngreed. That is why I am introducing legislation today to require the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission to use all of its authority, \nincluding its emergency powers, to eliminate excessive oil speculation.\n  This bill is cosponsored by Senators Levin, Nelson, Blumenthal, \nMcCaskill, Franken, Brown, Cardin, Baldwin, Whitehouse, Markey, \nKlobuchar, Shaheen, Merkley, and Hirono. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro is \nintroducing the companion bill in the House. I thank all of these \nMembers for their support.\n  Our legislation, the Energy Markets Emergency Act, is identical to \nbipartisan legislation that overwhelmingly passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 402 to 19 during a similar crisis in June \nof 2008.\n  Specifically, our bill directs the CFTC to do the following within 14 \ndays of enactment:\n  No. 1: Immediately curb the role of excessive speculation in any \ncontract market within the jurisdiction and control of the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, on or through which energy futures or swaps \nare traded.\n  No. 2: Eliminate excessive speculation, price distortion, sudden or \nunreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in prices or other \nunlawful activity that is causing major market disturbances that \nprevent gasoline and oil prices from accurately reflecting the forces \nof supply and demand.\n  There is now a growing consensus--this is not just the opinion of \nBernie Sanders--there is a growing consensus that excessive speculation \non the oil futures market is significantly contributing to the high \nprices the American people are seeing at the pump.\n  ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, the IMF, the St. Louis Federal Reserve, \nthe American Trucking Association, Delta Airlines, the Petroleum \nMarketers Association of America, the New England Fuel Institute, the \nConsumer Federation of America, and many other organizations have all \nagreed that excessive oil speculation has significantly increased oil \nand gas prices.\n  Just a few years ago, Goldman Sachs--perhaps the largest speculator \non Wall Street--came out with a report indicating that excessive oil \nspeculation is costing Americans 56 cents a gallon at the pump--56 \ncents a gallon. I personally think that is a conservative estimate, but \nit is interesting that it comes from Goldman Sachs itself.\n  The CEO--and what can we say--the CEO of ExxonMobil has testified in \nthe past that he believes excessive speculation has contributed as much \nas 40 percent to the price of a barrel of oil.\n  So what you are hearing is some of the Wall Street people--in a rare \nmoment of honesty--acknowledging the impact of speculation. You are \nhearing the head of the largest oil company in America acknowledging \nthe impact of speculation on gas prices. I think we do not need a whole \nlot of evidence to suggest this is a serious problem.\n  Three years ago my office obtained confidential information about how \nmuch Wall Street speculators were trading in the oil futures market on \njust one day--and that day was June 30, 2008--when the price of oil was \nover $140 a barrel and gas prices were over $4 a gallon. Here is what \nsome of the biggest oil speculators were doing back then, on just one \nday of trading: June 30, 2008. This goes on every day. One day: Goldman \nSachs bought and sold over 863 million barrels of oil, Morgan Stanley \nbought and sold over 632 million barrels of oil, Bank of America bought \nand sold over 112 million barrels of oil, Lehman Brothers--obviously \nnow bankrupt--bought and sold over 300 million barrels of oil, Merrill\n\n[[Page S4160]]\n\nLynch--bought by Bank of America--bought and sold over 240 million \nbarrels of oil.\n  The only reason these firms were betting on the price of oil was to \nspeculate and to make money. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, they do \nnot use oil. Their only function in this process is speculation, \ndriving up prices and making huge profits.\n  The rise in oil and gasoline prices was entirely avoidable. The Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act required the CFTC \nto impose strict limits on the amount of oil that Wall Street \nspeculators could trade in the energy futures market by January 17, \n2011--over 3\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  Unfortunately, the CFTC has been unable to implement position limits \ndue to opposition from Wall Street and a ruling by the DC Circuit \nCourt. This is simply unacceptable. Millions and millions of Americans \nwho are filling up their gas tanks today are disgusted. They know they \nare being ripped off, and they want us to protect their needs. The time \nis now to provide the American people relief at the gas pump before the \nsituation gets even worse.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 2557. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to provide for State accountability in the provision of access \nto the core resources for learning, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Core \nOpportunity Resources for Equity and Excellence Act with my colleague \nSenator Brown. I would also like to thank Representatives Fudge, \nHinojosa, and Frederica Wilson for introducing companion legislation in \nthe House of Representatives. Our accountability systems in education \nshould help us measure our progress towards equity and excellence. The \nCORE Act will help advance that goal by requiring States to include \nfair and equitable access to the core resources for learning in their \naccountability systems.\n  Sixty years after the landmark decision of Brown v. Board of \nEducation, one of the great challenges still facing this Nation is \nstemming the tide of rising inequality. We have seen the rich get \nricher while middle class and low-income families have lost ground. We \nsee disparities in opportunity starting at birth and growing over a \nlifetime. With more than one in five school-aged children living in \nfamilies in poverty, according to Department of Education statistics, \nwe cannot afford nor should we tolerate a public education system that \nsteers resources and opportunities away from the children who need them \nthe most.\n  We should look to hold our education system accountable for results \nand resources. We know that resources matter. A recent study by \nscholars at Northwestern University and UC Berkeley found that \nincreasing per pupil spending by 20 percent for low-income students \nover the course of their K-12 schooling results in greater high school \ncompletion, higher levels of educational attainment, increased lifetime \nearnings, and reduced adult poverty.\n  The recent Office of Civil Rights survey points to some gaps that we \nneed to address, including that Black, Latino, American Indian, Native \nAlaskan students, and English learners attend schools with higher \nconcentrations of inexperienced teachers; nationwide, one in five high \nschools lacks a school counselor; and between 10 and 25 percent of high \nschools across the nation do not offer more than one of the core \ncourses in the typical sequence of high school math and science, such \nas Algebra I and II, geometry, biology, and chemistry.\n  The CORE Act will require State accountability plans and State and \ndistrict report cards to include measures on how well the State and \ndistricts provide the core resources for learning to their students. \nThese resources include: high quality instructional teams, including \nlicensed and profession-ready teachers, principals, school librarians, \ncounselors, and education support staff;\n  Rigorous academic standards and curricula that lead to college and \ncareer readiness by high school graduation and are accessible to all \nstudents, including students with disabilities and English learners; \nequitable and instructionally appropriate class sizes; up-to-date \ninstructional materials, technology, and supplies; effective school \nlibrary programs; school facilities and technology, including \nphysically and environmentally sound buildings and well-equipped \ninstructions space, including laboratories and libraries; specialized \ninstructional support teams, such as counselors, social workers, \nnurses, and other qualified professionals; and effective family and \ncommunity engagements programs.\n  These are things that parents in well-resourced communities expect \nand demand. We should do no less for children in economically \ndisadvantaged communities. We should do no less for minority students \nor English learners or students with disabilities.\n  Under the CORE Act, states that fail to make progress on resource \nequity would not be eligible to apply for competitive grants authorized \nunder the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. For school districts \nidentified for improvement, the state would have to identify gaps in \naccess to the core resources for learning and develop an action plan in \npartnership with the local school district to address those gaps.\n  The CORE Act is supported by a diverse group of organizations, \nincluding the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education, \nAmerican Federation of Teachers, American Library Association, First \nFocus Campaign for Children, League of United Latin American Citizens, \nNational Education Association, Opportunity Action, and the Coalition \nfor Community Schools. Working with this strong group of advocates and \nmy colleagues in the Senate and in the House, it is my hope that we can \nbuild the support to include the CORE Act in the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. I urge my colleagues to join us \nby cosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (by request):\n  S. 2560. A bill to authorize the United States Fish and Wildlife \nService to seek compensation for injuries to trust resources and use \nthose funds to restore, replace, or acquire equivalent resources, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a bill I am \nintroducing that will provide the Department of Interior the necessary \nand appropriate authority to seek compensation from responsible parties \nwho cause injury to public resources managed by the United States Fish \nand Wildlife Service like National Wildlife Refuges, National Fish \nHatcheries, and other Service facilities. The proposal would allow the \nUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service, USFWS, to recover costs for \nassessing injury and to restore, replace, or acquire equivalent \nresources without further Congressional appropriations. The National \nPark Service, NPS, under the Park System Resource Protection Act \nPSRPA--16 U.S.C. 19jj, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, NMSA--\n16 U.S.C. 1431, currently have similar authorities and its time USWFS \nwere afforded this authority as well.\n  The Service Resource Protection Act, RPA, would enhance the \nprotection and restoration of USFWS resources found on National \nWildlife Refuges, National Fish Hatcheries and other Service lands, \nshould injury or harm occur. The RPA is a proposed statute that \nspecifically protects all living and non-living resources within \nService lands and waters. Any funds collected to compensate for injury \nor destruction of Service resources would be used to rectify that \nspecific harm without further Congressional appropriation. Under this \nauthority, damages could be used to reimburse assessment costs; prevent \nor minimize resource loss; abate or minimize the risk of loss; monitor \nongoing effects, and/or restore, replace, or acquire resources \nequivalent to those injured or destroyed.\n  Currently, USFWS Service manages more than 150 million acres of \nNational Wildlife Refuge lands and 71 National Fish Hatcheries. The sum \nof USFWS's acres is greater than those lands and water resources \nmanaged by the NPS\n\n[[Page S4161]]\n\nand NOAA combined. USFWS has significant land based management \nresponsibilities that are quite different from NOAA, in addition to \nmarine and estuarine areas USFWS manages. Compared to National Parks, \nRefuges allow for a broader range of activities--such as hunting, \nfishing, and wildlife dependent activities. The large size of the \nUSFWS's resource portfolio and the unique and varied stressors on these \nresources makes it imperative that the USFWS have the appropriate \nauthority to seek damages from responsible parties who degrade or \ndestroy USFWS resources and property.\n  Unlike NPS and NOAA, USFWS does not have the authority to recover \ndamages, e.g., monetary compensation, from responsible parties to \nassess and restore injured resources without prior Congressional \nappropriation. Today, when Service resources are damaged or destroyed, \nthe costs for repair and restoration of these resources falls upon the \nappropriated budget for the affected Refuge, often at the expense of \nother Refuge programs. Competing priorities can leave Service resources \nlanguishing until the refuge obtains appropriations from Congress to \naddress the injury. This may result in more intensive injuries, higher \ncosts, and long-term degradation of publicly-owned Service resources.\n  When bad actors harm public resources managed by USFWS the \nresponsibility for remedying the problems caused by bad actors should \nnot fall to the taxpayer to solve. More over the fact that currently to \nrepair damages to USFWS resources may require earmarks in the budget to \nensure these problems are resolved is doubly unfair in that such budget \nrequirements take resources away from other worthwhile projects that \nare unrelated to fixing the problems caused by irresponsible actors. It \nis patently unfair for taxpayers to shoulder the burden of solving the \nmistakes and negligence of others. The public expects that Refuge \nresources--and the broad range of activities they support--will be \navailable for future generations. Our bill ensures that persons \nresponsible for harm, not taxpayers, should pay for any injury they \ncause.\n  While the Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration program \nestablished under the Oil Pollution Act and CERCLA establishes a unique \nprocess for the USFWS to seek damages in limited circumstances \ninvolving oil spills and or the release of hazardous substances. These \nlaws do not apply to situations when toxics materials and regular solid \nwaste are dumped on or near a refuge that are not formally defined as \nhazardous substances and the USFWS is not authorized to recover funds \nto address injury from the responsible party in these situations under \nexisting statute. Additionally, for injuries caused by actions or \nmechanisms other than a `spill' of oil or release of a hazardous \nsubstance, such as illegal cutting of vegetation, destruction or \nvandalism of real property and facilities, e.g., kiosks, visitor \ncenters, fire and abandoned debris, the USFWS has no statutory \nmechanism to recover costs for assessing and restoring the public's \nresources. In contrast, NPS and NOAA have statutory authority to \nrecover civil damages for these types of injuries, and the funds go to \nthe agencies for assessment and restoration.\n  USFWS manages 556 National Wildlife Refuges and 38 Wetland Management \nDistricts, covering over 150 million acres, and accounting for 25 \npercent of public lands and waters managed by the Department of the \nInterior. The agency is also responsible for 71 National Fish \nHatcheries and a National Conservation Training Center, which would \nalso be covered by the proposed legislation. Management of the Refuge \nSystem prioritizes wildlife conservation and habitat management, but \nencourages the American public to enjoy the benefits of these lands. In \nthe organic legislation, the National Wildlife Refuge System \nImprovement Act of 1997, activities such as hunting, fishing, \nphotography, wildlife observation, environmental education and \ninterpretation were identified as priority public uses on Refuges.\n  Found in every U.S. State and territory, and within an hour's drive \nof most metropolitan areas, National Wildlife Refuges: attract \napproximately 45 million visitors each year; protect clean air and safe \ndrinking water for nearby communities; protect more than 700 bird \nspecies, 220 mammals, 250 reptiles and amphibians, and 1,000 fish \nspecies; offers hunting on 322 refuges and fishing on 272 refuges; and \ngenerates more than $1.7 billion for local economies, creates nearly \n27,000 U.S. jobs annually, provides $543 million in employment income, \nand adds more than $185 million in tax revenue.\n  The fiscal year 2014 appropriated budget for the Refuge System is \napproximately $72 million dollars, but it is estimated that the current \noperations and maintenance, O, backlog tops $3 billion dollars. The \nNational Fish Hatchery System has a backlog in excess of $300 million. \nBecause the Service does not have statutory authority to pursue \nrecovery of damages from responsible parties, the cost of replacing or \nrestoring injured Refuge or Hatchery resources typically gets included \nin the O project list, and requires tax-payer funding to fix. This \nlegislation would allow the Service to recover damages directly from \nthe person or persons that harmed the resource, thus removing this \nadditional financial burden from taxpayers.\n  The legislation is not intended to generate revenue for the Service; \ninstead, it aims to be budget neutral. Any funds collected to \ncompensate for resource injuries will be used to rectify that specific \ninjury without the need for Congressional appropriation. Under this \nauthority, damages would be required to reimburse assessment costs; \nprevent or minimize resource loss; abate or minimize the risk of loss; \nmonitor ongoing effects, and/or restore, replace, or acquire resources \nequivalent to those injured or destroyed.\n  By way of example, NPS has recovered damages on cases ranging from \n$125.00--$10 million dollars for assessment and restoration of injuries \nto resources on their lands. However, a direct comparison between USFWS \nand NPS is of limited value, since the two agencies have dissimilar \nmissions and allow for different activities on their lands. The Refuge \nand Hatchery systems also manage many more individual land units and \ntwice the acreage of the NPS.\n  USFWS administers several laws, such as the Migratory Bird Treaty \nAct, that provide for penalties and fees as part of civil or criminal \nproceedings. The RPA is a civil authority that would allow the Service \nto recover compensation in the form of monetary damages for costs \nassociated with assessment and restoration of injured resources. It is \nintended to make the public whole: it is not meant to be punitive \ntowards the person or persons who caused the injury. As part of the \nAnnual Uniform Crime Report, AUCR, Service Law Enforcement has \nidentified several categories of crimes in which they have prosecuted \nindividuals for criminal violations and received associated fines. \nThese fines are remitted to the U.S. Treasury and do not provide any \nmeans to assess injury or recover restoration costs associated with \nrepairing or replacing resources. The Service has used Tort law to \nrecover damages on occasion, but many of our cases do not meet the \ndollar threshold for pursuing a civil lawsuit by the Department of \nJustice. As a result, even though cases may be criminally prosecuted, \nmost of them are not pursued as a potential civil claim.\n  However, if the Service had RPA authority, we could use a civil \nprocess to recover costs for assessment and restoration. The AUCR \nprovides many examples of areas where the Service could use the civil \nauthority under RPA in conjunction with other criminal procedures. In \n2010, 39 arson offenses were reported on Service lands. Monetary loss \nto the government resulting from these cases totaled almost $850,000, \nbut neither restoration funds, nor repair of the public's resources \nresulted from these prosecutions. Similarly, over 2,300 vandalism \noffenses, totaling $314,000 in monetary loss were documented. Other \nreported offenses number in the thousands and could lead to recovery of \ndamages for many field stations: These include, illegal off-road use \n(n=2,234), trespass (n = 8,163), and other natural resource violations \n(n = 4,628). In these instances, the Service must choose between using \ntax-payer funded, appropriations to pay for assessing, repairing, \nreplacing or restoring structures, habitat and other resources injured \nby the responsible party or for other important Refuge needs.\n\n[[Page S4162]]\n\n  It is time to shed taxpayers' cost burden of repairs and restoration \ndue to damage caused by the unlawful behavior of negligent individuals \nand give the USFWS the authority it need to collect damages from those \nresponsible to do the work to right what's wrong. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 486\n\n       Whereas there is a growing humanitarian crisis along the \n     international border between the United States and Mexico;\n       Whereas the United States welcomes lawful immigrants and \n     has established appropriate channels for the lawful admission \n     of refugees;\n       Whereas, since October 2013, officials in the Department of \n     Homeland Security have apprehended more than 47,000 \n     unaccompanied migrant children after they crossed that border \n     without legal authorization;\n       Whereas the majority of these children have arrived in the \n     United States through the Rio Grande Valley Sector in Texas \n     but the effects of this surge in illegal immigration have \n     been felt across the United States;\n       Whereas this surge in illegal immigration has undermined \n     the ability of the Department of Homeland Security and other \n     law enforcement agencies to protect the United States from \n     criminal and national security threats;\n       Whereas the vast majority of these children have traveled \n     to the United States from countries in Central America, a \n     journey of more than 1,000 miles that traverses some of the \n     most dangerous territory in the Western Hemisphere and \n     smuggling routes operated by drug cartels and other \n     transnational criminal organizations;\n       Whereas these transnational criminal organizations \n     routinely commit acts of human trafficking, sexual assault, \n     exploitation, kidnapping, and homicide against children who \n     are the victims of their human smuggling operations;\n       Whereas children making this journey face other grave \n     dangers such as riding on top of crowded railroad cars, \n     dehydration, heat exposure, and drowning;\n       Whereas it is unknown how many children making this journey \n     have perished or become victims of violent crime while \n     traveling to the United States;\n       Whereas it is the duty of the United States Government to \n     identify and provide humanitarian relief to any unaccompanied \n     migrant child who is--\n           (1) the victim of a crime;\n           (2) a refugee;\n           (3) an asylee; or\n           (4) eligible for any other form of immigration relief \n     under the immigration laws;\n\n       Whereas the current and previous administration, each \n     headed by a President belonging to a different political \n     party, have failed to adequately secure the international \n     border between the United States and Mexico and enforce the \n     immigration laws;\n       Whereas, beginning in 2010, President Obama and the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security announced a series of \n     executive actions, public statements, and enforcement \n     decisions that have created a misperception outside of the \n     United States that children entering the United States \n     without legal authorization will receive relief from \n     immigration enforcement consequences;\n       Whereas these executive actions and the continuing failures \n     of President Obama and the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     adequately secure the international border between the United \n     States and Mexico and enforce the immigration laws are a \n     proximate and material cause of the growing humanitarian \n     crisis along the international border between the United \n     States and Mexico;\n       Whereas the failure of the United States Government to \n     enforce the immigration laws has undermined trust in the \n     commitment of the United States Government to enforcing such \n     laws;\n       Whereas the Senate must do everything in its power to \n     mitigate the growing humanitarian threat along the \n     international border between the United States and Mexico and \n     to prevent additional unaccompanied migrant children from \n     making the dangerous journey to the United States; and\n       Whereas this cannot be accomplished until President Obama \n     has demonstrated to people of the United States that he is \n     serious about stopping this humanitarian crisis and \n     preventing similar crises in the future by enforcing the \n     immigration laws: Now, therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that \n     President Obama should--\n         (1) publicly declare that no deferred action program \n     granting relief from immigration enforcement shall apply to \n     any unaccompanied migrant child who unlawfully enters the \n     United States;\n         (2) publicly discourage people in Central America and \n     elsewhere from sending their children on a dangerous journey \n     through Mexico to the United States;\n         (3) begin fully enforcing the immigration laws;\n         (4) ensure that each State that is affected by the surge \n     in unaccompanied migrant children entering the United States \n     has the resources needed by that State to address this crisis \n     while ensuring that such children are treated humanely; and\n         (5) work with the Government of Mexico and the \n     governments of countries in Central America to improve \n     security along the international borders between Mexico and \n     Guatemala, and Mexico and Belize.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4163-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4163-S4164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 487--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ATTORNEY \n    GENERAL ERIC H.

Res. 487\n\n       Whereas, in February 2010, the Internal Revenue Service \n     (IRS) began targeting conservative nonprofit groups for extra \n     scrutiny in connection with applications for tax-exempt \n     status;\n       Whereas, on May 14, 2013, the Treasury Inspector General \n     for Tax Administration (TIGTA) issued an audit report \n     entitled, ``Inappropriate Criteria Were Used to Identify Tax-\n     Exempt Applications for Review'';\n       Whereas the TIGTA audit report found that from 2010 until \n     2012, the IRS systematically subjected tax-exempt applicants \n     to extra scrutiny based on inappropriate criteria, including \n     use of the phrases ``Tea Party'', ``Patriots'', and ``9/12'';\n       Whereas the TIGTA audit report found that the groups \n     selected for extra scrutiny based on inappropriate criteria \n     were subjected without cause to delays lasting years;\n       Whereas the TIGTA audit report found that the groups \n     selected for extra scrutiny based on inappropriate criteria \n     were subjected to unreasonable and burdensome information \n     requests, including requests for information about donors and \n     political beliefs;\n       Whereas the Exempt Organizations Division within the Tax-\n     Exempt and Government Entities Division of the IRS has \n     jurisdiction over the processing and determination of tax-\n     exempt applications;\n       Whereas, on September 15, 2010, Lois G. Lerner, former \n     Director of the Exempt Organizations Division, initiated a \n     project to examine political activity of organizations \n     described in section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, writing to her colleagues, ``[w]e need to be \n     cautious so it isn't a per se political project'';\n       Whereas, on February 1, 2011, Lois Lerner wrote that the \n     ``Tea Party matter [was] very dangerous'' and ``[t]his could \n     be the vehicle to go to court on the issue of whether \n     Citizen's [sic] United overturning the ban on corporate \n     spending applies to tax exempt rules'';\n       Whereas Lois Lerner ordered the Tea Party tax-exempt \n     applications to proceed through a ``multi-tier review'' \n     involving her senior technical advisor and the IRS Office of \n     Chief Counsel;\n       Whereas Carter Hull, an IRS lawyer and a 48-year veteran of \n     the United States Government, testified that the ``multi-tier \n     review'' was unprecedented in his experience;\n       Whereas, on June 1, 2011, Holly Paz, Director of Rulings \n     and Agreements within the Exempt Organizations Division, \n     requested the tax-exempt application filed by Crossroads \n     Grassroots Policy Strategies for review by Lois Lerner's \n     senior technical advisor;\n       Whereas, on March 22, 2012, Commissioner of Internal \n     Revenue Douglas Shulman was specifically asked about the \n     targeting of Tea Party groups applying for tax-exempt status \n     during a hearing before the Committee on Ways and Means of \n     the House of Representatives, to which he replied, ``I can \n     give you assurances . . . [t]here is absolutely no \n     targeting'';\n       Whereas, on April 26, 2012, Lois Lerner informed the \n     Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of \n     Representatives that information requests were done in ``the \n     ordinary course of the application process'';\n       Whereas prior to the November 2012 election, the IRS \n     provided 31 applications for tax-exempt status to the \n     investigative website ProPublica, all of which were from \n     conservative groups and 9 of which had not yet been approved \n     by the IRS, in spite of a prohibition under Federal law \n     against public disclosure of application materials until \n     after the application has been approved;\n       Whereas the IRS determined, by way of informal, internal \n     review, that 75 percent of the applications for designation \n     as an organization described in section 501(c)(4) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that were set aside for further \n     review were filed by conservative-oriented organizations;\n       Whereas, on January 24, 2013, Lois Lerner wrote, in an \n     email to colleagues, regarding Organizing for Action, a tax-\n     exempt organization formed as an offshoot of the election \n     campaign of President Barack Obama: ``Maybe I can get the DC \n     office job!'';\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2013, Richard Pilger, Director of the \n     Election Crimes Branch of the Public Integrity Section of the \n     Department of Justice, spoke to Lois Lerner about potential \n     prosecution for false statements about political campaign \n     intervention made by tax-exempt applicants;\n       Whereas, on May 10, 2013, in response to a pre-arranged \n     question, Lois Lerner apologized for the targeting of \n     conservative tax-exempt applicants by the IRS during a speech \n     at an event organized by the American Bar Association;\n       Whereas the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives determined that, of the 298 applications \n     delayed and set aside for additional scrutiny by the IRS, 83 \n     percent were from right-leaning organizations;\n       Whereas the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives determined that, as of the May 10, 2013, \n     apology from Lois Lerner, only 45 percent of the right-\n     leaning groups set aside for extra scrutiny had been \n     approved, while 70 percent of left-leaning groups and 100 \n     percent of the groups with ``progressive'' names had been \n     approved;\n       Whereas the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives determined that, of the groups that were \n     inappropriately subject to demands to divulge confidential \n     donors, 89 percent were right-leaning;\n       Whereas, on May 15, 2013, Attorney General Eric H. Holder, \n     Jr. testified before the Committee on the Judiciary of the \n     House of Representatives that the Department of Justice would \n     conduct a ``dispassionate'' investigation into the IRS \n     matter, and ``[t]his will not be about parties . . . this \n     will not be about ideological persuasions . . . anybody who \n     has broken the law will be held accountable'';\n       Whereas, on May 15, 2013, President Barack Obama called the \n     targeting of conservative tax-exempt applicants by the IRS \n     ``inexcusable'' and promised that he would ``not tolerate \n     this kind of behavior in any agency, but especially in the \n     IRS, given the power that it has and the reach that it has \n     into all of our lives'';\n       Whereas Barbara Bosserman, a trial attorney at the \n     Department of Justice who in the past several years has \n     contributed nearly $7,000 to the Democratic National \n     Committee and political campaigns of President Obama, is \n     playing a leading role in the investigation by the Department \n     of Justice;\n       Whereas the Public Integrity Section of the Department of \n     Justice communicated\n\n[[Page S4164]]\n\n     with the IRS about the potential prosecution of tax-exempt \n     applicants;\n       Whereas, on December 5, 2013, President Obama declared in a \n     national television interview that the targeting of \n     conservative tax-exempt applicants by the IRS was caused by a \n     ``bureaucratic'' ``list'' by employees in ``an office in \n     Cincinnati'';\n       Whereas, on April 9, 2014, the Committee on Ways and Means \n     of the House of Representatives referred Lois Lerner to the \n     Department of Justice for criminal prosecution;\n       Whereas the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives found that Lois Lerner used her position to \n     improperly influence agency action against conservative tax-\n     exempt organizations, denying these groups due process and \n     equal protection rights as guaranteed by the United States \n     Constitution, in apparent violation of section 242 of title \n     18, United States Code;\n       Whereas the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives found that Lois Lerner targeted Crossroads \n     Grassroots Policy Strategies while ignoring similar liberal-\n     leaning tax-exempt applicants;\n       Whereas the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives found that Lois Lerner impeded official \n     investigations by knowingly providing misleading statements \n     to TIGTA, in apparent violation of section 1001 of title 18, \n     United States Code;\n       Whereas the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives found that Lois Lerner may have disclosed \n     confidential taxpayer information, in apparent violation of \n     section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;\n       Whereas former Department of Justice officials have \n     testified before a subcommittee of the Committee on Oversight \n     and Government Reform of the House of Representatives that \n     the circumstances of the investigation by the administration \n     of the targeting of conservative tax-exempt applicants by the \n     IRS warrant the appointment of a special counsel;\n       Whereas Department of Justice regulations counsel attorneys \n     to avoid the ``appearance of a conflict of interest likely to \n     affect the public perception of the integrity of the \n     investigation or prosecution'';\n       Whereas, on January 13, 2014, unnamed officials in the \n     Department of Justice leaked to the media that no criminal \n     charges would be appropriate for IRS officials who engaged in \n     the targeting activity, which undermined the integrity of the \n     investigation by the Department of Justice;\n       Whereas, on January 29, 2014, Attorney General Holder told \n     the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, ``I don't think that \n     there is a basis for us to conclude on the information as it \n     presently exists that there is any reason for the appointment \n     of the independent counsel . . . . The notion that somehow \n     this has caused a loss of faith in this Justice Department is \n     inconsistent with the facts'';\n       Whereas, on February 2, 2014, President Obama stated \n     publicly that there was ``not even a smidgen of corruption'' \n     in connection with the IRS targeting activity;\n       Whereas, on April 16, 2014, e-mails between the Department \n     of Justice and the IRS were released showing that the \n     Department of Justice considered prosecuting conservative \n     nonprofit groups for engaging in political activity that is \n     legal under Federal law, which damaged the integrity of the \n     Department of Justice and undermined its investigation;\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2014, the IRS agreed to provide all of \n     Lois Lerner's e-mails to investigators of the Committee on \n     Ways and Means of the House of Representatives;\n       Whereas, on May 14, 2014, e-mails obtained through a \n     request under section 552 of title 5, United States Code \n     (commonly known as the ``Freedom of Information Act'') by the \n     nonprofit group Judicial Watch indicate that the Washington \n     office of the IRS was examining applications for tax-exempt \n     status by Tea Party organizations, which is contrary to \n     claims that the cases were being handled by lower-level \n     workers in Cincinnati;\n       Whereas, on June 11, 2014, James Comey, Director of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), testified to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives \n     that FBI investigators did not examine the IRS database with \n     taxpayer information, which included private taxpayer \n     information that is prohibited from being shared without an \n     order from a judge, and only looked at the table of contents;\n       Whereas, on June 13, 2014, IRS Office of Legislative \n     Affairs Director Leonard Ourlser informed the Committee on \n     Finance of the Senate that the IRS could not produce e-mails \n     from January 2009 through April 2011 from Lois Lerner due to \n     a computer crash;\n       Whereas, on June 17, 2014, the IRS stated that it could not \n     produce e-mails from 6 other IRS employees;\n       Whereas, on June 23, 2014, it was reported that \n     Commissioner of Internal Revenue John Koskinen has \n     contributed approximately $100,000 to Democratic candidates \n     and organizations, including $7,300 to President Obama;\n       Whereas, on June 24, 2014, it was reported that the IRS \n     agreed to pay $50,000 in damages to one of the conservative \n     groups, the National Organization for Marriage, as a result \n     of the unlawful release of confidential information to a \n     political rival of that group;\n       Whereas, on June 25, 2014, according to the Committee on \n     Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, Lois Lerner \n     sought to have Senator Chuck Grassley, a sitting United \n     States Senator and ranking Republican member of the Committee \n     on the Judiciary of the Senate, referred for IRS examination; \n     and\n       Whereas section 600.1 of title 28, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, promulgated under section 515 of title 28, \n     United States Code, requires the Attorney General to appoint \n     a special counsel or prosecutor when it is determined that--\n       (1) a criminal investigation of a person or matter is \n     warranted;\n       (2) investigation or prosecution of that person or matter \n     by a United States Attorney's Office or litigating Division \n     of the Department of Justice would present a conflict of \n     interest for the Department or other extraordinary \n     circumstances; and\n       (3) under the circumstances, it would be in the public \n     interest to appoint an outside special counsel or prosecutor \n     to assume responsibility for the matter: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the statements and actions of the Internal Revenue \n     Service (IRS), the Department of Justice, and the \n     administration of President Barack Obama in connection with \n     the targeting of conservative tax-exempt applicants by the \n     IRS have served to undermine the investigation by the \n     Department of Justice;\n       (2) the efforts of the administration to undermine the \n     investigation by the Department of Justice, and the \n     appointment of Barbara Bosserman, who has donated almost \n     $7,000 to President Obama and the Democratic National \n     Committee, to a lead investigative role, have created a \n     conflict of interest that warrants removal of the \n     investigation from the normal processes of the Department of \n     Justice;\n       (3) further investigation of the matter is warranted due to \n     the apparent criminal activity by Lois Lerner, former \n     Director of the Exempt Organizations Division within the Tax-\n     Exempt and Government Entities Division of the IRS, and the \n     ongoing disclosure of internal communications showing \n     potentially unlawful conduct by executive branch personnel;\n       (4) appointment of a special counsel or prosecutor would be \n     in the public interest, given the conflict of interest for \n     the Department of Justice and the strong public interest in \n     ensuring that public officials who inappropriately target \n     individuals for exercising their right to free expression are \n     held accountable; and\n       (5) Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. should appoint a \n     special counsel or prosecutor, with meaningful independence, \n     to investigate the targeting of conservative nonprofit \n     advocacy groups by the IRS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4164-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4164-S4165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 488--DESIGNATING JULY 26, 2014, AS ``NATIONAL DAY OF \n                         THE AMERICAN COWBOY''\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. \nHoeven, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. \nMerkley, Mr. Risch, Mr. Tester, and Mr. Walsh) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) healthy populations of fish depend on the conservation, \n     protection, restoration, and enhancement of fish habitats in \n     the United States;\n       (2) fish habitats (including wetlands, streams, rivers, \n     lakes, estuaries, and coastal and marine habitats) perform \n     numerous valuable environmental functions that sustain \n     environmental, social, and cultural values, including \n     recycling nutrients, purifying water, attenuating floods, \n     augmenting and maintaining stream flows, recharging ground \n     water, acting as primary producers in the food chain, and \n     providing essential and significant habitat for plants, fish, \n     wildlife, and other dependent species;\n       (3) the extensive and diverse fish habitat resources of the \n     United States are of enormous significance to the economy of \n     the United States, providing--\n       (A) recreation for 60,000,000 anglers;\n       (B) more than 828,000 jobs and approximately \n     $115,000,000,000 in economic impact each year relating to \n     recreational fishing; and\n\n[[Page S4171]]\n\n       (C) approximately 575,000 jobs and an additional \n     $36,000,000,000 in economic impact each year relating to \n     commercial fishing;\n       (4) at least 40 percent of all threatened species and \n     endangered species in the United States are directly \n     dependent on fish habitats;\n       (5) certain fish species are considered to be ecological \n     indicators of fish habitat quality, such that the presence of \n     those species reflects high-quality habitat for fish species;\n       (6) loss and degradation of fish habitat, riparian habitat, \n     water quality, and water volume caused by activities such as \n     alteration of watercourses, stream blockages, water \n     withdrawals and diversions, erosion, pollution, \n     sedimentation, and destruction or modification of wetlands \n     have--\n       (A) caused significant declines in fish populations \n     throughout the United States, especially declines in native \n     fish populations; and\n       (B) resulted in economic losses to the United States;\n       (7)(A) providing for the conservation and sustainability of \n     fish populations has not been fully realized, despite \n     federally funded fish and wildlife restoration programs and \n     other activities intended to conserve fish habitat; and\n       (B) conservation and sustainability may be significantly \n     advanced through a renewed commitment and sustained, \n     cooperative efforts that are complementary to existing fish \n     and wildlife restoration programs and clean water programs;\n       (8) the National Fish Habitat Action Plan provides a \n     framework for maintaining and restoring fish habitats to \n     perpetuate populations of fish species;\n       (9) the United States can achieve significant progress \n     toward providing fish habitats for the conservation and \n     restoration of fish species through a voluntary, \n     nonregulatory incentive program that is based on technical \n     and financial assistance provided by the Federal Government;\n       (10) the creation of partnerships between local citizens, \n     Indian tribes, Alaska Native organizations, corporations, \n     nongovernmental organizations, and Federal, State, and tribal \n     agencies is critical to the success of activities to restore \n     fish habitats;\n       (11) the Federal Government has numerous land and water \n     management agencies that are critical to the implementation \n     of the National Fish Habitat Action Plan, including--\n       (A) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service;\n       (B) the Bureau of Land Management;\n       (C) the National Park Service;\n       (D) the Bureau of Reclamation;\n       (E) the Bureau of Indian Affairs;\n       (F) the National Marine Fisheries Service;\n       (G) the Forest Service;\n       (H) the Natural Resources Conservation Service;

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE ASIA-PACIFIC REBALANCE.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Asia-Pacific region has nearly a third of the \n     world's population and over one-quarter of global gross \n     domestic product, and its future prosperity and security are \n     intertwined with the United States;\n       (2) In addition to long-standing historic ties with Asia-\n     Pacific countries, such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, \n     Australia and New Zealand, the United States welcomes its \n     growing partnerships and collaboration with member states of \n     the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and with \n     governments across the Pacific Islands;\n       (3) throughout the Asia-Pacific, a strong defense posture \n     provides the foundation for United States national security \n     as well as for United States diplomatic, economic, \n     humanitarian, and people-to-people engagement in the region;\n       (4) a regional defense posture must therefore include a \n     balance of traditional and nontraditional military engagement \n     in order to make use of the capabilities and capacities of \n     United States partners and allies in the region with fewer \n     resources;\n       (5) traditional military engagement is especially important \n     in areas such as nonproliferation, ballistic and cruise \n     missile defense, maritime security assistance, and combined \n     military exercises;\n       (6) nontraditional defense engagement should include \n     collaboration on combating emerging infectious diseases, \n     responding to humanitarian disasters and extreme weather \n     events, effectively addressing the security challenges posed \n     by human and drug trafficking, civilian educational \n     partnerships and foreign language learning, and joint \n     research endeavors devoted to meeting the region's energy \n     needs;\n       (7) while the Department of Defense is traditionally the \n     United States Government agency with the resources and \n     capacity to lead engagement throughout the region, whenever \n     and wherever possible it should work closely with interagency \n     partners to accomplish shared foreign policy objectives and \n     should encourage those interagency partners to lead when \n     appropriate in order to better achieve United States \n     objectives in the Asia Pacific;\n       (8) regionally-focused security studies organizations \n     managed by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, such as \n     the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies established with \n     the support of the late Senator Daniel K.

Madam President, I rise today to honor ``A Prairie \nHome Companion,'' which for 40 years has shared with its listeners the \ncomings and goings of the good people of that most Minnesota of towns, \nLake Wobegon--where as everyone knows, all the women are strong, all \nthe men are good looking, and all the children are above average.\n  Only 12 people were in the audience for that very first broadcast on \nJuly 6, 1974, at the Janet Wallace Auditorium at Macalester College in \nSaint Paul. If those dozen people got there by car, they paid 55 cents \nper gallon to fill the tanks of their Ford Pintos or Plymouth Valiants. \nIf they stopped for a McDonald's burger afterward, they paid 30 cents.\n  How things have changed--and not just the price of gas and burgers! \nToday, 40 years later, more than 600 radio stations carry ``A Prairie \nHome Companion'' to four million listeners every week from the historic \nFitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul.\n  It has won a Peabody Award and has broadcast from nations including \nCanada, Ireland, Scotland, England, Germany and Iceland and nearly \nevery State in the Nation. It has inspired a movie by the same name, \nwhich won four international awards. It has helped make Minnesota \nPublic Radio and American Public Media household names.\n  And it has certainly made its creator and host, Garrison Keillor, a \nhousehold name! Mr. Keillor has won Grammy and George Foster Peabody \nawards, not to mention the National Humanities Medal.\n  But one thing has not changed at all from that very first broadcast: \nThis little variety program resonates with people. It has warmed our \nhearts with its stories, songs, poems and jokes. It has made us laugh, \nmade us cry, and made us sing along. And it has given its millions of \nlisteners a hometown they can call their own--right in the heart of \nMinnesota.\n  Madam President, I would like to congratulate Minnesota Public Radio, \nAmerican Public Media, and the cast and crew of ``A Prairie Home \nCompanion'' on 40 years of radio excellence. This is one show that is \nmost certainly above average.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the resolutions be agreed to, the \npreambles, where applicable, be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  (The resolutions, with their preambles, are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/26/senate-section/article/S4190-4", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF HOWARD BAKER, JR.\n\n  Mr. REID.
