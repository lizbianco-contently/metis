Mr. President, this morning I would like to start by \nremembering the sacrifice of two 18-year veterans of the Capitol \nPolice, Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut. On this date \nin 1998, Gibson and Chestnut paid the ultimate price while standing in \ndefense of the U.S. Capitol. We know these men fell defending more than \njust the structure, though. We know they fell defending more than just \nthe Members sent here or even the staffs who help each of us better \nserve constituents and our country. No, these men died while protecting \neverything this building represents--our democratic way of life, the \nfreedom granted to each of us by a creator we often thank but never \nsee.\n  We honor these men for their lives, and we honor them for the final \nact of heroism that ended those lives. That is why a plaque inside the \nCapitol commemorates their sacrifice. That is why the Capitol Police \nheadquarters bears both of their names. That, I know, is of little \nsolace to the wives, children, and friends left behind, but it is a \nsmall way of saying ``we remember'' when the scale of the debt owed can \nnever truly be repaid in full.\n  So today the Senate honors John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut for their \nsacrifice, and the Senate sends its condolences and its gratitude to \nthose who loved them most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/24/senate-section/article/S5852-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5852-S5855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORKING TOGETHER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am glad to see that Senate Democrats \nhave finally ended their obstruction of the bipartisan student loan \nbill. It has been weeks since the Democrats blew past the July 1 \ndeadline they kept warning about, and it has been even longer since the \nHouse passed a bill similar to the one they are actually now agreeing \nto. But at least Democrats have finally stopped obstructing and \narguing. At least now they are ready to put their partisan political \nfix aside and join President Obama and congressional Republicans in \nenacting real permanent reform for all students--the only real reform \non the table that is designed to help every middle-class family.\n  I would like to thank the sponsors of this bill for their hard work: \nSenators Manchin, King, Alexander, Burr, and Coburn. They may come from \ndifferent political parties, but they all really care about students, \nand this bill certainly proves it.\n  There is something else this bill proves too: that Democrats can work \nwith Republicans when they actually want to--when they check their \npartisan take-it-or-leave-it approaches at the door and actually talk \nwith rather than at us.\n  That is why it is really disheartening to hear about the partisan \nspeech President Obama plans to give today, the one the White House \ncan't stop talking about. With all the buildup, you would think the \nPresident was unveiling the next Bond film or something, but in all \nlikelihood it will be more like a midday rerun of some 1970s B movie \nbecause we have heard it all before. It is really quite old.\n  These speeches are just so formulaic, and they are usually more \nnotable for what they leave out than what they contain. Here is what I \nmean. We all know the President will bemoan the state of the economy in \nhis speech, but he won't take responsibility for it. He will criticize \nRepublicans for not rubberstamping his policies but will leave out the \nfact that for 2 years Democrats did just that, and yet the economic \nrecovery is still stagnant.\n  He won't talk about the fact that since he lost control of the House \nand his ability to have things exactly the way he wanted, he has \nrefused to engage with seemingly anyone in Congress on ways to get the \neconomy moving. A perfect illustration of that is the fact that instead \nof working with us on solutions, he is out giving speeches. And here is \nthe kicker: Instead of taking responsibility for his failure to lead, \nhe will probably try to cast this as some titanic struggle between \nthose who believe in ``investing'' in the country and those who \nsupposedly want to eliminate paved roads or stop signs or whatever \nridiculous straw man he invents this time.\n  Give me a break. There is a real philosophical debate going on in our \ncountry, but it is not anything like how he imagines it. I would say it \nis more of a debate between those who believe in a government that is \nsmarter and more efficient and some who seem to believe in government \nagainst all the evidence; between those who draw the obvious lessons \nfrom human tragedies in places such as Greece and Detroit, and some who \ncannot face up to the logical endpoints of their own ideology, who \ncannot accept the terrible pain their own ideas inevitably inflict on \nthe weakest in our society.\n  It is between those who understand the necessity of empowering of \nprivate enterprise if we are ever going to drive a sustained recovery \nfor middle-class families and some who can't seem to let go of ivory \ntower economic theories, even after 4\\1/2\\ years of an economy \nliterally treading water.\n  Speaking of ivory tower theories, here is another difference. Some of \nus believe it is actually possible to act as good stewards of the \nenvironment without declaring war on vulnerable groups of Americans. I \nknow a lot of people here in Washington who think of Appalachia as fly-\nover country, but many in my State have another word for it. They call \nit home. When these struggling families hear one of the White House \nclimate advisers say a war on coal is exactly what is needed, can you \nimagine how that makes them feel? It makes them feel as though they are \nexpendable, as though Washington does not understand them or, frankly, \nsimply doesn't care. ``[It is] like going to some of these big cities \nand shutting Wall Street down,'' is how a coal worker from eastern \nKentucky recently put it.''See how it affects everything,'' he said. \n``Coal is our Wall Street.''\n  This is just one of the many reasons Republicans have long called for \nan ``all of the above'' strategy. We understand that traditional \nsources can be developed in tandem with new alternative energies and \ntechnologies and that there is no other sane strategy anyway, since it \nis basically physically impossible, even putting the catastrophic \neconomic consequences aside here for a moment, to even come close to \nmeeting our energy needs with renewables today. We cannot even come \nclose.\n  What are we going to do in the meantime, power our country with \nforeign energy or American energy? This should be a no-brainer, but \nthen again we are talking about Washington here. That is why it is so \nfrustrating when the administration drags its feet on projects such as \nthe Keystone Pipeline. The North American oil that Keystone would bring \nis basically going to come out of the ground whether we take it or not. \nSo will the administration take it and the jobs that would come along \nwith it or surrender it to places such as China? The White House will \nnot say. The President's spokesman was asked for a decision again \nyesterday. You know what his answer was? Don't look to us.\n  Look, this pipeline has been under review for years and years. It is \nbasically\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\nbeing held up for one reason and one reason only: because the President \nis afraid to stand up to some of the most radical elements of his base, \nthe kind of people you will find at one of those meetings of the Flat \nEarth Society he likes to talk about.\n  It is time for him to choose between his political friends and the \nmiddle-class families who stand to benefit from the jobs, growth, and \nenergy that Keystone would bring. Keystone is just one example of a \nproject the President could work with both parties to implement right \nnow, that would help our economy. There is a lot more we can get done \nif he would actually pick up a telephone and try to work with us every \nonce in a while. I know Democrats would love to hear from him every now \nand then as well, because every time he goes out and gives one of these \nspeeches, it generates little more than a collective bipartisan eye \nroll.\n  It is such a colossal waste of time and energy, resources that would \nactually be better spent working with both parties in Congress to grow \nthe economy and to create jobs. I know that is what my constituents in \nKentucky expect and, frankly, they should expect that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to follow the remarks \nof our Republican leader on the President's pivot to the economy. Over \nthe last 4 years, the Obama administration has given us one of the \nbiggest economic experiments in American history. The numbers tell the \nstory. Under this President, the Federal Government has increased the \nFederal debt by $6.1 trillion, raised taxes by $1.7 trillion, and \nimposed $518 billion worth of new regulations. The President, when he \ncame to office, when he had a Democratic Senate and a Democratic \nHouse--in other words, his party controlled all branches of the \nlegislative and executive branch--got virtually everything he wanted.\n  He got a $1 trillion stimulus package. He wanted a government \ntakeover of America's health care system and that is what he got. He \nwanted extensive new regulations for the financial industry and he got \nthat too. He wanted to impose, through the Environmental Protection \nAgency, radical environmental regulations and that is what he got as \nwell.\n  From 2009 through 2010, until the voters spoke in November 2010, our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle controlled the White House, the \nHouse of Representatives under Speaker Pelosi, and the Senate. They got \nvirtually everything they wanted. That was their great experiment, to \nsee whether a growing and intrusive and expanding Federal Government \nwas the answer to our economic challenges and high unemployment.\n  We now know what the results have been. America's unemployment rate \nhit 10 percent for the first time since the early 1980s and it stayed \nabove 8 percent for 43 straight months. Meanwhile, many Americans have \nsimply given up looking for work. How do we know that? The Bureau of \nLabor Statistics publishes something they call the labor participation \nrate. We know the percentage of people in the workforce is the lowest \nit has been for more than 30 years. That is a tragedy. Add it all up \nand we have been experiencing the weakest economic recovery and the \nlongest period of high unemployment since the Great Depression in the \n1930s.\n  Even by the President's own measuring stick, by his own standards, \nhis economic record has been a huge disappointment. Hence, his \nrepetitive pivots to the economy, time and time again, particularly at \na time when his administration is having to answer a lot of hard \nquestions about various scandals. But I am with Speaker Boehner. I say: \nWelcome, Mr. President. Let's talk about the economy. Let's talk about \nwhat works and what does not work.\n  I think we know now what does not work, which is another government \nprogram that raises taxes, increases regulations, and creates \nuncertainty on the job creators upon whom we are depending to put \nAmerica back to work.\n  As a Washington Post correspondent noted this past week:\n\n       The President promised 1 million new manufacturing jobs by \n     the end of 2016. But factory employment has fallen for the \n     last 4 months, and on net is only 13,000 jobs toward that \n     goal.\n\n  There is some good news. I was on the floor yesterday, admittedly \nbragging a little bit about the economic growth in my State, in Texas, \nand one of the reasons is because we are taking advantage of the \ninnovation and the technology boom in the energy production business \nand we are actually seeing a huge movement back onshore, to the United \nStates, of a lot of manufacturing because of the low price of natural \ngas. But, unfortunately, the President does not seem to recognize the \nbenefits of producing our own domestic natural energy and what that \nwould mean in terms of bringing jobs back onshore and creating more \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  The President has promised to increase net take-home pay and expand \nthe middle class. You may recall particularly on the health care bill \nhe said it would reduce health care premiums by $2,500 for a family of \nfour. Unfortunately, he proved to be wrong because the cost has \nactually gone up $2,400 for a family of four, not down. We know from \nLabor Department statistics that median earnings for American families \nhave fallen by 4 percent since the recession ended.\n  I think even its most ardent advocates now are coming to the \nrealization that ObamaCare is not working out the way they had hoped. \nIndeed, I was on the floor a few days ago with a letter from three \nunion leaders who said that basically it is turning out to be a \ndisaster. It is hurting their own members. Again, these are people who \nwere for ObamaCare, saying it is not turning out the way we had hoped.\n  The administration itself has implicitly acknowledged this by saying \nthe employer mandate; that is, the requirement for people who employ 50 \npeople or more, is stifling job creation and prompting many companies \nto take full-time jobs and turn them into part-time jobs. Between March \nand June, the number of Americans working part time jumped from 7.6 \nmillion to 8.2 million. I think the administration saw that number and \nit scared them a little bit, as it should. Hence, they delayed the \nemployer mandate for another year, unilaterally.\n  A new survey finds that in response to ObamaCare, 74 percent of small \nbusinesses are going to reduce hiring, reduce worker hours, or replace \nfull-time employees with part-time employees.\n  I am not suggesting those of us who did not vote for ObamaCare should \nbe rejoicing in this development. Indeed, I think it is a sad moment. \nBut even its most ardent advocates are finding out that their hopes and \ntheir dreams and their wishes for this government takeover are not \nturning out the way they should. Again, this is not a time for anyone \nto spike the ball or to rejoice in the failure of this program. This is \na time for us to work together to say: OK, there are people who opposed \nObamaCare. They ended up being right in their predictions. There were \nthose who supported ObamaCare and unfortunately for the country it did \nnot work out the way they had hoped. Now is the perfect time for us to \ncome together and say: What do we do next to prevent the failure of \nthis health care takeover by the Federal Government hurting the very \npeople it was supposed to help? This is an opportunity for us to work \ntogether to do that.\n  We need to do something different. Someone said a long time ago that \nthe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and \nexpecting different results. It is not going to happen so we need to do \nsomething different. We need to do something different in terms of \ndelivering access to quality health care and making it affordable. \nInstead of more tax increases and more temporary tax gimmicks, we need \nfundamental tax reform. This is something that Republicans and \nDemocrats I think all agree on. The President himself said he believes \nwe need to do revenue-neutral corporate tax reform that lowers the \nrates, broadens the base, and gives us a revenue system that is more \nconducive to strong economic growth.\n  Instead of having people in politics pick winners and losers in the \neconomy or pick which parts of the law to enforce and which parts to \nwaive, we need to dismantle what is left of ObamaCare and replace it \nwith sensible, patient-centered alternatives that will lower costs, \nimprove access to quality, and\n\n[[Page S5854]]\n\nnot interfere with that important doctor-patient relationship--\nsomething the Senator from Wyoming has eloquently spoken about many \ntimes.\n  Instead of letting the Environmental Protection Agency regulate our \nentire economy, we need to expand domestic energy production by \neliminating misguided Federal regulations. Instead of adopting energy \npolicies that hamper job creation, we need to adopt policies that help \npromote jobs such as approving the Keystone Pipeline from Canada and \nnot trying to overregulate something that is already subject to State \nregulation, such as fracking.\n  Here in Washington, people act as though this horizontal drilling and \nthis fracking process is something new. We have been doing it in Texas \nfor 60 years and it has been regulated by the oil and gas regulator in \nour State. They protected the water supply and benefited job creation \nand economic growth for a long time.\n  I understand it is hard for those of us who were wrong about their \npredictions for many of these policies to say: You know what. It did \nnot work out the way we planned. None of us are relishing the failure \nof some of these policies, but we need to work together and get outside \nof our ideological comfort zone and address the problem of chronic high \nunemployment, the fact that our young people are graduating from \ncollege and they cannot find jobs. They know they are going to be \nburdened by the debt we continue to rack up, and that our economy is \nbouncing along the bottom. I am afraid if we continue with the policies \nof the last 4 years we will create a lost generation of young Americans \nwho cannot find good, full-time jobs. None of us--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--wants that to happen, but it is time we did something \nabout it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, later today President Obama is scheduled \nto give the first in a series of speeches about the economy. He is \npivoting one more time to turn his attention to the millions of \nAmericans who are still struggling 4 years after the recession ended. \nThe reason I say ``one more time'' is because this morning one of the \nreporters said this is about the tenth time the President has pivoted \nto the economy.\n  A White House adviser said on Sunday that the President is going to \nspeak about ``what it means to be middle class in America.'' Well, I \nhope President Obama will talk about how his own policies have harmed \nand continue to harm the middle class in America. I hope he will talk \nabout the harm that his health care law has done to hard-working \nfamilies. I hope the President will finally start talking about these \nthings because the American people have been talking about them for a \nlong time now.\n  I hear it every time I go home to Wyoming--almost every weekend. It \ndoesn't matter whether I am in Fremont County, Park County, Laramie \nCounty, or Natrona County--wherever I am in Wyoming, I continue to hear \nabout this law. Now we are even hearing about it from the very union \nleaders who were among the law's biggest supporters. The heads of three \nmajor labor unions put out a letter recently that warned of the damage \nthe health care law is doing to the middle class. They wrote:\n\n       The unintended consequences of the ACA are severe. Perverse \n     incentives are already creating nightmare scenarios.\n\n  Perverse incentives are already creating nightmare scenarios. That is \nwhat the law's supporters are saying.\n  They wrote that the health care law ``will shatter not only our hard-\nearned health benefits but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour \nworkweek that is the backbone of the American middle class.''\n  If the President wants to talk about what it means to be middle class \nin America, he needs to explain why his policies are destroying the \nbackbone of the middle class. That is what the union leaders are \nsaying. They are seeing, just like the rest of us, that the job numbers \nare not good for America.\n  In June, the number of people working part time who want to work full \ntime soared by 322,000. There are more than 8.2 million Americans \nworking part-time jobs because their hours were either cut back or \nbecause they can't find the full-time work they seek.\n  The White House conceded that the law was a problem for employers \nwhen it said they needed relief from the logistical mess the law has \ncreated. That is why the Obama administration decided to delay the so-\ncalled employer mandate. That was one of the signature parts of the \nPresident's health care law. Under the law, every employer with 50 \npeople who were working 30 hours a week or more was going to have to \noffer expensive government-mandated health insurance. Now we have a 1-\nyear delay on this extremely unpopular and damaging Washington mandate.\n  If the law is so bad for businesses that they can't handle it in \n2014, it is still going to be bad for them in 2015, and that was just \none regulation. The President's health care law has already created \nmore than 20,000 pages of new regulations. Well, those regulations \nconcern middle-class families I hear from in Wyoming, and it is not \njust Wyoming. The front page of the Washington Post has a headline that \nreads ``Health law's unintended impact on part-timers.''\n\n       For Kevin Pace, the president's health-care law could have \n     meant better health insurance. Instead, it produced a pay \n     cut.\n       Like many of his colleagues, the adjunct music professor at \n     Northern Virginia Community College managed to assemble a \n     hefty course load despite his official status as a part-time \n     employee. But his employer, the state--\n\n  The State of Virginia is his employer. This is not some company, it \nis the State of Virginia--\n\n     slashed his hours this spring to avoid a Jan. 1 requirement \n     that all full-time workers--\n\n  As a requirement in the health care law.\n\n     for large employers be offered health insurance. The law \n     defines ``full time'' as 30 hours a week or more.\n\n  This isn't a business worried about a bottom line, this is the State \nof Virginia.\n\n       Virginia's situation provides a good lens on why. The state \n     has more than 37,000 part-time hourly wage employees, with as \n     many as 10,000 working more than 30 hours a week.\n\n  Remember, 30 hours is the key number.\n\n       Offering coverage to those workers, who include nurses--\n\n  An important part of our economy and important as far as the needs of \nour country--\n\n     park rangers and adjunct professors, would have been \n     prohibitively expensive, state officials said, costing as \n     much as $110 million annually.\n       ``It was all about the money,'' said Sarah Redding Wilson, \n     director of Virginia's Department of Human Resource \n     Management.\n\n  The health laws have an unintended impact on part-timers, and as a \nresult it is hurting the middle class.\n  Middle-class Americans are also worried about their health insurance \npremiums--and they have a right to worry. The McClatchy News Service \nran this headline last week: ``Obama boasts of health care saves, but \ncosts likely to rise for many.''\n  The article went on to say:\n\n       Experts predict that premiums on individual plans will \n     increase in most states because of the new consumer \n     protections this sweeping legislation requires.\n\n  ``Consumer protections'' is just the White House's way of saying more \nredtape. That includes all of the new, required services people have to \nhave in their Washington-mandated, Washington-approved health \ninsurance. It is all of the health care services people have to pay for \nin advance whether they need them, whether they want them, or whether \nthey will ever use them. Those requirements are a big part of the \nreason--and another reason--that health insurance costs are still going \nup even though Washington Democrats promised the health care law would \nhave the opposite effect.\n  It is happening all across the country. Indiana was the latest State \nto announce that premiums are going to go up next year--not down. Last \nFriday the State insurance department--this is not just somebody \nlooking around--said the average rates for people buying individual \nplans will go up 72 percent. That announcement follows big increases in \nOhio, Maryland, Idaho, Missouri, and Kentucky.\n  In one State after another, rates for next year are being announced, \nand they are much higher than they were before the President's health \ncare law went into effect. When President Obama gives his speech today \nand over the next few weeks he should tell his audience the truth about \nwhat is happening to the rates and why. He should\n\n[[Page S5855]]\n\nalso talk to middle-class Americans about what might happen as far as \ntheir access to their family doctor under his health care law.\n  Remember when the President said: If you like your doctor, you can \nkeep your doctor? That was something the unions wrote about in their \nletter. It is a promise they think the President now isn't going to \nkeep. Well, I think they are right.\n  Now the Health and Human Services Department admits that individuals \nmay not be able to keep their doctors. This comes from the Web site the \nDepartment set up to try to answer questions people have been asking \nabout the health care law. The Department's Web site now says if you \nget your coverage through the government's new insurance marketplace \n``you may be able to keep your current doctor.''\n  That is a long way from when the President of the United States stood \nup and promised--actually he used the word ``guarantee''--you will be \nable to keep your doctor. It is that kind of backpedaling and broken \npromises that has union leaders worried. It has them worried, it has \njob creators hesitant, and it has middle-class Americans all across \nthis country concerned.\n  Of course, the health care law is just one of the areas where \noverregulation is hurting the economy. Another example is President \nObama's announcement last month of tighter regulations on powerplants. \nThat is on top of the excessive redtape the administration has already \nput in place that makes it harder and much more expensive for America \nto produce American energy.\n  Last week I introduced a bill to block President Obama from going \naround Congress to implement his national energy tax through \nregulations. The American people have repeatedly told Washington to \nfocus on jobs, not to roll out more redtape that increases energy bills \nand decreases economic opportunities.\n  The President promised that he cared about hard-working, middle-class \nfamilies, but his policies, one after another, are hurting those \nfamilies and are making their lives much more difficult.\n  President Obama needs to stop the Washington spin and tell the truth \nabout his health care law and the truth about his other failed \npolicies. Then he needs to come back to Washington, put aside his \ntired, old rhetoric and work with the Republicans to do the right thing \nfor the American people. That means coming up with a replacement health \ncare plan to finally give people what they were asking for all along: \nThe care they need from a doctor they choose at a lower cost.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, are we in morning business at this point?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, we still are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/24/senate-section/article/S5855-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5855-S5856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STUDENT LOAN DEBT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, later today we will consider a student \nloan bill that will affect 11 million students across America.\n  On July 1 the interest rate paid by students for their student loans \ndoubled; it went from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. We know students are \ngraduating with more and more debt. We also know the cost of that \ndebt--the interest rate--makes a big difference in their lives. \nSometimes they postpone important life decisions because of student \nloan debt.\n  My daughter has a business in New York with two employees who are \npaying off student loans. She said the biggest worry they have from \nmonth to month is making that payment. I understand that too. After \ntaking a look at the increase in debt, we find that student loan debt \nhas now surpassed credit card debt in America. It is more than $1 \ntrillion, and it is growing faster than any other form of debt. It is \nan indication of an indebtedness we need to take seriously. We will \nhave a chance to do that this afternoon.\n  There are many different points of view on what to do with student \nloans. Some people say that the government should be involved but it \nreally should be a market-based system. Others say, no, the government \nshould be involved and it should be a subsidy. We should help students \ngo to school. We should find ways to keep the cost of education \naffordable, and lowering interest rates is one way to do it.\n  We will have two amendments this afternoon. Senator Jack Reed and \nSenator Elizabeth Warren are offering an amendment that will cap the \ninterest rate on student loan debts at 6.8 percent for most debts \naffecting undergraduate students and 7.9 percent for other loans. To \nput a cap on that interest rate means we have to subsidize. In other \nwords, as we project out what the cost of student loans will be based \non market interest rates, a subsidy is necessary to honor that cap.\n  The second proposal will be from Senator Sanders of Vermont, and his \napproach is a little different. He basically says we ought to sunset \nany changes we make to student interest rates today after 2 years and \nthen revert back to the current 6.8 percent rate. That ends up costing \nabout $20 billion. Senator Sanders may or may not offer a means to pay \nfor that. I believe, from some statements he has made publicly, he \nbelieves that should be a debt of the government, but I will leave it \nto him to make his explanation.\n  At the end of the day, after those two amendments are considered, we \nwill come down to one basic decision we have to make as a body, \nDemocrats and Republicans. It can be simply stated, and here is what it \nis: Should the student loan interest rate--currently at 6.8 percent for \nmost students--stay at 6.8 percent or be reduced to 3.8 percent? That \nis the question.\n  If we pass the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act, which I have \nworked with Republicans and Democrats to craft, the interest rate for \nundergraduate students--that is almost two-thirds of all students--goes \ndown 3 percent, from 6.8 percent to 3.8 percent. I won't mislead my \ncolleagues. It is based on a 10-year Treasury rate and will be \nprojected over a period of time. As general interest rates go up, so \nwill the student loan interest rate from 3.8 percent, but we put a cap \non it and say that rate can go no higher than 8.25 percent in a 10-year \nperiod of time, protecting students even if interest rates go up \ndramatically. So there it is.\n  The final vote will be whether to reduce the student loan interest \nrate from 6.8 to 3.8 and to cap it for two-thirds of the students at \n8.25 percent--no higher than that--for the next 10 years. Students who \nare receiving subsidized loans won't have to pay the interest while \nthey are in school, and they will have some other benefits at the end \nof the day. What we are setting out to do is to make student loans \naffordable for students and to make sure families are not burdened with \nloans they can't pay back.\n  I hope my colleagues, no matter what their philosophy on student \nloans--whether they believe they should be market-based or government-\nsubsidized--realize that at the end of the day we have a very clear \nchoice to make: Stick with the 6.8 percent interest rate or lower it to \n3.8 percent.\n  What does that mean for students, the 3-percent difference? We \ncalculated it. We looked at the average undergraduate student in \nAmerica, and here is what it means: If we don't lower it to 3.8 \npercent, if we keep it at 6.8 percent, it means that student, over the \ncourse of 4 years of undergraduate education, will pay an additional \n$2,000 in interest. Why would we want to do that? Why at the end of the \nday would we want to keep interest rates at 6.8 percent and penalize \nstudents with $2,000 in interest over the next 4 years? That is the \nwrong thing to do.\n  I urge my colleagues, when the bipartisan alternative comes up, to \nvote for it. Even if my colleagues believe it should be a government \nsubsidy, which we have not been able to enact, or if they believe it \nshould be market-based--either way, this is a better outcome.\n\n  Personally, I hope this isn't the end of the story. Senator Tom \nHarkin of Iowa chairs the HELP Committee--the education committee--and \nhe is going to come to the floor soon to start working on the \nreauthorization of higher education. We understand it is more than the \ninterest rate that is\n\n[[Page S5856]]\n\ncausing a problem for students; it is the cost--the cost--of higher \neducation.\n  I went to Georgetown Law School. I couldn't get in there today with \nthe standards they have. Currently, I am told it costs over $50,000 a \nyear to go to this law school--$50,000 a year for 3 years, in addition \nto undergraduate debt. Well, a person better get a darn good job at a \nWall Street firm afterward because they will face a mountain of debt. \nThey are not alone. All across the United States we are seeing tuition \nrates go up--even at public universities--to record levels.\n  We have to find a better way to prepare the next generation of \nleaders in America. The old model of 4 years of undergraduate and then \ngraduate school and professional school has gone beyond the reach of \nmost students and families.\n  Keep in mind, too, that student loans are different from most other \ndebt. Student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. The debt a 19-\nyear-old student and his family sign up for is a debt that can trail \nthem to the grave. We have cases where people are signing up to \nbasically guarantee the loans of granddaughters to make sure their \ngranddaughter can go to college, and then the granddaughter either \ndrops out or can't find a job and defaults on the student loan, and \nthey proceed to collect it from grandma. I am not making this up. They \nare garnishing the grandmother's Social Security benefits to pay for \nstudent loans she guaranteed for her granddaughter. That is how \nruthless this industry is and how tough this debt is.\n  We have a chance today to make this debt more affordable for students \nnow, to reduce the interest rate from 6.8 percent to 3.8 percent and \ncap it over the next 10 years at 8.25 percent. I won't mislead my \ncolleagues. In some debt categories of borrowing--graduate students and \nparent PLUS loans--in the second 4 years the interest rates go up more, \nand many of those who borrow in those categories are going to find 5 \nyears from now that they are facing a much tougher debt situation. I \nwon't mislead my colleagues on that at all.\n  I think we can't leave the conversation today and say we are finished \nand we don't need to talk about it anymore. Let's give the students and \nfamilies the help they need today, but let's not stop on this issue. On \nthe higher education reauthorization bill, we will have a chance to \naddress overall student indebtedness and affordability for families.\n  Let me close by saying that the worst offenders--the worst \noffenders--when it comes to college loans are the for-profit schools. \nPeople may not know much about them unless a person is 18 or 19 years \nold and they can't escape them when they go on the Internet. They are \ntrying to sign up students to for-profit schools, many of which are \nworthless--worthless.\n  The numbers to remember are three, and they are going to be on the \nfinal, so listen carefully. Twelve percent of all students coming out \nof high school go to for-profit schools. Twenty-five percent of all \nFederal aid to education goes to for-profit schools. Forty-seven \npercent of all student loan defaults are students at for-profit \nschools. So what is the message there? They are raking in Federal \ndollars at twice the rate they should, and their students are failing \nat a rate greater than any other category of schools. Their students \nare failing to get a job, failing to graduate, failing to pay back \ntheir loans.\n  For-profit schools are a national scandal. We need to deal with them \nin the higher education reauthorization. I know Senator Harkin has held \nhearings on these schools, and he understands this. We need to take an \nhonest look at the schools that are misleading our students and their \nfamilies. These schools aren't worth the accreditation, they certainly \naren't worth the time, and they aren't worth the debt they are pushing \non students.\n  Let me make a marketing pitch, if I may. I say it in Illinois, and I \nwill say it anywhere. If you are graduating from high school and not \nsure where to go, what you want to do, what you want to major in, your \nsafest bet is your community college. It is nearby. It is affordable. \nIt offers many options. In most States the hours are transferable to \nother colleges. It is a good way to start your college education. Also, \nfor vocational training, community college is a smart investment. When \nit comes to these for-profit schools, exactly the opposite is true.\n  So when we reauthorize higher education, let's come up with a good \nstudent loan approach that builds on what we can vote for today, but \nlet's also start looking at the overall cost of higher education, \nsensitive to the needs of families today to make sure their kids have a \nfighting chance for the best jobs in America.\n  I travel all around my State, and I go to businesses. I asked my \nstaff: Find me businesses that have done well in the recession and are \nhiring today. I find a lot of good businesses, including Kraft Foods in \nChampaign, IL. Each year they need over 100 industrial maintenance \nengineers--people to keep the assembly lines running--who understand \nhow to repair things, understand computers, and are good employees. The \nstarting wage for those employees, by and large, is $50,000 a year. \nThat is the average wage in my State. Think about it--a starting wage.\n\n  Well, what is holding them back? Why didn't they fill the jobs? The \nstudents coming out of high school are not ready. They do not have the \nmath skills or the computer skills. But if they go to Parkland \nCommunity College in Champaign, they can acquire it affordably.\n  That makes sense. That is a way to bring a student out of high school \nwith a year or two of good training at a community college and have a \ngood job and opportunity for a lifetime. It is a great place to start. \nThose jobs are all over my State and all over America.\n  So let's focus on affordability in higher education, on training for \nvocational skills that give people a chance to become skilled \napprentices and beyond, and let's make sure today that we do not miss \nthis opportunity to reduce interest rates.\n  A ``no'' vote on the bipartisan plan will keep interest rates for \nstudents at 6.8 percent. A ``yes'' vote will lower the interest rates \nfor two-thirds of students to 3.8 percent and save those students \n$2,000 over the next 4 years. It caps that interest rate at 8.25 \npercent. That is a guarantee that no matter what happens to interest \nrates, these students will be protected.\n  This is a pretty basic choice. We need a strong bipartisan vote. \nRegardless of your philosophy on what student loans should look like, \nkeep these families and students in mind. If you are frustrated with \nthe legislative process, frustrated that Congress is not doing it \nexactly the way you want to have it done, do not take it out on the \nstudents and their families. Give them a break today with a ``yes'' \nvote for the bipartisan bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prioritize certain projects under the bridges in critical \n                           corridors program)\n\n       On page 26, line 12, after ``benefits'' insert ``, and \n     projects shall be carried out on bridges that the Federal \n     Highway Administration has classified as structurally \n     deficient or functionally obsolete''.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, thank you for allowing me to offer this \namendment today, and I thank my colleagues from Maine and Washington \nState for agreeing to work with us on this important amendment. I also \nthank them for the way they are conducting this appropriations bill by \nallowing amendments to come forward and having debate.\n  This amendment is one that I think will be relatively \nnoncontroversial. This is an amendment to the underlying Transportation \nand Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. It simply says \nthat our nation's bridges that need repairs the most ought to be \nprioritized.\n  There are bridges that are classified by the Federal Highway \nAdministration as ``functionally obsolete'' or ``structurally \ndeficient,'' and we want to be sure they receive priority consideration \nunder the section of the bill that provides for Bridges in Critical \nCorridors. This is a fund that is established under the appropriations \nbill. In this way, we are helping to ensure that fund in question \nactually accomplishes its objective.\n  We all know the Federal Government's highway trust fund dollars are \nstretched very thin and, frankly, there are not enough dollars that are \nmaking their way to the core infrastructure needs we have in this \ncountry. In fact, in 2008, the fund got in trouble, and since that time \nit has been bailed out four times from the Treasury's general fund, and \na fifth bailout is now scheduled for fiscal year 2014. Clearly, the \nfunds are very limited, and we have to be very careful and resourceful \nin how we spend those funds.\n  This appropriations bill does include, as I said earlier, a separate \nfunding mechanism--$500 million--for Bridges in Critical Corridors \nacross the country. I know there are some in this Chamber who wonder \nwhether that is necessary in the legislation, and I understand their \nargument. But if we are going to include this special fund, let's be \nsure the money is used in the most efficient way possible, and that is \nwhat this amendment is all about. Let's be sure we target the limited \nresources we have in a way that addresses our Nation's bridges that are \noutdated and often at risk.\n  This amendment narrows the number of bridges that receive priority \nconsideration by 75 percent, and does so by focusing these resources on \nfunctionally obsolete and structurally deficient bridges throughout the \ncountry that need the funding. These are the bridges with problems that \nif left unaddressed could be in tomorrow's headlines.\n  We do not have to just deal with hypotheticals, it is happening. We \nhave all seen recent accounts of this functionally obsolete Skagit \nRiver Bridge on Interstate 5 in Washington State that collapsed in May. \nI know Senator Murray was very involved in responding to this. It was \nstruck by a truck that exceeded the bridge's height limit. The good \nnews is there were no direct fatalities, unbelievably--at least in this \ninstance there were not. The bad news is there are a lot of bridges \nthat are functionally obsolete or structurally deficient around the \ncountry. There are thousands of them, and we need to be sure that, \nagain, they are prioritized in this legislation.\n  One of those bridges happens to be the Brent Spence Bridge in my \nhometown of Cincinnati, OH. The bridge is located at the critical \nintersection of I-75 and I-71--an important artery--and it is a bridge \nbetween southwest Ohio and northern Kentucky.\n  This Brent Spence Bridge was built nearly 50 years ago, and it was \ndesigned to carry 80,000 vehicles every day. As of this year, it is \ncarrying more than double that number every day. It is expected to \nexceed 200,000 vehicles per day by 2025.\n  To facilitate the increased traffic and congestion on the bridge, the \nengineers actually removed the bridge's emergency shoulders, so there \nare no emergency shoulders on the bridge anymore. They also had to \nnarrow the lanes to 11 feet rather than the 12 feet recommended by the \nFederal Highway Administration. So this makes it hazardous for drivers. \nIt also has not alleviated the congestion much because it continues to \nresult in an average of 3.6 million hours of delay for passenger \nvehicles every year.\n  So Brent Spence is one example of an endangered bridge this amendment \ncould help. We need to ensure that bridges such as Brent Spence receive \nthe priority access to the funds in the Bridges in the Critical \nCorridors section of this legislation.\n  So for this reason, I would urge my colleagues to support this \ncommonsense amendment.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Collins and Senator Murray for \nallowing this amendment to be part of the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I support this amendment. What it does \nis it clarifies that when the Department of Transportation awards \nfunding under Bridges in Critical Corridors, priority should be given \nto structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges.\n  The Federal Highway Administration uses those terms to talk about the \nstatus of the bridges across the country. So when a bridge is \n``structurally deficient,'' its condition has deteriorated over time. \nAnd when a bridge is ``functionally obsolete,'' its design does not \nmeet today's standards. Both situations, obviously, can be a serious \nconcern.\n  In the underlying bill itself, I took the initiative to include an \nadditional $500 million for these bridge investments so that we can \naddress these serious concerns across our country and make sure our \ntransportation network is safe and reliable.\n  So I support this amendment. I urge our colleagues to vote for it.\n  I would ask the Senator from Ohio if he wants a voice vote and would \nallow us to move forward on it now or if he requires a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I would defer to the chairwoman. I \nwould like a voice vote, if that is what the chairwoman would prefer. \nBut it might be a good amendment to have a recorded vote on.\n  What is the chairwoman's preference?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it is completely up to the Senator from \nOhio. As I said, if the Senator offers us a voice vote right now, I can \nguarantee its adoption quickly. How long does the Senator want to wait \nto vote?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I think I will take the Senator up on \nher offer.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. A wise choice and a good example for those Senators who \nfollow the Senator in offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I just want to commend the Senator for \nhis amendment. The fact is that 25 percent of our Nation's bridges are \neither structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, as described by \nthe Senator from Ohio.\n  In my home State of Maine, nearly a third of our 2,408 bridges are \ndeficient. Senator Portman's amendment targets these funds to ensure \nthat they are awarded to structurally deficient or functionally \nobsolete projects in an effort to respond to our Nation's crumbling \ninfrastructure.\n  Like Senator Murray, I support this amendment, and I too am prepared \nto accept it on a voice vote.\n\n[[Page S5858]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the question is on agreeing \nto the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio.\n  The amendment (No. 1749), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for \nbringing his amendment before us and setting a good example for all \nMembers, as we now move forward, to bring their amendments to the \nfloor. We will work our way through them. We hope everybody can contact \nmyself and Senator Collins as quickly as possible so we can get these \namendments up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1760\n\n  With that, Madam President, I call up Senator Cardin's amendment No. \n1760.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for Mr. Cardin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1760.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Transportation to submit to \n Congress a report relating to the condition of lane miles and highway \n                              bridge deck)\n\n       On page 38, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 127.  The Secretary shall submit to Congress a report \n     describing the percentages of lane miles and highway bridge \n     deck in each State that are in good condition, fair \n     condition, and poor condition, and the percentage of Federal \n     amounts each State expends on the repair and maintenance of \n     highway infrastructure and on new capacity construction.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, as the chair of the full Committee on \nAppropriations, I rise today to comment on this bill, but also to thank \nand acknowledge the really important role that Senators Murray and \nCollins have played. Really, it has been the way the Senate should \noperate. They have held extensive hearings in the subcommittee on \nAmerica's needs in transportation--an ever-piling up backlog that we \nneed to address.\n  It would accomplish several good, agreed-upon public policy goals. \nNo. 1, safety. Because when we are talking about roads, bridges, and \nthe other infrastructure areas in this bill, safety is our No. 1 \npriority.\n  No. 2, when you are building or repairing a bridge in Maryland, \nMaine, Washington State, or North Dakota, those people are working in \nthe United States of America, and, hopefully, the supply chain \ninvolved--whether it is asphalt to steel--is made in the good old USA. \nSo what we would do is improve the safety rates and lower the \nunemployment rate and at the end of the day have something to show for \nit.\n  So many of the American people are frustrated with us when it comes \nto spending because they think if they give us $1, we will spend $2 and \nnot have spit to show for it. But yet in this bill, at this time, we \nhave a legislative framework, and a restrained fiscal framework, to be \nable to move on important transportation infrastructure needs and on \nhousing.\n  The appropriate role for the Federal Government to be involved in is \nhousing: those things that are involved in, No. 1, promoting economic \ndevelopment in blighted areas, regardless of whether you are in an \nurban State or a rural State. The needs of North Dakota are different \nthan the needs of Maryland. Even in my very dear State of Maryland, we \nhave different needs in different parts of the State. The robust \nBaltimore corridor, which is more urban, requires one framework for the \ncommunity development block grant money.\n  If you go to Garrett County, in the western part of my State, that \nwas hit by a blizzard during Hurricane Sandy or you go down to the \nEastern Shore, Somerset County, that was hit by a hurricane, literally \nflooding to dangerous proportions--those two counties have as high a \npoverty rate as Baltimore City.\n  So when we talk about the great things in this bill, what I like \nabout it is it is local--it is money that will come for local needs. \nThe needs of Garrett County and Somerset County are different than the \nneeds of Baltimore City. But what we do know is that we need jobs and \nwe need to be able to address the needs of the people who want to be \nmiddle class and are looking for an opportunity to get there and also \nfor the compelling needs particularly of the elderly and disabled.\n  Again, we in the Senate know because we are urban and rural and \nsuburban. You meet different needs according to the locale. In \nBaltimore City, it is a high concentration of elderly in certain areas. \nWe can meet those needs through a combined effort of housing, Meals On \nWheels, helping people be able to receive coordinated services to keep \nthem independent and healthy. When you get to the rural parts, that is \neven harder.\n  So what I like about this bill is it is, first of all, focused on \nrebuilding America. I so salute our troops. We have been in a 10-year \nwar. The consequences of that war will be felt by the men and women who \nserved and the taxpayers who have to pay it for many years to come.\n  But as we look at this, what they fought for is for America. Now we \nhave to think about rebuilding America. I am glad we gave it a try in \nIraq. OK. We gave it a try in Afghanistan. But come home, America. As \nthe troops come home, and hopefully the money comes back home, we begin \nto show results there. If we rebuild our infrastructure, focus on \ncompelling human needs, I think we will not only serve the Nation well \nbut people will begin to have trust in us that through smart \napproaches, restrained spending, we can get there.\n  I am proud of what this bill does in Maryland. It does create jobs. \nIt helps with infrastructure. This bill is absolutely crucial to \nMaryland. First, the THUD bill provides $40 billion for highways and \nnearly $9 billion for mass transit. We need that. This means Maryland \nwill receive in fiscal year 2014 $700 million.\n  We are not waiting only for the Federal Government. The Maryland \nGeneral Assembly recently increased the gas tax--very controversial--\nbecause of our compelling needs. Governor O'Malley and our general \nassembly wanted to rise to the occasion, but they want us to rise to \nthe occasion as well.\n  As we look at some of these projects, they affect not only the State \nof Maryland but they affect the region and the Nation. The Presiding \nOfficer was not here when we had a horrific accident in 2009 on the \nMetro. The Metro suffered a terrible crash: brakes failed, safety \nsystems failed, a lot failed--nine people lost their lives.\n  We said we were going to create a safety culture and turn to our \nNational Transportation Safety Board to be able to do it. I made two \npromises to families: that I would do everything I could to see what \nwere appropriate Federal safety standards and to put money in the \nFederal checkbook to improve that safety. I demanded reforms at Metro \nmanagement to a culture of safety.\n  So where are we now? Guess what. We have put money in the Federal \ncheckbook, $150 million to continue to buy the important crash-\nresistant cars that will be able to help them. The money will be used \nfor signal improvement, rail car maintenance to make sure we are \nimproving this.\n  Safety is the No. 1 obsession with me. In addition to working on \nMetro, I know this bill deals with FAA's contract tower program, a \nsubject of much debate during last year's continuing funding \nresolution. I remember real debate with Senator Moran on how we could \nkeep those airports open.\n  They are the first to be hit by the sequester. I have five of them. \nThey are in communities called Easton--by the way, Secretary Rumsfeld \nis down there. Cheney would come by as well--the Frederick Municipal \nAirport that the President uses periodically for\n\n[[Page S5859]]\n\ncoming to Camp David, Hagerstown, Martin, Salisbury, and Ocean City.\n  Those towers are important for two reasons: national security and \neconomic security. So we are looking at how we can make sure we keep \nthese towers open so airplanes can come and land safely and take off \nsafely and aid the commerce to our communities.\n  You have heard me also speak about housing and community development. \nWhen I got started in Congress, we had something called revenue sharing \nthat was started by President Nixon so the local communities would get \nformula-based funding to help them rebuild their communities or \nstrengthen them in the area of economic development.\n  That changed. That ended. That ended during the Gingrich era. But we \ncame up with community development block grant money. Again, that money \ncomes locally to meet local needs. The criteria are: eliminate blight, \nimprove employment opportunities, and be able to create a sustainable \ninfrastructure that will not need government subsidies so the community \ncan be able to sustain itself and build on that to create jobs.\n  We are very impressed with this. Again, this legislation meets needs \nfor seniors and housing. I could go on about it. But this bill is a \nvery important accomplishment for the State of Maryland. When I talk \nabout safety, I note the Portman amendment. I note Senator Cardin has \nan amendment on a report on the highway deck.\n  I wish to say something else. We had some tough things happen in my \nState over the last couple of days on the Bay Bridge. Many of the \npeople in this Senate travel the Bay Bridge, some to go to their State. \nWe are a next-door neighbor with our pals from Delaware, Senators \nCarper and Coons, who represent the Delmarva Peninsula, a wonderful \nplace. We hope the Presiding Officer comes over sometime and actually \nsees real water, oceans and rivers and crabs and so on, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  But this bridge, we now have two of them because of the volume, and \nthen, second, the way people travel on it, the velocity has increased. \nLast Friday, we had a terrible situation where a truck tailgated a \npassenger vehicle and pushed it off the bridge--off the bridge. The car \nfell 40 feet.\n  Thank God the passenger survived, a young lady who--the impact was so \nhard, the windshield broke, so she was able to get out. She is a \nfitness instructor. So she had the robust and physical vigor to be able \nto swim to safety. We thank God for her survival. But we are now scared \non the Bay Bridge.\n  Yesterday, we had another head-on collision on the bridge. The AAA, \nthe American Automobile Association, has called upon the National \nTransportation Safety Board to review the conditions on our bridge. Are \nthe barriers high enough? Should we be using two-way traffic now to \nalleviate the traffic jams because transportation is changing? In other \nwords, these are very important questions related to safety.\n  Do we need another bridge? An analysis needs to happen. If we build \nanother bridge, should it be there or further south? Controversy. But \nagain we need analysis.\n  I cite that example because as I review the facts of this case and \nconsult with the State, I too am considering joining with the American \nAutomobile Association to ask for the NTSB to review the accidents on \nthe bridge and give us recommendations in terms of what we need so it \ndoes not happen again.\n  You cannot fall 40 feet. It could have been someone elderly. There \ncould have been babies in that car. It does not matter. You cannot fall \n40 feet off the bridge being rear-ended by a trick and think it is OK. \nYou cannot have a head-on collision and think it is OK. I do not think \nit is OK what is happening on the Bay Bridge.\n  I now want to work with my Governor and consider what are the best \nsteps forward. But as of today, I am very strongly recommending a \nreview by the National Transportation Safety Board to look at it. It is \nnot only what is happening in Maryland. It is what is happening all \nover America.\n  I see on the floor the Senator from Oklahoma. I am going to yield the \nfloor so others can speak. But before I do, I wish to compliment \nSenators Murray and Collins and the way they have been moving this \nbill. I think it is important.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. COBURN. I wanted to speak for a moment about----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Wait a moment, I suggested the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded just to talk about the THUD bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue \nthe call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, my colleague from Oklahoma was waiting \nto offer amendments, but filling in for Senator Murray, I was trying to \nget a sense what that meant. The reason I wanted the quorum to go on \nwas so I could have a chance to talk to the Senator from Oklahoma. \nWherever he is, I want him to know that if he thinks I was trying to \nstifle him or not allow him to have his rights on the Senate floor, I \napologize. What I was trying to do was create an orderly process so we \ncould keep this excellent momentum going. I invite Senator Coburn to \nplease return to the floor. If in any way he felt I was being negative \ntoward him, I do not mean that. In fact, what I meant was let's get it \nclear so he could go forward.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma and I have an excellent relationship. We \nhave agreed on many things, and we have duked it out on others. We did \npromise an open amendment process, and we intend to keep it.\n  Again, I apologize. I invite him to come back to the floor. Let's \nhave a discussion and let's keep it going.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to add some further comments on \nthe bill while we are waiting for Senators to return to the floor to \noffer amendments. I note the gentlelady from Maine is returning.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Making college affordable is one of the most important \nsteps we can take toward completing our economic recovery and ensuring \na path to the middle class for all Americans. As a Nation, we are still \nworking to recover from the largest economic downturn since the Great \nDepression. Access to student loans at affordable interest rates \nrepresents an incredibly important piece of this vital recovery.\n  I often use a quote of President Obama that he included in his State \nof the Union Address a couple of years ago. It says to win the future, \nwe must outeducate, outinnovate, and outbuild the rest of the world. I \nbelieve we do this best by supporting our students and investing in \ntheir future.\n  Unfortunately, the Student Loan Certainty Act on the floor today is a \nstep in the wrong direction. A college education should be a path to \nprosperity, a path to the middle class, not a path to indebtedness.\n  As many of my colleagues have described, the bill before us today \noffers students and families lower student loan interest rates in the \nnear term, but we can fully expect higher student loan interest rates \nin the years to come.\n\n[[Page S5860]]\n\n  For families with multiple children who are college bound, their \nchildren's education becomes more expensive in each ensuing year. This \nmeans that under this plan, a current freshman in college may get a \ndecent student loan interest rate for a few years, but a current \nfreshman in high school will end up with rates much higher than the cap \ncontained in current U.S. law.\n  Not only does this legislation raise long-term interest rate loans \nfor students, it fails to close tax loopholes. It does not ask the \nwealthy to pay their fair share, and it burdens students who can least \nafford it with deficit reduction.\n  The bill before us lacks a true vision for outeducating the rest of \nthe world. It doesn't ask our country to invest in the future, nor does \nit offer a comprehensive solution to college affordability. Rather, it \noffers a poor permanent fix and slaps students and their families with \nthe bill.\n  I remind my colleagues that there were multiple alternative solutions \nproposed before Congress slumped over the July 1 deadline that doubled \nthe interest rates on student loans. I supported two measures offered \nby my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, that would have paid \nfor lower interest rates for students by closing tax loopholes for the \nvery wealthy in our country. The Senate twice voted on Senator Reed's \nproposals and they received a majority vote each time.\n  We are also making a good-faith effort to address the shortcomings of \nthe bill before us to work toward a deal that would be a true win for \nstudents and their families. The Reed-Warren amendment, which I proudly \ncosponsor, would impose a lower cap to protect student borrowers. Why \non Earth would we wish to expose our students to higher rates?\n  Senator Sanders' amendment would sunset the current deal in 2 years \nand allow for a return to regular order so Congress can rightly deal \nwith interest rates and a host of other issues that affect college \ncosts. These amendments are sound improvements to the underlying bill \nthat would allow us to invest in students and families, rather than \nobfuscate the student loan and debt problem. I am disappointed that we \nhave reached the point where debates about the future of college \naffordability are less about the lives of students and their families \nand more about protecting loopholes for corporations and the wealthy.\n  It wasn't always this way. In 1944, starting with the compact to \nreturning soldiers from World War II made through the GI bill, our \nNation made a commitment to future progress by investing in education. \nBetween 1944 and 1951, 8 million veterans received education benefits, \nincluding many former distinguished Members of this body.\n  In 1958, President Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, signed the \nNational Defense Education Act, providing loans for college students \nand funds to encourage young people to enter teaching careers, the \nprecursor to our current program for student loans.\n  President Lyndon Johnson built upon this legacy. A cornerstone of the \nGreat Society was a path to the middle class through a college \neducation. The Higher Education Act of 1965 gave us the Federal student \nloan program, known today as the Stafford Loan Program, and the \nEducational Opportunity Grant Program, known today as the Pell Grant \nProgram. This generation of American lawmakers lived in trying times--\nwinning a war, fulfilling the dream of the civil rights movement--yet \nthey still had the foresight to make the hard choices, the choices \nnecessary to invest in the future--our future.\n\n  Legislation I supported as a Member of the House of Representatives \nbuilt on this investment and lowered the subsidized Stafford loan rate \nto 3.4 percent, which was the rate at which students borrowed until \nJuly 1. We recognized that investing in students is important, and \nlowering rates is a part of that investment.\n  The fact that State investment in higher education has declined \nsignificantly over the past decades has exacerbated the problem. \nParticularly as States struggle to balance their budgets in these tough \neconomic times, their investments in students have decreased, meaning \nhigher tuition, fewer grants, and fewer scholarships.\n  I hear regularly from Wisconsin students that the cost of higher \neducation in my State puts college out of reach for some. Thirty years \nago undergraduate tuition at the University of Wisconsin-Madison was \nabout $1,000. Today it is well over $8,000. And it is not just my home \nState of Wisconsin. Across the country tuition at public 4-year \ncolleges has tripled. This means more students are borrowing through \nFederal student loan programs to cover the higher cost of higher \neducation. For students at the University of Wisconsin System, unmet \nneeds after grants and scholarships is over $9,000--nearly doubling in \nthe last decade. Yet the Federal Government limits on subsidized loans \nhave remained relatively stagnant over the past 30 years. In many cases \nthe limits on what a student can borrow through the Stafford Loan \nProgram means their loans will not even cover the cost of their \ntuition.\n  This is what it all comes down to--a series of choices. Are we going \nto sacrifice the progress of our next generation because we are \nunwilling to do the hard work and make those tough choices now? Are we \ngoing to gradually chip away at the ladders of opportunity put in place \nby the generations before to lift Americans into the middle class and \nout of poverty; do we ask the wealthy to pay a little bit more; do we \nask corporations to pay their fair share. Or do we say to students: You \nare on your own; sink or swim.\n  I say to students across Wisconsin and this great country: We should \nall be in this together. We must continue this compact from one \ngeneration to the next. The veteran who was educated on the GI bill \nwants to see his neighbor's children able to afford college. The \nteacher who earned her education through the Pell Grant Program wants \nthe same opportunity for her students. The mother who attended college \nthrough the Stafford Loan Program does not want to see her savings for \nretirement depleted or her children sapped with debt.\n  I reject sacrificing the progress of the next generation because we \nare unwilling to do the hard work and make the hard choices now. I \nreject shortchanging the next generation of young Americans by making \ncollege more expensive and then using the profits from their high \ninterest rates to pay down the deficit, particularly when we ask the \nwealthiest to contribute nothing.\n  If we are to win the future, we must make the hard important choices \nnow. For this reason and for the hard-working people of Wisconsin, I \noppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, we have had a good discussion about how \nto proceed with this bill. The chairman of the full committee has been \nextremely constructive in exercising her leadership. She very much \nwants a new approach, and I commend her for bringing bills individually \nto the Senate floor.\n  What we are going to propose--and through the Chair I would like to \nengage in a colloquy with the chairman of the full committee--is that, \nas usual, we would go back and forth, one side then the other, in \nconsidering amendments but that we would allow Senator Coburn to file a \nseries of amendments at this point. They are already filed, but he will \ncall them up and make them pending, with the understanding that we \nwould set aside individual amendments so we could keep going back and \nforth and so that other colleagues on the Republican side who have \namendments would not be shut out but, rather, would be accommodated as \nwell.\n  Is that the understanding of the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator, and I wish to respond to the \nranking member of THUD to say this: No. 1, yes, that is our \nunderstanding. As we move ahead on this bill, remember that this is the \nfirst appropriations bill on the floor in 2 years and the first time \nTHUD has been on the floor in 4 years. The Senator from Maine and \nSenator Murray are to be commended. The old-school way--old school, \nwith respect--was an open amendment process with alternating amendments \nback and forth. Old school was never to bring up 12 or 15 amendments at \none time; it was usually 1 amendment.\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\n  So the understanding is that it is to go back and consider one \namendment at a time, alternating sides, with the understanding that the \nSenator from Oklahoma wishes to speak on a variety of amendments and \noffer them.\n  Again, I think we have cleared the air, and I am so happy about that. \nSo I do concur with the Senator from Maine.\n  We also understand, in addition to his amendments, alternating among \nthe ranking member, the chair, and the chairman of the subcommittee, \nthere might also be other intervening amendments; is that correct?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would say through the Presiding Officer that is my \nunderstanding as well. And I think this was a very good example of \neveryone operating in good faith.\n  I, for one, am prepared for the Senator from Oklahoma to proceed, but \nI would note that the Cardin amendment is the pending amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, first of all, I thank the chairman of \nthe full committee and the chairman and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee. I first want to give them some praise. Although I don't \nagree with the total numbers in this bill, I do recognize the \nsignificant changes they have made to the bill with ideas we had 2 \nyears ago, and I am very appreciative of the fact that the slumlord \nproblem is being taken care of, the count on vehicles for the Federal \nGovernment is being taken care of, and the conferences are being taken \ncare of. Almost all of my concerns have been addressed very faithfully \nin looking at those issues we raised and actually including them in the \nunderlying language, and I am very appreciative of that.\n  In terms of getting amendments up, my desire is just to get them up \nand pending and to be flexible with the chairman and the ranking member \non which ones they will accept, which ones they do not want to take a \nvote on, and then talk about that and not to ramrod the process. It is \nonly a matter of efficiency for me. If their pleasure is for me to do \none or two or three and then come back later and do it again, as long \nas we have an open amendment process, I don't have any problem with it.\n  I do think we have some ideas to improve this bill, and I think the \namendments ought to be considered. So I thank them for their \nconsideration and allowing me to make some amendments pending, and I \nwill talk with both the chairman and the ranking member about when and \nwhat we will do with the disposition of those amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1750\n\n  Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1750, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending amendment be set aside for the purposes of \ncalling up this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to spend a moment talking \nabout amendment No. 1750.\n  This bill has a prohibition in it that I think is long overdue and \nvery good. What it does is it prohibits the transfer of funds for \nFederal assistance in the bill to corporations with delinquent taxes. I \nbelieve that is a great step in the right direction.\n  Companies that are contracting with, doing business with the Federal \nGovernment have an obligation to pay their taxes, but I also believe \nour Federal employees ought to be paying their taxes as well. We have \n$5 billion due to the Federal Treasury from Federal employees where the \ncases have been adjudicated. They are not under question any longer. \nThere is no question about whether the money is owed. They have run \nthrough all their appeals. All this amendment would do is to strike the \nsame balance for both independent contractors, which is not a part of \nthe Senate bill as presently on floor, and individual Federal employees \nwho have a tax obligation.\n  When the average Federal compensation fully absorbed is calculated, \nit is in excess of $134,000 a year. That includes all the benefits and \neverything else. That is twice the per capita median family income in \nAmerica. So the fact that we have this large of an outstanding amount--\nit is about $1 billion--with current active Federal employees, I \nbelieve there ought to be some consequence for Federal employees who \nhave a tax obligation but aren't paying it and whom we continue to keep \nin our employ and continue to pay them with no payment back to the \nFederal Treasury.\n  In one division of the Federal Government--the Internal Revenue \nService--if, in fact, an individual is found in a situation such as \nthis, they lose their job. It is grounds for termination. So this is a \nsimple improvement that would say what is good for American taxpayers \nis also good for Federal employees and what is good for businesses that \ndo business with the Federal Government is good for Federal employees. \nAnd what is good for the businesses ought to also be good for \nindependent contractors who owe the Federal Government money.\n  So I would be happy to have any modifications the committee might \nrecommend to this as well, but in terms of fairness and running a $17 \ntrillion debt and running $600 billion in deficits, we ought to be \naggressive about collecting the taxes owed to us that there aren't any \nquestions about. The principle the committee used in terms of \nbusinesses that deal with the Federal Government ought to be applied to \nindividual contractors and individuals as well.\n\n[[Page S5862]]\n\n  With that, I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, as well as the chairman, for the opportunity to offer \nthis amendment and will await their disposition and their plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, President Barack Obama today is in the \nMidwest talking to folks about how important it is that Congress return \nits focus to our Nation's economic recovery. I couldn't agree more. \nFlustered by filibusters and paralyzed by politics, Washington has \ngotten off track, and it is time that changes.\n  The Senate this week has an opportunity to pass an appropriations \nbill. I am grateful for the leadership of Senator Murray of Washington \nand ranking member Senator Collins of Maine in bringing this \nappropriations bill to the floor. I am still fairly new here, \nrelatively speaking, but I am told it wasn't an unusual or shocking \noccurrence back in the day for the two parties to come together to \nnegotiate and pass a bipartisan spending bill.\n  The bill in front of us would fund the Departments of Transportation \nand Housing and Urban Development. While I think to most people these \nagencies aren't especially related to their daily lives, both are \nactually fundamentally about investing in our Nation and its critical \ninfrastructure--the roads we drive on, the homes we live in, the trains \nand planes we ride on, the ports our goods are shipped through. This \nbill is about infrastructure. We know that when we invest in America's \ninfrastructure, we are actually investing in America's communities and \nin America's future.\n  This bill is about building the infrastructure for the long-term \nstrength and stability of our communities and our country, and it is \nabout putting Americans back to work. This bill will put Americans back \nto work on a wide range of major transportation projects in communities \nacross our country. The programs in this bill have meant an enormous \namount to my home State of Delaware, as I know they have to the \nPresiding Officer's. They can continue to have an important, positive \nimpact on communities across our country, but only if we can come \ntogether to fund them.\n  The so-called TIGER grants program helps States and local governments \npay for new highways and bridges, public transit projects, railways and \nport infrastructure. It is a competitive, highly sought-after program. \nFor the current fiscal year, the Department of Transportation received \nnearly 600 applications from across all 50 States, the District of \nColumbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa--$9 billion in requests \nfor just $470 million in available funds. That competition helped focus \nthese resources where they were best leveraged and where they would \nhave the best impact. In my view, our communities need these funds, and \nthey need this bill to make possible this program.\n  TIGER grants in Delaware made possible the building of the Newark \nRegional Transportation Center, which will support 350 high-skilled, \nhigh-wage construction jobs a year while it is being built. This new \ncenter will give folks in New Castle County new options for public \ntransportation, cutting down on the number of cars on I-95 and our \nlocal roads, and strengthening the community.\n  TIGER grants are a core part of our Nation's infrastructure strategy, \nand they will be at risk if we don't move this bill forward.\n  The new Bridges in the Critical Corridors Program is another \nsignificant part of our infrastructure strategy, and I commend Senator \nMurray for her efforts to ensure that our Nation's bridges are safe. At \nhome in Delaware, one out of five bridges is deemed structurally \ndeficient or functionally obsolete. Let me repeat that. One out of five \nbridges in my little home State of Delaware is structurally deficient \nor functionally obsolete. They may have major defects and need major \nrepairs or may have been built so long ago that they are not up to \ncurrent code. Either way, I think we would agree that this Nation, our \nconstituents, our communities need our bridges to work, and work \nsafely.\n  We also need and rely on our highways. The Federal-Aid Highway \nProgram uses the highway trust fund to help States and local \ngovernments to help plan, build, and repair our Nation's needed \nroadways. It is a true Federal-State-local partnership and has helped \nensure consistent quality and safety standards on highways across our \ncountry for nearly a century.\n  I shouldn't have to explain to this body why having functional roads \nis important to businesses, to families, or even to the public's \nsafety, but I will say this: There are more vehicles on the roads year \nover year than ever before. Part of our responsibility is to make sure \nthose roads work--and work safely. Another part is to offer our \ncitizens other options to reduce the traffic burden on those roads.\n  This bill also contains two new programs to do just that, that I \nthink are worth highlighting. The New Starts Transit Program supports \nprojects to provide new or expanded public transportation services. The \npassenger rail grants, of particular interest to me, are focused more \nnarrowly on intercity passenger rail services designed to reduce \ntraffic congestion.\n  How are we going to move this country forward if we can't move around \nwithin this country? As a Congress, we have to do more to strengthen \nour Nation's infrastructure, and that is a big part of what this bill \ndoes.\n  I recently joined the Appropriations Committee after the passing of a \ngreat senior Senator--Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey--who was \nfor many years a great and tireless champion of Amtrak. He fought \nharder than anybody to build Amtrak into what it is today because he \nsaw that with our population steadily growing we needed to be prepared \nto provide reliable, safe, affordable transportation, in particular \nhere in the eastern region.\n  At his funeral, Vice President Biden said that, ``If it wasn't for \nFrank, Amtrak wouldn't be what it is today.'' He is right. And, of \ncourse, our Vice President famously rode Amtrak down to Washington \nevery morning and home to Delaware every night that he served as a \nSenator, as I do now. I took the 6:25 down, and I hope, God willing, to \nbe on the 7:00 home. We will see.\n  Amtrak, in this region in particular, isn't a luxury, it is a \nfundamental and critical part of the economy, not just in my home State \nof Delaware and at least a dozen States on the Atlantic seaboard but \nacross the country for communities that rely on passenger rail to \nconnect with the Nation's major economic centers.\n  Senator Lautenberg once said,\n\n       If we shut down the Northeast Corridor rail service, you'd \n     have to build seven new lanes on Interstate 95 just to carry \n     all the travelers that use these trains every day.\n\n  In the last fiscal year, Amtrak achieved a new milestone of 31.2 \nmillion riders. In fact, they had record ridership 9 out of the last 10 \nyears, and Amtrak continues to make steady progress in reliability, \ncapacity, and on-time performance. How could we possibly afford to \nreplace this vital service with, as Senator Lautenberg suggested, seven \nnew lanes of interstate running up the entire length of the east coast?\n  Now is not the time, in my view, given all these standards of \nprogress that they have met, to gut Amtrak, as our counterparts in the \nHouse seem determined to do. Now is the time to help Amtrak build on \nits steady gains and progress and continue to grow. Amtrak is a vital \npart of dozens, even hundreds, of communities across this country. So \nin my view, to invest in Amtrak is to invest in those communities and \ntheir future.\n\n  The other major portion of this bill that we consider today is \nhousing, the transportation and housing appropriations bill. As our \neconomy continues to recover, people in communities all across our \ncountry are looking to us to help them grow. Housing infrastructure is \njust as important a part of the foundation of our country and our \ncommunities as is transportation. In low-income neighborhoods, \nrestoring community infrastructure is the foundation for future \neconomic growth. That is why this bill's strong investment in the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program, one of HUD's longest running \nand in many ways most successful programs, is so critical.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, I served as a county executive before \njoining the Senate. In that role, our\n\n[[Page S5863]]\n\nlocal government made efficient, focused, targeted use of CDB grants to \nprovide for housing assistance for low-income seniors, for the \ndisabled, for communities across our country in New Castle County, DE.\n  CDB grants are high-yield investments that work all over this \ncountry, that are controlled in many ways at the local level, and that \nenable communities to rehabilitate buildings, streets, and sewer \nsystems that literally lay the groundwork for new business growth and \nvibrant revitalized communities. As the hardest hit Americans work \ntirelessly to get back to work and back on their feet, housing \nprograms, also included in this vital bill, ensure they can keep a roof \nover their heads or that they have the possibility of safe, clean, \nsanitary, affordable housing in their future.\n  In Delaware, nearly 4,000 people were homeless in our small State at \nleast once last year, and more than 200 of them were veterans. All over \nthis country, I know many of our colleagues are concerned about the \nnumber of our veterans who fought for us overseas and now face and \nendure homelessness here at home. For those who felt the despair and \nloss and loneliness of homelessness, those who lived with this fear \nthat they will one day experience it as well, the housing programs \nfunded in this bill are a lifeline. I want to particularly thank \nSenator Murray for her leadership on ensuring that we end the scourge \nof veteran homelessness in our country.\n  Homeless assistance grants, another key provision in this bill, help \nDelaware organizations, and organizations all over this country, to \noffer permanent and transitional housing to once-homeless persons, \nwhile providing services including job training, health care, mental \nhealth counseling, substance abuse treatment, and childcare.\n  And last, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program helps to expand \nthe supply and affordability of housing to low-income families and \nindividuals, many of whom are elderly or disabled. In my home State of \nDelaware, a recent grant from the Project Rental Assistance \nDemonstration Program will create and sustain 170 units of affordable \nhousing over 5 years for persons with disabilities.\n  For millions of Americans and for thousands of Delaware families, the \nkey to a better home lies in good counseling, in home ownership, and in \nthese sorts of investments in a stable, affordable housing market.\n  Elisa, one of my constituents from Middletown, did not believe she \nwould ever be able to purchase a home for herself and two children, but \na federally funded class called Preparing for Home Ownership helped her \nnavigate the housing market and find a home that she could afford. She \nis now spending less on her three-bedroom home than she had on her two-\nbedroom rental, and her children have a backyard of their own for the \nfirst time.\n  If we want families to succeed, if we want children to focus in \nschool, if we want to create communities with safety and stability, \nmoving toward sustainable home ownership is a vital investment by this \ncountry in creating and sustaining quality communities.\n  Dedicated organizations, such as NCALL and Interfaith Community \nHousing of Delaware, have leveraged Federal funding such as this to \nhelp with mortgages, loan modifications, and private capital to help \nput more than 1,000 families each year in Delaware into better housing. \nTheir services include workshops, foreclosure prevention services, and \ncounseling.\n  Another constituent who contacted me, Eva from Rehoboth, was in \ndanger of losing her home when she met with a foreclosure prevention \ncounselor to discuss her personal situation. A counselor helped her to \ndevelop a plan to stabilize her finances and to modify her mortgage \ninto a more affordable interest rate. Because of a counseling program \nfunded by this bill, Eva avoided foreclosure and was able to save her \nhome.\n  The National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program, administered \nthrough NeighborWorks, has helped hundreds of households in Delaware to \navoid the pain, loss, and dislocation of foreclosure. Last year, \ncounselors from NCALL, First State, and YWCA conducted more than 5,000 \nhome ownership counseling and education activities, including one-on-\none counseling appointments, workshops, and homebuyer fairs. Funding \nfrom this program will allow them to reach even more Delawareans in \nneed in the year ahead.\n  We may have made some progress as a Chamber last week in getting \nthrough the executive branch nominations that had been the subject of a \nnumber of filibusters and quite a bit of contention, and I was pleased \nthat this bill earned six Republican votes in the Appropriations \nCommittee when taken up and considered. Surely it can earn enough votes \nin this full Senate to move forward to debate, to consideration, and, I \nhope, to final passage. It is the challenge of this Chamber to listen \nto each other, to work together, and to provide the vital investments \nin infrastructure and in housing that ensure a steady recovery and a \nbrighter future.\n  Senator Lautenberg once said that his career in business taught him \nthat if you want to be successful tomorrow, you have to lay the \nfoundation today. That is exactly what this bill does. That is what we \nare voting on--the foundation of tomorrow's success for America's \nfamilies and communities.\n  I earnestly hope we will come together to pass this bill, to create \njobs, and to invest in our country's future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/24/senate-section/article/S5863-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5863-S5894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SMARTER SOLUTIONS FOR STUDENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 1911, as provided under the \nprevious order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1911) to amend the Higher Education Act of \n     1965 to establish interest rates for new loans made on or \n     after July 1, 2013, to direct the Secretary of Education to \n     convene the Advisory Committee on Improving Postsecondary \n     Education Data to conduct a study on improvements to \n     postsecondary education transparency at the Federal level, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, we are now on the student loan bill, so \nto speak. There is going to be a few hours of debate on the bill \nitself--actually 3 hours. As I understand it, there will be three \namendments in order under the rule on this bill. So we will probably be \non this bill for some time this afternoon. But we do want to finish it. \nI know the leader wants to finish it. Both the majority leader and \nRepublican leader want to get this finished today, so we will be \nworking on this bill for probably the better part of this afternoon.\n  I would like to set the stage for it by talking about the situation \nwith student loans and why we are where we are right now. First of all, \nI would like to say the bill before us basically is the House bill. \nThere will be a Manchin-Burr amendment that will be offered as a \nsubstitute. I will be supporting that. That is the compromise bill. \nThat is the compromise we reached through several weeks of negotiations \nbetween the Republicans on the Senate side and the Democrats on the \nSenate side and the White House. It was a three-party negotiation that \nwent on, and this is the compromise that was reached. So the bill \nbefore us represents a number of compromises that were made on both \nsides to produce legislation that would give certainty to students who \nborrow money from the Federal Government to attend college this fall.\n  As we all know, we have debated several different measures related to \nstudent loan interest rates for several weeks. This is the closest we \nhave gotten to an agreement that represents at least two core \nDemocratic principles, our side's principles, related to student loan \ninterest rates.\n\n[[Page S5864]]\n\n  I think it is only right to point out that we have had a couple of \nvotes on keeping the interest rates at 3.4 percent for subsidized \nstudent loans for next year. That did not receive the 60 votes needed \nto move. As a consequence, on July 1, the interest rates on subsidized \nloans snapped back from 3.4 to 6.8 percent. We have been working hard \nto try to keep students from paying that 6.8 percent interest and on \nhow we could reach some agreement, and that is what this bill does that \nis before us.\n  The two core principles we fought for were that the front-end caps--\nthey have front-end caps to ensure that undergraduate students taking \nout Stafford loans will not pay above 8.25 percent interest even if \nthere are extreme fluctuations in the market. I point out that 8.25 \npercent is exactly the caps we had on student loans in the 1990s. This \nis not something new or out of line with what we have done before. We \nhad 8.25 percent in the nineties, and I might add five times in the \nnineties we bumped up against that cap, so that cap protected students \nfive times in the nineties from going above 8.25 percent.\n  Graduate students taking out these Stafford loans will have a cap of \n9.5 percent in interest. Parents and graduate students taking out PLUS \nloans, these are the parent loans, will never pay above 10.5 percent. \nThat is the first principle, to have these upfront caps.\n  Second, the principle we had is to get as close to budget neutral as \npossible. The composition of this bill places us about as close to \nbudget neutrality as possible, meaning that billions of dollars will \nnot be generated off the backs of students to reduce our budget \ndeficit, something that was included in the version of this legislation \nthat passed the House and which was a key feature on an earlier \nRepublican bill that received a vote in the Senate--not a passing vote, \nit received a vote.\n  Again, these are the compromises made on the Republican side. They \nhad several billions of dollars to raise on the student loans in the \nfuture. We did not. So we compromised down. Basically, it is $715 \nmillion over 10 years. Since there is going to be over $1 trillion over \n10 years, $715 billion is not much compared to the $1 trillion in \nstudent loans that will be taken out over the next 10 years. That comes \ndown to about $71 million a year. That is just about as close as we can \nget it to budget neutrality.\n  What does this mean for students? It means this fall all \nundergraduate students, subsidized or unsubsidized, will only have to \npay 3.86 percent interest. That is down from 6.8, down to 3.86 percent. \nThat means they will have that interest rate for the life of the loan. \nThat is locked in. It will not vary.\n  Graduate students will see a 1.4-percent rate decrease from what it \nwould be and parents will see a 1.5-percent rate decrease, so in all \ncases a decrease. That means real savings for borrowers. That means an \naverage of $1,500 savings for undergraduates, $2,913 for graduate \nstudents, and $2,066 for parents, again over the life of the loan.\n  This bill also includes a provision that requires the GAO to submit a \nreport to Congress within 4 months, detailing what the actual cost to \nthe Federal Government of administering the Federal student loan \nprogram is and what the appropriate interest rate should be to avoid \ngenerating any unnecessary revenue. Again, I am sure people referred to \nit. There was an editorial in the New York Times this morning talking \nabout the fact that the government should not be generating revenue off \nthe backs of students. We all agree with that. That is why we tried to \nget this as close to budget neutrality as possible. As some will point \nout, under the system the way it is set up over the next 10 years, the \nCBO estimates the Federal Government will make more than $180 billion \non Federal student loans.\n  I might just say, deriving savings was not the intended purpose of \nthe Federal student loan program when it began in the 1960s, and it \nshould not be a purpose of it now. The purpose should be to keep \ninterest rates as low as possible for students and their families. So \nin 4 months, when the GAO submits its report to Congress, I plan to use \nthat information to inform us on the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act--I will have more to say about that in a second--to get a \nloan system that does not generate money for the government. This \ndebate on student loan interest rates will continue, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join us in that discussion as we move to the Higher \nEducation Act reauthorization next year. As I said, I will have more to \nsay about that in a second.\n\n  I have cosponsored this bill that is before us. I will vote for its \npassage. I will oppose other amendments because we have an agreement to \nmove ahead. I believe this was the best deal we could get for students \nat this time.\n  The bill before us is supported by a number of groups, including the \nUnited States Student Association, the American Council on Education, \nRock the Vote, Center for American Progress and Generation Progress, \nGenerational Alliance, the National Association of Student Financial \nAid Administrators, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \nAlso, this morning we received a letter from the Leadership Conference \non Civil and Human Rights that supports this with a ``yes'' vote on the \nbill before us.\n  I wish to make it clear that I plan to revisit the issue of student \nloan interest rates, along with other facets of the higher education \nsystem, in order to address the whole issue of college affordability. \nThis fall the Senate HELP Committee, which I chair, will start \nconsideration on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act that \nexpires this year.\n  The interest rates--what we are talking about here today--we attach \nto Federal student loans is an important issue. I don't deny that. It \nis one that deserves our attention, but I want to point out that it is \njust one piece among many that go into college affordability. We will \nbe tackling the many pieces that go into the reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Act so we can address the whole issue of college \naffordability.\n  When I am in Iowa, I hear from students and parents about the \nfinancial squeeze they are facing from the spiraling costs of college \nand their anxiety about student loan debt.\n  I have charts here. The first chart shows the increase in the cost of \na public 4-year education over time. It has tripled since the 1980s. If \nwe look at that chart, we can see that from 1980 to today the cost of a \ncollege education has tripled. That is the red line. The blue line is \nthe Consumer Price Index. As we can see, our current system is out of \nstep with the marketplace.\n  The cost of that degree has skyrocketed for students across the \ncountry. The costs have risen far higher and faster than the rate of \ninflation. Why is this happening? Why has it gone up so rapidly? If we \nlook at 1990 to 1991, it just shot up. From about 2000 to now, it has \nreally skyrocketed. I think it is legitimate for us to ask this \nquestion: Why is that happening? It is not just student loan interest \nrates causing that. We have had low student loan interest rates, so \nthat cannot be the sole cause. Something else is going on. Again, that \nis why we need to examine that in the Higher Education Act--so we can \nfind out why that has happened.\n  The second chart I have shows what is happening to our students. The \naverage loan debt for a bachelor's degree has doubled since the 1990s. \nIn the 1990s the cumulative debt a student would have after going to \ncollege would be $9,350. Today it is $26,660. That is over a 20-year \nperiod. Why has that gone up so much? That is why we have to get into \nthe whole panoply of issues that affect college affordability.\n  In light of this crisis, I have chaired a series of hearings in our \ncommittee focused on what is being done to curb the cost and how we can \nhave strategies to help keep the dream of higher education alive for \nstudents without giving them a ton of debt when they graduate. To date, \nwe have examined promising strategies employed by innovative colleges \nand universities to curb costs while improving student outcomes. We \nhave looked at State policies for improving affordability and State \nbarriers to innovation, efficiency, and effectiveness. There is much \nroom for progress and improvement when it comes to our system of higher \neducation. I believe a consensus is emerging on the need to break away \nfrom business as usual. We cannot keep going on the way we have been \ndoing over the last 20 years in funding for higher education.\n  Among the many ideas we have heard in these hearings, three major \nthemes\n\n[[Page S5865]]\n\nhave emerged. First, States are cutting funding to public universities, \nshifting the costs to students, their families, and Federal financial \naid programs. In all of our hearings--and we have looked at all that \ngoes into these charts, such as the increase in costs to students and \nthe cost of college--the single largest correlative factor has been the \ndecrease in State support for higher education.\n  What has become clear--at least to this Senator--is that State \nlegislators have figured it out. They can cut their budgets and cut \ntheir support for public universities, shift the burden back on \nstudents and their families, the students come to the Federal \nGovernment and borrow more money, we increase Pell grants, and the \nburden on the student grows because their debt grows. Yet the colleges \nthemselves are not stepping in to do anything. There are some colleges \ndoing innovative things, but they are not doing enough to control the \ncosts. Something has to be done about the States backing off of their \nsupport.\n  The second theme that emerged was that many of our more than 7,000 \ndegree-granting institutions are not making college affordability a \npriority. It is just not a priority. They are focused on chasing \nrankings, investing in efforts unrelated to academic success, and they \nare failing to respond to a rapidly changing higher education \nlandscape.\n  The third theme that emerged was that students and families are not \nempowered with accurate, clear, and accessible information about the \ncomparative costs, quality, and value when shopping for a college \neducation. While college affordability is a complex issue with no easy \nanswers, there is much that all stakeholders--the Federal Government, \nState governments, institutions, families, and students--can do to \nincrease college access and success and keep the costs down regardless \nof a student or family background.\n  Again, we are going to have to look at this in the higher education \nbill. Interest rates are just one piece of it, and that is what we are \naddressing today, but there is a lot more going on than just interest \nrates. We have to look at our system of accreditation. We have to look \nat our campus-based aid programs, the financing of Pell grants, and the \nregulation of the for-profit colleges that my friend from Illinois is \nalways consistently pointing out here. We need to look at the structure \nthat supports our Federal loan system, from the loan origination \nprocess to the servicing done by private and nonprofit contractors \nafter students have completed their course of study, and debt \ncollection should they default. The system we have is complex. I will \nrepeat that the interest rate on student loans is only one piece of \nthis jigsaw puzzle. It is an important piece to be sure and one we are \naddressing today.\n  Throughout the discussions about the interest rates, both President \nObama and my ranking member and good friend Senator Alexander have \npersonally committed to working with us as we take up the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act in the coming year so we \ncan address all the issues affecting our entire higher education system \nand hopefully enact much needed reforms.\n  We all understand how serious and important the issue of \naffordability is for a higher education. I look forward to working with \nSenator Alexander, members of our committee on both sides, and the \nWhite House in the months ahead to come up with a Higher Education Act \nreauthorization bill that is comprehensive and really gets to the \nbottom of college affordability so we can start to break away from the \nway we have been doing things in the past. As I said, we cannot \ncontinue on the way we have been doing this.\n\n  There are many who have been involved in negotiating the legislation \nbefore us today. Compromises are tough sometimes. I have said before--\nand I know my friend from Illinois said this at our press conference \nlast week--if I were to write this bill and if I could have it my way, \nthis would not be what I would write. I understand that. It wouldn't be \nwhat my friends on the other side would write either. And that is the \nart of compromise--to bring both sides together and get the best \nagreement we can. This is a good agreement. It is good for \nundergraduate students, it is good for graduate students, and it is \ngood for their families.\n  I thank President Obama for his leadership in negotiating this bill. \nI would also like to thank my friends and colleagues. I thank Senator \nDurbin, who was a great leader in bringing this about. I thank Senator \nManchin, Senator King, Senator Carper, as well as Senator Alexander, \nSenator Coburn, Senator Burr, and their staffs for all the hard work \nand diligence in putting this proposal together.\n  As I said, this might not have been the bill I would have written, \nand I think everybody who has been involved in this would say the same. \nBut it is the best we could do. Quite frankly, it is going to lower \ninterest rates this year. For undergraduate students, for the next 4 \nyears it will be lower than 6.8 percent. In the fifth year it goes up \njust a little bit. As I said, as we look at the Higher Education Act \nand as we get this back from GAO in 4 months, we are all going to work \ntogether to see what exactly is the best path forward.\n  We can keep the interest rates low for students this year and into \nthe future, and I support this bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act. I \nencourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage.\n  I am glad to yield for my friend Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, through the Chair I would like to direct \na question to the Senator from Iowa. I respect the leadership he has \nshown on this issue and so many issues, whether it is health, \neducation, or disabilities. He has been the voice of leadership in the \nSenate for a long time. I know this is his last term as a Senator, but \nI also know he still has one big job ahead of him, and he has talked \nabout it--the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. We are going \nto hold the Senator to that because we need his voice and leadership in \nthat room or it won't happen.\n  I saw his leadership on this particular issue. Senator Harkin came to \nthis negotiation with conservative Democrats and Republicans and sat \ndown and said: There are some basics we are going to have to include in \nthis before I will sign off.\n  I remember this--No. 1, keep the interest rates as low as possible \nfor students so that students and their families don't have an \nincreased burden.\n  As he said, in the next 2 years--whatever category of a student loan \nwe are talking about--this bill is a break. For undergraduate students, \nit saves $2,000 in interest over the next 4 years that they otherwise \nwould pay if this bill fails to pass.\n  The second thing he said: We want a cap on interest rates so that if \nsomething unforeseen happens, if all the economic predictors are wrong \nand the base interest rate on 10-year Treasurys goes up faster than we \nthought, there will be a cap to protect the students. He insisted on \nit, and we put it in there. For undergraduate students, it is 8.25 \npercent. That is a guarantee that it will not go to the high heavens. \nAnd 8.25 percent has been a traditional ceiling cap.\n  The third thing--and I want to make a point of this because it is \nlikely to come up in debate. This is an interesting compromise. We \nwould dream up scenarios. Well, what if we put the cap at this number? \nWhat would happen to the interest rates? When it is all over, if we \ncalculate it over 10 years, do we break even? We don't want to make a \npenny off of students and their families on student loans. We don't. We \ntried to avoid it.\n  I think the best effort of the Senator from Iowa netted some $600 \nmillion to the Treasury over 10 years. This bill is in the range of \n$715 million.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, will my friend from Illinois yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am asking a question of Senator Harkin and then I will \nbe happy to yield.\n  What I would like to put in perspective is $715 million to the \nTreasury over 10 years. Over a 10-year period of time, CBO estimates \nthe government will make $1.4 trillion worth of student loans. This \n$715 million, when compared against that, comes out to .005 percent. So \nwe cut it as close as we could.\n  What does it mean to the students? It means to the students, \naccording to the way they factored it out, that for\n\n[[Page S5866]]\n\neach loan a student takes out--$2,000, $3,500, whatever it happens to \nbe--there will be on average a surcharge of $2.76. That is what comes \nto $715 million. So the net result of it is--we would like to bring it \nto zero; that was our goal. The way this place works, that was hard to \nachieve. I thank the Senator from Iowa for dedicating himself to those \nthings.\n  I wish to address him in the form of a question, to be complicit with \nthe rules of the Senate: If we fail to pass the bipartisan approach we \nare bringing to the floor, what will be the immediate impact on \nstudents and families in the United States?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I thank my friend from Illinois for his great \nleadership. Before I get right to the answer, I would point out the art \nof compromise, which we did. The Republican proposal we had before us a \nfew weeks ago raised $15.6 billion over 10 years. So they have \ncompromised a long way too. We have gotten it down to $715 million, \nover 10 years, from $15.6 billion. The Senator is absolutely right. We \nare looking at close to $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, and that \nkind of puts that $715 million in perspective.\n  If we don't pass this today, there is one sure effect: Student loans \nwill be almost twice what they would be under this bill--this year, \nalmost twice--for them and their families.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Interest rates.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And that would be true for this year and next year and \nthe year after, almost--not quite--this is 3.86, it would be 6.8. So \nthey would be paying 6.8 percent on every loan they take out this year \nrather than 3.86 percent, which I might point out also covers both \nsubsidized and unsubsidized loans. That is a good deal.\n  Again, I say to the Senator that by keeping the rates like that--and \nthis is another good point to make and I think people should \nunderstand. A student borrowing this year at 3.86 percent locks that in \nfor the lifetime of the loan--locks that in. It doesn't go to 8.25 \npercent. That 8.25 is a cap in case interest rates start going up.\n  I would point out to my friend from Illinois that 8.25 is what we had \nin the 1990s, and five times in the 1990s we hit that cap, so we \nprotected students five times in the 1990s at that 8.25 percent.\n  I say to my friend we have to pass this bill to keep students from \npaying 6.8 percent on their loans this year.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1773\n\n  On behalf of Senator Manchin, I call up his amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. Manchin, Mr. \n     Burr, Mr. King, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Carper, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \n     Harkin, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 1773.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1774\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n\n[[Page S5867]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Schatz, Mr. \n     Murphy, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Blumenthal, and Mr. Wyden, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1774.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                  (Purpose: To provide a sunset date)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. SUNSET.\n\n       (a) In General.--The amendments made by this Act shall be \n     effective for a 2-year period beginning on July 1, 2013.\n       (b) Repeal.--The amendments made by this Act shall be \n     repealed on July 1, 2015, and section 455(b) of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087e(b)) shall be applied \n     as if this Act the amendments made by this Act had never been \n     enacted.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I have a lot of affection for my friend \nfrom Iowa Senator Harkin and Senator Durbin from Illinois, but I must \nrespectfully disagree with them and rise in opposition to the bill.\n  I ask for support for an amendment I am offering which is being \ncosponsored by a number of Senators. I wish to thank Senator Leahy, \nSenator Wyden, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Gillibrand, Senator \nBlumenthal, Senator Schatz, Senator Murphy, and Senator Hirono for \ntheir support for this amendment. I also wish to thank the largest \neducational organization in America, the National Educational \nAssociation, for their support of this amendment, and I thank the \nAmerican Federation of Teachers for their support of this amendment.\n  The truth is that if the bill on the floor is passed without \namendment, it would be a disaster for the young people of our country \nwho are looking forward to going to college and for the parents who are \nhelping them pay their bills. The job of the Congress, it seems to me, \nis to improve upon the dismal situation we face today in terms of \nstudent indebtedness and college affordability. These are major crises \nin this country. Millions of kids leaving school are deeply in debt and \nparents are borrowing at high interest rates to send their kids to \ncollege. We have a crisis. This bill makes a bad situation worse, not \nbetter.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment I have offered which \nwould provide a 2-year sunset to this bill--an approach which would \nprevent student interest rates from soaring and allow us the time, \nthrough the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, to deal with \nthe issue of student indebtedness in a constructive long-term manner. \nThis issue is too important not to go through a hearing process, not to \ngo through a committee process. I hope we will pass my amendment, \nsupported by eight other Senators, which will sunset this bill in 2 \nyears and allow us to take advantage of the relatively low interest \nrates now and prevent student interest rates from soaring into the \nfuture.\n  The very sad truth of the matter is that in a number of ways, our \ngovernment--Congress, the White House--is failing young Americans \ntoday, at all ages. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of \nany major country on Earth. Almost 22 percent of our kids live in \npoverty.\n  I think every working American understands that our childcare system \nis a disaster. If a person is a working-class mom or dad in Vermont, or \nI suspect any other place in this country, it is hard to get the \nquality childcare they need, so that many kids today, because of \ninadequate childcare from zero to 3 and 4, enter kindergarten or first \ngrade already years behind where they should be intellectually and \nemotionally. We are failing our young children.\n  We are failing our teenage young people as well. Today, the \nunemployment rate for high school graduates is close to 20 percent. \nThat is the official rate. For real unemployment, counting those who \nhave given up looking for work and those who are working part time when \nthey want to work full time, it is even higher than that. What does \nthat mean for millions of kids who graduate high school, can't get a \njob their first year out of school, their second year out of school, \nand their third year out of school? What does this mean for their \nentire lives? We are not dealing with that issue.\n  I had passed an amendment as part of the immigration bill to provide \n400,000 jobs over a 2-year period for young people. That is a start. We \nhave to go a lot further than that. By and large, we are failing \nworking-class, middle-class young people today who are desperately \nsearching for jobs.\n  For minority youth--for African-American youth--if my colleagues can \nbelieve this, the official unemployment rate for ages 16 to 19 is over \n43 percent--over 43 percent, African-American young people, unable to \nfind jobs. That is unacceptable.\n  Our goal must be to make sure the youth of this country, if they \ngraduate high school and they want to go out into the workforce, are \nable to get decent jobs or if they choose to go to college, to be able \nto afford to go to college, and to make sure our young people do not \nend up on street corners doing drugs--not in jail, not in self-\ndestructive activity. That is our job, to make sure those who have the \nability and capability are able to go to college and others are able to \nget meaningful work. Frankly, we are failing in both of those areas. \nWhen we do that, we fail not only the young people of this country but \nthe future of this country because the future by definition is with our \nyoung people.\n  All of us know we live in a highly competitive global economy. If \nthis country is going to succeed economically, we need the best \neducated workforce in the world. Unfortunately, compared to much of the \nindustrialized world, we are doing very little to make that happen.\n  In June, the OECD--the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment--released its annual snapshot on the state of education in \ndeveloped nations. The report showed the United States is losing ground \nto other nations that have made sustained commitments to funding higher \neducation opportunities. We are losing ground, and the legislation on \nthe floor today, which will result over a period of years in a strong \nlikelihood that interest rates for student loans will go up, making it \nharder for moderate and low-income kids to go to college, will only \naccelerate those losses.\n  The United States once led the world in college graduates. Thirty, \nforty years ago, we led the world in the percentage of our people who \nwere college graduates. In fact, as a result, today those people \nbetween age 55 and 64 in the United States still lead their peers in \nother nations in the percentage with college degrees--about 41 percent. \nSo if a person is between 55 and 64, compared to the rest of the world, \nthat age group has the highest percentage of people who are college \ngraduates.\n  Tragically, over the years, we have lost substantial ground. In \n2008--and this is a very sad story indeed, something that should \nconcern every Member of Congress and every American--the same \npercentage of Americans aged 25 to 34--the same percentage of that \nyounger group--has a degree compared to the older group of 55 to 64. \nWhat does that mean? What it means is that for the last 30 years, every \nPresident, every Governor, every Member of Congress, virtually every \nparent in America has said to our young people: The world is changing. \nTechnology is exploding. A high school degree no longer will do it if \nyou are going to make it into the middle class.\n  That is what everybody has said for the last 30 years. But 30 years \nlater, nothing has changed. The percentage of Americans who have a \ncollege degree today is no higher than it was 30 years ago. The result \nis that other countries have significantly surpassed us in terms of the \npercentage of their younger people who now have college degrees.\n  In terms of the percentage of college graduates, we lag behind \nAustralia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, Israel, Japan, \nSouth Korea, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United \nKingdom. In other words, where we were once first in the world in terms \nof percentage of college graduates, we are now 15th in the world.\n  How do we compete in a global economy if we have descended from first \nto fifteenth in the world in terms of people with college degrees? That \nis why\n\n[[Page S5868]]\n\non the immigration bill we have people coming to the floor and saying: \nAmericans are not educated. They cannot do these high-tech jobs. We \nneed people from all over the world to come in to do that work.\n\n  Well, I do not agree with that, but that is the argument out there: \nOur people do not have the education. Does anyone believe in any \nserious way the bill on the floor today is beginning--beginning--to \naddress the issue of making it easier for kids in this country to go to \ncollege? The answer is nobody does because, according to CBO \nprojections, interest rates are going to go up, and, in fact, it is \ngoing to be harder for families to send their kids to college. I will \nget into that in a moment.\n  The other very important point to be made--and I think a lot of \npeople do not understand this--according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the U.S. Government is making huge profits--huge profits--from \ncollege loans. In fact, according to the CBO, the estimate is that the \nU.S. Government will make about $184 billion in profits over the next \n10 years.\n  So what do we have? We have a middle class which is disappearing. We \nhave poverty at a level as high as it has been in the last 60 years. We \nhave millions and millions of families struggling to be able to send \ntheir kids to college. My parents did not go to college. My brother and \nI were the first in our family to go to college. Millions of families \nare in the same boat.\n  What is the U.S. Government doing now? We are helping to balance the \nbudget not by asking multinational corporations--that make billions of \ndollars a year in profit and pay nothing in Federal income taxes--to \npay their fair share of taxes; no, that is not what we are doing. We \nare saying to working-class and middle-class families: Oh, you want to \nsend your kids to college? You want to borrow money from the \ngovernment? Well, over the next 10 years we are going to make $184 \nbillion in profits off of you.\n  Let me go on record as saying I think that is a very \ncounterproductive idea. It is a dumb idea. We have to get out of the \nbusiness of making profits off of struggling families who want nothing \nmore than to be able to send their kids to college.\n  Let's be very clear about what the legislation on the Senate floor \nwould do. According to CBO--and I fully agree; I do not know what \ninterest rates are going to be tomorrow, next year. You do not. Nobody \ndoes. And the CBO is by no means infallible. But the CBO and most \neconomists believe we are leaving this period where interest rates have \nbeen historically low. Are they absolutely right? I do not know. Could \nthey be wrong? Quite possibly. But that is what the CBO is estimating. \nThis is what the CBO says.\n  The CBO says the 10-year Treasury note on which this entire \nlegislation is based is now at 1.8 percent. In 2014 it will be at 2.57 \npercent; in 2015 it will be at 3.35 percent; in 2016 it will be at 4.24 \npercent; in 2017 it will be at 4.95 percent; in 2018 it will be at 5.2 \npercent.\n  Everybody has to understand that what this legislation is about is \nbasing student loans on a variable interest rate. Interest rates go up; \nstudent loans go up.\n  So let's look at what will happen with student loans under this \nlegislation. The good news is that because interest rates are low now, \nfor the next few years the interest rate for the subsidized Stafford \nloans will be, in 2013, 3.8 percent; in 2014, 4.6 percent; in 2015, 5.4 \npercent; in 2016, 6.2 percent; in 2017, 7 percent, in 2018, 7.2 \npercent. That is for undergraduates.\n  For the graduate Stafford loans, under this proposal on the floor \ntoday, in 2015, 6.9 percent; in 2016, 7.8 percent; in 2017, 8.5 \npercent; in 2018, 8.8 percent.\n  For the PLUS loans--those are for parents who are helping their \nkids--in 2015, 7.9 percent; in 2016, 8.8 percent; in 2017, 9.5 percent; \nin 2018, 9.8 percent.\n  Now, does anybody really believe that at a time when families and \nyoung people are having an enormously difficult time paying for college \nthat these interest rates make any sense whatsoever? They do not. They \nare going to put an increased burden on working families and young \npeople.\n  Today, the average student graduating from a 4-year college leaves \nschool $27,000 in debt. If you are paying interest rates of 7 percent \nor 8.5 percent for graduate school, there is no doubt in my mind that \nindebtedness will rise.\n  Furthermore, not only is it a question of families and young people \nstruggling with enormous debt--on my Web site I asked Vermonters and \npeople all over the country to tell me what the impact would be on \ntheir lives of student indebtedness. We heard just enormously painful \nstories from people who said: You know what. My husband and I wanted to \nhave a baby. We cannot have a baby right now because we do not have the \nfunds. We are paying off our student debt.\n  We heard from people who are going into professions they really did \nnot want to go into because they just have to make a whole lot of money \nto pay off their debt rather than doing what was the love of their \nlife, what they studied to do. So what we have is a bad situation \nwhich, if the CBO is correct, will only make that situation worse.\n  My amendment is not my preferred option. My preferred option would be \nto do what a majority of the Members in the Senate voted to do, which \nis to freeze interest rates for another year at 3.4 percent while we \ncome up with a long-term solution. My Republican colleagues, as they do \non virtually every piece of major legislation, chose to filibuster that \nbill, and we needed 60 votes. I think we only got 51. A majority spoke \nfor the American people, for the young people, for working families, \nbut we could not get the 60 votes. That was my preferred option.\n\n  But this approach, at least, and what my amendment would do is to \nsay, OK, between 2013 and 2014 we will keep interest rates fairly low--\nnot as low as I would want it--4.6 percent for undergraduate Stafford \nloans, 6.1 percent for graduate Stafford loans, and 7.1 percent for the \nPLUS program. It is not ideal by any means, but it is a lot better than \nwhat will likely take place in years to come. So we take the best of \nthis bill and sunset it at the end of 2 years.\n  So if people say there is no option to going forward as opposed to \n6.8 percent, I say: Sorry, you are wrong. There is an option. That is \nwhat we have done. We have a 2-year sunset on this bill that would be \nat least a reasonable compromise to give us the opportunity to take a \nhard look at the higher education bill and figure out two issues: how \nwe create low-interest loans over a long period of time and, second of \nall, how we, in fact, make college more affordable than it currently \nis.\n  Let me be a little bit political, as I finish my remarks, and say \nthis: I respect everybody's point of view, and there are different \npoints of view here. But I think what a lot of Americans are asking \nthemselves--they say: Well, let's see. We just had elections in \nNovember, and we were told elections matter. We had a candidate for \nPresident of the United States, Barack Obama, who won a very decisive \nvictory, who ran on the platform of saying: Hey, I am going to stand up \nfor the middle class. I am going to stand up for working families.\n  We had an election in which Democrats, Independents, retained control \nof the Senate. Now there are 54 votes in the Democratic caucus, and \nalmost without exception Democratic candidates--I ran--Independents \nstand for working families, stand for the middle class.\n  So what I do not understand is, when we have a Democratic President, \na Democratically-controlled Senate, why we are producing a bill which \nis basically a Republican bill--very close to what the House \nRepublicans passed.\n  As most people know, the House Republicans are perhaps the most \nconservative majority in the House that we have seen maybe ever--the \nmost conservative body. They say: This is a pretty good bill. We will \naccept it.\n  Well, if the most rightwing Congress in American history thinks this \nis a pretty good bill, I would hope that many Democrats would say maybe \nthere is something wrong with this bill; maybe we can do something \nbetter than that.\n  The other point I would make, as I did a moment ago--and people have \nto understand this--a majority of the Members of the Senate voted to \nkeep interest rates at 3.4 percent for another year. Fifty-one Members \nvoted for that. Most people assume that 51 out of 100 is a majority. \nBut we were unable to pass that legislation because of a Republican \nfilibuster.\n\n[[Page S5869]]\n\n  What we have seen on virtually every single important piece of \nlegislation is that the majority does not rule in the Senate. We need \nto have a supermajority of 60 votes. The result is legislation like \nthis, which could well end up raising interest rates for students and \ntheir families to an absolutely unacceptable level.\n  So let me conclude by saying we have a huge crisis in this country. \nThe crisis is that today hundreds of thousands of bright young people \nwho have graduated from high school are now saying--now saying--I would \nlove to go to college. I can do it. I would like to be a professional. \nI would like to be a doctor. I would like to be a nurse. I would like \nto do one of many professions. I would love to do it. I am smart enough \nto do it. I have the drive to do it. I just come from a family that \ndoes not have the money to send me to college.\n  So for those hundreds of thousands of young people whose dream it was \nto go to college, this legislation only makes that situation worse \nbecause it will make college even more unaffordable. Let's be clear: \nThis is a loss not only to those families and to those young people; it \nis a loss to our country.\n  A couple months ago I had the Ambassador from Denmark come to the \nState of Vermont to do some town meetings with me.\n  The Presiding Officer may or may not know the cost of college \neducation in Denmark in terms of out-of-pocket costs. It is zero. It is \nzero. It is not just Denmark, there are a number of countries around \nthe world that have the intelligence to understand that the most \nimportant thing they can do is invest in their young people. So they \nsay to their young people: You do well in school, regardless of your \nincome, and you are going to be able to go to the best colleges we \nhave. Not only the best colleges but graduate school, medical school, \nlaw school, and your cost will be zero.\n  You know what. I think that is pretty smart. I think investing in our \nyoung people is investing in the future of our country. That is what \nsome countries do. They make college education free in terms of out-of-\npocket cost. Other countries do not go that far.\n  I live an hour away from the Canadian border. They heavily subsidize \ncollege. So we are seeing many American kids now going off to fine \ncolleges and universities in Canada, where even for people from the \nUnited States college costs are less than they are in the United \nStates.\n  In terms of what we are demanding of young people and parents in out-\nof-pocket expenses, there is no country in the industrialized world \nthat asks more than we do. The result is that we have seen virtually no \ngain in the last 30 years in terms of the percentage of our people \ngraduating from college.\n  We have a crisis. It is a crisis which impacts millions of young \npeople: those who have given up on the dream of college and those who \nare graduating from college deeply in debt.\n  It impacts our entire Nation. It is insane to me that we are \nconceding to other countries around the world and saying: OK, you are \ngraduating large numbers of people. You are allowing them to go to \ncollege. But we in this great country, we cannot do that. It makes no \nsense to me at all. It is bad for the future of this country, bad for \nour economy, bad for millions of families.\n  The legislation on the floor today only makes a bad situation worse. \nIt is based on variable interest rates. It is, according to the CBO, \nlikely that those interest rates will rise. In 2018, we are talking \nabout subsidized Stafford loans at 7.25; graduate rates, 8.8; PLUS \nloans, 9.8. Can anybody really come to the floor and tell me this is \nwhere we want to go as a country? So we have a bad situation which we \nhave to address, not make it worse.\n  Once again, I wish to thank all of the Senators who have cosponsored \nthis legislation: Senators Leahy, Wyden, Whitehouse, Gillibrand, \nBlumenthal, Schatz, Murphy, and Hirono. I want to thank the NEA, the \nlargest educational organization in the country, for their support, and \nthe American Federation of Teachers for their support.\n  Let's stand tall today for the working families of this country who \nbelieve in the American dream, and that dream is significantly about \nthe desire of our young people to do better than we have done. That was \nthe dream my parents had. It is the dream that millions of families \nhave had. An important part of that dream is to work hard as a parent \nto enable my kid to get a college degree.\n  We are failing millions of families right now. This legislation will \nmake a bad situation worse. We can do better. We can do better. Let's \nstand with the working families of our country today. Let's reject the \nunderlying amendment, and let's pass the Sanders amendment.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent the time during quorum calls be \ncharged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, we all know that on July 1 interest \nrates for subsidized Stafford loans doubled from 3.4 percent to 6.8 \npercent. I have twice voted to extend the 3.4-percent rates to protect \nour Nation's students. Unfortunately, both times we had those votes the \nextensions were defeated. Without congressional action, the 6.8-percent \ninterest rates will stand as current law.\n  I think today we are going to vote for a bipartisan compromise to \nkeep student loan interest rates low this year. I plan to vote for that \ncompromise, but I have some concerns about it. I do want to thank my \ncolleagues who have spent many hours coming to an agreement that can \npass this body. This is a bipartisan compromise, and I think it is very \nimportant we work together to address this issue. While the compromise \nisn't perfect, our undergrads and our graduate students will be able to \ngo to college this fall with peace of mind knowing the interest rates \nare well below those they would otherwise face.\n  In fact, this compromise will save $30 billion in interest debt for \nstudents over the next 4 years. Undergraduates borrowing this year will \nsave about $2,000 over the course of their studies, and graduates could \nsave between $4,000 and $9,000.\n  Today, assuming it is offered, I also plan to vote for the Reed-\nWarren amendment to lower the cap on interest rates. I would have \nsupported Senator Murray's effort to allocate any resulting savings to \nshore up Pell grants, which would help fund those students who need it \nthe most, but I understand we are not going to be able to vote on that \namendment.\n  While today's vote is important to keep student rates low for this \nyear's students, I wish to be very clear I do not consider this \ncompromise to be a permanent fix for our students. Included in the bill \nis a requirement for a study to be conducted by the nonpartisan and \nindependent Government Accountability Office which will analyze the \ncost of running the student loan program. Once we have the results of \nthe study, we should use the information to determine what course of \naction is best for our students.\n  One thing is very clear: Any solution should not come at the expense \nof our students. Affordable higher education is one of the best \ninvestments we can make in our country. It is essential to growing this \nNation's economy, to creating jobs, and to protecting the middle class. \nOur businesses need educated workers to compete in the new global \nknowledge-based economy.\n  In an immigration bill the Senate recently passed, which I voted for, \nwe increased the number of highly skilled workers businesses could \nbring in because there is currently a shortage in this country of those \nhighly skilled workers. I supported that, but that is a crutch, a \nshort-term fix. We should be educating American students for these \nhigh-skilled jobs.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, the student loan debate is a very \nimportant one. Last year a survey found our State had the highest \naverage student debt in the Nation, at $31,408 per student. Nearly \nthree-quarters of New Hampshire students have some amount of student \nloan debt--the second highest percentage of students with debt in\n\n[[Page S5870]]\n\nthe country. We must protect our students. We should not be trying to \nsolve the fiscal challenges facing this country on the backs of our \nstudents. We can't afford to price middle-class families out of a \ncollege education.\n  Studies show adults with degrees from 2- and 4-year colleges have far \nhigher family incomes than adults who have high school degrees. In \nfact, according to a recent study from Georgetown University, people \nwith bachelor's degrees earn about $1 million more over their lifetimes \nthan those who don't have a college degree. We need to get rid of any \nbarrier that stops students who want to pursue degrees.\n  Recently, I met a woman named Anne, from Manchester, who had been a \nrecipient of student loans. She was able to go to school and get a \ndegree because of Pell grants. Anne will quickly tell you that without \naid she would never have even thought about pursuing a college degree. \nShe is now working in a professional capacity and she is contributing \nto her community in so many ways. Unfortunately, Anne is now worried \nabout her daughter, a single mother who works part-time and who has \nlimited options to pursue her own dream job because of the high cost of \neducation. Anne told me:\n\n       These kids are our future. We cannot limit them in this \n     way; student loans should not be an obstacle that is \n     insurmountable.\n\n  She is right. We need to make it easier and more affordable for \nAmericans to go to college, not harder and more expensive.\n  I also heard from a woman named Patricia. She is 45, a single mother \nwith three children under 18 years of age. She is currently a student \nat Granite State College who is relying on loans to get her degree. For \nthe past 10 years, she and her family have been in and out of homeless \nshelters. She grew up as the youngest of nine children in a family \nwhere the option of college was never even considered or discussed. \nPatricia has an incredibly tight family budget. Student loans are \ncritical to her getting a degree and ultimately being able to provide \nfor her family. Sadly, any increase in student loan interest rates \ncould limit Patricia's ability to continue her education.\n  The bottom line is clear. We all know it. We have to make college \nmore affordable. It is essential for our students, it is essential for \ntheir futures, and it is essential for the future of this country. If \nwe expect to compete in this global economy, we have to make sure we \nhave the high-skilled workforce we need, and that means making sure \nthose young people who want to go to college can afford to get that \ndegree. It is just too important for our country's future to fail at \nthis.\n  I thank the Chair, and I would just note that I will be voting for \nthe bill, but as I said, I certainly hope we are all committed to \nmaking greater progress and making college education more affordable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1778 to Amendment No. 1773\n\n  Mr. REED.

Madam President, I am pleased to offer this amendment, \nalong with Senator Warren and 18 of our colleagues. Our amendment would \nprovide the kind of certainty students deserve and that they will not \nreceive under the proposed bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act as it \nis currently drafted.\n\n[[Page S5871]]\n\n  Simply put, our amendment will ensure that students and parents will \nnot be any worse off than they would be under the current fixed rates \nof 6.8 percent or 7.9 percent. To illustrate this, let me present a \nchart.\n  Under the underlying legislation, Stafford loans for students are \nessentially subject to the same interest rates, and they are depicted \nhere. These are the undergraduate loans in yellow and the graduate \nloans in white. We can see in the first year for the undergraduate \nloans it is just under 4 percent, and that is less than the 6.8-percent \ncurrent statutory limit. For the graduate loans, they are up roughly \nabout 5\\1/2\\ percent, which, again, is below that. But very quickly, by \n2015, the graduate loans exceed this 6.8-percent threshold. That is the \ncurrent law. Then it keeps going up and up and up.\n  Actually, this chart does not represent the entire impact because the \nlast bar represents the estimates not just for 1 year but for 5 years. \nSo we can see these increments--the white increments for the graduate \nloans--keep going up and up and up indefinitely. This is permanent \nlegislation. This is not a 5-year fix or a 10-year fix. It is permanent \nlegislation. A similar process is that the undergraduate Stafford loans \ngo up and up and up and up.\n  Our legislation will simply say if you want to provide an incentive \nand a benefit for students who are today going to school, that is \ncommendable, but at some point we are going to have a much worse deal \nfor students than we have just with the current law. So we are \nproposing, very simply, to cap at 6.8 percent the Stafford loans and \nthen at 7.9 percent for the parent PLUS loans.\n  This is a projection of the percentage interest rates for parent \nloans. Again, 2013, it is below the present 7.9-percent statutory \nlimit, but quickly, by 2015, it is above, and then it is indefinite. \nFrom 2018 to 2023 and beyond, it goes up and up and up and up. Our \namendment simply says if we want to give everybody a benefit in the \nnext several years of lower rates, do it, but let us give real \ncertainty that rates will not exceed the current statutory rates.\n  As I have indicated previously in my remarks, I wish to commend the \nauthors at least for putting in caps on rates.\n  Some of the original proposals coming from the Senate Republicans and \nother places had no real caps in place. At least now we have caps.\n  I want to particularly thank Chairman Harkin, because he committed \nhimself to ensuring that all these loan programs have a cap. Our point, \nthough, is the caps are so large that effectively students and parents \nin a very short period of time will be paying much more than they are \ntoday. These caps are too high. They could go as high as 8.25 percent \nfor undergraduate Stafford loans, 9.5 percent for graduate Stafford \nloans, and 10.5 percent for PLUS loans. Those are significantly higher \nthan our threshold. We can do better. We want to protect students from \nthese high interest rates.\n  In Rhode Island, roughly 49,000 students will borrow for this coming \nacademic year. They would benefit from this approach, but their \nbrothers and sisters, who may be freshmen in high school, will be \ntaking out loans when the interest rates will be exceeding the current \nrates.\n  Adopting the Reed-Warren amendment means students can benefit from \nthese low rates initially, but then we will have the existing statutory \ncap in place for future generations. As it exists now, if you are a \nsenior in high school and you are going to college next year, you are \ngoing to get the benefit of the rate, but your younger brother or \nsister, who may be a freshman or junior in high school, and your \nparents are paying for it in the future, and will be paying \nindefinitely.\n  As my colleague Senator Warren has pointed out, they are doing it in \na situation in which the government is making billions of dollars a \nyear on these loans. This is not a question of putting subsidies in. \nContrary to the history and purpose of the student loan programs, we \nare actually reversing the subsidy. We are saying, No, the students \npay.\n  Education is so important to the future of America, yet we are no \nlonger going to invest in it as a Nation. We are going to let students \npay. That is the way this whole approach has been structured. They \npicked as their benchmark the 10-year Treasury bill. Typically, we use \nthe 91-day Treasury bill. Just in the baseline, there is a higher \ninterest rate. Then they picked a premium to put on top to compensate \nthe government for potential risk of loss. As some of my colleagues \nsuggested, we are not quite sure what the premium should be, and we \nfeel very strongly that premium is much too high for the actual risks \nand costs of the program. So this proposal has baked in higher interest \nrates for some students after the first 2 years, and for all students \nand parents in the long run.\n  I believe what we are doing in the Reed-Warren amendment makes a \ngreat deal of sense. Many people are struggling in many different ways, \nand particularly students are struggling with student debt. We should \nensure that the new rate structure does not leave students worse off--\nand not just for the first 2 years, but let's be realistic and serious. \nLet's look down the road. This road is taking us to higher and higher \ninterest rates for students. I think we can do better. I think we must \ndo better.\n  I would point out that we have paid for this amendment by putting a \nvery small surcharge of 0.55 percent on incomes over $1 million, so \nthis is fully paid for, and it will give students the real certainty \nthat they will not see interest rates go beyond the present statutory \nlimits.\n  I think what we should be doing as a Nation is not shifting the \nburden to students but investing through students in our future. We \nknow if students are able to go on to college and to postgraduate \neducation, they are going to make more money, they are going to \ncontribute more to the economy, we are going to be more globally \ncompetitive, and we will be in a much better position.\n  Frankly, that was the wise judgment our parents and grandparents made \nwhen, in the 1950s, 1960s, and the 1970s, they decided to invest in the \nfuture of America by investing in higher education.\n  I daresay there are very few people in this Chamber who in one way or \nanother did not directly benefit from that investment. But now we are \nsaying today, No, it is on the students, they are going to pay market \nrate premiums, and, according to CBO numbers, we will be generating \nabout $184 billion--the difference between our borrowing costs and what \nthe students and families are paying. That is not the way to grow a \nstrong, prosperous America.\n  Because there have been elaborate studies, we also understand that we \nhave a jobs gap already between highly educated individuals and the \njobs. By 2020, there will be about a 5-million-jobs gap between those \njobs requiring higher education and the projected graduates in the next \nseveral years going forward.\n  So we have to do much more, and I think we also have to look at the \nissue in a comprehensive way. We have to build in incentives for lower \ncosts at colleges and universities. That is not being done in this \nlegislation, and I think once we pass it, the likelihood of getting on \nto that issue is diminished.\n  We also have to try to come up with ways in which students can \nrefinance loans. A trillion dollars of student debt has surpassed \ncredit card and automobile debt as the second biggest household debt in \nthe country, and that is going to grow. It will particularly grow under \nthe underlying proposal. We have to figure out a creative way to do \nthat. And, by the way, that is going to cost money. So if one of the \nprinciples and premises of this whole legislation is we will spend no \nadditional money for higher education support, how are we going to fix \nthat issue of students and families who are deeply in debt--not just \nthose who are carrying the debt today but those who are going to \naccumulate the debt going forward?\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Reed-Warren amendment. This \nwill be the certainty that is proclaimed in the title of the underlying \nlegislation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I want to start by saying to Senator \nReed how much I appreciate his leadership in putting forth this \namendment\n\n[[Page S5872]]\n\nthat takes a bad bill and turns it into something that will be helpful \nfor our students and for our families struggling with student loan \ndebt.\n  I also want to say how much I appreciate the leadership of Senator \nHarkin, Senator Durbin, Senator Manchin, Senator King, Leader Reid, all \nof whom have worked very hard and made best efforts under very \ndifficult circumstances. We had a better bill that passed the Senate, \nbut it was filibustered by Republicans and, as a result, we are where \nwe are now.\n  Today the Senate will vote on a plan that would fundamentally change \nthe way government sets interest rates on student loans. My colleagues \nwho support this proposal say it will lower interest rates on loans for \nthis year, and that is all that matters. That is the same thing credit \ncard companies said when they sold zero-interest credit cards, and it \nis the same thing subprime mortgage lenders said when they sold teaser-\nrate mortgages. In all these cases, the bill comes due. Nobody disputes \nthe fact that within a few years, according to our best estimates, all \nstudents will end up paying far higher interest rates on their loans \nthan they do right now.\n  I want lower interest rates for students. With more than $1 trillion \nin existing student loans, our students are drowning in debt. We must \nfind a way to address this crisis by lowering the interest rates, \nrefinancing existing student loan debt, and bringing down the cost of \ncollege. But I cannot support a plan that asks tomorrow's students to \npay more in order to finance lower rates today. And I cannot support a \nplan that raises interest rates on students in the long term while the \ngovernment continues to make a profit off of them.\n  According to official government estimates, the Federal Government \nwill make $184 billion in profits off student loans over the next 10 \nyears under current law. This is obscene. Students should not be used \nto generate profits for the government. We should be doing everything \nwe can to invest in students and to offer them the best deal we can on \nstudent loans, not find more ways to make money off them.\n  I am a realist about this. I know that eliminating those $184 billion \nin profits is going to be hard. The government and our Republican \nfriends liked having that money to spend. I know that it will take time \nto wring the profits out of the system, and I know it will take \ncompromise. But the plan before the Senate today is not a compromise, \nand it doesn't remove a single dime of profits from the student loan \nprogram. That is not an accident. It was designed that way, on purpose, \nwith the high interest rates in the future, to preserve every penny of \nthat $184 billion in profits. I want a compromise that actually saves \nsome money for our students.\n  In fact, the plan we will vote on makes even more money off the backs \nof our students--an additional $715 million over the next 10 years. \nThat is right; the total profits of the plan we will vote on are nearly \n$185 billion.\n  Some have sought to minimize these profits. They say this money is \nonly a fraction of what students will borrow in the next decade. But I \nhave spent months talking to families in Massachusetts, and it doesn't \nlook small to them--families who are already squeezed by the economy \nand who are fighting to put kids through college, young graduates who \nare struggling to buy a home, buy a car, or to put away a little bit of \nsavings in the future. That money should stay in their pockets, not go \nto the government. These students don't think that $184 billion in \nprofits is small change. These students don't think adding another $715 \nmillion on top of these already huge profits can be ignored as rounding \nerrors. These numbers are not abstractions, they are real dollars \ncoming out of the pockets of hard-working Americans. Middle-class \nfamilies work hard and pay their taxes, and now they have to pay an \nextra tax--an extra $184 billion tax to put their kids through college.\n  Meanwhile, this plan asks for nothing from our biggest corporations \nwhich take advantage of loopholes in the Tax Code to avoid paying their \nfair share. It asks for nothing from millionaires and billionaires who \nget away with paying less taxes than their secretaries. It asks for \nnothing from the enormously profitable companies that get billions of \ndollars in subsidies from the government every year. It is our kids--\nour kids who are trying to get an education--who will pay more.\n  Senator Jack Reed has introduced an amendment that would change this. \nHis amendment would substantially improve the plan before us today. His \nidea is a simple one: It would cap interest rates on all Federal loans \nat their current levels. These caps would allow students to get a good \ndeal right now while the interest rates are low. But the caps would \nalso ensure that when interest rates go up in a few years, as we all \nexpect them to, our students will still be protected.\n  The Reed amendment is the only way to ensure that no students will be \nworse off under the new plan than if Congress did nothing at all. It \nmakes sure we don't pit our students against each other, making \ntomorrow's students pay more so today's students can get a break.\n  Senator Reed's amendment creates these protections for students by \ntaking a chunk of profit out of the student loan system and replacing \nit with 55/100th of 1 percent--about one-half of 1 percent--surtax on \npeople whose annual income is more than $1 million.\n  This amendment would turn this bill into a true compromise. It does \nnot come close to taking all the profits out of the student loan \nsystem, as I would like to see, but it is a very good first step in \nthat direction.\n  Like most of the things we do around here, this is a choice. Anyone \nwho says we can't afford this amendment is in effect saying it is more \nimportant to keep making profits off the backs of our kids than to ask \nmillionaires to pay a tiny bit more. These dollars have to come from \nsomewhere--college kids or millionaires.\n  A vote against this amendment is a vote in favor of higher interest \nrates for our students. A vote against this amendment is a vote in \nfavor of making profits off the backs of our students. I don't believe \nthat is how we build a future. I believe we build it together.\n  I support Senator Reed's amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, as we know, Congress has trouble with \ndeadlines. That is why we always seem to be missing them. When we have \ntrouble finding a permanent solution, we seem to kick the can down the \nroad, hoping to find a solution later.\n  We are here today trying to fix the problem we have with the \ngovernment student loan programs because we kicked the can down the \nroad last year, and if we do not stop and start fixing things, we will \ncontinue to do it. That breeds a lot of uncertainty into the minds of \nthe families and the children who are trying to go on and better \nthemselves. The result was that on July 1 rates on government-\nsubsidized undergraduate Stafford loans doubled to 6.8 percent. That is \na fact. That is what we know we are dealing with, and we are trying to \nreverse that.\n  Not surprisingly, it set off alarms. My goodness, we all got excited \nabout this. What are we going to do? We had a year to do it, but we \ndidn't do anything; we just extended it--3.4 percent and only for the \nStafford subsidized loans and nothing for other loans people were \ntaking. When you consider that 11 million students who are trying to \nbetter themselves are borrowing money every year, we were only talking \nabout 1 million. That was all we were trying to help. We forgot about \neverything else.\n  It is time to fix it today with a ``yes'' vote on the bipartisan \ncompromise we worked out. It is really tripartisan--Democrat, \nRepublican and Independent. That is pretty special around here, if you \ncan get everybody agreeing and moving in the right direction.\n  Let me explain what the bill does and what this bipartisan compromise \nwill do. We can lower the rate for all undergraduates--all of them--\nfrom 6.8 percent, which is where it is right now, to 3.8 percent. So we \nunderstand, that\n\n[[Page S5873]]\n\nmeans a savings of $2,000 in interest for the average freshman student \nwho starts college this year. Remember, doing nothing and voting \nagainst the long-term fix means that the 11 million students who will \nbe borrowing money for this school year will pay a higher rate than \nthey have to.\n  Let's look at the amount of people we are talking about, and the \nmoney. This is what we are actually talking about.\n  The legislation, the bipartisan plan, has been scored and we know \nthis first year saves $8.1 billion that students will not have to pay \nin interest. That we know. For the first 4 years of this plan, 2013 \nthrough 2016, it is $31.8 billion. By doing nothing, that is what we \nare leaving. We are making the students pay that much more by doing \nnothing. Anything else we do other than the bipartisan, this is the \ntype of money they will be paying in higher interest rates and more \nobligations on the families.\n  All of us understand the importance of education. It is what has made \nAmerica the land of opportunity. All of us want to help students go as \nfar as they can with their talent, as far as their talent is going to \ntake them. That is what brought so many of us together to come up with \nthe tripartisan fix, if you will, for the student loan program.\n  We all understand that the student loan rates are only one piece to \nthe issue of making college more accessible and more affordable for all \nAmericans who want to further their education. We will get to the other \npieces when we debate the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, \non which Senator Harkin has been working so hard. I truly look forward \nto having those discussions, but today we have to know what we are \ndealing with. We are dealing today with something that has an immediate \nimpact on the pocketbook of student borrowers and their families--\npeople who need to borrow money to go to school. That is what is in \nfront of us. We talked all over and around it. We are talking about \naccounting principles. We are talking about everything that needs to be \nlooked at. But it is not going to change what we are dealing with today \nbecause this bipartisan agreement truly has savings that families need.\n  As I said, it is probably more accurate to call our proposal \ntripartisan, and I am proud to do that with all of us working together. \nIf you think bipartisanship is hard work and hard to get around here, \ntripartisanship is like hitting the trifecta; that is the megabucks. We \nare doing something really right when we can get all three sides going \nin the same direction.\n  This legislation is a long-term fix that is fair, it is equitable, \nand it is fiscally responsible. We all agreed on a set of priorities \nwhen we began our negotiations--that is everybody: Democrats, \nRepublicans, my colleagues on my side of the aisle, the Democratic \nside, who have other proposals. What we all agreed on is that the \ninterest rate should be as low as humanly possible. We also agreed that \nthere should be strong front-end caps on interest rates to protect \nstudent borrowers in high interest rate environments so that it does \nnot just run wild with them. It has a cap of 8.25 percent, which has \nbeen historic for some time. We kept that cap.\n  We ensured that the government did not profit or lose money on the \nloans. I think that was a big thing, that we all came to agreement. \nSome of the bills we had, had anywhere up to $16 billion of profit \nbuilt into them. That money was going to go to debt reduction. We said \nbasically that every penny we can reduce in the interest, that money \nshould go right back toward education for the student, and we have done \nthat.\n  I admit there is no legislation that is perfect. I have been around \nthis process for many years, and I have never voted on a perfect piece \nof legislation. But I tried to get the best we possibly could that made \na difference and made sure we can get it passed, and we have that \ntoday. It is a good piece of legislation. Anything else that we think \nneeds to be fixed that we have talked about, we can do that when we do \nthe reauthorization of the Higher Education Act under Chairman Harkin, \nwhich will be looking at everything.\n  Here is how good this bipartisan--tripartisan--compromise is. The \nundergraduate Stafford loans, both subsidized and unsubsidized, are \nbased around the 10-year T-bill plus 2.05 percent, which would yield a \n3.86-percent rate for this year. The current rate is 6.8 percent; now \nwe are at 3.8 percent.\n  Let me show another chart. Nearly 8 out of 10 undergraduate borrowers \nwill have both sub and un-sub loans, while only 1 out of 10 will have \nsubsidized loans. That is how many students will have just the \nsubsidized loans. That is what we thought we were fixing when we froze \nit at 3.4--that is all the people we helped. I don't think a lot of us \nunderstood. Some people thought it helped everybody, and it did not. \nOnly subsidized is this, the Stafford subsidized. Those who borrow only \nunsubsidized is this. But if you look at those who needed both, this is \nwhat we are talking about--6.5 million more students we are helping and \nserving through this bipartisan--tripartisan--piece of legislation, the \ncompromise.\n\n  This is what we worked to do. How could we help? You want to help the \nmiddle class? This is where the middle class is. This is where the \npeople are who need to have the assistance, this is where they come in, \nand I think we have done a very good job at doing that.\n  We still have the PLUS loans. We have the graduate unsubsidized \nloans. Right now the graduate unsubsidized Stafford loans are paying \n6.8 percent. Under our legislation they will be paying 5.4 percent. If \nyou look at the PLUS loans today, the PLUS loan current rate is 7.9 \npercent. Under our bill it is 6.4.\n  One hundred percent--every student--11 million of them who are \nborrowing money--will be benefited by the bipartisan agreement. \nEverybody benefits. That is what we tried to do.\n  Our plan keeps in place the IBR, which is the income-based repayment \nplan.\n  Let's say you graduate after years and you borrowed a lot of money. \nYou have a lot of debt. You get a job that pays $40,000, and you have \ntwo kids now. We put in a protection that basically says they can only \ncharge you--you only have to pay 10 percent of your disposable income. \nWith a $40,000 income, with two children, that can be as low as $142 a \nmonth. Now, $142 a month--let's say that with the economy, the job you \nhave that is where your heart and desires are--after 20 years it is \ncompletely forgiven. After 20 years, you made a good effort and maybe \n50 percent of your loan is still owed. The taxpayers are picking up \nthat. When people are saying that we are not helping, that we should be \nsubsidizing higher education, we are doing that and I think with \ntremendous help.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said our bipartisan proposal will \nsave the government $715 billion over 10 years with $1.4 trillion of \nmoney that will be borrowed, and $700 million--that is over 10 years, \nand that is $70 million a year. That is about as close as they are able \nto come. What that really amounts to--let me give it to you this way. \nIt might be better. Over the 10 years, $715 million means that the \nFederal Government--if someone says: Oh, but they are making a profit, \nover 10 years the Federal Government will make $2.76 on each loan. If \nwe can get it to zero, we will take it to zero. We don't make a penny. \nThat is about as close as we can get working with the numbers we have.\n  We should not deny students starting college this fall $2,000 in \nsavings for the sake of a principle. You say we are making $2.76 over \n10 years, so they should not have the $2,000 in savings? It doesn't \nmake sense to me.\n  Chart No. 3. This indicates that the average freshman in 2013 who \ngraduates in 4 years will save over $2,000 on our plan--$22,000 versus \ncurrent law, $24,000. In the years ahead, the interest rates on newly \nissued Federal student loans will be tied to the U.S. Treasury 10-year \nborrowing rates plus add-ons to offset costs associated with defaults, \ncollections, deferments, forgiveness, and delinquencies.\n  What we are talking about is--what they are saying is that rates are \ngoing to go up. CBO projects this. They projected it before. If \neverything that you are hearing--and they say that rates will go up; \nthat is where the difference of about $500 comes in. That is the \ndifference. That is in the worst-case scenario that the $500 would come \nin. Setting the rates to the market borrowing\n\n[[Page S5874]]\n\ncosts is fair, and it is equitable and sustainable as long as we have \nstrong borrower protections, and it is fiscally responsible.\n  This way, Washington doesn't wind up profiting from students or \nlosing money on them. Depending on the methods of accounting that you \nuse--you heard how much money we are making on this and that. Let me \nexplain a little bit about the accounting procedure. The student loan \nprogram either generates $184 billion, if you used the Federal Credit \nReform Act--and I will say the Federal Credit Reform Act has been the \nway the CBO has scored for the last 23 years. For 23 years that is the \nway it has been done. If you use fair value accounting, which some have \nbasically supported and want us to change to--even CBO has pointed \ntoward that--there would be a $95 billion loss. There is a $280 billion \nswing between what some people say we are making in excess profit; \nothers say we will be losing money, it is not paying for itself, and we \nare still subsidizing at the $95 billion rate.\n  That is a tremendous swing. We are not going to fix that. Senator \nHarkin will look at all of this, and we will be able to address all of \nthis in the comprehensive bill. We should all agree it is simply not \nfair to make a profit on the backs of students, and we agree on that, \nand that is why no matter what happens in the market in the long-term, \nthe Senate compromise--and we fought hard for this--on the front end, \nthe Senate compromise includes an interest rate cap of 8.25 percent. \nMuch of this is important because there will be approximately $140 \nbillion in new loans issued every year, which means $1.4 trillion in \nloans will be issued over the next 10 years.\n  In just a few short weeks students will be returning to school, and \nthey will have plenty to worry about: what books to buy, where their \nclasses are, how to haul all their stuff to all the rooms, and much \nmore.\n\n  There has been so much discussion and argument. We will be voting on \namendments that are based on what will happen after 4 years.\n  This chart shows what the CBO said the interest rates would be. In \n2003, we start at around 4 percent. They felt they would go up to 5.8, \nto 5.9 percent, and level off for the past decade, which is from 2003 \nto 2013. This is actually what happened. If we locked into some of the \namendments some of my colleagues, whom I respect, are telling us to \nlock into, no one would ever be able to take advantage of these \nhistoric lows. We are able to adjust that based on the market rate \nrather than just a fixed rate.\n  These are the things we don't know, but we know we are going to score \n$31 billion in savings in the first 4 years. We do know that. This is \nhow far they have been off before, so there is no science in this. If \nanyone thinks this is the gospel, it is not.\n  With a ``yes'' vote on our legislation today, there is one less thing \nstudents and their families will have to worry about: what the interest \nrate will be this year and how it will be calculated for years to come. \nWe all came here to help our constituents do what we believe is right. \nWe all agree that ensuring college remains affordable and accessible \nfor this generation and future generations of Americans is the right \nthing to do. There simply is no better investment we can make than the \neducation of our children and grandchildren.\n  We will count on today's students to be the driving force of American \ncreativity and innovation in the years ahead. Some bedrock values \ndefine America, and one of them is pretty fundamental: We believe in \nopportunity. We believe everyone who wants to work hard and play by the \nrules should have a shot to succeed. To make good on that American \npromise--the promise of the American dream--we must do all we can to \nensure that students can have an affordable education.\n  With a vote today on this bipartisan--more appropriately a \ntripartisan--agreement to lower the interest rates on all student \nloans, we will take a large step in the right direction. That is why I \nurge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan, tripartisan, \nagreed-upon legislation that helps students in the future.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the effort that my \nfriend Senator Manchin has done to reach a conclusion. I hope we reach \nthat conclusion today.\n  I was a university president for 4 years before coming to the \nCongress. There are 11 million families--between now and the start of \nthe school year--who will be making decisions on how these programs \nwork, so they are very impacted by what we do. Working together to make \nthis happen is important, and I will be supporting that.\n  I am glad to be a cosponsor of this bill that deals with \nscholarships, but I wish to talk quickly about one other topic and then \nI have another topic I came to the floor to talk about.\n\n\n                Remembering Officers Chestnut and Gibson\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Fifteen years ago this week, we had two of our Capitol \nPolice officers killed in this building. Officer Jacob Chestnut and \nDetective John Gibson were killed. An intruder came into the building, \nand these two people, trying to protect and defend others, were killed. \nLater today there will be a moment of silence in honor of them and at \nthe same time remembering all of those who do this every day for us.\n  I happened to be working in this building on 9/11. I was one of the \nlast people to leave the building that morning, and I remember the \npeople who were still here when I left were the Capitol Police. I \nremember one of the policewomen I saw as I was going out the door--\nIsabelle said: You need to get out of the building as quick as you can. \nBut she was still here.\n  Officer Gibson actually died in the doorway of an office that was my \noffice for a couple of years in this building. I moved into that office \nshortly after he and his family both made the sacrifice that all of \nthose who work here to protect us are willing to make.\n  The other thing I would like to say is that in light of all of that, \nthis building was kept open for people who were not only from the \nUnited States but from all over the world to come and see. One of the \nthings Congress appropriately never talked about after that tragedy \nwas: What do we do to keep people out of this building? The discussion \nwas: What do we do to let people continue to be in this building, and \nwe will be remembering that day.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise principally to talk about the fact \nthat today President Obama is pivoting back to jobs and the economy in \na series of speeches in Illinois, Florida, and in my State of Missouri.\n  He will be speaking at the University of Central Missouri at \nWarrensburg today, and I am glad he is. I was there recently. This \ncampus always hosts Girls State and Boys State. It is one of our great \nschools. Warrensburg is a great community. I am glad he is there, and I \nam glad the President is going to get to see that.\n  These speeches the President is giving sound an awful lot like the \n2012 campaign speeches. I think we need to move beyond that. We need to \nnot just pivot to the economy, but we need to stick with the economy. \nMissourians and all Americans are concerned about the economy and for \ngood reason.\n  In June, a Gallup poll found Americans continuing to say the economy \nis the biggest problem facing the country. Certainly, if we look at \nwhat we ought to be focused on in our domestic agenda of what we are \ngoing to do for America, private sector jobs have to be at the top.\n  The President has pivoted--and I think usually the press and maybe \neven the administration were pivoting to jobs and the economy--to the \neconomy and has done that a lot over the last several years. It is sort \nof like he goes to this issue and then he goes away from it. I believe \nthat when he is there, he is talking about the right thing, but he has \nto talk about the right thing all the time if he wants the right thing \nto happen.\n  There is an old saying that even a stopped clock is right twice a \nday. The President and the administration's focus seems to be like \nthat. Occasionally, we come around to the right topic, but then we \nquickly get to other topics.\n  In May of this year, the President pivoted to jobs during his middle-\nclass jobs and opportunity tour. In February, he pivoted to jobs during \na State of the Union Message. In June of last year, he pivoted to jobs \nduring a campaign speech in Cleveland, OH. Aides said he was framing \nthe speech but didn't have\n\n[[Page S5875]]\n\nany new proposals. That was the way that speech was described that day.\n  In September of 2011, President Obama pivoted to jobs during a speech \nbefore a joint session of Congress that was held to bring attention to \njobs, where he said he wanted to vote on a $447 billion jobs package.\n  In August of 2011, the President pivoted to jobs during a speech at \nthe White House following a Senate debt ceiling vote, and then he had a \nMidwest bus tour.\n  In January of 2010, he pivoted to jobs amid news that unemployment \nreached 10 percent in the wake of what I think was clearly a failed \nstimulus plan. It was a stimulus plan that didn't work. During the \nspeech, he announced there would be more tax credits for clean energy \njobs.\n  The December before that, he pivoted to jobs during a White House \nforum for business leaders. I think I read somewhere this morning that \nwe could count as many as 18 pivots to jobs. We need to pivot to jobs \nand stay with it.\n  When the President is talking about private sector jobs, he is \ntalking about the right thing, but what he says after pivoting to jobs \nis what matters. Hopefully, tomorrow the President will still be \ntalking about jobs. Hopefully, the President will talk about jobs every \nday in the next week and longer until we get this done. We need to stay \non the economy until we get it done.\n  Action speaks louder than words, and unfortunately the record is not \nas good as we would like it to be. We have lagging job creation and \ndevastating manufacturing loss. The economy is now adding jobs again \nbut barely enough to keep up with the numbers of people going into the \nworkforce. Manufacturing has been particularly hard hit, despite the \nPresident's goal of adding 1 million new manufacturing jobs by the end \nof the second term. I would like to see that happen. If the President \nstays focused on that as the premier domestic topic every day for the \nnext 3\\1/2\\ years, it might, but it will not if he doesn't.\n  We have too much debt, and that doesn't help in adding jobs. We have \nadded $6 trillion in debt and saw a stimulus plan that added a lot of \nthat debt and didn't appear to create the jobs it was supposed to \ncreate.\n  As far as the health care law, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates 7 million people will lose their coverage because of \nthe health care law. The Chamber of Commerce said that more than 70 \npercent of small businesses say the health care law makes it harder and \nless likely for them to hire new employees. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says the health care law will not reduce the number of uninsured \nbelow 30 million Americans, but it is going to cost a lot of money in \nholding back full-time jobs.\n  I read articles every day in different papers that people are looking \nat part-time jobs rather than full-time jobs because of the health care \nlaw. Surely that is not what we should be doing.\n  There are energy policies that don't make sense: the continued \nblockage of the Keystone Pipeline that would have added tens of \nthousands of jobs just to build it. After it is built, more American \nenergy equals more American jobs. The President and administration need \nto embrace that concept of more American energy.\n  Republicans in the Senate and House are united in calling for \nprogrowth policies such as replacing the President's health care plan \nwith something that will work. Encouraging more American energy of all \nkinds--from renewables to solar to wind--is important. We need to also \nunderstand that traditional sources of energy will be the main source \nof energy for the foreseeable future and that will grow our economy--\napproving things such as the Keystone XL Pipeline, stop overregulating \nin ways that hold our national energy policy back.\n  Obviously, we need to rein in wasteful government spending, give \nAmericans more economic certainty, and simplify. There is much we can \ndo. We need to simplify the Tax Code. There is a lot we can do.\n  I say to the President, it is time to keep talking about jobs. I hope \ntoday is the first of lots of days in a row when we are talking about \njobs but also doing the things that help create private sector jobs, \ndoing the things that help create an environment where people want to \ntake the chance to create an opportunity because our society needs to \nbe about that.\n  By the way, it is the private sector jobs that do that. The public \nsector jobs are fine, and I am glad to have one right here, but public \nsector jobs don't pay the bill. They are the bill. Private sector jobs \nare where we need to go, and I encourage the President to stick with \nthe pivot this time.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the student loan issue, \nand my time should be allocated to the time of Senator Alexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, we have been hearing really two debates \naround here the last few days--in fact, over the last few days and \nmonths--about student loans. Both are important, but they are separate, \nand I think they need to be separate and thought of as two separate \ndebates as we consider the issue before us this afternoon.\n  The first and larger issue is the cost of college. It is too high. \nEveryone agrees to that. In fact, the cost of college--of higher \neducation--has exploded in the last 30 years.\n  In a former life, I used to interview people for a living on \ntelevision. In the 1980s I interviewed the financial aid officer at one \nof our Maine colleges. He made a very interesting point.\n  He said: Angus, if you look back over the last 40 or 50 years, the \ncost of a private college education in the United States has almost \nexactly tracked the cost of a new Ford automobile. In the 1950s, $1,500 \nbought a car and a college education. In the 1960s, about $3,000 bought \na car and a college education. That relationship continued into the \n1990s. Then something happened because today a new Ford is about \n$18,000 and a private college is approaching $60,000, something like \n$58,000.\n  That is a real problem for all of us. It is a problem for parents. It \nis a problem for students. It is a problem for the government that \nsupplies the loans. It is a problem for Pell grants. It is a problem \nfor all of us. It is one we need to discuss. But that is not the issue \nbefore us today.\n  There has been some discussion in this bigger debate about college \ncosts and what the Federal role should be. Should it be to support and \nhelp students go to college? Indeed, we have had this discussion for \nthe last 25 or 30 years, going back to the time of Pell grants, which \nwere designed to help students--particularly low-income students--go to \nschool. We have had various iterations of the student loan program. At \nfirst it was lodged in the banks, and it was a guaranteed student loan. \nThen some years ago it was made exclusively a Federal loan.\n  I can make the arguments--and we have heard some of them on the \nfloor, including from the Senator from Vermont, who very eloquently \nmade the argument that we need to make college accessible. We should do \nthat, but not in the context of the discussion we are having today \nabout student loans. It is a larger issue. I am sure Senator Harkin and \nhis committee are going to take that up in the reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Act later this year.\n  I can be very passionate and persuasive about the importance of the \naffordability of college. In fact, I would argue that the GI bill, back \nin the early 1950s and late 1940s, is one of the most important \neconomic development investments this country ever made because it sent \na whole generation of young Americans to college, and it was the \nmainspring of our great economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s.\n  The problem now, though, if we are talking about massive new Federal \nsupport for higher education--it runs into three problems, it seems to \nme, that we are going to have to examine and think about as we move \nforward in this debate. One is financial, another is political, and the \nfinal one is economic.\n  The financial problem is we are broke. Every dollar we spend--in \naddition to what is being spent now; in\n\n[[Page S5876]]\n\nfact, including about 30 percent of what we are spending now--is \nborrowed. So if we are going to significantly increase Federal grants \nor subsidies to students, they have to come from somewhere else. I \nheard Senator Carper speak yesterday about this.\n  He said: Do we really want to say, OK, we are going to cut Head Start \nin order to give funds to students? Are we going to cut somewhere else? \nHow are we going to make those kinds of allocations?\n  Every dollar must be borrowed, and that is just the financial reality \nwe are in today.\n  The political reality is we are in a situation of divided government. \nThe central reality of our political times is nothing happens in this \ncity without votes from both parties. It is simple arithmetic. We have \na President who is a Democrat. We have a House of Representatives that \nis controlled by Republicans, and we have a Senate with a majority of \nDemocrats but with important powers to the minority party. So the \nbottom line from all that is nothing happens without bipartisan votes. \nSo as much as we--or any group, whether it is the Democrats, the \nRepublicans, or our two Independents--as much as we might want \nsomething, if it doesn't have bipartisan support, it is simply not \ngoing to happen. That is the reality.\n  That is indeed the reality that drove Joe Manchin and I to begin \nthese discussions about 6 weeks ago when we were talking about student \nloans. There was a Democratic proposal which didn't get enough votes, \nthere was a Republican proposal which didn't get enough votes, and \neverybody walked away. I was haunted by the experience of the \nsequester, where the same thing happened: Democratic proposal, \nRepublican proposal, everybody hates the sequester, but it is \nhappening.\n  So we believed we had to open some discussions because we have to \nfind a way to get enough votes to get a proposal through the Congress \nso students aren't facing way higher interest rates this month than \nthey should be. No action, make no mistake about it, means students \nwill be paying dramatically higher interest rates than they should be, \ngiven the current cost of money. Why? Because Congress fixed an \ninterest rate.\n  I would argue the last thing Congress should ever do is fix an \ninterest rate. It will always be wrong--either wrong for the students \nas it is now, dramatically, or wrong for the taxpayers at some point in \nthe future. We can't predict what interest rates can or should be, and \nfixing a rate, which is what we are facing now--6.8 percent--is \nalways--at this point, as I said, is dramatically wrong for students.\n  In terms of the political realities around here, my dad was a \nlifelong poker player. One of the things I learned from him--one of the \nguiding principles of my life--is you have to play the hand that is \ndealt. The hand that is dealt us right now is that it takes both \nRepublican and Democratic votes to get anything through the Congress. \nThat is the reality, and that defines our ability to get things done. \nIt doesn't mean we can't get things done, it just means we can't always \nget our way, and compromise has to be part of our lexicon.\n  The final issue about whether we want to create a massive new support \nprogram for college education is economics. I am not saying this is a \ndispositive argument, but I think it is something we have to think \nabout. The explosion of college costs I talked about that started in \nthe 1990s corresponded, to a large extent, to the availability of \nadditional money for scholarships and loans and grants, and \nthe colleges essentially ate it up. We can go through great effort to \nfind money to increase Pell grants by $1,000, and we will all feel good \nthat we have done something for the students. But if the colleges \nincrease their costs by $1,000, nobody wins. The Federal Government and \nthe taxpayers are out $1,000. The students are in exactly the same \nposition they were in before. They still have to find the difference \nbecause the money has just been eaten up by the increases in costs.\n\n  I think that is why we have to be thinking about what the \nimplications are of the actions we take. Just saying we want to give \nmore money to students for college--if, indeed, that money immediately \nturns into higher costs and higher tuition, nobody has gained, least of \nall the students because they end up with this huge debt burden.\n  We can and should have this discussion. It is an important one. But \nit is not the discussion before us today. The discussion before us \ntoday is pretty simple: Do we want to continue a program that has fixed \nrates at 6.8 percent when currently rates are running more in the 3-\npercent range?\n  In other words, do we want to balance the Federal budget for the next \n4 or 5 years on the backs of our students? I don't think we should do \nthat. I think we have come up with a proposal that doesn't do that--\nthat dramatically benefits students as long as interest rates are where \nthey are, and it protects students on the upside.\n  I try to always think about problems as if we didn't have all of the \nhistory and we simply had a blank sheet of paper and said: How should \nwe go about this? How should we structure a student loan program in the \nFederal Government if we didn't have all the back-and-forth and the \nhistory and the fixed rates and all of those things?\n  It would seem to me if we sat down in a room with a group of bright \npeople, they would say: Well, No. 1, the government is going to have to \nborrow this money that it then lends to the students because we are \nbroke. Therefore, in order to be fair to the taxpayers and the \nstudents, the students should pay what it costs the government to \nborrow the money, plus a little bit for the cost of administering the \nprogram and the risks of default. That is exactly where we landed in \nthis proposal.\n  People talk about market rates. Yes, there are market rates, but it \nis the 10-year Treasury bill, which is one of the lowest rates in the \ncountry. This isn't the prime rate. This isn't LIBOR. This is one of \nthe lowest borrowing rates we can ever have. It is the borrowing rate \nfor the U.S. Government, which heretofore anyway has had a pretty good \ncredit rating. Therefore, the students are guaranteed that they will \nalways be below the outside market. If they went to a bank for a loan \nwith no collateral, no cosigning, no job, the rates would be much \nhigher than what we are talking about.\n  By the way, it is important to understand, because there has been so \nmuch discussion about this, that this is not an adjustable rate \nmortgage. If we can manage to pass this bill and get it through the \nHouse and get it to the President in the next week to 10 days, once a \nstudent signs up for a loan this fall their rate for that loan will be \nfixed at 3.86 percent for the term of the loan--for the term of the \nloan.\n  It is true that the following year, if they need another loan, that \nrate will be the T-bill plus 2.05 percent for the term of that loan. In \nother words, the loan rate doesn't change each year according to the \nrates. I think that is an important distinction. I think there has been \nsome confusion about that. In addition, there are provisions in current \nlaw which this bill doesn't change that allow for forgiveness of \nstudent loans under certain circumstances, depending upon how long the \nloan has been in place and the employment a person has, as well as \nlimits on how much a person has to pay as a percentage of their income.\n  As I said before, I don't believe Congress should be setting rates.\n  Let's talk about the effect of this proposal on students. The first \neffect is that it will cut almost in half the rates students are going \nto have to pay for their loans this year, from 6.8 percent to 3.86 \npercent, as this side of the chart shows. So a freshman going to \ncollege starting in 2013--this year--this is what they would pay for \ntheir total loans under this proposal.\n  It says ``bipartisan''; it should say ``nonpartisan.'' This is what \nthey will pay under current law. That is a dramatic difference. That is \nmoney out of the pockets--billions of dollars out of the pockets of \nstudents over the next 2 or 3 years.\n  Everybody says, well, what if rates go up? Rates might go up. They \nmight stay the same. They might go down. But even if they go up, under \nthe projections of the Congressional Budget Office, here is a student \nstarting college in 2017, and they would pay a little bit more under \nour proposal--it is the difference between $24,800 and 24,295--about \n$500. This difference is about\n\n[[Page S5877]]\n\n$2,000. This is money in hand. This is maybe, depending upon what \nhappens with interest rates--what is worth more, $1 billion in hand or \n$1 billion in the bush? I think it is $1 billion in hand because these \nare the rates kids are going to have to face right now.\n  I think this is a great deal for students. No. 1, it dramatically \nlowers the rates in the early years. No. 2, thanks to the hard work of \nTom Harkin, who negotiated like a tiger, there is a cap on the upside. \nSo students aren't subjected, if rates happen to go way up--as they \nhave occasionally but not very often in our recent history--into double \ndigits, there is a cap of 8.25 percent.\n  So the students enjoy the benefit of the low rates, but their \nexposure to the upper rates, to too-high rates, is capped. I think that \nis a sensible and prudent and beneficial proposal for students.\n  The savings to students next year will be something like $8 billion \nor $9 billion; otherwise, if we do nothing this week, that is the \namount they are going to have to pay.\n  The future is uncertain, but I think it is important to talk about \nprojections of interest rates because a lot of the discussion is that \nthe students are going to have to pay so much more because the CBO \nprojects interest rates to go up. By the way, even on the CBO's \nprojections for undergraduates, the rates would never hit the cap. They \nwould be in the low 7s--very close to where the present rate is.\n\n  But let's just talk about CBO interest rate projections because that \nis what is driving a lot of the anxiety around here. Here is the CBO. \nLet's pretend it is 2003--10 years ago--and we go to the CBO and say: \nWhat are you projecting for interest rates--just as we did a few weeks \nago? Here is what they projected. They said: Well, interest rates are \nat about 4 percent, but we think they are going to go up around 5, 5.5, \n6 percent. That is the projection CBO used in 2003. OK.\n  The good news is, we know what actually happened. Again, starting in \n2003, here is the actual cost of interest rates. Look at the \ndifference. If we were basing our decisions on projected interest \nrates, look at the huge difference that took place, and all of this \nrepresents money in the students' pockets as opposed to fixing the \nrate.\n  So, yes, the projections are that they will go up, but we do not know \nthat. I would take money in hand anyday against a possibility that \nthere might be a payment later on. And we do not know that. It could go \neither way.\n  If interest rates go way up, as I said, the cap kicks in. The cap of \n8.25 percent is very close to the 6.8 percent we have now. It results \nin about--I do not know--$20 a month difference between the cap and the \n6.8 percent, if, indeed, we go all the way to the cap.\n  I think this is a prudent and responsible proposal. It is the best of \nall worlds for the students because they get low rates now, and they \nget a cap if rates go up. I think it makes sense for the taxpayers. I \nam perfectly willing to have the debate, to have the discussion about, \nA, what do we do about college costs, and, B, should the Federal \nGovernment be playing a greater role in terms of support for students? \nI think that is a very honest discussion.\n  But this is called the student loan program. It is about loans. And \nthe implication of a loan is that it is to be paid back with some \nreasonable rate of interest. Pell grants are grants, and we have tax \ncredit programs that are, in effect, grants. This is one part of the \nstudent aid puzzle, and what we have before us today is a prudent, \nsensible, beneficial program for the students.\n  I will conclude by saying the choice is very clear because if we do \nnot act on this bipartisan proposal that we believe will have a \nreceptive ear in the House of Representatives--we know the President \nsupports it and is ready to sign it tomorrow--if we do not move this \nbill, nothing happens, nothing happens during August, students are \nsigning up for loans at almost double the rate they should be. I think \nthat is unfair to students, and I think they sent us here to solve \nproblems. This is one I believe we can tackle. We can and have solved \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized on the student \nloan bill. The time can come out of the Manchin-Burr amendment. I am \nnot sure exactly how we are allocating time.\n  Let me take this opportunity to thank the cosponsors of the bill: \nSenator Alexander, Senator Coburn, Senator Carper, Senator King, and \nSenator Manchin. Without this bipartisan approach, we would not be here \ntoday. It has not been lost on me that four of the six cosponsors are \nformer Governors. They recognize the importance of education. They \nrecognize the importance of students having access to that education. I \nthink all of them are stalwarts as it relates to good education, and I \nthink they recognize, as do Senator Coburn and I, that this is a good \nbill. It is good policy, the Manchin-Burr-King-Alexander-Coburn-Carper \nbill.\n  Let me take a minute to share with my colleagues or remind my \ncolleagues where we are today. Senator King just did it. Under current \nlaw we are at 6.8 percent for all undergraduate students. It is higher \nfor graduate students. It is higher for PLUS loans. A month ago, we had \na bifurcated system where some undergraduates paid 6.8 percent and \nother undergraduates, who were considered subsidized, paid 3.4 percent. \nI would suggest that is morally wrong. I think collectively what we did \nwas we said: How can we come up with a system that shows the equity we \nbelieve in and that provides a financial benefit to all students who \nparticipate?\n  So I say to my colleagues, I want to point out the single most \nimportant part of this bipartisan bill or nonpartisan bill is the fact \nthat for two students seated side by side--one whose parents have a \ndifferent income level than the other one's parents--we treat them both \nthe same.\n  For the one who has a lower income level, as Senator King said, they \nqualify for Pell grants, for education tax credits, for loan \nforgiveness, for a lot of different things. But from the standpoint of \nthe rate the Federal Government charges them to borrow money to go to \nschool, we treat them the same. I think that is what we are supposed to \ndo.\n  If we did not treat them the same--let me back up for a second--and \nwe were treating this one at 3.4 percent and this one at 6.8 percent, \nunderstand that this one can only borrow $3,500 at a subsidized rate. \nWell, you are not going to enter any college today for $3,500. It is \nnot going to happen. So you are going to have to borrow a little more. \nIf you borrowed the maximum you can get, it is $5,500 in your freshman \nyear. So you are going to get $3,500 over here, and you are going to \nget $2,000 over here but you are going to pay 6.8 percent.\n  What the bipartisan or nonpartisan bill does is it provides every \nundergraduate with, this year, 3.86 percent. In the case of the \nsubsidized student, they are not, as before, borrowing at a lower rate \nfor some money and a higher rate for other money, actually subsidizing \nthemselves. And for the undergraduate who is not subsidized, they are \nnot paying way more than they should for their college loan.\n  So what did we do? We used the 10-year bond, with market forces. I am \nnot sure there is a fairer way to do it--fairer for the student, fairer \nfor the institution, fairer for the American taxpayer. We tied it to \nthe 10-year bond, and we got an add-on which is reflective of the cost \nto run the program and the risk of the loan. We hope every student pays \nit back, but that does not always happen. What we tried to be is good \nfiduciaries for the American taxpayer.\n  Within that, as Senator King said, they are capped. If you are an \nundergraduate, it is capped at 8.25 percent. It came out a little \nhigher than that. But the tradeoff for doing that, in comparison to \nwhat my colleagues in the House have done, is that when you take out a \nloan this year at 3.86 percent, that is your interest rate for the life \nof the loan. We do not readjust it on an annual basis. This is like \ngetting a 15- or 30-year amortized loan for a home mortgage. We are not \ngoing to come in and change the rules on you and say: Well, the United \nStates wants more interest in the future. But it does mean, just like \nin a home mortgage purchase, if you buy one this year, the likelihood \nis, the one you buy next year might have a different interest rate \nbecause the market has changed.\n\n  I think the American people can deal with that because it is \npredictable. It\n\n[[Page S5878]]\n\nbrings with it some certainty. You can calculate it on your own. As my \ncolleague said, the last to set rates is the Congress of the United \nStates. We should not be in that business. It should be market forces. \nWith this legislation, it will be.\n  I sat over here trying to think of just the one phrase I would say to \nmy colleagues is the primary reason they should support this bill and \nprovide this benefit for the American people. I wrote down two words: \nfinancially sustainable. You see, in 2007, Congress created the current \nstudent loan program rate. A year ago--after we had extended the \nprogram because it ran out for 2 years--we said: Well, we are going to \nfix it. We are going to have a long-term solution. Then, all of a \nsudden, we did a 1-year extension. The Senator from West Virginia was \nthe most vocal person. He said: What happened? We were going to fix it. \nWe did not fix it. Thank goodness that is why, when it came up this \nyear, there was such outcry over the fact that now is the time to fix \nit if we are going to do it. Let's go ahead and fix it.\n  Well, what is the test of: Did we fix it? I would suggest to my \ncolleagues, it is financial sustainability. Can this withstand the test \nof time? Today we need that certainty from the standpoint of Federal \nspending, from the standpoint of the American taxpayer. But we also \nneed it from the standpoint of America's children.\n  We are speaking as much to the 10-year-old as we are to the 18-year-\nold. The 18-year-old may be a freshman next year. The 10-year-old has \naspirations, down the road 8 more years, that they are going to have \nthe ability to go to college. We want to provide them with the \ncertainty that there is going to be a student loan program out there \nthat is equitable and fair that they can participate in and not \nquestion whether, in fact, it will exist. I think with the option we \nhave on the table, we will be able to say that from one generation to \nthe next.\n  I know we will consider this afternoon a couple of different options. \nI want to urge my colleagues. I think there will be two options from \nthe standpoint of plans you can choose. If you believe equitable \ntreatment is right, then the bipartisan bill is the one you need to \nsupport. If you believe financial sustainability is important, then the \nbipartisan bill is the one you need to support.\n  I think if you tick down all the things you probably ought to look \nat--what makes it most affordable; what is best for the students--I \nthink what you will find is it is the bipartisan bill.\n  There has been a lot of work put into making it a long-term solution. \nI want to urge my colleagues. Congress changes every 2 years. That is \nthe length of ``long term.'' But let's not put into law a sunset on \nthis in 2 years. That is the other amendment. Why would we say we have \ncome up with a great plan, one that sort of passes the test of \nequitability and sustainability, and then turn around and say: But we \nare going to sunset it in 2 years? Congress has the ability, with every \nnew Congress, to look at any piece of legislation and change it. Let's \nmake that the function of what we learn from this and not prejudge it \nand say: Let's cut it off in 2 years.\n  I am going to conclude because my colleagues are here to speak on the \nprogram as well. I thank the cosponsors--the four Governors and Senator \nCoburn. Without their help we would not be to this point. I thank the \nleadership on both sides of the institution--the majority leader and \nthe minority leader and those who have brokered the ability for us to \nbe here today. Without them, we would not be considering what I think \nis the best piece of legislation to address the challenges we have for \nstudents in need of loans for college this year and future years.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I come to the floor today to speak again in support of \nthe permanent solution to the student loan program. Like my colleague \nfrom the great State of North Carolina, I think that is exactly what we \nhave with the bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act.\n  I want to acknowledge all of those who worked so hard to come \ntogether and support this legislation. It is actually not bipartisan, \nit is tripartisan. Former Governor King is an Independent, so you have \nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents all in support of this \nlegislation. That is what it takes. It takes people coming together \nacross the aisle doing good work. That is what they have done here to \nput this legislation together. I am pleased to be supporting it.\n  I come today to call on all of our colleagues to support it as well. \nThe plan provides students with dependable low-cost financing on a \nlong-term basis. That is the key. This is a long-term fix. It is called \nthe Student Loan Certainty Act because it provides just that, it \nprovides certainty for students and for families.\n  Again, let's take a minute to review how the plan works. The plan \nwould tie all student loan rates to the 10-year Treasury note rate to \nreflect both current market and employment conditions. For this year \nthat rate index would be 1.81 percent. Then both subsidized and \nunsubsidized Stafford loans would be 2.05 percent over that rate. \nGraduate student rates would be 3.6 percent over the 10-year Treasury \nrate, PLUS loans would be 4.6 percent over the Treasury rate.\n  It is important to note that the rate on those loans is then fixed, \nso you have that certainty when you take out the loan. You know what \nthe rate on that loan is going to be for the life of the loan. It is \nimportant for our borrowers.\n  Let's take a minute to compare this program with the existing student \nloan program. Subsidized Stafford loans right now are charged at 6.8 \npercent. It was 3.4 percent, but now it is 6.8 percent, because as my \ncolleague identified the program had expired.\n  We are in this situation where we are going with short-term \nextensions. So we faced these periods like right now where the program \nhas expired, so the rate for Stafford loans is 6.8 percent. Under this \nprogram, that goes to 3.86 percent this year--3.86 percent compared to \n6.8 percent.\n  The same thing for unsubsidized Stafford loans. Now 60 percent of the \nborrowers, the undergraduate borrowers, borrow unsubsidized Stafford \nloans. A lot of the lower income students who borrow subsidized loans \nalso borrow unsubsidized loans. They were paying that 6.8 percent even \nbefore the program expired. For all of those undergraduate students, \nthe rate goes down to 3.68 percent. That is a big-time savings for \nundergraduate students. Furthermore, the program is capped at 8.25 \npercent, so they have the certainty of a cap as well. They save money \nnow. As was pointed out by my colleagues, they save money now and they \nhave the certainty of a cap as well.\n  There are caps for both the graduate students and for the PLUS loans \nthat parents take out as well. In addition to the caps, there is \nanother safety net in the program. The other safety net in the bill is \nthe income-based repayment level. Under the income-based repayment \nlevel provisions, student loan payments are limited to 15 percent of \nincome. Any balance remaining on the loan after 25 years is forgiven. \nSo you have both safety nets. You have the caps and you have the \nrepayment limit provision to protect borrowers.\n  This program is designed solely for students and their families. Let \nme repeat that. This program is designed solely for students and their \nfamilies. Unlike the existing student loan program, it does not \nsubsidize Federal health care or any other program. It is for the \nstudents and their families alone, period. Again, as my colleagues \nnoted, a year ago we extended the student loan program. I was actually \na member of the conference committee for MAP-21, the Department of \nTransportation reauthorization legislation. In that legislation we not \nonly reauthorized the DOT budget, we also reauthorized Federal flood \ninsurance as well.\n  In addition, we extended for 1 year the reauthorization of the \nstudent loan program. The reason we extended the student loan program \nfor 1 year was so we could come up with a permanent solution, not so we \ncould come up with another short-term extension but specifically so we \ncould come up with a permanent solution. That is exactly what this is.\n  The bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act provides that certainty for \nstudents, for families. It is a long-term permanent fix for our \nstudents. So I join with my colleagues and I call on\n\n[[Page S5879]]\n\nboth sides of the aisle, all of us, to come together. Let's fix this \nfor our students. Let's get it in place. Let's get it over to the \nHouse. I believe they will pass it as well. Let's have this ready for \nour students as they are preparing to enter college this fall.\n  With that, again, I thank everyone who has worked so hard on this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that after I speak for about \n10 minutes, the Senator from California be recognized for up to 30 \nminutes, and following her, the Senator from Oregon be recognized, Mr. \nMerkley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Maine, the \nIndependent Senator from Maine, probably said it best when he observed \non the floor and in private conversation that if you took four or five \nof us and said forget that you are elected to public office, here is a \nproblem to be solved, we would have come up with something similar to \nthe solution that the President, the House of Representatives, and the \nbipartisan proposal on the floor today. This is a very good solution on \na very big problem that affects millions of families and about 9 \nmillion undergraduate students who are headed to college this year.\n  The bipartisan proposal makes it cheaper, simpler, and fairer for \nstudents going to college. It makes their loans more certain, because \nit locks in a rate for the life of the loan. It ends the political \nfootball game which we play every other year, it seems, on student \ninterest rates and solves the problem permanently.\n  It is based upon an idea recommended by President Obama, passed by \nthe House of Representatives, and endorsed by the bipartisan group that \nhas been working on it. I wish all of the major problems that came \nbefore us could be solved in this way. As far as cost goes, it is a big \ndifference. Two-thirds of all federal loans are undergraduate loans. \nThere are about 11 million borrowers who will take out about 18 million \nloans, because students take out more than one loan.\n  For all of the undergraduate loans, about two-thirds of the loans, \nthe rate of the loan will be cut about in half, which means if you get \na loan this year at a 3.86-percent rate, that is the rate that is \nlocked in for the entire life of the loan. It is simpler and fairer \nbecause there is a single rate for all undergraduates. Before, we had \none rate for a subsidized loan and another rate for the unsubsidized \nloan. That is confusing. It was unfair, because 80 percent of the lower \nincome students who had the subsidized loan also had an unsubsidized \nloan. So now everybody who shows up at the University of Tennessee and \nborrows money, if they are undergraduates, all of their loans will have \nthe same rate.\n  It is fair to taxpayers because we asked the Congressional Budget \nOffice to comment on what it costs the government to borrow the money \nand administer the loan, take into account the cost, and try to come as \nclose to zero as possible to the cost of issuing loans for the \ntaxpayers. They have done that.\n  It is fair to students because we also asked the Congressional Budget \nOffice to do the same thing for students. They said, we are loaning \nmore than $100 billion a year over $1 trillion over 10 years, so help \nus find a formula that comes as close to zero as practical so we do not \novercharge students and make money on the backs of students. They came \nwithin seven-tenths of 1 percent in their estimates, which is only an \nestimate, and for all practical purposes that is a rounding error. That \nis a good-faith effort to get to zero in terms of fairness to the \ntaxpayers and students.\n  But I would want to say to those who suggest it is not fair to \nstudents, let's keep in mind a few things. First, thanks to Senator \nHarkin and many of the Democratic Members of the Senate, there are caps \non the loans. So if rates go up too high, there is a limit on how high \nthey can go.\n  Second, there is, as has been mentioned, the income repayment plan \nwhich means that under the existing law today, if you take out a \nstudent loan and then you get a job, you only have to pay back about 10 \npercent of your disposable income. That is not all of your income, that \nis after you subtract your living expenses and your taxes, about 10 \npercent of what is left. If that is not enough, after paying it back \nover 10 or 20 years, depending on whether you have a public or private \nsector job, the government forgives it. So there is that cap on there \nas well.\n  Then there is the interest subsidy. About 40 percent of the loans are \nsubsidized for lower income students, which means the government, the \ntaxpayer, pays the interest while you are in college. So if you are a \nlow-income student at the University of Tennessee, you take out a loan, \nthe government will pay your interest the whole time you are in \ncollege.\n  Then there is the Pell grant. We spend about $35 billion a year of \ntaxpayer money on Pell grants which go to low-income students. So a \nstudent at the University of Tennessee may have a Pell grant of up to \nabout $5,500 or so. They might have a Hope scholarship in the State \nanother $3,000. The tuition at the University of Tennessee is about \n$8,000 or $9,000. At the community college it is about $3,000 or \n$4,000. So you can see there is relatively a lot of financial aid out \nthere before students borrow these low-rate student loans that \ntaxpayers are making available to 9 million students at a rate of 3.86 \npercent for undergraduates.\n  Then there is one other aspect in which this is favorable to \nstudents; that is, the accounting system that we use. I have heard some \nsay the government is making money on the backs of students. Let me try \nto put that in the simplest form I can. All we are doing with the \nproposal today is resetting the rates, a very simple bill with a few \npages. It is on top of a student loan system with a lot of cash going \nin and out of it, $100 billion going out this year in new loans, maybe \nabout as much coming back in, being repaid from old loans. There are \ntwo ways of accounting for that cash back and forth to determine \nwhether it benefits the taxpayers or whether it benefits the students.\n  Under the law, we have something called the Federal Credit Reform \nAct, which says the taxpayers are benefiting to the tune of about $185 \nbillion over 10 years. That is correct. That is exactly what it says. \nNot from what we are voting on today but for the underlying system that \nalready exists.\n  But the Congressional Budget Office has said that is not the way they \nrecommend measuring how we count the cost to the government of loaning \nmoney. To be specific, the Congressional Budget Office says the Federal \nCredit Reform Act estimates do not provide a comprehensive measure of \nwhat Federal programs actually cost the government, because they do not \ntake into consideration the market risk.\n  CBO says that adopting a fair value approach would provide a more \ncomprehensive way to measure the cost to the Federal credit programs \nand would permit more level comparisons between those costs and the \ncosts of other forms of Federal assistance. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says: We already use that fair value approach, which includes \ntaking into account the market risk with such things as the \nInternational Monetary Fund, the IMF, the Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram, the bailouts, as we called them in 2008. CBO uses those with \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  In other words, the nonpartisan group we rely on to advise us about \nmoney says that if we actually use the right accounting tools, the \ncurrent student loan system benefits students to the tune of about $95 \nbillion over the next 10 years, not taxpayers. So there is another \nbenefit to students. It is not true that under the recommended form of \nevaluating the cost to the government that taxpayers come out better \nthan students.\n  One other thing I would like to say--or two other things. One is, I \nwould like to compliment those who have worked on this. My colleague \nSenator Harkin, who is chairman of the Education Committee here in the \nSenate, argued forcefully for caps. I congratulate the President for \nincluding this idea in the budget and forcefully supporting it.\n  I congratulate the House of Representatives. I suppose it is not lost \non anyone the Senate is run by Democrats and the House is run by \nRepublicans.\n\n[[Page S5880]]\n\nThis is a bipartisan proposal. I like the sound of that. I think that \nshows we can get results done when we keep our eye on the ball.\n  I especially compliment Senator Burr, Senator Coburn, Senator \nManchin, Senator King, and Senator Carper for working carefully on \nthis, and Senator Durbin for his leadership in putting this together.\n  As most speakers have said, it is true that we have a larger question \nbefore us. Do we need to make some changes in student loans? It is a \nlot of money--$100 billion a year. That is a lot of money. We need to \nmake sure that it is available in the right way and that students \naren't borrowing too much.\n  Right now, if you are 20-year-old and you show up at the University \nof Tennessee in Knoxville and you want $5,500, you get it. The \nuniversity can't say to you: I am sorry, Lamar, we don't think given \nyour circumstances you are going to be able to pay that back in 10 \nyears. I can say: Give me my money.\n  This is what the law says. Maybe we need to take a look at that and \nwe need to be careful about our facts.\n  The Federal Reserve, for example, says that 70 percent of borrowers \nwith student loans today--we are in the year 2012, in the fourth \nquarter--have a balance of less than $25,000. Seventy percent of all \nstudent loans at the end of last year had a balance of less than \n$25,000. Forty percent had a balance of less than $10,000.\n  The trend is going in the wrong direction. Some students are \nborrowing too much money. But the average undergraduate loan debt is \nabout $25,000--that is the average debt--and the undergraduate student \ncan't really borrow more than $31,000, and that is two-thirds of the \nloans.\n  So while there may be some problems with the student loan program--\nand I, for one, think some students borrow more than they should--we \nhave 6,000 institutions out there, from the Nashville Diesel College, \nto Harvard, to Notre Dame, to the University of Tennessee, and we need \nto be careful that we understand exactly what the problem is, that we \nfocus in on it, we don't apply a lot of mandates from Washington, and \nthat we work with the colleges and universities. We need to find those \nuniversities, such as Tennessee Tech University, where they have a very \nlow level of student loans and others where they may have loan rates \nthat are too high. We need to make sure students don't saddle \nthemselves with too much debt.\n  But when we have a 20-year-old in Knoxville showing up who is \nentitled to $5,500 in loans for a community college tuition that only \ncosts $3,000 and he or she can put the other $2,500 in his or her \npocket and the community college can't say no, well, that is one of the \nreasons many community colleges have gotten out of the loan business--\nbecause they think that is wrong for the student. If this is the case, \nthen we in the Senate ought to look at that. Senator Harkin and I are \ncommitted to looking at student loans in the reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Act.\n  For today, if the Senate does what I hope it does, this will be a \nvictory for students. It makes loans cheaper, simpler, fairer, and more \ncertain. It stops this annual business of political football with the \nstudent interest rates. It gives students a low interest rate that they \ncan lock in over time and a cap at the top so that if rates spiral \nthrough the roof, student loans won't spiral through the roof. It is \ndone in the context of a larger system that includes Pell grants and \ninterest subsidies for low-income students. If it were based upon an \naccounting system that is recommended by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, it would tilt the whole program to the advantage of students to \nthe tune of an additional $95 billion over the next 10 years.\n  I congratulate all those who have worked on it, from the bipartisan \nsponsors, to the Republican leadership in the House, to the Democratic \nPresident of the United States.\n  I hope that we adopt it by a big vote and that the 9 million students \ngoing to college this fall will have the advantage of planning their \nlong-term futures with the lowest possible interest rate on 18 million \nstudent loans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the so-called \nbipartisan deal. I have very strong reasons for opposing it and \nsupporting the alternative, which is the Reed-Warren alternative.\n  The Senator from Tennessee said he likes the sound of bipartisan \ndeals. So do I. It feels good to get things done around here in a \nbipartisan way. But that doesn't mean, because it is called bipartisan, \nit is the right thing to do. Sometimes Democrats will have the right \nidea, sometimes Republicans will have the right idea, and we debate it.\n  I think it was interesting to hear Senator Alexander's comments. It \nwas a very interesting speech because it was part of--you know, saying \nthat it is wonderful and we are going to help students on the one hand; \non the other hand, he talks about changing the way we are doing our \naccounting to crack down on students; and then he says that in his \nState a student can get a $5,500 loan even though it only costs $3,000. \nWhat about the books they have to buy? What about transportation? What \nabout all the other out-of-pocket expenses?\n  So I listened to my friend from Tennessee, and I know he is a leader \non education, but I think he had kind of a dual message: On the one \nhand, it is wonderful to help our students. Well, maybe it is just too \nmuch of a risk.\n  I have to say that according to the information I have from my \nexperts, it is pretty tough when you take out a student loan. The \nFederal Government, if you don't pay it back, can garnish your wages \nand it can do lots of other things.\n  I am opposed to this bipartisan deal and strongly support the Reed-\nWarren measure.\n  I am pleased that a lot of people are listening to this debate \nbecause it is very important. I am going to read some of the criticisms \nof this bipartisan deal that come from outside groups.\n  The first is the National Association of Graduate-Professional \nStudents. This is what they said:\n\n       This bill falls short in preventing higher student loan \n     interest rates, especially for graduate and professional \n     students. A cap of 9.5 percent for graduate and professional \n     students offers no guarantees that our rates won't \n     significantly increase in the future. We should be \n     encouraging students to enter higher education to help keep \n     our economy growing, not deterring them with higher interest \n     rates.\n\n  The Young Invincibles also oppose this bill, writing:\n\n       Even as the Federal Government makes $184 billion off the \n     Federal loan program, students and families will be forced to \n     pay more under this bill than current law.\n\n  If you let the current law exist, at the end of the day, because of \nthe difference in caps, students will be better off in the outyears and \ninto the future. For anyone who says this is temporary, make no mistake \nabout it--Republicans have said this is permanent. We may revisit other \nthings, and I hope we do because there is a lot we should look at, such \nas the ability of students to refinance their loans. There are many \nother things I hope we can work on. But this particular deal, if you \nlook at the Republicans' own words, is a permanent deal.\n  U.S. Public Interest Group says:\n\n       We oppose S. 1334, the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty \n     Act, because it is worse than current student loan policy. \n     Current law includes an unjustifiable 10-year revenue stream \n     of $184 billion flowing directly from student borrowers to \n     the Federal Government. [This bill] does not address this \n     problem. Instead, it exacerbates it, generating an additional \n     $715 million in new revenue off the backs of student loan \n     borrowers to pay down the deficit.\n\n  They close their comments by saying, ``Enough is enough.''\n  I am sure people listening to this debate could be a bit confused \nabout exactly what we are talking about. I am going to try to go \nthrough some of the facts surrounding this debate. I think it is \nimportant that we understand what students are feeling out there. I am \ngoing to read a few.\n\n  In California, Amy and Christian Diede owe over $82,000 in student \nloans. Amy, who has a master's degree in psychology, and Christian, a \ncardiovascular nurse, say:\n\n       It's like carrying a big backpack filled with bricks all \n     over the place, and I can't ever let it go. It's always \n     there. I may get rid of a few bricks, but there's always \n     going to be more. I don't see the student loans going away.\n\n\n[[Page S5881]]\n\n\n  I have met people who are still paying off their student loans and \nthey are on Social Security.\n  Last year, Tammy Brown of Redding, CA, said the government has been \ntaking $179 out of her Social Security disability check each month for \nthe past 5 years. Brown, 52, became disabled in 1986 after being \ninvolved in a car accident. Unable to work, she fell behind on her \nstudent loan payments. She said the Social Security check is too small \nto cover her food and medical bills, so she quit taking prescription \npain pills. She said, ``It's kind of hard to live on this amount of \nmoney.'' This is a woman on Social Security disability, and what are we \ndoing in the bipartisan deal? We are laying on top of what we already \nmake from student loans an additional $715 million.\n  Joseph Luka of Portland, ME, started college as a pre-med student, \nbut he switched to mechanical engineering because the thought of \ngraduating with more than $100,000 in student loans after medical \nschool was too daunting.\n  I will return to some of the comments at the close of my time.\n  We have to ask a few questions. Why are we piling another $715 \nmillion of debt on the backs of our students--so we could stand here \nand say we did a bipartisan deal? And I know how hard it was. Yes, \nthere are great improvements from where it started. I appreciate that, \nbut we have a better deal. It is called Reed-Warren. It matches those \nlow rates you see in the bipartisan deal for the first 3 years. It \nmatches them, and then it keeps the rates down. I am going to show just \nhow much money we save students in the Reed-Warren legislation because \nit keeps the rates down.\n  Did students put two wars on a credit card? Is that why they have to \nbe punished? Were students running the banks that placed huge bets on \nWall Street, leading up to the crash? Did students create a drug \nbenefit in the Medicare Program without paying for it? Did students \ncreate and sell toxic mortgages, swaps, and securities? Oh, no, they \ndidn't do any of that, but apparently we are forcing students to pay \nfor that by tacking another $715 million on their backs.\n  I have to say, when it comes to the banks, oh, hundreds of billions \nof dollars, no problem; too big to fail. It is very hard to explain to \npeople and to students. We say we love our children and we want them to \nsucceed. And yes, we do, but we don't follow our words with actions \nbecause if we followed our words with actions, we would embrace the \nReed-Warren solution. But the handwriting is clearly on the wall, and \nwe are not going to have the votes to do that, so we are going to ask \nour students to continue to pay more and more.\n  We ought to look at what past Presidents have said about the \nimportance of education.\n  I feel I must point out that Americans have always said that our \nvalues include valuing our students. So let's go back.\n  George H.W. Bush:\n\n       Think about every problem, every challenge, we face. The \n     solution to each starts with education.\n\n  How right he was when he said that.\n  Bill Clinton:\n\n       When we make college more affordable, we make the American \n     Dream more achievable.\n\n  How right he was to say that.\n  George W. Bush:\n\n       Our country must focus our education system on helping \n     workers learn the new skills of the 21st century so we can \n     increase the job base of this country.\n\n  And Barack Obama:\n\n       The jobs of the future are increasingly going to be those \n     with more than a high school degree. We all want Americans \n     getting those jobs in the future. So we are going to have to \n     make sure that they're getting the education they need.\n\n  OK. So how about charging our students $715 million more? That really \nhelps us do what these Presidents have called us to do, which is to \nvalue our children, to value education. Two Democrats, two Republicans. \nA clear message. And, believe me, that is hard to find on a lot of \nissues. Education is key. Our students are important. They need the \neducation to get the jobs.\n\n  I am going to show exactly what this bipartisan bill is going to \ncost. I already said it is $715 million over the course of time to the \ngovernment. Let's look at how much more each family will have to pay \nunder this so-called ``deal'' compared with the Reed-Warren substitute.\n  First, let's take a look at the 10-year loan. Now, what we do on all \nthese charts is we go out to the cap because we know the caps will all \nbe reached. All one has to do is look to the experts. They have told us \nthe caps will be reached. Take the 30-year average rate of the 10-year \nnote, add on the surcharge, and, bingo, the caps will be reached in a \nfew years.\n  Let's look at the Reed amendment versus the deal. If you have a \n$15,000 loan for 10 years, under the deal you pay $1,363 more than you \nwould under the Reed amendment. If you have a $25,000 loan, over 10 \nyears you pay $2,271 more under the bipartisan deal. If you have a \n$50,000 loan--and you can get those, by the way--for 10 years, you pay \n$4,500 more.\n  So let's say you decided you wanted to take 25 years to pay back that \nundergraduate loan. Let's say you have decided you want to take 25 \nyears. You will pay, for a $30,000 loan amount, $8,400 more under this \nso-called bipartisan deal than you would under the Reed-Warren \namendment. You will pay $14,000 more over the course of a 25-year loan \nif you have a $50,000 loan amount.\n  So I am saying to the American people who might be watching this, the \nbad deal is the bipartisan deal and the good deal is the Reed deal. \nLook at how much more money an individual has to pay for a $50,000 loan \nover 25 years--$14,000 more. Some people don't even make $14,000 in \nhalf a year.\n  Let's look at what happens to graduate students, and this is why the \ngraduate students are speaking out against this. Look at this: If you \npay back your graduate loan in 10 years--and we all know the caps are \ngoing to be reached--you pay $2,500 more for a $15,000 loan, $4,200 \nmore for a $25,000 loan, $8,500 more with a $50,000 loan, and for a \n$100,000 loan you pay $17,000 more under the so-called bipartisan deal \ncompared to the Reed amendment.\n  So what we are seeing now is a breakdown of why we say it is going to \nmean $715 million more in debt on the backs of our students. I am \nshowing how it breaks down for a family.\n  This is worth looking at. If you are a graduate student--and I know \nthe Presiding Officer probably has a doctorate--and you had to go \nborrow money under this bipartisan deal, if your loan amount was \n$30,000, you would pay $16,000 more than you would under the Reed-\nWarren amendment. If you had a $50,000 loan, you would pay $26,000.\n  Look at this: If you have a $100,000 loan, which many people have--\nyou hear about what the cost is, and many people who go to graduate \nschool have this--you will pay $53,000 more under the so-called \nbipartisan deal.\n  Let's take a look at the parents--the parents who will have the \nmisfortune of having to live under this. Look at the cap. Under the \nReed-Warren cap it is a 7.9-percent cap for the parent loan. Under the \nso-called bipartisan deal it is a 10.5-percent cap. So what does this \nmean? The additional money for a 10-year loan would be $2,500 for a \n$15,000 loan, $4,200 for a $25,000 loan, $8,400 for a $50,000 loan, and \n$16,000 for a $100,000 loan. That is how much more the parents of the \nstudents would pay.\n  The last chart, to bring it home to everyone, is the parents who are \ngoing to live with this bipartisan deal unless we pass Reed-Warren are \ngoing to have to pay, over 25 years--because their cap is 10.5 percent \nunder this great bipartisan deal--$16,000 more on a $30,000 loan, \n$26,000 more on a $50,000 loan, and--hold on to your pocketbook--\n$53,000 more on a $100,000 loan.\n  Why would we not support the Reed-Warren bill? Did it cost us a few \nbucks? Yes. So we paid for the few bucks it cost us by putting in a \nmillionaire's surtax of \\1/2\\ percent. OK? But because the bipartisan \ndeal expects students to pay, and is putting the deficit burden on the \nstudents, their cap ranges up to over 10 percent for the parent loans.\n  So you might hear: Oh, Senator Boxer, it will never reach the cap. We \nwill not get to the cap. Well, I will use a--well, I will not go there. \nThat is simply not true. We will get to the cap. Why? I said before, \nthe average for the 10-year Treasury bond over the past 30 years is \n6.22 percent. That is what it is. The bipartisan deal plugs us into the \n10-year Treasury bond and adds a few dollars, a few percentage points \nfor\n\n[[Page S5882]]\n\nhandling fees, and we will get all the way up to the cap in every case. \nIt is just going to happen.\n  If you don't learn from past interest rates, you can't predict the \nfuture. CBO predicts the future. They are using the past. We have to \nuse the past. The cap will be hit. The cap will be hit.\n  So where does this leave us? We have a stark choice to make. We can \ngo with a bipartisan deal that people worked very hard on--and I \ncompliment them for all the work they put into it, believe me. We can \ngo with that deal that puts debt on the backs of our students--an \nadditional $715 million worth of debt--or we can go with the Reed-\nWarren alternative that says to students: You are already paying \nenough. We are not going to lay this on you. We figured out a way to do \nit so that you are capped at a much lower rate.\n  This is what we are talking about. This is what we are talking about. \nThe deal will take $715 million out of our students' pockets over the \nnext 10 years, and anyone who thinks that is fair should vote for the \ndeal. Anyone who can look into the eyes of a student who is already \nstruggling, who is already working, who is already asking their parents \nfor help and trying to put it all together in a package, anyone who \nthinks that is fair, then vote for the deal. But don't kid yourself. \nThis $715 million is going right onto the backs of our families. I have \nshown the charts. This is a permanent deal.\n  Senator Coburn: I am pleased Senators agreed on a permanent \nprincipled solution. On Friday, the Republican leader called this bill \na permanent reform that ties interest rates to market rates. From the \nRepublican HELP Committee, Senator Alexander called this a long-term \nmarket-based solution. They are not going to revisit this issue.\n\n  I have to compliment Senators Reed and Warren. They deserve praise \nbecause they have come up with a plan that works, that is fair, and \nthat will give solace to our students. For the undergraduate and \ngraduate loans, we will see them capped out at 6.8, and for the parent \nloans the cap is 7.9 compared to over 10 percent in the so-called \nbipartisan deal.\n  Now, I promised I was going to revisit some of the stories, and I am \ngoing to close with those stories.\n  Sandy Barnett, 58 years old, of Illinois took out a $21,000 loan to \npay for graduate school in the late 1980s. But even after earning her \nmaster's degree, Barnett struggled to find a job that paid more than \n$25,000 a year. She fell behind on her payments. She suffered through a \nlayoff, a stretch of unemployment, and the death of her husband while \nher student loan ballooned to $54,000.\n  So what are we saying to Sandy Barnett? Oh, great news, we had a \nbipartisan breakthrough and now we are going to add $715 million to \nstudent debt.\n  When Michelle Bisutti, a 41-year-old family practitioner in Columbus, \nOH, finished medical school in 2003, her student loan debt amounted to \n$250,000. By 2010 it had ballooned to $555,000. The entire balance of \nher Federal loans--over $200,000--will be paid off over 351 months, \nwhen she will be 70 years old.\n  What are we doing? Who are we fighting for? How can we make one more \nspeech on the floor of the Senate saying our students are our future? \nWe have an immigration bill that is letting in high-tech workers \nbecause we don't have enough trained American workers to fill the jobs. \nYet we are going to make it easier on students by piling on another \n$715 million of debt on their backs and on the backs of their families?\n  Emmanuel Tellez's mother is a laid-off factory worker, and $120 from \nher $300 unemployment check is garnished to pay the Federal PLUS \nstudent loan she took out for her son.\n  Aren't we proud, Federal Government? This is great. We are garnishing \nEmanuel Tellez's mother, her unemployment check, because she took out a \nFederal PLUS student loan for her son. Why don't we talk about \nrefinancing these loans? Why don't we talk about making it easier for \npeople to pay back these loans instead of having a so-called bipartisan \ndeal that adds $715 million to students; that puts it on their backs?\n  Deanne Loonin, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center \nin Boston, said she has been working with an 83-year-old veteran--Mr. \nPresident, an 83-year-old veteran--whose Social Security benefits have \nbeen reduced for the past 5 years.\n  The client fell behind on a Federal loan that he signed up for in the \n1990s to help his son with tuition costs. Loonin said the government's \ncuts have left the client without enough cash to pay for medicine for \nhis heart problems.\n  This is a national problem, and part of it is a national disgrace. So \nwhat is the solution? A so-called deal that makes it worse.\n  Last year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that \nAmericans 60 and older still owe $36 billion in student loans. Social \nSecurity checks are being garnished and debt collectors are harassing \nborrowers in their eighties over decades-old student loans. We can't do \nthis.\n  There was a recession, the worst one since the Great Depression. Yes, \npeople lost their jobs. Yes, people had problems. So why aren't we \ndealing with the underlying issues and making it easier for our \nfamilies, instead of having a deal that is cut--I wasn't part of it, \nthat is for sure--that hurts our students and their families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                Remembering Officers Chestnut and Gibson\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, in approximately 8 minutes from now we \nare going to have a moment of silence for Officer Jacob Chestnut and \nDetective John Gibson in recognition of the sacrifice they made in \ndefending the Capitol against an armed intruder.\n  I want to say how much we appreciate the forces deployed to protect \nus in our ability to share our thoughts on a host of issues that we \nspeak to on the floor. If somewhere across America someone violently \ndisagrees with us, if they decide they want to not engage in democracy \nbut engage in violence, they might come to the Capitol, and our \nwonderful force protects us and gives us the ability to speak our \nhearts and minds on this floor on behalf of our constituents every \nsingle day.\n  So not only are we paying respect today to the officer and detective, \nbut we are also paying respect to the entire delegation of security \nforces who work at the Capitol.\n  I am going to be brief in order to pause appropriately for that \nmoment of silence and tell you that the conversation we are having \ntoday is part of a broader conversation about how to build the middle \nclass in America.\n  There are some core pathways to the middle class, and one of those is \nfair mortgages. Indeed, when we were having a debate on Dodd-Frank in \n2009 and 2010, we decided to put an end to payments in which mortgage \noriginators were steering people from fair loans into predatory loans \nand getting big bonuses for doing so.\n  Today, the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nannounced that they are bringing a case against a company that was \ndoing exactly this, paying $6,000 to $8,000 per mortgage to an \noriginator so they would betray their customer and not put them in the \nbest mortgage they qualified for but into a much higher interest \nmortgage.\n  I am delighted that in this Chamber we decided to end such practices. \nI am delighted we proceeded to confirm the first Senate-confirmed \nDirector just last week so that this agency can do its job. Its \nannouncement today shows it is hard at work in this critical area of \nfair home mortgages.\n  Another key pathway to the middle class is living-wage jobs. We are \ngoing to have a lot of debate about what creates and destroys those \njobs in America because there is no program that substitutes in terms \nof a foundation for a family more than a living-wage job.\n  Another key pathway is education. Now, this is very personal to me. I \ngrew up in a working-class community. My dad was a mechanic. I still \nlive in that same community today, and I am surrounded by families that \nare struggling with near minimum wage jobs with often no benefits, \nhoping and praying that their children will be able to get the \neducation necessary to have one of those remaining living-wage jobs. \nThey are hoping we will do our job in Congress to help steer the \neconomics of this Nation so there will be more of those living-wage \njobs. But the viewpoint from the street is it doesn't look as though \nthere are going to be a\n\n[[Page S5883]]\n\nlot of jobs for those folks graduating from college.\n  They are also concerned if they send their child to college and their \nson or daughter ends up with a school loan the size of a mortgage, that \nis going to hang like a millstone around their neck and haunt them the \nrest of their life.\n  My colleague from California has just spoken eloquently to this \nissue. She has just been sharing stories of people on the ground and \nwhat they are facing in the context of how these big massive loans for \nschool are weighting down the opportunities for our children.\n  In addition, it is discouraging our children from believing that they \ncan even get that education. If they don't believe that, then they \ndon't put in the work in high school to prepare themselves to get that \nhigher education to fulfill their potential.\n  I grew up from a small child with President Kennedy speaking of a \nvision in which we could aspire to great things, of fulfilling the \nmaximum opportunity for ourselves and for our families and for our \nNation. But right now, on the ground there is an undercurrent of deep \ndiscouragement, almost desperation, not seeing a broad boulevard into \nthe middle class but seeing a cooked, broken path complete with tricks \nand traps. That is what this conversation is about: How do we create \nthat broad path into the middle class?\n  I am going to stop here, and I will come back later and talk \nspecifically about the loan program.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Moment of Silence\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nobserve a moment of silence in memory of Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and \nDetective John M. Gibson of the United States Capitol Police.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of so many of my colleagues, I \nwant to thank the security forces at the Capitol for the incredible job \nthey do in protecting these rooms where debates and democracy take \nplace.\n  The debate that we are engaged in right now is about how to create a \nbroad path to access education, as education is one of the key factors \nin developing and realizing the dream of middle-class jobs in America.\n  I was starting to share that this is very personal to me because I \ncome from a working-class family. My parents and my grandparents had \nnot gone to college. I didn't know people on my street who had gone to \ncollege. I didn't have siblings who had gone to college. I didn't know \nanything about college. But it was a scholarship, a loan, and jobs that \nenabled me to attend a university and pursue an education that took me \ninto this realm of public policy, the realm that we are still in right \nnow.\n  My first deep interest was Third World economic development, and I \nwas blessed with a chance to work in Central America and India and to \nlive as an exchange student in West Africa. Then that same education \ngave me a chance to go to graduate school, and there I was able to \nprepare for working here on strategic nuclear policy.\n  Education took me into realms that matter to our Nation, to our \nworld, and matter in terms of creating the foundation to be able to \nhave a living wage. So this is critically important to our children.\n  The proposal we have before us is that we are going to set up a loan \nprogram, and the loan program is going to take the cost of funds that \nare lent out and put on an additional 2.05-percent cap or add-on in \ninterest for those who are getting undergraduate loans. For those who \nare getting graduate loans, it is going to add a 3.6-percent spread, as \nit is called. And for parents who are getting loans to help finance \ntheir kids' education, it is going to add on a 4.6-percent spread.\n  This 2-percent spread on undergraduates, 3.6-percent spread on \ngraduates, and 4.6-percent spread on parents produces a lot of profits. \nI had my team consult with CBO to make sure the net profits of this \nprogram over the next 10 years are going to be $185 billion, and make \nsure we understand that they are taking the profits that come from \nthose spreads, the higher interest charged over the cost of money, and \nthey are subtracting out the fact that some loans will be defaulted on. \nThey are subtracting out the cost of administering the program, and \nthey end up with a net profit. How much is that net profit? It is $185 \nbillion.\n  That means we are providing a service to our students, not at cost, \nbut we are building in an equivalent of a massive $185 billion fee on \nthe children of working families who are aspiring to get an education. \nThat is not a great deal. In fact, it is a terrible framework.\n  My colleagues who have worked to put this together point out that \nright now this may be the only option compared to locking in the 6.8 \npercent for the next 10 years. In the first few years it produces a \nlower interest for our undergraduates than they would otherwise get. \nThat is an important point to observe, that for a couple of years the \nloans our students will be getting will be at a significantly lower \nrate under the deal that is being proposed today. But over the course \nof the 10 years, the best estimate from CBO of the profits generated is \nstill $185 billion, in fact $1 billion more, rounding off, than it is \nunder the existing program.\n  To those who believe this is a great long-term solution, I disagree. \nIs it better in the next couple of years? Yes, it is. But I ask you, \nexactly why do we believe that adding on $185 billion in fees as a \nprofit center for the U.S. Government is a great idea if our goal is to \ncreate an affordable pathway to higher education? I have yet to have \nanyone explain that. In fact, I often hear: Well, you know, built into \nthe existing law, which doubles to 6.8 from the 3.4 percent right now--\nthat has profits built into that too.\n  That is a fair point. But let's step back and ask ourselves, \nsustaining the situation when we are charging extravagant fees to \ngenerate extravagant profits and lock them in for 10 years, is that a \ngood idea?\n  There are a couple of proposals that would make this a much better \nprogram. One is to say, no, we are not going to have this big spread \nwith a high cap of 8.25 percent on undergraduate loans and 9.5 percent \non graduate loans and 10.5 on parent loans. But we are going to cap it \nat 6.8 percent. That makes a lot of sense. I applaud my colleague from \nRhode Island who has come to the floor to speak for that proposal, and \ncertainly I will be supporting that proposal.\n  Senator Sanders has said: You know what. This is a pretty good \nsolution for a 2-year period, so let's sunset this after 2 years so we \ncan have this debate again. Because if we lock this in for 10 years and \nif we maintain the pay-for rules of the Senate in which if you \neliminate the profit margin in one area you have to increase the profit \nmargin in another, we might never be able to unlock this and we will \ncontinue treating college loans as a profit center for the U.S. \nGovernment, so let's terminate this after 2 years. Let's sunset this \nand rethink this.\n  That is a pretty good idea too. I encourage my colleagues to consider \ndoing that. I certainly will be supporting that.\n  Nick writes to me from Oregon. He says:\n\n       After receiving paperwork the other day from DoE servicer \n     ``Direct Loans,'' I dove into my student loan [application] \n     to see what I was filling out an application for.\n       I took out $5,500 my Freshman year of college, $6,500 my \n     second year, $7,500 in my third, and $7,500 to finish my \n     senior year. So in total I borrowed $27,000.\n       In January I deferred payment on my loan because I had not \n     found full time employment.\n       With a stroke of luck, in February I landed two part-time \n     jobs making a whopping $12 per hour doing manual labor to \n     supplement my $10 per hour part time gig in the health care \n     field.\n       Since March I've been full-time with the healthcare \n     company, and earned a $1 raise. I've gained a lot of \n     experience on the job, but from a monetary perspective, I \n     wish I could be earning more so I could pay off my loans.\n       My loans are currently at 6.8 percent with a total owed as \n     of today: $32,266.\n\n  That is up from the $27,000 he had owed before. He continues, saying:\n\n       At 6.8 percent my loans are accruing over $1,800 in \n     interest each year. That's about $150 per month.\n\n  That is just the interest. Then when he is able to stop deferring and \nstart making payments and include the capital being paid off it will be \nmuch more, and on a near minimum wage job that is extraordinarily \ndifficult.\n  Here is a letter from a mother in Oregon, Melissa.\n\n\n[[Page S5884]]\n\n\n       I graduated with a Master's degree in 1993. My loans have \n     been paid off for over 10 years.\n       My husband enrolled in college when he was 36, 3 year ago. \n     He will graduate next year with over $60,000 in debt for a \n     Bachelor's degree.\n       At this rate of increase in what it costs to get a college \n     degree, I don't see how it is possible for our son, who is \n     now 2, to ever have a college experience.\n       Please do the right thing and help make education \n     accessible to everyone.\n\n  That is the plea of Melissa, to do the right thing. The right thing \nwould be to cap the interest in this program so it doesn't go over 6.8 \npercent. The right thing to do would be to sunset this program after 2 \nyears. Both of those amendments will be available to all of us here on \nthe floor. I encourage my colleagues to support those amendments.\n  Our students already face $1 trillion in debt. It is weighing them \ndown. It means they are postponing getting married, they are postponing \nhaving children, they are perhaps postponing moving out on their own \nbecause they cannot afford an apartment with this debt. It is hurting \nthe economy and it is hurting our future because children are \ndiscouraged about the possibility of going to college.\n  That is not the vision we want to have for America, where our \nchildren do not believe there is a path to the American dream for them. \nToday, if these amendments fail, it will be a very difficult choice, a \nvery difficult choice between a couple of years of interest that is \nbetter than the status quo but a program that locks in a profit center \nfor college loans, and we will have a very uncertain prospect about \nwhether we can unlock that program a couple of years from now. I hope \nwe pass those amendments.\n  I am not sure, frankly, which side I will come out on if we fail in \nthat effort. But I will tell you this. If this deal becomes law we must \nreturn to this floor time and time again because adding $185 billion in \nfees so we can have a profit off working-class students trying to find \na pathway to the middle class is wrong and deeply damaging to the \nAmerican dream.\n  I yield the floor.\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, on Wednesday, the Senate will \ntake votes in relation to the Manchin amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute to H.R. 1911, the Smarter Solutions for Students Act. I was \nunable to be present for this vote, due to a pre-scheduled commitment \nin my home State for which my attendance was confirmed before the \ntiming of these votes was set. Because my presence would not have \nchanged the outcome of either vote, I honored my previous commitment. \nHad I been present I would have voted in support of Senator Manchin's \namendment.\n  We are facing a crisis. On July 1, interest rates on new subsidized \nStafford student loans doubled, from 3.4 to 6.8 percent. Already, \nofficials at the Federal Reserve, the Department of the Treasury, and \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have all warned that student \nborrowing threatens to dampen consumption, depress the economy, limit \ncredit creation, and pose a threat to our Nation's financial stability. \nStudents and graduates in my State are already heavily in student loan \ndebt. Two out of every three Missouri students will leave college with \nstudent loan debt. At a time when a higher education is vital to \nexpanded opportunity for so many young people and with a 21st Century \neconomy that increasingly demands workers with the skills earned as \npart of a college education, we cannot make it even more difficult for \nyoung people to financially achieve a college education. We need to \nact.\n  While not perfect, the Manchin amendment is the product of bipartisan \ncompromise, forged and supported by Members from both sides of the \naisle. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation because it will \nprovide relief to our Nation's students by lowering interest rates for \nAmerica's student loan borrowers. This relief will not only apply to \nsubsidized Stafford loans; it will apply to loans to undergraduates, \ngraduate students, and the parents of students seeking to pay for their \neducation. Importantly, this legislation also includes interest rate \ncaps; without this feature, I would not have been able to support this \nbill.\n  I would have also supported the second-degree amendment put forth by \nSenators Reed and Warren because it is consistent with my commitment to \nkeeping rates low. The Reed-Warren amendment would provide certainty to \nstudents and families by ensuring that interest rates will go no higher \nthan they would under the fixed rates in current law without adding to \nour deficit. I believe this is a responsible measure that deserves \nbipartisan support.\n  To be clear, addressing the issue of student loan interest rates is \nonly one piece of the puzzle of ensuring that higher education is \naffordable and attainable to those who seek it. We must also examine \nthe issues of the rising costs of college attendance and the rapid \ngrowth of the proprietary college sector, where the share of Federal \nstudent aid payments and loan defaults is disproportionately and \nalarmingly high.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues on all of these issues. \nCongress has an important role in helping American students attain the \nhigher education opportunities they seek, to ensure that our Nation \nremain a global leader in the 21st century economy.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work of my \ncolleagues who reached today's compromise student loan plan. However, I \nwill oppose this bill, and I want to explain my reasoning.\n  The bill before us may be a good deal for current students in the \nshort term, but it hurts their younger brothers and sisters in just a \nfew years.\n  We must find a way to make college affordable for students and \nfamilies--not just for those who are attending college in the fall or \nover the next few years, but also for those who will attend college in \nthe future.\n  In Hawaii in the 2013-2014 academic year, the U.S. Department of \nEducation predicts that over 20,000 undergraduate students, over 3,300 \ngraduate students, and over 2,300 parent borrowers will take out \nFederal student loans.\n  Today's bill changes Federal student loans to variable interest \nrates, and raises caps above current law. While this bill will keep \nstudent loan interest rates low in 2013, the Congressional Budget \nOffice--CBO--projects that by 2017, the rates for undergraduate student \nloans will rise above current law.\n  The American Association of State Colleges and Universities--AASCU--\nAmerican Association of University Women--AAUW; Education Trust, The \nInstitute for College Access and Success--TICAS; United States Public \nInterest Research Group, Young Invincibles, and other groups oppose \nthis bill.\n  Under today's bill, undergraduates would see their student loan \ninterest rate caps increase from 6.8 percent today to the higher cap of \n7.25 percent by 2018. Graduate students would see their rate caps \nincrease from 6.8 percent in 2013 to a new, higher cap of 9.5 percent. \nParents using Federal PLUS loans would see their rates increase from \n7.9 percent in 2012 to a new, higher cap of 10.5 percent. At these \nlevels, future students will pay thousands of dollars more over the \nlife of their loans.\n  I am a cosponsor of two of my colleagues' amendments that would \nimprove this bill. To avoid hurting future students, I support an \namendment by Senators Jack Reed and Elizabeth Warren that would allow \nstudents to take advantage of the benefits of today's short-term low \ninterest rates, but would keep the same cap as current law. This \namendment is fully offset by a surcharge on millionaires. I also \nsupport Senator Sanders' amendment to sunset today's bill in 2 years to \nprevent interest rates from exceeding current law and to foster a \nbetter long-term solution to college affordability.\n  Government should not be making money on the backs of students. Under \ncurrent law, the Federal government already overcharges students for \ntheir student loans, to the tune of over $180 billion over the next 10 \nyears. This bill locks in that profit, plus it brings an extra $715 \nmillion to the Treasury. It is encouraging that today's bill requires \nthe Government Accountability Office to study the actual cost of the \nFederal Student Loan Program. However, only after getting this \ninformation can Congress make an informed decision to set student loan \ninterest rates with just enough markup to make the program self \nsufficient. Without knowing the true costs of the student loan program,\n\n[[Page S5885]]\n\nit is premature to lock in the arbitrary rates in today's bill for 19 \nyears.\n  Instead, a few weeks ago I voted for both S. 953, the Student Loan \nAffordability Act, and S. 1238, the Keep Student Loans Affordable Act. \nEach of these would provide a temporary extension of a 3.4 percent \ninterest rate on subsidized Stafford loans, completely paid for by \nclosing tax loopholes. Such an extension would give Congress time to \nwork toward a broader reauthorization of the Higher Education Act that \ncan address many other important aspects of college affordability and \ncompletion all at once, beyond just this interest rate debate.\n  In sum, I do not support today's bill because it makes future \nstudents worse off than current law. Instead, I look forward to working \non other initiatives to improve college accessibility and affordability \nfor our young people.\n\n\n                 bipartisan student loan certainty act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, more than 3 weeks have passed since \ninterest rates on subsidized Stafford loans have doubled for students \nnext year. Unfortunately, this rate increase has taken effect despite \nnumerous attempts by the Senate to extend the lower rates while we \ndebate a comprehensive solution to the high cost of college, including \nstudent loan interest rates. Few if any bills that make their arduous \nway through the legislative process are perfect, but the legislation we \nare considering today is, in too many ways, too imperfect. Even after \nour attempts to win approval of better options, this legislation, in \nits final form, does not offer enough to protect our future students \nfrom needlessly paying higher interest rates.\n  Education is a path out of poverty, a road to personal growth, and an \naccess ramp to professional accomplishment and economic security. No \nstudent should be denied the benefits of a college education because of \nthe cost, but unfortunately that is happening all too often. In recent \nyears, average college tuition rates have been increasing faster than \ninflation and outpacing student financial aid. Tuition rates today are \ngoing beyond the ability of most families to pay. As a result, students \nand their parents take on significant student loan debt in order to \nhave the opportunity at a college education.\n  I believe that the Federal Government has an obligation to support \nthese students by subsidizing loans for the lowest income students and \noffering programs like Pell Grants to help students who never thought \nthey could afford college. While the bill lowers interest rates for 11 \nmillion students in the near term, students and their parents by as \nsoon as 2015 will likely pay higher interest than they pay under \ncurrent law. Debt from student loans is climbing to new heights and \noutstanding student loan debt in the United States has reached nearly \n$1 trillion.\n  This debate has included consideration of two amendments that I am \npleased to cosponsor that would greatly improve the underlying \nlegislation. Senators Reed and Warren filed an amendment to reduce the \ncaps on interest rates to current levels, ensuring that students are no \nworse off under this legislation than they are today. We also have \nconsidered an amendment by Senator Sanders, which will sunset this \nagreement after 2 years, ensuring that Congress continues the important \nconversation at how best to reduce college costs for students and their \nfamilies. I very much hoped that these amendments could have been \nadopted.\n  This legislation is a mere patch on a much larger problem. We must \nhave a comprehensive debate at lowering college costs through the \nHigher Education Act reauthorization this fall. As part of that debate \nI dearly hope we address the abuses of for-profit colleges and the raw \ndeal they are giving to far too many students. While these schools are \nturning a profit and filling the airwaves with paid advertising, many \nof their students are defaulting on their federal loans because these \nschools by and large do not offer an adequate education that prepares \nstudents for the working world. Some of these schools are swindling our \nstudents, and we cannot adequately address college affordability \nwithout better regulating for-profit schools.\n  This legislation is not what I would have drafted. Under the new \nstudent loan bill, the Federal Government will make an additional $715 \nmillion in profits over the next decade, and all of the profit is \ncoming from the pocketbooks of students and their families. While I am \npleased the legislation includes a GAO study within 4 months to help us \nbetter understand the costs to the government of running the student \nloan program, so that we can better set appropriate student loan \ninterest rates that do not generate revenue for the Federal Government, \nit does not go far enough to protect our students.\n  This conversation is not completed. The challenge and the obligation \nof making college affordable certainly remains. We have a \nresponsibility to families across America to not only keep student loan \ninterest rates low in the years ahead, as they plan their finances and \nmanage their households, but to make fundamental reforms to help \nstudents and their families manage college costs. I am counting on that \ndebate, and I know America's students are, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent at the conclusion of Senator \nCarper's remarks I be recognized to use the time allotted to me under \nthe motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I think what I would like to do is try to \nset this discussion this afternoon in context if I can. One of the \nthings I focus on a lot--I know the Presiding Officer does as well back \nin Delaware--is how do we create a nurturing environment for job \ncreation and job preservation. I think that is one of the most \nimportant aspects of government. That is not the only one. One of the \nbest things you can do to help people is make sure they have a job.\n  One of the ways to strengthen our economy is to make sure we are \nmaking smart investments with Federal, State, and local moneys as well \nas public funds. One of the ways we create that nurturing environment \nis to make sure we have a world-class workforce; that folks coming out \nof our high schools can read, write, think, do math, have science \nskills, technology skills, a good work ethic.\n  Other parts of the nurturing environment include access to capital; \nthat is, to money, commonsense regulations, some certainty with respect \nto the Tax Code--a Tax Code that makes sense, is not burdensome--access \nto elected officials, modern infrastructure, broadly defined. Those are \nsome of the elements.\n  But if we are going to be successful as a country in this century, we \nneed to invest, among other places, in a world-class workforce, those \nkinds of skill sets. That is not just college, not just in \npostsecondary, it is almost from the cradle well into their lives.\n  A second area where it is important for us to invest is \ninfrastructure, broadly defined: roads, highways, bridges, rail, ports, \nairports, water, wastewater, broadband deployed all across the \ncountry--those are the kinds of investments that will pay great \ndividends in the form of a stronger economy.\n  A third area we need to invest in is research and development. We \nwere reminded by Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes \nof Health, of the kind of impact sequestration is having on our \nabilities to invest in all kinds of health-related areas and \npharmaceutical areas, medical areas. They are finding it difficult to \nmake the kind of investments needed to be made. Part of what we need to \ndo is invest in the kind of research that can be commercialized and \nturned into goods and products we can sell not just in America but all \nover the world.\n  That is sort of the context. In my view, in the end this is how we \nstrengthen our economy, how do we grow the economic pie for our country \nand citizens.\n  Going back to the first item I mentioned is a world-class workforce. \nIt doesn't start when people graduate from high school and go off to \ncollege, whether junior college or whether it is a certificate program. \nIt is what we do before they ever go the to first grade, the kinds of \ninvestments that are made before kids ever go into kindergarten, at the \nage of 5 in most States.\n  But today's debate is on college loans. I will focus on that. Let me \nremind us, the investments we do not make in the lives of children when \nthey\n\n[[Page S5886]]\n\nare young, before they ever go to kindergarten, can be demonstrated in \nHead Start. We only fund about half the kids in this country who are \neligible for Head Start, only half. We fund roughly half the kids who \nare eligible for what is called title I, special education programs in \nour schools to make sure that, if they are way behind, they have a \nchance to at least catch up a little bit. We fund half the kids \neligible.\n  Some of my colleagues said we should provide free college education \nfor people; that should be our policy. We are not even meeting our \nobligation to fund Head Start for half the kids in the country, fund \nspecial education title I for half the kids in the country who are \neligible. We have a $750 billion budget deficit this year. It is down \nfrom $1.4 trillion a couple of years ago, but it is large. It is going \nto come down for a while and then jump back up a number of years down \nthe line.\n  I think for us the question is how do we get a better result for less \nmoney in almost everything we do. In a way college loans are the \nsymptom of the problem but not the underlying problem. The underlying \nproblem is less the Federal student loan program, it is more the cost \nof education, what we are spending. My wife and I put two boys through \ncollege in the last half dozen or so years and we have a pretty good \nidea of what it costs to go to school these days. They got a good \neducation but, boy, it costs a whole lot. One of the things we need to \nbe focused on when we have this debate is what can we do to make sure \nour young people get a good education but how do we make sure it is \ndone in a cost-effective way.\n  There is some interesting work going on in places such as MIT, \nHarvard, Stanford, that I think is informing us all in that discussion.\n  Let's talk about the program before us today, the student loan \nprogram. For a number of years we set the rate cap at 6.8 percent and \nthen during the great recession we lowered that cap so the top rate \nstudents would pay on their student loans, Federal student loans, was \n3.4 percent. That period of time expired more than a year ago, June 30 \nof last year, and so the rate was supposed to pop back up to 6.8 \npercent where it had been previously as a cap on what could be charged \nto students.\n  June 30 a year ago we were not sure what to do and we said let's kick \nthe can down the road and put it off a year, the date of decision, and \nwe will decide by June 30, 2013, what the new policy should be. We got \nhere on June 30, 2013, and some were willing to kick the can down the \nroad for another year and deal with it then.\n  The President said we cannot do that. We can't keep doing that. The \nPresident said we need to put in place a policy, a commonsense policy \nthat is fiscally responsible but also that is morally responsible to \nthe least of these in our society. I think we have both a fiscal \nimperative here, given the large deficits we face, and we have a moral \nimperative here to make sure the least of those in our society have a \nchance to have the ability to go to college and get a college \neducation--be more productive in our society.\n  A lot is being said about the different rates.\n  There are two numbers we ought to keep in mind. People have said that \nin years to come interest rates will go up. I suspect they probably \nwill go up since they are pretty low at this time, but we don't know. \nWe have had Senators come to the floor and say the interest rates will \nbe this amount or that amount. Who knows. We don't know.\n  What we do know is that under the current law right now and unless we \npass something and get bipartisan support as well as the support of the \nPresident, the interest rate is going to be 6.8 percent for some time. \nIf we adopt the bipartisan proposal that a number of us are offering--\nit is a tripartisan proposal, actually, with the support of the \nPresident--the rate for the student loans this year will not be 6.8 \npercent, it will be 3.86 percent.\n  If the student takes a loan this year, that rate doesn't go up. Even \nif interest rates go up, they will owe 3.86 percent on the loan that \nstudents take out this year. If they take out another loan in the \nfollowing school year and the rate is 4.1 percent, or whatever that \nrate is, that is what they will pay on that second loan for the balance \nof the loan, whether it is 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, or 20 years.\n  As interest accrues on these student loans over the next 2, 3, and 4 \nyears while someone is in school, a reasonable question to ask is: Who \npays for the accrued interest? If the student is in school, as most of \nus have been, the interest accrues. In the past, we have had subsidized \nloans for low-income students and unsubsidized loans for those who have \na higher income. For a number of years, the student who had the \nsubsidized loan--the lower income student--would accrue interest on \ntheir loan for year 1, year 2, year 3, year 4, and year 5.\n  As for the subsidized student, the Federal Government has paid the \naccrued interest. Then when they graduate from school and walk away, \nthey don't owe that interest. It has been paid for--forgiven, if you \nwill.\n  For the unsubsidized higher income student, the Federal Government \ndefers the interest, but eventually interest--eventually it has to be \npaid by the higher income student. We don't change that. We leave that \nin effect.\n  Who pays the accrued interest for the lower income students? The \nFederal Government. When they graduate school, then they have an \nobligation to pay that interest and the principal on their own.\n  As I have talked to my colleagues, I find that not everybody knows \nwhat I just mentioned about the lower rate. As far as the example I \njust gave, if the rate for the student loan taken out this fall is 3.86 \npercent and the next year the rate is 5 percent or 6 percent, the House \nlet's the rate go up each year. A permanent, assigned rate would not be \nin effect when the loan is taken out.\n  Somebody graduates and they go to work. In this example, they find a \njob that pays $25,000. That is one person who has no spouse or kids. \nLet's say that person has $45,000 worth of debt. How much can they be \ncompelled to pay in interest starting the year after they graduate? The \nanswer is not $1,000 a month or $500 a month. The answer is $97 a \nmonth, and that is it. There is a mathematical formula where we take \ntheir income, less what the poverty level is for that person, \nmultiplied by 0.15 percent. In this case it is $97 a month.\n  Then we have this example. Let's say Sally gets married, has a child, \nand has a family of three. Let's say the family of three is making \n$40,000 a year and they have $45,000 worth of loans. How much can they \nbe compelled to pay in interest? Again, there are three people in the \nfamily with $45,000 in loans. How much can they be compelled to pay? It \nturns out to be about $120 a month. Not many people realize this is the \nlaw, and it is going to stay the law under the tripartisan proposal.\n  How about if somebody goes to work for the Federal Government or \nState government or local government or they go to work for a nonprofit \nand they do so at some sacrifice. Maybe they could make more money in \nthe private sector, but they have this urge or compulsion for public \nservice. After 10 years, their loan will be forgiven. If they are \ncurrent on their loan, their loan will be forgiven after 10 years of \npublic service. That has been the law and that would remain the law.\n  How about if they don't work in public service? What if they don't \nwork for the State, local or Federal Government? What if they don't \nwork for a nonprofit with a 501(c) designation? Let's say they are \ncurrent on their loan. After 25 years, their loan is forgiven as well.\n  We can argue about the rate we use to determine what graduates, \nundergraduates or families would pay on their loan after the student \ngraduates and whether it makes sense to peg or key that rate off the \n10-year Treasury note. I think the 10-year Treasury the President has \nrecommended is a reasonable place to begin.\n  Some have said we should use the Fed funds rate. What is the Fed \nfunds rate? That is the rate that is charged overnight when one bank \nloans money to another bank overnight. Some people say that should be \nthe rate. This is not an overnight loan from one financial institution \nto another, so I don't think the Fed funds rate is appropriate.\n  Some people said we should use a 90-day T-bill rate. This is not a 9-\nday loan. A 90-day T-bill rate may make\n\n[[Page S5887]]\n\nsense for credit card interest rates, but a 5-year, 10-year, 15-year, \n25-year student loan, I don't know that a 90-day T-bill rate makes a \nlot of sense as the interest rate for us to use.\n  Some people have said: Why don't we use a rate that might be charged \nfor a 3- or 4-year car loan? This is not a car loan that is \ncollateralized with a car. This is not a 20-, 25-, or 30-year mortgage \nthat is collateralized with a house. This is a long-term loan that is \nnot collateralized.\n  What the President has said--and I and our bipartisan group agree--is \nthat it makes sense to use a 10-year Treasury note and peg the rate off \nof that and add to that a modest fee--in this case close to 1.5 \npoints--to make sure the program is soundly run and doesn't make the \ndeficit larger.\n  We have heard about some large numbers assigned as to what this \namounts to in terms of a transfer from students to the Federal \nGovernment. The President's original proposal had a very large amount, \nunder his initial proposal, going from students to the Treasury, and he \nwas going to use that money to pay for Pell grants. We would actually \ncover the cost of the Pell grant increases. We don't do that in our \nprogram.\n\n  What we tried to do is to take the very large transfer of money in \nthe President's proposal to the Treasury and to change that and scale \nthat down and come as close as we could to eliminating it. This is \nabout a $1.2 trillion college loan program, and that is about as close \nas we could come to eliminating the transfer, if you will, from \nstudents to the government to about $600 million to $700 million. That \nis a lot of money, but out of $1.2 trillion, somebody told me it works \nout to $2.50 per student who is getting a loan. If we can bring it down \nto zero from $600 million or $700 million, that would be great.\n  Let me conclude with these thoughts: Should we have a Federal student \nloan program? I am sure some people think we shouldn't, but I think we \nshould. Should it be one where we use the Government's purchasing power \nto make it possible for people to access credit so they can go to \nschool? I think we should. Should we allow people to use the Federal \nmoney the Government borrows--should we let them have that money at \nbelow Government cost? When we do that, it makes the deficit go up and \nit makes us squeeze programs such as Head Start and the Title I \nProgram. It is like robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  I think this is a good proposal. This proposal will use the \nGovernment's borrowing power and will be able to provide a lower-than-\nmarket rate for a lot of students. Students will be able to lock in the \nlower rate. It will then provide some help--with the Federal Government \npaying for the accrued interest--for the lower income students who have \nthe subsidized loans. During the time they are in school, the \nGovernment picks it up, and they don't have to pay it back. It is \ncovered by the Government.\n  This will make sure that when students graduate and get a job that \ndoesn't pay a lot of money, there are significant limits on how much \ninterest they can be compelled to pay in a year.\n  If somebody goes to work for the Federal Government, State \ngovernment, local government, nonprofit or public service, after 10 \nyears--if they are current on their loan--it is forgiven. For a person \nwho doesn't go into public service but is current on their loan and \nstill owes a ton of money after 25 years, their loan is forgiven. That \nis not heartless or unfair. I think it is pragmatic and reasonable. I \nthink it makes sure we meet our fiscal obligation for the taxpayers. At \nthe same time, we are meeting our moral obligation for those who need \nto borrow money to go to college.\n  I think there was a UC request--as I was beginning to speak--from a \nSenator from a State smaller than Delaware. I believe he had a \nunanimous consent request to speak immediately following my remarks.\n  I yield with great pleasure for my Army buddy, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Jack Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I recognize it is a much larger State. The \nnice thing about the Senate is that we all have two Senators.\n  There has been a great deal of work put together by so many people \nhere: Senator Carper, Senator Manchin, Senator Alexander, Senator \nHarkin, Senator King, and Senator Burr. I could go on. They have been \ntrying--in a principled way--to help students. They provided short-term \nhelp, but the major criticism I have of the legislation is that it \nlocks us into the long-run, predictable rate increases and will add \nfurther to the burden that students and families are bearing to send \ntheir children, and themselves, to college and beyond.\n  Despite these great efforts, I just do not believe this approach, if \nunamended, is going to be the way we want to move forward.\n  Mark Kantrowitz is a well-known expert on student aid. His comments \nare particularly telling.\n\n       It's still going to be, effectively, an interest rate \n     increase masquerading as a decrease. Students currently \n     enrolled will benefit from the low interest rates, but as the \n     economy recovers and rates rise, today's high school students \n     could end up paying more than 6.8 percent. It's far from a \n     permanent solution.\n\n  I think he is right. I wish to emphasize the fact that as the economy \nrecovers and rates rise, one of the fallacies of the CBO projections is \nthat back in early 2000s they suggested that interest rates would stay \nvery high. They did not anticipate the collapse in 2008 and 2009 of our \neconomy.\n  Honestly, I don't think we want to premise our student lending on an \neconomic collapse. I think what we want to do is assume and hope that \nthe economy recovers, which will invariably increase interest rates. We \nare starting at the low point of interest rates, and then inevitably we \nare moving up. We are moving up as the economy recovers. We will also \nmove up as the Federal Reserve limits their very aggressive \nquantitative easing program, where they have been buying securities to \ndepress the rates.\n  If we look at the CBO projections, parents and graduate students will \nbegin paying more than the current fixed rate of 6.8 percent and 7.9 \npercent by 2015. That is not a long time. That means the young freshman \nwho is going into college next year might benefit from this proposal, \nbut the younger brother or sister who is a freshman in high school will \nbe paying much more. I think collectively, over time, since this is a \npermanent proposal, the debts that will accumulate to American families \nand American students will be significant.\n\n  We are essentially adopting a new approach to Federal policy on \nhigher education. We are not subsidizing it; we are not making it below \nmarket rates. We are shifting the costs on to students. That is because \none of the premises in this proposal, quite obviously, is that there \nwill be no cost to the government, and we are starting with the \nprinciple of a rate of 6.8 percent over time. So as we decrease rates \nfor the first few years, just simple arithmetic tells us we have to \nraise rates going forward.\n  Also, I think the way this is structured has to be considered. We \nhave chosen not a short-term T-bill rate--a 91-day rate--which is low; \nwe have chosen a 10-year rate which, in itself, is higher. So we have \nbegun our reconstruction of the rate structure by picking a much higher \nbaseline than has been consistent in the past, even with variable \nrates, and we have had variable rates in the past. Then we have added a \npremium to that to cover our costs--the cost of default, the cost of \nthe administration of the program.\n  Interestingly enough, in this proposal, there is a study the GAO is \nordered to do to tell us if our cost estimates are in any way close to \nthe real cost to the Federal Government. I think the factor is \nsignificantly sufficient that the premium--the delta, if you will--we \nare charging students is much higher than the real cost, even including \ndefault rates, to the Federal Government.\n  I think this is a proposal that, again, was generated with great \nsincerity and great diligence, but over time it does not meet the test \nof consistency with our previous support for higher education. We \nactually subsidized higher education, and we did it at below-market \nrates. We did it because we believed we had to give students a chance \nto educate themselves not only for\n\n[[Page S5888]]\n\ntheir benefit but, just as importantly, for the benefit of this Nation.\n  I would suggest--and around this Chamber I have said this before--\ndirectly or indirectly, every one of my colleagues who is of a certain \nage has benefited from subsidized student loans. If they didn't, then a \nbrother or a sister or someone did. Yet we are saying that was good for \nus, but it is not good for this generation of students. They should \nbear the risk of interest rate increases.\n  They should bear the full cost. This is at a time when we have to be \nmuch more cognizant of the centrality of higher education in terms of \nthe lifetime wages and earnings of individuals and in terms of our \neconomic competitiveness across the globe.\n  We all have reached a point that unless we adopt the amendment I \npropose, we are locking ourselves into increasing rates that go way \nbeyond the current statutory rate of 6.8 percent for Stafford loans and \n7.9 percent for PLUS loans. Even with these rates--the current rates--\n6.8 and 7.9 percent--CBO has estimated that the government will \ngenerate about $184 million in revenues. That is the difference between \nthe cost of funding and the return. It is just what it costs the \ngovernment to borrow and what they are getting in revenue from \nstudents, accounting for defaults and borrower benefits. So instead of \ninvesting in students, we are basically profiting from them, and that \npoint has been made by my colleagues, particularly Senator Warren, over \ntime.\n  As we move to this new form of rate structure--10-year Treasury bills \nplus a premium; they are capped, but they are capped at high rates--the \ngovernment will, in fact, be making even more money.\n  What I would like to do and what we have tried to do is to propose \nthat we initially freeze rates at 3.4 percent and then spend the time \nto fix this problem as best we can completely. We need to develop a \nrate structure that does not provide a huge profit, as defined between \nthe cost of funding and the revenue to the Federal Government, \nincentivize colleges to lower tuition--and that will be a very \ndifficult and challenging endeavor--and think seriously about \nrefinancing because right now we have students and families facing $1 \ntrillion in debt, and they are suffering under this situation.\n  We want to take a comprehensive approach, but this is not the \napproach. This is simply fixing rates. The one certainty in this \nlegislation is that the rates will go up--not right away, but they will \ngo up--and they could go up very quickly, and they could reach the \nlimits very quickly, and that is an additional burden on students. As a \nresult, it will begin to make college more expensive, less affordable, \nless of an option for many families and youngsters, and it will hurt us \nin the long run in terms of our economic competitiveness and our \nability to grow our economy.\n  We have had experience with market-based rates in the student loan \nprogram before. This is not new. Most recently, the market-based rates \nfor student loans from July 1, 1998, and June 30, 2006, was yield on a \n91-day Treasury bill plus 1.7 percent while the student was in school \nand plus 2.3 percent while the student was in repayment. This rate was \ncapped at 8.25 percent, and it applied to all Stafford loans--\nsubsidized, unsubsidized, and graduate. For parent PLUS loans, the rate \nwas the yield on the 91-day Treasury bill plus 3.1 percent, capped at 9 \npercent.\n  Those rates were a good deal for borrowers. Students who are repaying \ntheir loans under this system have a rate of 2.35 percent this year and \nparents are paying 3.15 percent. That is because interest rates have \ncome down dramatically. One of the reasons for that--perhaps the \nprimary reason--is because we faced an economic potential catastrophe \nin 2008 and 2009. Economic activity shrunk, rates fell, and the Federal \nReserve took a very aggressive program of quantitative easing to \ndeliberately lower interest rates.\n  Instead of using the 91-day Treasury bill, what this underlying \nproposal uses is the 10-year Treasury bill. This decision results in a \nrate that in and of itself is 1.76 percentage points higher for this \nyear alone. If we use the 91-day T-bill rate, we could lower rates even \nfurther, but we are using the 10-year rate, so we are already building \nin almost 2 percentage points of interest for students who will be \nsubject to this legislation.\n  Since May 1 we have already seen the rates on the 10-year Treasury \nbill climb nearly 1 percent. Those rates are headed upward, and the CBO \nhas projected them to rise. That is consistent, by the way, with an \neconomic recovery. So the good news is if the economy recovers, \ninterest rates will rise except it is not good news for students \nbecause their interest payments will rise. If CBO is wrong, that means \nwe will probably have an economic shock ahead of us which will be bad \nnews for everyone.\n  So I think we have to be very cognizant of the fact that there is a \nmuch better way to do this, and there should be a comprehensive \napproach.\n  What we are suggesting, and in the amendment Senator Warren and I are \nproposing, is that we at least cap the interest rates for the Stafford \nloans--for the undergraduate loans--at 6.8 percent, which is the \ncurrent rate, and for the PLUS loans at 7.9 percent so no one, \nregardless of whether one starts college next fall or 4 years from now, \nwill be worse off than the current situation with the fixed interest \nrate. I think that would be an improvement. I think, if we don't adopt \nsuch an approach, then we are locking students and families into a very \ncostly and predictably increasingly costly structure. We are not making \nany reforms with respect to the cost of college. We are not dealing \nwith the issue of refinancing.\n  Honestly, I also think to say, well, if it gets really bad, if we \nreally start hitting those caps--to say we will go back and fix it \nfundamentally ignores one of the principles that underlies this \nproposed legislation--that there be no further costs to the government. \nTo fix the interest rate several years from now, when it is 8 percent, \nagain, will cost a lot more than staying with the current 6.8 percent \nfixed rate and 7.9 percent fixed rate.\n  So for that reason, I will be opposing the underlying legislation \nunless we can make significant progress with respect to at least \ncapping the rates at 6.8 percent and 7.9 percent.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes about \nthe loan program and concerns I have about it, particularly the scoring \nconventions used by the Congressional Budget Office in its cost \nanalysis of these student loans. It is something I have looked at for \nsome time as the ranking member of the Budget Committee. We have asked \nCBO to analyze these issues and have offered the honest Budget Act, \nwhich deals with all kinds of loans, and the improper way CBO scores \nthem--not that they do it on their own, but because we require them to \nscore it that way.\n  In sum, I would say the loans that have been referred to today do not \nmake money for the government. They just do not. They are going to cost \nmoney. It is simply--and that would be a subsidy to the borrower. We \nare talking about 2.05 percent above the 10-year Treasury note, and \nthat is a good way to figure what the interest rates are. When they \nrise, the cost of money rises. It rises for the U.S. Treasury as well \nas for the people who borrow from the U.S. Treasury.\n  But the Federal Credit Reform Act, or FCRA, requires CBO to score \nthese loans in a way that gives the impression that they do, in fact, \nmake money. In a recent report on student loans, the CBO wrote to us \nthat FCRA--this is the law that tells them how they analyze the cost:\n\n       FCRA accounting does not consider some costs borne by the \n     government. In particular, it omits risks taxpayers face \n     because federal receipts from interest and principal payments \n     on student loans tend to be low when economic and financial \n     conditions are poor and resources therefore are more \n     valuable. Fair-value accounting methods account for such \n     risk. . . .\n\n  Fair value accounting methods aren't being used with these loans. In \nfact, CBO utilized a fair value accounting system--please get this, \ncolleagues: They used that system to analyze these loans in addition to \nthe system required by law, and that would show that student loans \nactually lose money for the American taxpayer. So often around here we \nhave scores that indicate one thing, and Senators advocate that they \nsay one thing, when the truth is it costs us money.\n\n[[Page S5889]]\n\n  As the Senate moves forward in this debate, it is important that it \nconsider the real costs associated with the Federal student loan \nprogram.\n  The budgetary costs of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program are \ndetermined based on accounting rules specified by the Federal Credit \nReform Act. Under the guidelines set forth there, the cost of Federal \nloans are recorded in the year in which the loans are made. The net \ncost of a student loan includes the estimated future repayment of \nprincipal and interest--the estimate of what would be repaid. The value \nof these future repayments are adjusted to reflect certain risks--the \nrisk of default and the risk of inflation. CBO cannot, however, include \nan adjustment for market risk, such as if the country has a bad \nfinancial crisis, which periodically happens.\n  Examples of market risk include the current fiscal situation: Our \nNation's current unemployment rate is 7.6 percent with 11.8 million \npeople unemployed. Some want to continue to bring in millions of people \nto take those jobs from abroad while we have 11 million people \nunemployed, and it is time for us to reevaluate that policy, in my \nopinion.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 2013 figures, the \nunemployment rate among college students shows about 1.9 million \nunemployed college students. All of these factors lead to lower loan \nrepayment rates and higher collection costs for the government. With an \ninterest rate well over 7 percent and college students struggling to \nfind work, default rates are going to increase.\n  Because the FCRA method of accounting for student loans does not take \ninto account all of the risks that are associated with making a loan, \nthe government should require that CBO adopt the fair-value accounting \nmethod. As I said, unrelated specifically to this legislation, I \noffered legislation 2 years ago to do just that because the American \npeople need to know what the cost to the Treasury will be when we make \nloans, and we know, and CBO acknowledges, that this method they are \nusing required by law is not accurate.\n  According to a June 2013 CBO report made for the Senate Budget \nCommittee entitled ``Options to Change Interest Rates and Other Terms \non Student Loans'' that I requested in my capacity as ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee, CBO admitted and acknowledged that its current \nscoring rules failed to adequately account for the cost of these loans.\n  That is just a fact. I wish it were not so. I wish we could cut these \nrates even lower than they are. But I have to say, it is not accurate \nto say the Federal Government is going to make a bunch of money off of \nit.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       [U]sing fair-value methodology represents a broader measure \n     of cost that includes the cost of market risk.\n\n  So CBO has explicitly stated it would be better to use the fair-value \nmethodology and not the other.\n  Well, does that make a difference? Does it change what the score and \nthe analysis would be? They have their official analysis based on the \nrequirements that Congress gave them, but they acknowledge the market \nrisk is a better analysis. What did they say that would do?\n  The methodological difference between FCRA--the current system--and \nthe fair-value accounting system produces alarmingly different \nresults--alarmingly different. Under the FCRA, CBO estimates that the \nstudent loan program will reduce the deficit by $37 billion in fiscal \nyear 2013 and save $184 billion over 10 years. With those results, of \ncourse, the program looks good.\n  But under the fair-value accounting procedure that CBO says is \npreferable, CBO estimates that direct student loans issued between 2013 \nand 2023 would cost the government $95 billion--cost the government $95 \nbillion. Suddenly, the student loan program, when adjusted more \naccurately for market risk, is a deficit creator rather than an income \nproducer.\n  As I say, I wish that were not so. I hate to report that. But we have \nbeen looking at these numbers for some time. I urge my colleagues. I \nknow we need to do something about student loans. We need to get it \ndone now. I am not here to try to say we should not pass anything. But \nwhat I am saying is, colleagues, we have to end this fooling ourselves \nsystem. We have to go to an honest system that the private markets \nutilize and the Federal Government should be utilizing. I am going to \ncontinue to push for that.\n  We will continue to work on this issue. I know we have a situation \nthat is very painful for students, many of whom have overborrowed. They \ndid not understand the significance of what they were doing and they \nran up more debt than they should have. As a result, they are in a \npainful circumstance, for sure. But when we do our policy for the \nfuture, and we analyze what it costs to make a loan program--what it \ncosts the taxpayers--we need to have accurate accounting.\n  If the matter is accurately accounted, using best accounting \nprocedures, this bill, as now presented, would actually cost the \ntaxpayers money rather than make them money.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are debating student loans. We are here \nhaving this debate because of Russia. How did that happen? It was \nOctober of 1957. The Russians launched a satellite called Sputnik. We \ndid not have any satellites. We knew they had the bomb, and then they \nhad the satellite. It scared us. It frightened Congress enough that \nthey created the first student loan program. Oh, there were loans given \nto GIs coming back from the war, but this was a program available to \nthose who were not veterans. They called it the National Defense \nEducation Act. It was all about Americas defense. What they said was: \nWe will loan money to students across America to go to college. I think \ntheir rationale was sound. If more Americans went to college and got \neducated, we would have the engineers and scientists we need to make \nthis a strong nation from a defense point of view and from our economy \npoint of view.\n  So I thank the Russians for launching Sputnik, and I thank the \nCongress for creating the National Defense Education Act because a kid \nfrom East St. Louis, IL, whose parents had eighth grade educations, got \na chance to go to college, and he is standing here today in the Senate.\n  It was a pretty good deal too. The National Defense Education Act \nsaid: You can borrow money to go to school, and you do not have to pay \nit back until a year after you graduate--10 equal payments at 3-percent \ninterest. I remember these because I was frightened to death in 1969, \nwhen I finished law school and added up all my student loans, and they \nsaid to me: You owe $8,500. I went home to my wife, and I said: We are \ndoomed. We can't pay that back--$850 a year. It is impossible. It was \nnot impossible. We did it. And many others did too.\n  What happened as a result of that satellite and that student loan \nprogram was a dramatic change in higher education in America in the \n1960s and ever since. We democratized higher education. It used to be \nthe only folks who went to college were the sons and daughters of \nalumni and those who were supersmart and rich. Well, kids like myself \ngot a chance all across America.\n  So now here we are today, many years later--some 50 years later--and \nwe are talking about student loans for this generation of students. We \nhave many choices before us. I happen to like the National Defense \nEducation Act. I like holding interest rates at 3 percent. I like the \npayback terms. But the number of students taking out loans and the cost \nof higher education have reached a point where we cannot do that \nwithout some serious commitment of resources at the Federal level at a \ntime when our budget problems do not give us much latitude and much \nopportunity.\n  So I sat down with a number of my colleagues--Angus King, a new \nSenator from Maine, an Independent who sits on the Democratic side; Joe \nManchin, a Democrat from West Virginia; Tom Carper, a Democrat from \nDelaware; and Tom Harkin, who is the chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and\n\n[[Page S5890]]\n\nPensions Committee, and is in charge of this subject matter. That was \nthe Democratic side. On the Republican side: Lamar Alexander of \nTennessee, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. It \nis a pretty diverse group.\n  We hammered out a bipartisan answer to dealing with student loans \nthat will be the last vote today. We will have a series of votes. That, \nI think, is the right answer because I think we have struck the right \nbalance. There are many of my colleagues in the Democratic caucus who \nare still opposed to this bipartisan approach. Some of them believe--\nand I do not quarrel with it--we should go back to the old days of the \nNational Defense Education Act. We should be subsidizing the interest \nrates. We ought to be putting a substantial amount of money into \nkeeping the cost of higher education low in terms of interest rates.\n  I do not quarrel with that. I am a beneficiary of that type of \napproach and philosophy. But we have tried to pass that in the Senate \nseveral times with the leadership of Jack Reed of Rhode Island, and we \ncannot come up with 60 votes. We cannot come up with the supermajority \nwe need to make this a viable alternative.\n  So now we have to ask ourselves a very basic question: What will we \ndo if we cannot have a subsidized Federal program? Well, I think what \nwe have come up with is a good approach. What we have come up with says \nbasically we are capping the interest rate any student will ever have \nto pay in undergraduate loans at 8.25 percent--8.25 percent--capped, no \nmatter what happens to interest rates. And we are saying we are going \nto start at an interest rate that is even dramatically lower than the \ninterest rate paid by students as of this moment. So if you vote \nagainst the bipartisan alternative on student loans, you are voting \nagainst an effort to bring student loan interest rates down from 6.8 \npercent to 3.8 percent and you are voting against the cap on interest \nrates at 8.25 percent. I do not see how that is going to benefit \nstudents. If you were offered a new home mortgage, reducing your \ninterest rate by 3 percent, you could not wait to go to closing--\nright?--because the interest you are going to pay on your home goes \ndown dramatically.\n  Our bipartisan approach is going to reduce the interest rates paid by \n11 million students and for about two-thirds of them by 3 percent. And \nthose who vote no, those who vote no to that approach, are saying: Keep \nit at 6.8 percent. How can that be good for students or their families? \nA cap of 8.25 percent on student loans for 10 years is a protection \nthat says to students in the future: The highest interest rate you face \nis 8.25 percent.\n  What does it mean in terms of savings? Our approach in the bipartisan \nbill means if you are an undergraduate student in America, over the \nnext 4 years of your education, you will save between $2,189 and $3,191 \nin interest not paid--interest not paid.\n  So those who are going to vote against the bipartisan bill are saying \nto students: Keep the rate at 6.8 percent. Do not lower it. And pay \nbetween $2,000 and $3,000 more in interest over the next 4 years. With \nfriends like that, students and their families--I will not finish the \nsentence. But people ought to think twice about this. We are giving \nstudents a lower interest rate and a guaranteed cap.\n  It is not just for undergraduates. In the next 4 years, those who are \nin the graduate loan programs will save over $4,000 in interest with \nthe bipartisan approach; and those in the parent loans will save over \n$2,000 in interest paid. So for 4 years this is a solid winner.\n  In the effort of full disclosure and honesty, after 4 years, in the \nsecond 4 years, interest rates, we project, will be going up, and the \ncost of these loans go up.\n  My position is, let's vote for this now, roll up our sleeves and make \nsure that 4 years from now we can replace it with something that is as \ngood or better. But why stick people with 6.8 percent, when we can \nbring the loan rate down to 3.8 percent?\n  At the end of the day, the groups that are supporting this bill are \nsubstantial: the American Council on Education, the American \nAssociation of Community Colleges, the National Association of \nIndependent Colleges and Universities, Rock the Vote, the United States \nStudent Association, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal \nBudget, because, you see, we are not adding to our budgetary woes here.\n  We found out this program actually generates about $715 million more \nthan the actual cost of loans, as we project them. I wish it were zero. \nBut put it in perspective: $715 million over 10 years against the \nstudent loan program that will cost us $1.4 trillion.\n  My colleague Senator King did an analysis, and I think he calculated \nit at .005 percent or somewhere in that range.\n  Mr. KING. Three zeroes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So .0005 percent. Do you know what it means to the cost \nof a student loan--that $715 million I am talking about? Mr. President, \non average $2.76 for each loan over the ten year period. So if you \nborrow $2,000 or $3,000, over the life of the loan you will pay $2.76 \nmore, but you will save $2,000 to $3,000 in interest.\n  For those who argue that $715 million is a deal killer, it is not. I \nwish it were zero, but it should not stop us. If you are frustrated \nwith the current situation, if you think there ought to be a different \nstudent loan program, work to change it. But do not be supporting a \nposition which raises interest rates on the students who are struggling \nto get by. Do not be voting against the bipartisan bill that puts a cap \non these student loan interest rates.\n  Let's roll up our sleeves in the next 4 years. Let's make sure we \ncontinue affordable interest rates for students.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I spoke on the floor earlier today about \nthe proposal that is before us. I wish to reiterate what I said then: I \ncannot stress enough that this bill represents a number of compromises \nmade on both sides to come to a solution on how to keep interest rates \nlow for students in the coming years. The compromise we will be voting \non shortly is the closest we have gotten to a deal that represents two \ncore Democratic principles related to student loan interest rates: No. \n1, the inclusion of hard, upfront caps for students, so should we \nexperience high interest rates in the future, they will be protected \nfrom those high rates.\n  Let me repeat. Under this plan, undergraduates in this country will \nnever pay more than 8.25 percent. That is what we had in the 1990s, and \nfive times we bumped up against that in the 1990s. History could well \nrepeat itself in that regard.\n  We have a hard cap. Graduate students will pay no more than 9.5 \npercent; parents and graduate students taking out PLUS loans, no more \nthan 10.5 percent--hard cap.\n  Secondly, we wanted this to come as close to deficit neutral as \npossible, and this is what we have done.\n  To show how we made compromises around here, I will say that the \nRepublicans' initial proposal that we had voted on here--and it went \ndown, as well as the initial Democratic Senate proposal went down--the \nSenate Republicans' initial proposal raised $15.6 billion in deficit \nreduction over 10 years. We negotiated down to $715 million over 10 \nyears. Put that in context. Over the next 10 years the student loan \nprogram will probably loan out somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 to \n$1.5 trillion. What we are talking about is only $715 million over the \nnext 10 years. That is the closest we could come to zero and at the \nsame time have hard caps and keep interest rates low.\n  I can't stress enough that this is a true compromise. If I were to \nwrite it, I would write it differently, and I have expressed myself in \nvotes on the Senate floor in the past. But we have to deal with the art \nof the possible and reach compromises that answers both what the \nRepublicans sought to do and what we sought to do.\n  I would also reiterate that this is not the end of the conversation. \nIt is the beginning.\n\n[[Page S5891]]\n\n  As important as student loans are--Stafford loans so students are \nable to get an education and their parents being able to afford it--as \nimportant as that is, it is only one part of the jigsaw puzzle that is \ncollege affordability.\n  In 4 months, when the GAO report comes back--and I will again repeat \nthat one of the elements we got in this compromise was a requirement \nthat the GAO do a study on student loans, what the real cost is to the \ngovernment, what the real cost is to administer that, and get that back \nto us in 4 months. When we are in our committee reauthorizing the \nHigher Education Act, we can take that into account.\n  My good friend from Maine, who has been so instrumental in working \nout this agreement, has said many times that the rule book we have to \ngo on is CBO estimates. I have been here long enough to see how many \nmistakes CBO has made in the past. We don't know if they are right. We \nhave no way of knowing that. We also don't know what those interest \nrates are going to be in the future, and we don't know if a 2.05 add-on \nor 3.6 add-on is the right thing. We don't know. That is why we have \nrequired the GAO to give us an in-depth study so we can have a better \nhandle on the cost to the government, what it costs to administer the \nprogram and all of its elements. We will take that into account.\n  I was pleased to hear, again, Senator Alexander, my good friend and \nranking member on our committee, earlier today on the floor. He \nexpressed the same commitment he has expressed to me personally that I \nmentioned today; that is, working together to get a reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act done in this Congress. Senator Alexander is \ncommitted to that, and so am I.\n  I might also add that I am pleased that President Obama has also said \nhe is personally committed to working with us to get a Higher Education \nAct through and working with us to look at all of the college \naffordability issues. This was displayed in his speech today.\n  This is just one element--an important element but only one element.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Alexander, the White House, \nSecretary Duncan, the Department of Education, and members of my \ncommittee on the Democratic side to really look at all aspects of \ncollege affordability and how we are going to address this issue \ncomprehensively.\n  I again want to point out for the Record--because soon we will be \nvoting--that there are two amendments that will be voted on. I think \none is by Senator Reed of Rhode Island and the other is by Senator \nSanders of Vermont, and then we will have our final passage, if I am \nnot mistaken. I know the two amendments that have been offered--one by \nSenator Sanders and one by Senator Reid--look very nice, and I know \nmany on my side will be tempted to vote for them, but I will not be \nvoting for them. They look nice, they sound nice, they would be nice in \na perfect world, but we have to deal with CBO estimates. Quite frankly, \nthe cost of those amendments, as judged by CBO, is something we can't \ndo. Again, they sound nice, they look nice, they might feel nice, but \nwe can't do it. So I will be opposing those amendments. I will be \nopposing them because we can't do that at this time.\n  What we can do is do the compromise we have reached. That is what we \ncan do. And don't let anyone tell you this is a bad deal for students. \nThis is not a bad deal for students. If we don't pass this, \nundergraduate students this year will pay 6.8 percent on their loans. \nWith this bill, they will pay 3.86 percent. Tell me which is the best \ndeal. Next year it is 4.26 percent, the year after that it is 5.4 \npercent, and the year after that it is 6.29 percent. It doesn't get up \nto 7 percent for 4 years, if CBO is right. In any case, for the next 4 \nyears it is going to be lower than 6.8 percent for every undergraduate \nstudent in college.\n  Don't let anybody tell you this isn't a good deal for students. It is \na good deal for students. This is why today we received an endorsement \nby the United States Student Association endorsing this bill, endorsing \nthe compromise. They are not walking away from it. The Leadership \nConference on Civil and Human Rights has endorsed this bill. Any way \nyou look at it, this is a good deal for students, and it is a good deal \nfor their families. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.\n  Could there be a better deal? Well, I suppose. How about free money? \nThat is always a good deal, free money. There is always something \nbetter out there. I say to my friends on the Democratic side, don't let \nthe perfect be the enemy of the good. Yes, there is probably a more \nperfect thing we could do. We can't afford it. We don't have the CBO \nscoring that would allow us to do that. Plus, we need the votes of our \ncolleagues on the Republican side, so that is why we have to have a \ncompromise. That is the way this place should run--on compromises. \nLegitimate, yes, hard-fought-out, but good compromises.\n  What Senator Manchin and Senator Burr have offered is that \ncompromise--a good bill, a good, solid compromise, one that will make \nsure interest rates for undergraduate students will be lower for the \nnext 4 years and under 6.8 percent. As Senator Alexander worked so hard \nto make sure we got into this compromise, when students get these loans \nat 3.68 percent this year, that is it for the life of the loan--that is \na good deal--or next year at 4.26 percent or the next year at 5.24 \npercent. That is a good deal. So don't let what you might think would \nbe more perfect take you away from voting for this bill. This is a good \nbill.\n\n  Again, I thank so many who are responsible for putting this together. \nI thank Senator Durbin, Senator Manchin, Senator King, and Senator \nCarper, who worked so hard through so many days and weeks to get this \npulled together. Of course, I thank my ranking member and good friend \nSenator Alexander, who has been here from day one trying to find that \nsweet spot that we could all agree on and vote on. I thank Senator \nCoburn, Senator Burr, and all their staffs for all of their hard work \nand diligence in putting this proposal together. I thank President \nObama and his team and Secretary Duncan and his team for working \ntogether, and all of our staffs.\n  This is the best we could do on a compromise for students given all \nthe various priorities of this side, that side, the White House, and \neverybody else. This is a good deal. We shouldn't turn it down.\n  I will vote against the amendments offered by Senator Reed and \nSenator Sanders, well meaning though they are. As I said, they sound \nnice and they look pretty, but don't be lured into thinking that \nsomehow that is going to happen. It is not. We have to stick with this \ncompromise and get a good deal for the students, even though you may \nnot think it is perfect. It is a good deal.\n  I support the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act. I encourage all \nof my colleagues to vote in favor of its passing and against amendments \nthat would detract from it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back \nwith the exception of 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1778\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote in relation to \namendment No. 1778, offered by the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. The Reed-Warren amendment would provide students and \nfamilies with certainty by ensuring that interest rates will go no \nhigher than they would under the current fixed rates in present law--\n6.8 percent for student loans and 7.9 percent for PLUS loans. The \namendment is fully paid for by a very small--about one-half of 1 \npercent--surcharge on income over $1 million.\n  We should do this for students all across the country, and we should \ndo it not only for the students who might be going to college next year \nbut for those who are in high school today and will face, as we know, \npredictably higher rates.\n  A young man from Rhode Island wrote a letter to me. He said:\n\n       My brother, who is in college, will be paying a lot of \n     money for college and he's worried he will have a hard time \n     paying the loan. I'm afraid that by the time I go to college, \n     loans will be so expensive that I will not be able to pay it \n     off. My parents help with paying for college but they might \n     not be able to help with a loan that big. I really want to be \n     able to go to college.\n\n\n[[Page S5892]]\n\n\n  For those young men and women who are in high school today or who are \ngoing to high school, we have to at least vote for this Reed-Warren \namendment to make sure interest rates stay at least within the present \nbounds.\n  With that, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Rhode Island knows I have the highest \nrespect and affection for him. I might say that he makes excellent \npoints.\n  As I said earlier, this amendment looks good, looks pretty, sounds \npretty, and might be nice in a perfect world, but that is not where we \nare. Like my colleagues, like Senator Reed, I want to make sure we are \nonly asking students and families to pay as much interest as needed in \norder to properly administer the program and no more. Student loans \nshould not be a profit center for the Federal Government. As I said \nearlier, that is why we put into our underlying bill, the Manchin-Burr \nbill, a requirement that GAO report back to us in 4 months as to what \nit actually costs. My good friend from Rhode Island doesn't know what \nit costs. I don't know what it costs. No one really knows what the cost \nof this is.\n  As Senator Alexander said earlier, we are going to be looking at all \nof this in the Higher Education Act, what college affordability is.\n  Let me repeat. Under the bill before us, students pay less interest \nrates than 6.8 percent until 2017.\n  While the Reed bill may sound good, we are not there. We are not \nthere to move on the Reed bill yet or anything like it. Plus, the \noffset he has for that, even though he has fully paid for it, is not \nacceptable to a lot of people here in the Senate Chamber.\n  Stick with the underlying bill and defeat the Reed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1774\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 1774, offered by the \nSenator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders].\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Leahy, Wyden, \nBrown, Whitehouse, Gillibrand, Merkley, Blumenthal, Schatz, Murphy, and \nHirono for supporting this amendment. I also wish to thank the NEA and \nthe AFT, the two largest teachers organizations in the country, for \nsupporting this amendment.\n  This amendment is very simple. It sunsets this legislation after 2 \nyears, takes advantage of current, relatively low interest rates, and \ngives us the time to reauthorize the Higher Education Act and come up \nwith sensible long-term solutions to the crisis of student indebtedness \nand college affordability.\n  According to the CBO, by the year 2018, under this legislation \nundergraduate Stafford loans will be 7.25 percent, graduate Stafford \nloans will be 8.8 percent, and parent loans will be 9.7 percent. We \nhave a crisis right now in student indebtedness. We need to solve that \ncrisis, not make it worse.\n  I ask for support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I can't support this amendment. By \nsunsetting this effort 2 years because CBO uses a 10-year window, the \namendment would cost an estimated above $20 billion, and there is no \noffset to pay for it. So, again, the lack of that offset would violate \nthe agreement we made under our bipartisan agreement of trying to get \nas close to deficit neutrality as possible.\n  Like Senator Sanders, I also want to make sure we make any needed \nchanges to student loan interest rates before they become too high. Let \nme remind everyone, in the 1990s we had an 8.25-percent cap. We hit it \nfive times. We got back in this agreement an 8.25-percent absolute cap.\n  Beyond that, for the next 4 years every student--subsidized and \nunsubsidized--in college will have a lower interest rate than 6.8 \npercent. In the outyears, who knows what the interest rates are going \nto be. We don't know that, and neither does CBO. But we do know what \nthey are going to be this year and probably next year, and the students \nget a much better deal under the compromise.\n  So I say, don't support the Sanders amendment. Let's vote and let's \nkeep the compromise in place and give our students a good deal, this \nyear and next year and the year after and keep that 8.25-percent cap \nthat we negotiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The \nnext vote cast will be Orrin Hatch's 13,000th vote. This is a \ntremendous accomplishment. It speaks to his dedication to the State of \nUtah, his constituents, the Senate, and our country. He is the \nRepublicans' most senior Member. He is now serving in his seventh term \nin the Senate. Before running for the Senate, Senator Hatch received a \nbachelor's degree from Brigham Young University, a law degree from the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh, and was in private practice for a number of \nyears.\n  He is the ranking member on the Finance Committee today. As we know, \nhe made a reputation for himself when he was chair of the Judiciary \nCommittee. We worked together with him for those many years. He serves \non the HELP Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation. He has truly \nhad a significant impact on the Senate.\n  He is a dedicated member of the board of directors of the Holocaust \nMemorial Museum. He has done amazing work throughout his career.\n  His No. 1 accomplishment for me is not how many terms he has served \nin the Senate but his accomplishment for his wonderful family. His wife \nElaine has been a great helpmate for him for these many decades. He has \n23 grandchildren, 6 children, and now 10 great-grandchildren.\n  Although Orrin and I occasionally disagree on substantive issues, I \nhave great respect for him. I am so grateful to him over the years for \nalways expressing concern about me personally and his kindness and \nconcern to my family, especially to Landra.\n  Congratulations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The senior Senator from Utah will not be known for the \nquantity of his votes but for the quality of his work. He is a man of \nextraordinary character. We are happy to have this intermission to \ncongratulate him on yet another accomplishment in a long and \noutstanding career in the Senate.\n\n\n               orrin hatch's 13,000th vote in the senate\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have just cast 13,000th vote here in the \nSenate. I have to admit that I never thought I would cast so many \nvotes, but I'm grateful that I have had the opportunity to serve the \ngood people of Utah long enough to reach this milestone.\n  That said, I am not really one to dwell on the past. I have a lot \nmore work here to do and a lot more votes to cast before I am done.\n  But, I do want to thank both the distinguished majority and minority \nleaders for their kind words this evening and for being gracious enough \nto take the time to mark this occasion. I have known these good \nSenators a long time and I am proud to call both of them my friends.\n  I am grateful for all of the friends and colleague I have made here \nin the Senate. They make it a great place to work.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1773\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1773, \noffered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, a point of order. I believe we are prepared \nto voice vote this, and at the proper time I ask that such a motion be \nmade.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, we can fix our student loan program with \na ``yes'' vote on the bipartisan legislation to lower interest rates \nfor all student borrowers. The bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act is \na long-term fix that is fair, equitable, financially sustainable, and \nfiscally responsible.\n  This compromise will save students $8 billion in interest this school \nyear which translates to $31 billion in savings over the next 4 years. \nThat means a savings of $2,000 in interest for the average freshman \nstudent who starts college this year. A ``no'' vote will prevent our \nstudents from realizing this savings.\n  There is simply no better investment we can make than the education \nof our children and grandchildren. I urge my colleagues to make that \ninvestment and vote to support this long-term bipartisan fix.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I oppose the proposed amendment. It is \nshort-term rate relief, but it is long-term rate pain for thousands of \nstudents and families across the country. We can do much better than \nthat. In a few moments, we will have an opportunity after the voice \nvote to have another small discussion prior to final passage.\n  Again, I believe this amendment is not--despite the best work and \nbest intentions and great effort by my colleagues--the best work we can \ndo with respect to students and families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. First of all, I respect my colleague, and we just have a \ndifference of opinion, but we are still going to work together on \neverything we possibly can to make it better.\n  It is my understanding that we will be able to adopt the amendment by \na voice vote since we will be having a rollcall vote on passage of the \nbill as amended with this language.\n  I ask unanimous consent to extinguish the previous order requiring a \n60-vote threshold for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1773) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on passage of H.R. \n1911, as amended.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the vote comes on what we are going to do \nand that is--as my good friend Senator Manchin said--to keep interest \nrates low for students.\n  What this means for our students is that the student loans for all \nundergraduate students will be reduced from 6.8 percent to 3.86 percent \nthis year. It will be lower than 6.8 percent for the next 4\\1/2\\--\nalmost 5--years.\n  Do our students and our families a favor. Vote for final passage. \nKeep the interest rates low and make sure our students are not paying a \n6.8-percent interest rate this year, next year, and the year beyond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as I indicated previously with respect to \nthe amendment proposed by Senator Manchin, this proposal will provide \nshort-term rate relief but lock in long-term rate pain for thousands of \nfamilies and students across the country. It also represents the \nfundamental shift in our approach to student lending. It goes from \ninvesting in students and in our future economy to making those \nstudents be profit centers for the Federal Government. There is an \nestimated $184 billion over 10 years of profit in the current baseline. \nIt is the difference between the cost of funding and the revenue paid \nby the students to the Federal Government. This proposal adds $715 \nmillion to that.\n  Also, we have done nothing to address the $1 trillion of outstanding \ndebt that students face today. This measure will add to that debt.\n  Education has always been the engine of opportunity in this country. \nWith this legislation, that engine will leave the station with many \nfewer students aboard.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will read \nthe title of the bill for a third time.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, \nunder the previous order the question is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the THUD \nappropriations bill that is on the floor this week. I know all of us \nhave listened to the speeches and the commentators, and we hear a lot \nof people around Washington say: Cut, cut, cut.\n  Well, I am for cutting our spending, and I think we need to tighten \nour belt, but we need to do it in a smart way, and we need to do things \nsuch as cut programs that do not work. We need to also make smart and \ntargeted investments in our future. The question is, how do we do that?\n  Well, one of the ways we do that is by supporting this legislation \ntoday. By\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\nworking together and investing in our future, we can do great things \nfor this country, and that is what the THUD bill is about.\n  Yesterday, the FAA announced seven airports in our State would \nreceive a total of $4.8 million from the FAA for infrastructure \nupgrades. That is part of what the bill is about. Some of these are \nrunway rehabilitations, some are new lighting systems, some may be \ndrainage improvements. These not only promote safety--and certainly \nthey make air travel safer in this country, and that is extremely \nimportant--but also they are a way to spur economic activity. It is a \ngreat way to reinvest Federal tax dollars into my State and into the \nother 49 States to create jobs. Let me give Arkansas as an example of \nthis.\n  In Arkansas--and I know we are only about 1 percent of the \npopulation, so you can kind of do the math here--commercial and general \naviation airports actually support 29,000 jobs and contribute $2.5 \nbillion every year in economic activity.\n  Our airports are important, but it is only actually a piece of the \npuzzle. We need to remember that we have other great infrastructure we \nneed to invest in, such as waterways and ports and highways, and rural \ncommunities--we have to make sure they are not left behind--such as \nrural housing, but also rural broadband.\n  So there are a lot of ways we can invest to make this country \nstronger. That is why I believe it is very important to support this \nTHUD appropriations bill.\n  The bill passed in committee on a bipartisan vote 22 to 8. I was \nproud to vote for it. I was glad to see it get such a large bipartisan \nvote in the Senate subcommittee. I certainly hope my colleagues will do \nthis again on the floor in a very bipartisan way.\n  This bill includes things such as the Federal-Aid Highway Program. \nThis is a program that helps support interstate maintenance, bridge \nrepairs, highway safety. After all, how many reports do we have to read \nthat talk about the distressed infrastructure of our highways? So if we \nwant to replace these bridges that are beyond their lifespan, this is \nthe way to do it.\n  Every $1 billion in Federal highway and transit investment supports \n13,000 American jobs.\n  This bill also includes popular programs that have been put to good \nuse, such as TIGER. I could go through several of the TIGER grants my \nState has received, but one of those I am proud of is the TIGER grant \nfor West Memphis, AR, to develop their port. It is an intermodal \nfacility on the Mississippi River, right across from Memphis, which is \ncrowded. West Memphis has all the same attributes that Memphis has, it \njust happens to be on the Arkansas side of the river, and that \ninvestment there is going to explode development and do great things up \nand down the Mississippi River.\n  The Airport Improvement Program is also part of this, the Contract \nTower Program, the Community Development Block Grants. Every mayor, \nevery elected official in the counties, the Governors--they all know \nhow important the CDBG money is.\n  The other great thing about supporting this legislation is that it is \none step in the right direction headed back to what we call regular \norder, trying to get things done in the Senate the way they ought to be \ndone, with us working together, going through the committee process, \ncoming to the floor with a bill, having amendments, having debate, \nsometimes fussing and fighting with one another, but nonetheless \ngetting it done, and this is a great way to do that.\n  I believe moving our country forward with new jobs and a stronger \neconomy is something we all should be able to agree on. All of us \nshould be able to agree on this, maybe with a little difference here \nand there. But I hope a big number of Senators will support this \nlegislation.\n  Lastly, let me say a few words about Chairwoman Mikulski and her \nranking member Senator Shelby. Senator Mikulski has been amazing in her \nleadership of the Appropriations Committee. Everybody on the committee \nknows she is a breath of fresh air. She is so energetic and so \nknowledgeable and so good at what she does. We are so excited to have \nher there as chair of that committee. She is going to go down in \nhistory as one of the all-time greats. We are so proud she is pushing \nso hard to get these bills out of the committee and get them to the \nSenate floor and, hopefully, get them done on the Senate floor, so we \ncan send them over to the House and get them conferenced.\n  Also, I have to say thank you to Senator Murray, who is the chair of \nthis subcommittee, and also Senator Collins. I think Senator Collins is \na great legislator. She knows how to get it done. She knows how all the \nbits and pieces work around here. She knows the process. She has great \nrelations on both sides of the aisle. One thing I like about Susan \nCollins is a lot of times she will take on the hard items. She gets the \nhard work done. We need more Senators like her around here.\n  Certainly Senator Murray is incredible. She does so much good in the \nSenate and for the country and for her State.\n  With that, I encourage my colleagues to look at this bill. I know we \nare going to have some amendments, we are going to have some more \ndebate. That is part of it. That is great. But let's get up-or-down \nvotes and let's get this through the system.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/24/senate-section/article/S5895-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5895-S5898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here once again, actually now for \nthe 40th time, to urge my colleagues to wake up to the threat of \nclimate change.\n  I am very pleased to be joined today by our colleague Senator Brian \nSchatz of Hawaii, who is a champion of renewable energy and energy \nefficiency. As Hawaii's Lieutenant Governor, he coauthored his State's \nnet metering rule, which encourages renewable energy, and he led the \ndesign of the State's Renewable Energy Portfolio, which is on track to \nbe No. 1 in the Nation. He has pushed commonsense ways to boost energy \nsecurity and battle climate change, and it is no wonder he has been \ncalled Hawaii's ``Ambassador of Energy.''\n  We are here today in the wake of a hearing last week in the Committee \non Environment and Public Works. The premise of that hearing was \nsimple--``Climate Change: It's Happening Now.'' Disappointingly, again, \nallies of the fossil fuel industry attempted to discount or downplay \nthat straightforward call to action.\n  Of the climate scientists on hand, everyone--even the minority \nwitnesses--agreed that carbon dioxide causes climate change. That is \nphysics 101. And all but one agreed that climate change is a real \nproblem. The only academic who did not, Dr. Roy Spencer, is affiliated \nwith the industry-backed George C. Marshall Institute and the Heartland \nInstitute.\n  Regrettably, Dr. Spencer played a tried-and-true trick of the climate \ndeniers: deselecting data that does not support your conclusions. \nScientists around the world have been collecting high-quality surface \ntemperature data for more than 100 years. To Dr. Spencer, however, the \nonly data that matters are satellite and balloon readings of \natmospheric temperatures in the tropics. Why ignore data outside the \ntropics? Why ignore surface temperature data? Why ignore ocean data, \nwhen the oceans cover two-thirds of the globe? Well, when you look at \nall the data, it shows the Earth warming at a much faster rate than his \ndata in isolation.\n  Other minority witnesses played similar games.\n  Ms. Furchtgott-Roth, who is not a climate scientist, testified. She \nappears to be a sort of all-purpose witness-of-all-trades for the \nRepublicans on topics that range from job training to health insurance \nto constitutional law, even to Samoan fisheries. She claimed that \nclimate change has stopped.\n  Well, if you look at the past decade, you can convince yourself that \nclimate change has stopped. Actually, on this chart I have in the \nChamber, you can convince yourself that climate change has stopped five \ndifferent times. But when you look at the whole picture, the only \nconclusion is that the Earth is getting warmer. The past 10 years were \nwarmer than the 10 years before that. In fact, the past 10 years were \nwarmer than any other 10 years in recorded history.\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\n  The continued, now-near-fraudulent denial of climate change is \npernicious. Dr. Jennifer Francis of Rutgers called out in her testimony \nwhat she calls ``climate misleaders.'' She explained--and I will quote \nher--\n\n       These are people who [are] deliberately ignoring and \n     misconstruing the science in an attempt to convince \n     [lawmakers] and the public that either human-caused climate \n     change isn't happening, or that it's nothing to worry about.\n\n  Well, I am sure Senator Schatz is aware that observations around the \nworld, including in his home State, show climate change is indeed real \nand already happening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his kind words. He \nis a real expert and a leader on climate change, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work together with him and our colleagues on this \nimportant issue. He has just discussed the overwhelming evidence that \nglobal temperatures are rising. I would like to build on his remarks \nand add that temperature is not the only indicator that climate change \nis real and it is happening now.\n  We see the changes in Hawaii and all over the world. One only need to \nlook to the top of the world, where Arctic Sea ice is melting faster \nthan scientists had predicted originally. Just last summer, the ice \ncovering the Arctic Ocean retreated to its smallest size in recorded \nhistory, shrinking by 350,000 square miles--an area about the size of \nVenezuela.\n  Glaciers continue to retreat. The Greenland ice sheet provides a \nstark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice. For several \ndays in July of 2012, Greenland's surface ice cover melted more than at \nany time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month an \nestimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed.\n  Some types of severe weather are also on the rise. While climate \nscientists are extremely careful not to attribute any single weather \nevent to climate change, there is no doubt that increased climate \nchange has ``loaded the dice,'' which means extreme weather events are \nincreasingly likely.\n  Extreme weather events cost us in lives and in money. Of course, the \nsea level continues to rise. As water warms, its volume expands. \nScientists have observed that the top layer of the world's oceans has \nstored an enormous amount of heat, raising sea levels in many parts of \nthe world. This ocean warming has contributed to an estimated one-third \nto one-half of the increase in sea level rise to date.\n  Sea level rise is a serious challenge for my home State of Hawaii in \nparticular. Just a 3-foot rise in sea level, which scientists project \nfor this century, will flood many parts of Honolulu, including the \niconic hotels and businesses along Waikiki Beach, leaving beaches \neroded and hotels, businesses, and homes possibly inundated by the \nocean.\n  My colleague from Rhode Island, an ocean State, is especially aware \nof these changes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, tide gauges in Newport, RI, show an \nincrease in average sea level of nearly 10 inches since 1930. That is a \nbig deal for Rhode Islanders when we think about how devastating our \ngreat hurricane of 1938 was and what worse would now befall us with 10 \nmore inches of sea for storms to hammer against our shores.\n  Those measurements show that the rate of sea level rise is also \nincreasing. This matches reports that since 1990, sea level has been \nrising faster than the rate predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change. Part of what has caused sea level rise is ocean \nwarming, as described by Senator Schatz.\n  When fluids get warm, including ocean water, they expand and \ntherefore rise. During last week's EPW hearing, we heard about the \nheat, significant amounts of heat, that oceans are now absorbing. Even \nif atmospheric warming had hit another temporary level, the ocean is \nstill warming, and ocean warming hits ocean ecosystems.\n  Dr. Margaret Leinin testified at the hearing last week about a study \nthat showed economically important species such as cod, haddock, \nyellowtail, and winter flounder shifting northward over the last four \ndecades. The study suggests that the fish are moving to locations \nwithin their preferred temperature range.\n  Scientists have begun to tease out how what seem like small changes \nin average temperature are important to fish and other animals in the \nocean. In Narragansett Bay, we have a continuous temperature record \ngoing back to 1959, along with data on what is living in the water. We \nknow water temperature is rising. One study found on average winter \ntemperatures are up almost 4 degrees since the 1960s in Narragansett \nBay, and that is not good for the winter flounder.\n  NOAA scientists working in Rhode Island found that winter flounder \nincubated in warmer water are smaller when they hatch than those \nincubated in colder water. Juvenile winter flounder need time to settle \nto the bottom of the bay and to grow larger before abundant bottom \nfeeders such as the sand shrimp arrive. It looks like warmer water \nbrings the shrimp in earlier while the flounder are still small enough \nto eat, making them easier prey.\n  So the evidence is that warmer waters load the dice against winter \nflounder in Narragansett Bay, and the fisherman who relied upon this \nfishery paid the price. Catches are down to less than one-tenth of what \nthey once were. Fishermen in Hawaii are paying the price as well.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. As Senator Whitehouse has described, our oceans show the \neffect of climate change by absorbing much of the heat from our warming \nplanet. But they do more than that; our oceans absorb almost 25 percent \nof the carbon that humans release into the atmosphere. If they did not, \neven more greenhouse gasses would warm our planet at an even faster \npace. Our oceans and the life in them pay a price for all of this \ncarbon.\n  Increasing carbon dioxide creates a chemical reaction that raises the \nacidity of the sea water. This is called ocean acidification. So that \nis a technical term, but what does it mean as a practical matter? In \nplain terms, ocean acidification makes it difficult for shellfish, \ncorals, sea urchins, and other creatures to form the shells that they \nneed in order to live. As a result, fewer survive, which means entire \npopulations are put at risk. Acidification negatively affects crucial \nparts of the ocean food chain from shellfish and coral reefs to \nfisheries.\n  So what does this mean for human beings? Ocean acidification has real \neconomic consequences for communities that depend on the ocean for \nfood, for jobs, and for tourism, such as my home State of Hawaii. \nFurther acidification and warming will hurt our local fishing and \ntourism industries, industries that make up the backbone of our \neconomy. All the fish and the seafood we depend upon may become scarcer \nand likely more expensive.\n  If we continue to burn fossil fuels at our current rate, our oceans \nmay become 150 percent more acidic by the end of this century. That is \na higher level of acidity than has been seen in the last 20 million \nyears.\n  Today, more than 1 billion people worldwide rely on food from the \nocean as their primary source of protein. So without solving the \nproblem of ocean acidification, we will leave people, industries and \nentire economies, vulnerable, especially in developing countries. \nClimate change is threatening the basic foundation of many of our \neconomies and especially the State of Hawaii. The Hawaii economy, \nculture, and history are derived from the ocean. So any dramatic \nchanges to our ocean environment will impact our lives especially.\n  As I mentioned before, sea level rise threatens our beachfront \nproperty from Waikiki to Ka'anapali to the North Shore of Kauai. These \nbeaches are important for Hawaii tourism and our economy and to local \npeople across the State. Each year, Hawaii hosts an estimated 8 million \nvisitors, with many of them drawn to our beaches. Tourist receipts \nalone made up almost $12 billion in revenues last year. So climate \nchange could also usher in a period of more frequent and severe \nweather, which could make Hawaii's communities increasingly vulnerable \nto flooding and storm damage.\n  Climate change threatens more than our economy. Our national security \ninstitutions face a similar risk from sea\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\nlevel rise and ocean acidification. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense \nReview, an assessment produced every 4 years by the Department of \nDefense, concluded that climate change will affect the military and its \nmission. In particular, low-lying naval installations, such as Joint \nBase Pearl Harbor-Hickam, face similar threats from sea level rise that \ncould leave parts of the base flooded, requiring millions of dollars in \ncostly upgrades.\n  With the United States rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region, \nsustaining our naval capabilities and ensuring that they too can \nweather the effect of climate change will be increasingly important for \nHawaii and for our Nation.\n  I know the Senator from Rhode Island has concerns about his own \nState. I yield to him.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. As the Senator from Hawaii said, it is not just \nHawaii, it is not just Rhode Island actually, it is all of our States \nthat will be affected. Dr. Leinin, who testified at our EPW hearing, is \nfrom Florida Atlantic University. She highlighted how sensitive Florida \nwill be to climate change.\n  In her testimony, Dr. Leinin said:\n\n       The Caribbean/Florida region has shown sea surface \n     temperature increases of about . . . [2 degrees Fahrenheit] \n     per decade concurrent with losses of viable coral reef area \n     of between 5.5 percent and 9.2 percent per year. Western \n     Atlantic reefs have the highest percentage area affected by \n     bleaching of any reefs worldwide.\n\n  Not so great for Florida's diving and snorkeling economy. Dr. Leinin \npointed out that Florida's population ``is heavily concentrated, with \nalmost 14 million people living along our coast. In South Florida, \nMiami, the seventh largest city in the country, the Florida Keys, \ncoastal and inland portions of Broward County, the Florida Everglades \nand Ft. Lauderdale are all below 2 feet in elevation.''\n  The effects of sea level rise that we discussed for Hawaii and Rhode \nIsland appear to be more evident in Florida. Dr. Leinin told us: \nAlthough sea level rise has only risen these few inches in 50 years, \nthat rise has been sufficient to prevent drainage systems from working \nduring lunar high tides and during storms. The streets of Miami Beach \nare now routinely flooded at peak high tide. The addition of storm \nsurges to these higher sea levels means that drainage systems no longer \nwork reliably, causing seawater to move into storm sewer systems \nforcing water inland.\n  So South Florida is ground zero for sea level rise. As Senator Schatz \nsaid earlier, this is one of the effects of climate change. Sea level \nrise has not stopped or slowed down, especially not in South Florida. \nIt is time to wake up and get to work slowing these changes where we \ncan, and adapting our communities to their inevitable effects.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Commonsense solutions to the threat of climate change are \neverywhere. We have been talking a lot about the risks of climate \nchange, but let's talk a little bit about the opportunities--the \nopportunities to fight climate change, to transform how we produce and \nconsume energy, and to grow a clean energy economy.\n  We know what we need to do. We also know how to do it. Congress may \nnot enact comprehensive climate legislation this year, but it can still \ntake action to make a difference. As I see it, we have an opportunity \nfor common ground in three areas: energy efficiency, tax incentives, \nand innovative financing structures to promote clean energy deployment.\n  Perhaps the greatest opportunity for compromise is in energy \nefficiency, the commonsense idea that we ought to save money and reduce \npollution at the same time by simply consuming less energy to perform \nthe same tasks. Senators Shaheen and Portman have taken this up and are \nwriting excellent legislation to improve and enhance energy efficiency \nacross the Nation.\n  Their bill includes sensible measures that will help to achieve \nsignificant reduction in energy use. Buildings use close to 40 percent \nof the energy used in the United States. This bill will contain \nprovisions that will update the building codes, increase efficiency \ngoals for Federal facilities, and provide incentives to industrial \nfacilities, commercial buildings, and homes.\n  In recent weeks, we have been hearing that Shaheen-Portman may come \nto the floor. We are encouraged by that. We encourage both the majority \nleader and the minority leader, as well as the managers of this \nlegislation, to move it to the floor expeditiously so that we can take \ncare of it before the August break.\n  Second, I urge my colleagues to support tax incentives for clean \nenergy, many of which expire at the end of this year. Senators on both \nsides of the aisle have repeatedly worked together to extend these \nincentives, especially the wind credit. We can build on this common \nground to support sensible solutions. We not only have the opportunity \nto extend clean energy incentives as a part of tax reform but to \nimprove upon them. We should focus on creating credits that reward \nperformance and innovation and do not pick winners and losers. They \nshould help industries scale up, bring costs down, and become \ncompetitive on their own.\n  Finally, the Federal Government must do more to help new and \ninnovative technologies reach the marketplace. New technologies face \nsignificant barriers to market entry; barriers that focused government \nintervention such as loan guarantees and other financing mechanisms can \nhelp overcome.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island may also have thoughts on other \ncommonsense solutions. I yield to him for any comments he may have.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, Rhode Island is preparing for climate \nchange. We are doing it in commonsense ways. Along our coasts, we are \nidentifying areas that are vulnerable to sea level rise. The University \nof Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography is a world leader in \nmeasuring and understanding the effects of climate change on our \nwaters.\n  Rhode Island's Department of Health, with a grant from the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, is preparing us for the health \neffects associated with climate change. But it is not enough for \nindividual States to have to act alone. That is why Senator Schatz and \nI, along with our colleagues in the House, Representatives Waxman and \nBlumenauer, have put forward a discussion draft for a fee on carbon \npollution.\n  It is clear when we consider the damage climate change will cause, \nindeed already has begun to cause, there is a social cost of carbon \npollution. It is not factored into the price of fossil fuel.\n  That is a market failure, and our approach would correct that market \nfailure.\n  We wish to discuss with our Democratic and Republican colleagues how \nbest to implement this solution, what the price should be, how fast it \nshould rise, and how to return the proceeds back to Americans. A market \nsolution like this should be right up Republicans' alley. This is why \nRepublicans such as Art Laffer and George Shultz are talking about it.\n  A fee on carbon can reduce emissions. One option, to use the proceeds \nto reduce taxes, should be attractive to our Republican colleagues.\n  To give one example, with the majority of the carbon pollution fee \nproceeds, setting a little reserve aside for the lowest income people, \nputting the rest of it to work lowering corporate income taxes, and \njust with that you can reduce the top of the American corporate income \ntax rate from 35 to 28 percent, that is a pretty considerable value to \nthose businesses that are still considering paying the top rate, and \nthat should be worth something during negotiations.\n  As I have said before in these talks, it is time to wake up. It is \ntime to get to work.\n  I wish to thank my friend Senator Schatz for his leadership in the \neffort to protect Americans from the harms of climate change.\n  I turn to him now for his final remarks and welcome Senator \nBlumenthal, who will be joining us in this colloquy.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I wish to thank Senator Whitehouse for being a leader for \nso long, for being so forceful and so factual on this issue. I applaud \nhis leadership and look forward to continuing to work together on this \nimportant issue.\n  Climate change is real. Climate change is caused by humans, and \nclimate change is solvable.\n  I wish to end on a note of optimism. The urgency of this situation \ncreates a real opportunity. We have a chance to start a second \nIndustrial Revolution that will drive our economy for decades to come.\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\n  We have the chance and the responsibility to transition into a clean \nenergy economy and leave our world in better shape than we found it.\n  I yield the floor for Senator Blumenthal.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I wish to join with my two very good friends and \ncolleagues who have highlighted an issue that concerns the whole \ncountry, not just Hawaii, Rhode Island--and no two States are farther \napart geographically--but we share this very dire and dangerous \nproblem, often characterized as climate change. I think it is climate \ndisruption. It is global destruction.\n  One of the myths that surrounds this area that my two colleagues have \nsought to expose is the supposed incompatibility of reducing \ndestruction of our planet and, at the same time, growing our economy. \nOften, economic growth is thought to be in conflict with environmental \nprotection and responsibility.\n  In fact, ecology and economy go together. We can expand our economy \nby developing new sources of fuel, renewables such as wind and solar, \nbut also fuel cells, which in my State of Connecticut are a growing \nsource of energy responsibility and economic growth.\n  Far from being incompatible, these two goals are complementary. More \njobs, more economic growth, can be the result of controlling carbon \npollution.\n  In fact, the President's program for controlling carbon pollution, \nwhich would dramatically cut the magnitude of our air contamination and \nmake us a more responsible nation, will increase jobs and economic \ngrowth. It will also put us in a position of leadership around the \nglobe and enable us to regain the position of trust and leadership that \nwe have exercised on so many other issues. We cannot be a leader if we \ndon't lead ourselves.\n  We cannot tell others what to do when we don't follow the example \nthat we should be setting. It should be and it must be leadership by \nexample.\n  My colleague Senator Murphy and I--and he will be shortly speaking \nabout another subject--brought together a very powerful coalition in \nConnecticut last week to highlight this issue of climate change and to \ndramatize how many different interests and ages have commonality in \nthis goal: labor leaders, environmental activists, young people wearing \nT-shirts and carrying signs.\n  They get it. They know. The science is there. The reality is \npressing, urgent, and we must address it.\n  I wish to thank all of my colleagues who are uniting on this historic \ncause. I hope we can join together in colloquies going forward.\n  The Presiding Officer has been a leader in the House and will be now \nin the Senate; most especially, my friend and colleague Senator \nWhitehouse, who literally week after week, in many different themes and \nwidely diverse ways, has brought our attention, riveting our minds, on \nthis very important subject. I congratulate him on the 40th speech, and \nI look forward to participating more with him.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I look forward to that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/24/senate-section/article/S5898-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5898-S5899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. On July 20, a few days ago, we had a pretty somber \nanniversary in this country. Senator Bennet came down to acknowledge \nthe occasion. It was the 1-year anniversary of the shooting in Aurora, \nCO, in which a young man killed 12 individuals and wounded 58 others \nwhen he walked into a crowded movie theater at a midnight showing of \n``The Dark Knight Rises.'' This, once again, showed the vulnerability \nof this Nation when the Congress refuses to act on the issue of \npreventing gun violence.\n  I have come down virtually every week--not, frankly, as often or as \nregularly as Senator Whitehouse has on the issue of climate change, but \nin the short time I have been in the Senate I have tried to come down \nto the floor virtually every week to talk about the victims of gun \nviolence. Today it is an apt moment to recognize the victims in Aurora, \nwho now have been lost for over a year.\n  This number represents something different. On December 14, our world \nin Connecticut was absolutely shattered by a global tragedy in which 26 \npeople, adults and children, including 7-year-olds, died in a splatter \nof gunfire at Sandy Hook Elementary School, as well as six of the \nprofessionals who were charged with protecting them.\n  What has happened since December 14 is, frankly, in a lot of ways \neven more egregious, even more unconscionable, even more difficult to \nswallow than what happened on that day, and that is that 6,497 people \nhave died from guns since December 14 in, frankly, every manner.\n  There have been more mass shootings, accidental deaths, and suicides. \nThere have been instances of one-on-one urban violence, suburban \nviolence, and family-on-family violence. What has happened is this \ncountry has become kind of numb to it. We have to accept that every day \nwe are going to be able to pick up a paper, and somewhere across this \ncountry there is going to be upward of 30 or 40 people who have died at \nthe hands of guns at a rate that we can't find anywhere else in the \ncivilized world. We just kind of accept it.\n  The number is startling. Since December 14, almost 6,500 people have \ndied of gun violence. But we just can't settle on that number. We have \nto talk about who these people are. I am trying to lend some voice to \nthe victims of gun violence every week on the floor of the Senate to \ntry to spur the Senate to action because I have become resolved that \nthe numbers aren't enough.\n  Apparently, this number isn't big enough for the Senate to do \nsomething so that maybe if we humanize these tragedies, that might do \nthe trick.\n  A.J. Boik was described as a ball of joy by his friend Jordan. He had \njust graduated from high school, and he was looking forward to \nattending the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design in the fall. He \nwanted to be an art teacher and wanted to teach others the joy he felt \nfor art.\n  He was known as a big personality, so much so that after he was \nkilled in that movie theater in Aurora, over 1,000 people came to his \nfuneral. Among those mourners were his girlfriend who was there in the \ntheater the day he was shot.\n  Matthew McQuinn was one of the heroes that day. He was there with his \ngirlfriend Samantha and her brother Nick Yowler. When the shooter came \ninto the theater and started spraying bullets, Matthew, as well as \nNick, attempted to shield Samantha from the bullets.\n  Samantha survived but Matthew did not. He was working in a Target, \nwhich is where he actually met his girlfriend when they were working at \nanother Target. He was remembered by his coworkers very fondly. He died \nthat day saving a life.\n  Also a victim that day was PO3 John Thomas Larimer. He was one of two \nActive-Duty servicemembers who died as a result of that mass shooting. \nHis girlfriend Kelley Vojtsek, whose life was saved, said this:\n\n       John and I were seated in the middle area. When the \n     violence occurred, John immediately and instinctively covered \n     me and brought me to the ground in order to protect me from \n     any danger.\n\n  In that act, he saved his girlfriend, but he was struck with a bullet \nthat ended his life.\n  Alex Sullivan was 27 years old. His friends called him a gentle \ngiant. He was ringing in his 27th birthday, in fact, by going to the \npremier of ``The Dark Knight Rises.'' His family said he always had a \nglowing smile on his face. He made friends with everybody. He was a \nhuge movie buff, a comic book geek--as his family called him--and the \nNew York Mets. The Sunday following his attack would have been his 1-\nyear wedding anniversary.\n\n  Micayla Medek was called Cayla by her friends. She loved her friends \nand going out with her friends. That is what she was doing when she \nwent out that evening to see this movie. Her family didn't find out she \nhad been killed that day until 20 hours after the shooting. They had \nspent that evening and morning driving from hospital to hospital hoping \nto get news she had survived.\n  Veronica Moser-Sullivan was the youngest of the 12 people who were \nshot. She was 6 years old, not unlike the 20 6-year-old and 7-year-old \nchildren killed in Newtown. She was described as beautiful and \ninnocent, excited about life. She was there that\n\n[[Page S5899]]\n\nevening because her family wanted to get her mind off of the recent \npassing of her grandfather. She had become consumed with sorrow over \nthe passing of her grandfather. So as a treat her family brought her to \nthe premier of this movie. She was going to start swimming lessons the \nfollowing week.\n  James Holmes walked into that movie theater with an AR-15-style \nrifle, which we have heard talked about over and over and over--the \nweapon of choice in mass shootings in this country. But just as \nimportant, he was armed with 100-round drums of ammunition. Why on \nEarth does this Senate allow for the continued legal sale of 100-round \ndrums of ammunition? What possible legal reason could there be for the \npossession of 100-round drums of ammunition that go into an automatic \nweapon other than to kill as many people as possible as quickly as \npossible? There is no reason a hunter or sport shooter needs a 100-\nround drum of ammunition. Yet we can't even get the votes to ban the \nsale of those deadly accessories to semiautomatic weapons.\n  I get it. These 6,497 people didn't die at the hands of an assault \nweapon, they didn't die at the hands of a 100-round drum, never mind a \n30-round magazine, but these mass shootings are going to continue to \nhappen. Frankly, the one that happened in Santa Monica not long ago \nbarely made the headlines in this country. Three or four people dying \nat the hands of a semiautomatic weapon is nothing these days. Now there \nhave to be 20 or 30 people die in order for it to be a big story. \nExpectations have changed because these shootings are becoming regular, \nnormal occurrences. But we can't let this country become numb to mass \nshootings in the way I would argue we have become numb to the 6,500 \npeople who have died since December 14.\n  I understand we tried and failed to get legislation passed through \nthe Senate--supported by 90 percent of Americans--that would extend \nbackground checks to more sales of weapons, to make sure criminals \ndon't have weapons, to make gun trafficking a crime in a way that it is \nnot, to provide some more mental health resources, but we shouldn't \ngive up. We shouldn't give up because there is going to be another \nAurora, there will be another Sandy Hook if we do nothing, and 30 to 40 \npeople will still die every day if we stand by and continue to allow \nthis kind of regular, everyday gun violence to be the background noise \nof this Nation.\n  Maybe if the numbers don't move people, the stories of the victims \nwill. Maybe that will be enough to finally prompt the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives to action.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/24/senate-section/article/S5899-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5899-S5900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 4 years ago today, the Federal minimum \nwage increased to $7.25 per hour. That was the final phase of a minimum \nwage increase that Congress passed in 2007. After 4 years, it is time \nto evaluate where wages stand.\n  Since 1967, the Federal minimum wage has increased from $1.40 to \n$7.25. While at first glance this seems like significant progress, when \nadjusted to current dollars the value of the minimum wage has actually \ndeclined by 12.1 percent. Had the minimum wage kept pace with \ninflation, it would be $10.74 an hour today.\n  But the minimum wage for tipped workers is even worse. The current \nminimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13, and that has not gone up \nsince 1991. Employers paying the tipped minimum wage now pay just 21 \npercent of what that employee would make at minimum wage. This forces \nworkers to use more and more of their tips simply to make up the \ndifference between the tipped minimum wage and the standard minimum \nwage.\n  Working 40 hours per week at $7.25 per hour translates to just \n$15,080 per year. That's about $400 less than the Federal poverty level \nguidelines for a family of two. Last week, The Atlantic ran an article \nthat showed a budget chart produced by McDonald's to help its employees \nbetter manage their finances. And while I commend McDonald's for trying \nto help workers better manage money, the budget tells a sad story.\n  According to the chart, someone making the minimum wage and working \n40 hours a week at McDonald's would have to work a second job to make \nends meet. But to be clear for this budget to be accurate, a worker \nmust hold nearly two full time jobs. According to the Washington Post's \nWonkblog, a worker making the minimum wage would to have work 75 hours \na week to have the after-tax income in the McDonalds sample budget. \nWorking 75 hours a week at minimum wage with no vacation days and \nlimited benefits--if any--one can make $24,720 a year, after tax.\n  How does a person do that if they are a single parent? They can't. \nThere are not enough hours in the day to raise a family working that \nmany hours. And there certainly aren't enough dollars in the income to \nprovide child care.\n  The sample budget drawn up for McDonald's employees might as well \ninclude a line for Federal and State assistance. Families living on the \nminimum wage have few alternatives but to turn to programs such as \nSNAP, housings assistance, and Medicaid to survive. These are the same \nprograms that are regularly attacked by the ultra-conservative for \ngrowing too quickly. For those who insist that working be a requirement \nfor receiving public assistance, shouldn't they also insist that if you \nare working full time you shouldn't need public assistance? Wouldn't \nthat be a good definition of a minimum wage?\n  If we increase the minimum wage to $10.10, more than 30 million \nworkers would receive a raise. And while some of these workers are \nteenagers, 88 percent are adults. For many of those adults, these are \nnot part time jobs or stepping stones to their next job, but the full \ntime job they rely on for a living.\n  That is why 4 years after the last minimum wage increase, it is time \nto act again. I am a cosponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act introduced \nby Senator Harkin in the Senate and Representative George Miller in the \nHouse. The Fair Minimum Wage Act will increase the minimum wage from \n$7.25 to $10.10 per hour in three, 95-cent annual increments, and index \nit to inflation annually thereafter. The bill will also gradually raise \nthe minimum wage for tipped workers from the current $2.13 per hour to \na level that is 70% of the regular minimum wage.\n  If we pass the Fair Minimum Wage Act that same full-time worker being \npaid minimum wage I mentioned earlier that makes $15,080 a year--will \nmake $21,000. That can be the difference for a family that is getting \nby and one that is living in poverty. I hope my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle will join me in cosponsoring the Fair Minimum Wage \nAct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 4 years ago today, July 24, 2009, was the \nlast time the minimum wage was increased. It rose from $6.55 an hour to \n$7.25 an hour. And it has been stuck there ever since. Four years is \ntoo long. It is time to raise the minimum wage.\n  To that end, I have introduced legislation along with Rep. George \nMiller in the House. The Fair Minimum Wage Act will gradually increase \nthe minimum wage to $10.10 an hour in three annual steps. Our bill will \nalso link future increases in the minimum wage to the cost of living, \nusing the Consumer Price Index, so that people who are trying to get \nahead don't fall behind as our economy grows. Finally, our bill--for \nthe first time in more than 20 years--will raise the minimum wage for \nworkers who earn tips, from a paltry $2.13 per hour, today, to a level \nthat is 70 percent of the regular minimum wage. This will be gradually \nphased in over the course of 6 years, which will give businesses time \nto adjust while providing more fairness for hardworking people in \ntipped industries.\n  While millions of workers have been without a raise these past 4 \nyears, costs have continued to climb. Between 2009 and 2012, rent has \ngone up 4%, auto repair costs have climbed 6%, food is 8% more \nexpensive, child care costs 9% more, and public transportation takes a \n13% bigger bite out of workers' wallets.\n  I do not need to tell you that when you are taking in $1,000 a month, \neven a few dollars more at the grocery checkout line is a hardship. The \ntens of millions of working poor and low-wage Americans and their \nfamilies know this. They know that the minimum wage, for many, is a \npoverty wage; it pays $3,000 less per year than what is needed to lift \na family of three above\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\nthe poverty line. They know they can not survive on such meager wages. \nThey know it because they live it.\n  Unfortunately, the McDonald's corporation does not seem to \nunderstand. Last week, a budgeting brochure that McDonald's provides \nits workers went viral on the Internet. It seems that, as the folks at \nThe Atlantic said, ``McDonald's can't figure out how its workers \nsurvive on minimum wage.'' Let's talk about McDonald's.\n  McDonald's is the third-largest employer of low-wage workers in the \ncountry, with 860,000 U.S. workers. According to Glassdoor, the average \nwage for a cashier is $7.72 and for a crew member is $7.68. That is \njust pennies above the minimum. Even managers only make around $9.50 \nper hour, sometimes less.\n  The McDonald's budget brochure shows workers how to add up their \nmonthly expenses to determine their monthly household budget. But wages \nat McDonald's are so paltry that its sample budget had to assume that \nits employees work two full-time jobs to earn $2,000 a month. Never \nmind that most fast food jobs are part-time, and finding two jobs would \nbe very difficult in today's economy with so many unemployed and part-\ntime workers looking for full-time jobs.\n  On top of requiring two jobs, this budget's estimated costs are \neither out of sync with reality or simply missing. It estimated rent at \n$600 a month, when in reality rent costs $783 for a one-bedroom \napartment and $977 for a two-bedroom, according to the National Low-\nIncome Housing Coalition. Those are national figures; rent is much \nhigher in many parts of the country. The McDonald's budget also doesn't \ninclude necessities like child care or food. And I don't know where \nsomeone is going to get health insurance for $20 a month. Even \nMcDonald's charges $54 a month for its most basic plan for one employee \nwith no dependents, and that is after a year of working there. With \njust one dependent, it is $140 a month. And that basic plan still has \ndeductibles and copays on top of the premium.\n  This just shows how difficult it is for tens of millions of people--\nfolks who do some of the most demanding work in our country--to make \nends meet. But it's not just low-wage workers who are hurt when they \ncan't keep up with costs. This hurts our communities and our local \nbusinesses as well. When our neighbors can't afford to go to the \ngrocery store or the auto repair shop or the hardware store, all of \nthose businesses suffer. They lose customers and sales.\n  But imagine if the lowest wage workers all got raises. They would \ntake their car in for that long-needed repair. They would pick up a few \nextra items at the store. They would buy a new pair of shoes for their \ngrowing son or daughter. And those local stores would all benefit.\n  And when we see that 30 million people across the country will get a \nraise thanks to the Fair Minimum Wage Act, all that extra spending \nreally adds up. The local grocery might even have to hire new people to \nkeep up with rising demand. In total, my bill will add $33 billion to \nour GDP over its 3 years of implementation. And it will create 140,000 \nnew jobs over that same period.\n  It's simple: more money in consumers' pockets means more spending, \nwhich means more economic activity, which means more jobs.\n  In fact, the financial and economic experts know this already. I have \nseen article after article, interview after interview from financial \nexperts saying that we need more consumer spending in order to get our \neconomy really going. Just last month, the Wall Street Journal \ninterviewed the president of Naroff Economic Advisors. He analyzed a \nrecent consumer spending report and said, ``We're in a situation where \nwe need much stronger increases in wages and salaries if households are \ngoing to have the money to spend and the economy's going to grow \nfaster.'' He added:\n\n       We need wages to grow significantly faster. They're coming \n     up from where they have been, but we need them to really \n     begin to pick up. We need stronger job growth, but more \n     importantly we also need average salaries and hourly wages to \n     grow faster. Those have been largely flat and that's the \n     problem. Right now, income's growing because we're creating \n     more jobs, not because people are making more money. We need \n     the average person to see their salaries go up before they \n     can spend more and drive this economy forward.\n\n  Well, we can raise wages in this country, and we can provide those \nraises to the people who need it most--not to CEOs but to the people \nserving our food, watching our children, helping us when we call \ncustomer service, and assisting us at our local stores. These are the \npeople who are earning wages so low, they work two jobs and still can't \nmake ends meet. And these are people who will go out and spend just \nabout every dime in their local stores, boosting their local economies.\n  Minimum wage workers want to support themselves. Ninety percent of \nthe people who would benefit from my legislation are adults, not \nteenagers. They are often parents. In fact, one in five working parents \nin this country will get a raise under my bill, and a third of single \nparents. A total of 18 million children have parents who would get a \nraise. Think about that. All of those millions of families with a \nlittle more money to spend. What a help that will be to those growing \nkids.\n  We owe it to millions of low-wage families struggling to just have a \nglimpse of the American Dream, to make sure that they get a raise and \ncan support their families. But we also owe it to ourselves, to our \neconomy. Our system works best when everyone has the opportunity to \nsupport themselves, to be productive, and to participate in our larger \neconomy.\n  Raising the minimum wage is a simple and effective way to do this. \nAnd we know we can do it in a responsible way, with no unintended \nconsequences. My bill would phase in an increase in three steps, giving \nbusinesses time to adapt. And because the minimum wage will apply to \nall businesses, no single business will be at a competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  Also, my proposal is in line percentage wise with previous increases \nin the minimum wage. Decades of solid economic research shows us that \nthese increases have not caused job losses. In fact, businesses stand \nto benefit from increased wages, because raises result in significantly \nlower turnover rates, which in turn saves those businesses money.\n  Four years without a raise is 3 years too many. We have to make sure \nthat working families can keep up with the economy. That is why linking \nfuture increases in the minimum wage to the cost of living is so \ncrucial. Small annual increases will be easy to absorb, but will make a \nbig difference to American families. And it will help our businesses on \nMain Street as well as our national economy.\n  Mr. President, it is time to raise the minimum wage and link it to \ninflation for the future. It is the right thing to do, and it is the \nresponsible thing to do. And it will give a much needed boost to both \nlocal economies and our national economy. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this long-overdue legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/24/senate-section/article/S5900-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5900-S5901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO FRANK J. SAMMARTINO\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleague, the \nRanking Member of the Budget Committee, Senator Sessions, to pay \ntribute to Frank J. Sammartino, who is retiring this week after 33 \nyears of distinguished Federal service, including 26 years serving the \nCongress at the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Economic \nCommittee.\n  Mr. Sammartino began his Federal career in 1978, working in the \noffice of the assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where he worked until \n1985. He left HHS for the Tax Analysis Division in the Congressional \nBudget Office, where he has worked for most of his remaining career. \nWhile at CBO, Mr. Sammartino has risen up through the ranks to his \ncurrent position of assistant director for Tax Analysis, the director's \ntop person on all tax policy and budget matters. In addition to his \nwork at CBO, he has also served Congress as the chief economist and \ndeputy director at the Joint Economic Committee.\n  As head of the Tax Analysis Division at CBO, Mr. Sammartino has \nworked tirelessly to ensure the Congress has quality and timely \nanalysis of tax policy and budget issues. He has directly contributed \nto and overseen numerous baseline projections, policy studies, and cost \nestimates. In fact, early on at\n\n[[Page S5901]]\n\nCBO, he developed the first microsimulation model used by CBO for \nanalyzing tax policy. That model became the basis for CBO's individual \nincome tax projections and its analysis of the distribution of federal \ntaxes. In general, his expertise on a wide range of public policy \nissues has served as a valuable resource for Members and staff.\n  Mr. Sammartino exemplifies CBO's high standards of professionalism, \nobjectivity, and nonpartisanship, and has received the highest awards \nfor outstanding service while at both CBO and HHS. As chairman, I \ngreatly appreciate the sacrifices that he--as well as his family, \nincluding his wife, Ellen, and children, Frank and Lulu--have made in \nassisting the Budget Committee and Congress.\n  I would like to turn to my colleague, Senator Sessions, for his \nremarks.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the chairman and join her in commending Mr. \nSammartino for his many years of dedicated and distinguished service to \nCBO, the Congress, and the American people. We wish him and his family \nwell in his retirement from Federal service.\n  We hope our colleagues will join us in thanking Mr. Sammartino--and \nreally all of the hard-working employees at the Congressional Budget \nOffice--for his and their service.\n\n\n                    energy subcommittee assignments\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, today I wish to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing Tom Ed McHugh, who will retire as executive \ndirector of the Louisiana Municipal Association. Mr. McHugh will step \ndown on December 31, 2013, after 13 years of dedicated service.\n  Mr. McHugh began his career in public service in 1966 as a teacher in \nthe East Baton Rouge Parish School System after receiving a Bachelor's \ndegree in education from Louisiana State University. In 1989, Mr. \nMcHugh was elected mayor-president of the City of Baton Rouge and \nParish of East Baton Rouge and served three terms in this position. \nUnder his leadership, East Baton Rouge Parish experienced its greatest \nyears of growth and prosperity. Through his years of service as an \nelected official, Mr. McHugh created enduring changes in a wide breadth \nof programs to impact and improve the lives of every individual within \nand throughout his community.\n  Mr. McHugh has worked tirelessly for 13 years as executive director \nof the Louisiana Municipal Association to maintain and promote the \nindependence and self-sufficiency of Louisiana's municipalities while \nstrengthening the relationship between the local, State, and Federal \nlevels of government. He created municipal structures in which all \npeople are taken care of, no matter their situation in life. Mr. McHugh \nhad a vision to reach the lives of the citizens he vigorously worked to \nimprove through dynamic enhancement models that provided quality \nmanagement and services at all levels of government. Mr. McHugh also \nworked continuously to build a strong economic agenda to ensure the \nprosperity of Louisiana's municipalities and communities for \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. McHugh's distinguished career includes many prestigious \nrecognitions. Among them are memberships to the United States \nConference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, and the governing \nboards of the Louisiana Conference of Mayors and the Louisiana \nMunicipal Association. Mr. McHugh's career leaves a legacy of \naccomplishment and dedication to his family and all those who are a \npart of the educational systems and municipalities that he served. \nTogether with his high school sweetheart, Betty Schilling McHugh, Mr. \nand Mrs. McHugh are the proud parents and grandparents of three \nchildren and eight grandchildren, all of whom have continued to inspire \nMr. McHugh as a professional, a father, and a grandfather.\n  Mr. McHugh has been and continues to be an inspiration to all of \nthose who have been impacted by his tireless efforts. It is with my \nheartfelt and greatest sincerity that I ask my colleagues to join me \nalong with Mr. McHugh's family in recognizing the life and many \naccomplishments of this incredible leader and his impact in so many \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/24/senate-section/article/S5901-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/24/senate-section/article/S5901-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/24/senate-section/article/S5901-4", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 6:48 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada urging Congress to pass the Marketplace \n     Fairness Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, In the case of National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. \n     Department of Revenue, 386 U.S. 753 (1967), the United States \n     Supreme Court held, in relevant part, that Congress alone has \n     the power to regulate and control the taxation of commerce \n     which is conducted between a business that is located within \n     one state, and a customer who is located in another state and \n     who communicates with and purchases from the business using \n     only remote means; and\n       Whereas, The United States Supreme Court established in \n     Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), that a \n     state government cannot, of its own accord, require out-of-\n     state retailers to collect sales tax on sales within the \n     state; and\n       Whereas, The United States Supreme Court also announced in \n     Quill that Congress could exercise its authority under the \n     Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution to decide \n     whether, when and to what extent the states may require \n     collection of sales tax on remote sales; and\n       Whereas, The State of Nevada and municipalities within this \n     State receive significant operating revenue from sales taxes \n     collected by brick-and-mortar businesses and online vendors \n     with a nexus to the State and from use taxes on purchases \n     made online through vendors without a brick-and-mortar \n     location in the State; and\n       Whereas, Remittance of use taxes not collected by a vendor \n     from online purchases puts an undue burden and widely unknown \n     obligation on consumers; and\n       Whereas, The unequal taxation schemes as between online and \n     traditional retailers create a disadvantage for Nevada-based \n     retailers, who are rooted and invested in the Nevada \n     community and employ residents of this State; and\n       Whereas, The tax collection loophole for online retailers \n     deprives local governments of revenue that could be used to \n     fund necessities such as schools, police and fire \n     departments, and other important infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, The Marketplace Fairness Act, S. 336, 113th Cong. \n     (2013), and H.R. 684, 113th Cong. (2013), proposes to provide \n     states with the authority to require out-of-state retailers, \n     such as online and catalog retailers, to collect and remit \n     sales tax on purchases shipped into the state; and\n       Whereas, The State of Nevada has enacted the Simplified \n     Sales and Use Tax Administration Act, chapter 360B of NRS, \n     which is in compliance with the Marketplace Fairness Act, S. \n     336, 113th Cong. Sec. 2 (2013) and H.R. 684, 113th Cong. \n     Sec. 2 (2013): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the 77th Session of the Nevada \n     Legislature urge Congress to pass the Marketplace Fairness \n     Act without delay; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     each member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation and the \n     Executive Director of the Department of Taxation; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       POM-45. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada expressing support for wild horses and \n     burros in Nevada; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, Wild horses and burros are an integral part of the \n     ecosystem and rangelands of the United States and the State \n     of Nevada; and\n       Whereas, Wild horses and burros helped to build this nation \n     and are living symbols of freedom and our American Western \n     heritage, as represented by the depiction of wild horses on \n     the Nevada State quarter; and\n       Whereas, Wild horses and burros are natural resources and \n     cultural assets, and have the potential to promote tourism \n     and job creation in this State; and\n       Whereas, Building eco-sanctuaries that enable the public to \n     view and photograph wild horses and burros may provide a much \n     needed boost to the Nevada economy; and\n       Whereas, Wild horses and burros depend on the \n     understanding, cooperation and fairness of all interested \n     parties: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the Nevada Legislature:\n       1. Supports the preservation and protection of our iconic \n     wild horses and burros in the State of Nevada as living \n     symbols of freedom, the pioneer spirit of the West and \n     America's heritage, as well as valuable natural resources and \n     cultural assets;\n       2. Supports the development of wild horse and burro related \n     ecotourism in the State of Nevada;\n       3. Encourages the State Department of Agriculture to enter \n     into cooperative agreements with local wild horse and burro \n     advocacy groups pursuant to NRS 569.031 concerning wild \n     horses and burros living on private lands that are under the \n     jurisdiction of the State Department of Agriculture; and\n       4. Encourages a spirit of cooperation, collaboration and \n     fairness among wild horse and burro advocacy groups, private \n     land owners and the State Department of Agriculture; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     each member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation, the \n     Governor and the Director of the State Department of \n     Agriculture; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-46. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     amend the Clean Air Act and to fully consider the impact of \n     the new regulations; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1001\n\n       To the Congress of the United States of America:\n       Your memorialist respectfully represents:\n       Whereas, the Clean Air Act is a federal law designed to \n     minimize air pollution nationwide; and\n       Whereas, the Clean Air Act requires the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) to enforce regulations intended to \n     protect the public from air pollutants believed to be \n     hazardous to public health; and\n       Whereas, in 1970, Congress amended the Clean Air Act by \n     mandating comprehensive state and federal regulations for \n     both stationary and non-stationary sources of pollution; and\n       Whereas, the 1970 amendments dramatically expanded the \n     EPA's regulatory authority; and\n       Whereas, additional amendments adopted in 1990 expanded the \n     Clean Air Act by allowing the EPA to address acid rain, ozone \n     depletion, gasoline formulation and evaporative emissions; \n     and\n       Whereas, in April 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment \n     finding, declaring that current and future greenhouse gas \n     emissions pose a serious threat to public health and safety, \n     allowing the agency to regulate carbon dioxide emissions; and\n       Whereas, as written, the Clean Air Act gives states, not \n     the federal government, the primary role in establishing and \n     carrying out plans to comply with EPA regulations; and\n       Whereas, as written, the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to \n     consider the economic impact of its proposed regulations; and\n       Whereas, in spite of these provisions, recent actions by \n     the EPA reflect a disturbing and legally questionable shift \n     away from state and towards federal primacy; and\n       Whereas, these actions include the EPA's recent rejection \n     of Arizona's State Implementation Plan for Regional Haze, \n     which may cost Arizona consumers as much as one billion \n     dollars for new technology that will make an imperceptible \n     improvement in air quality compared to the state's plan; and\n       Whereas, while Americans support efforts to improve air \n     quality, such efforts should be carefully balanced to ensure \n     that the cost of new regulations on the economy do not exceed \n     potential benefits; and Wherefore your memorialist, the \n     Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives \n     concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress amend the Clean Air Act \n     to further clarify that the states, not the EPA, have the \n     primary role in developing plans for regulating air \n     pollutants and fully consider the impact of new regulations \n     on the state and national economy before approval or \n     implementation of new regulations.\n       2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State \n     of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-47. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislative \n     Assembly of the State of Oregon urging Congress to increase \n     investment in the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and \n     Clean Water State Revolving Fund; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                         House Joint Memorial 7\n\n       To the President of the United States and the Senate and \n     the House of Representatives of the United States of America, \n     in Congress assembled:\n       We, your memorialists, the Seventy-seventh Legislative \n     Assembly of the State of Oregon, in legislative session \n     assembled, respectfully represent as follows:\n       Whereas generations of Oregonians have enjoyed access to \n     safe, reliable and accessible public water, but a lack of \n     investment in critical water systems that are relied upon to \n     bring clean, accessible water to communities and the aging of \n     public water infrastructure pose significant threats to the \n     quality, safety, reliability and accessibility of public \n     water; and\n       Whereas water is widely viewed in Oregon as a public trust \n     to be managed for the common good of the public at large; and\n       Whereas approximately 80 percent of Oregon residents get \n     their drinking water from public water systems; and\n       Whereas the federal Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of \n     1996 created the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for the \n     purpose of assisting states with funding to ensure safe \n     public drinking water; and\n       Whereas in 2010 the Department of Human Services determined \n     that $44 million would be needed in order to fund projects \n     for protecting existing sources of public drinking water in \n     Oregon; and\n       Whereas in 2010 the final amount of funding from the \n     Drinking Water State Revolving Fund available for use on \n     Oregon priority projects was $9,752,311, representing less \n     than 25 percent of the amount needed; and\n       Whereas according to the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency, approximately 45 percent of the investment \n     needs in Oregon for public water infrastructure are in \n     communities with a population of less than 10,000; and\n       Whereas the Title VI provisions of the federal Clean Water \n     Act created the Clean Water State Revolving Fund in 1987 for \n     the purpose of assisting states with funding to ensure clean \n     water resources and wastewater systems and treatment \n     facilities for the public; and\n       Whereas in 2011 the Department of Environmental Quality \n     determined that $380,821,000 will be needed in order to fully \n     fund projects for maintaining clean water resource programs \n     and wastewater systems and treatment facilities to protect \n     the public and Oregon water resources; and\n       Whereas in 2011 the funding from the Clean Water State \n     Revolving Fund predicted to be available for use on Oregon \n     priority projects was $23,017,000, representing six percent \n     of the amount needed; and\n       Whereas 50 percent of Oregon priority projects for funding \n     from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund would serve \n     communities with a population of less than 5,000; and\n       Whereas the current levels of funding for the Drinking \n     Water State Revolving Fund and the Clean Water State \n     Revolving Fund are not sufficient to ensure that Oregon's \n     public drinking water and wastewater systems and treatment \n     facilities are maintained and protected to benefit the health \n     and safety of Oregon residents and benefit Oregon water \n     resources;\n       Whereas investing in Oregon's public drinking water and \n     wastewater systems and treatment facilities will create and \n     support family wage jobs for Oregon workers; and\n       Whereas according to the National Utility Contractors \n     Association, for every $1 billion that is invested nationally \n     in water infrastructure, almost 27,000 jobs are created; and\n       Whereas it is critical for Oregon students to have access \n     to safe and clean drinking water; and\n       Whereas there is currently no dedicated federal funding \n     available for updating and repairing drinking water systems \n     in public schools; and\n       Whereas protecting the public drinking water and wastewater \n     systems and treatment facilities in the nation's communities \n     is of crucial importance and requires an ongoing federal \n     funding commitment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislative Assembly of the State of \n     Oregon:\n       (1) The Seventy-seventh Legislative Assembly of the State \n     of Oregon urges the Congress of the United States of America \n     to increase investment in the Drinking Water State Revolving \n     Fund to upgrade and repair the nation's aging public drinking \n     water systems in order to ensure that all citizens have \n     access to safe, clean and affordable drinking water.\n       (2) The Seventy-seventh Legislative Assembly urges the \n     Congress of the United States to increase investment in the \n     Clean Water State Revolving Fund to upgrade and repair the \n     nation's aging public water and\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\n     wastewater treatment systems in order to ensure the health \n     and safety of the nation's urban and rural environments and \n     water resources.\n       (3) The Seventy-seventh Legislative Assembly urges the \n     Congress of the United States to ensure that federal funding \n     is available for public water systems in both large and small \n     communities and ensure that dedicated funding is made \n     available for updating and repairing drinking water systems \n     in the nation's public schools.\n       (4) A copy of this memorial shall be sent to the President \n     and Vice President of the United States, to the Senate \n     Majority Leader, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and to each member of the Oregon \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-48. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California memorializing the President and \n     Congress of the United States to enact appropriate \n     legislation reauthorizing the federal Older Americans Act of \n     1965; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, In 2006, Congress reauthorized the federal Older \n     Americans Act of 1965 in its entirety, effective through the \n     2011 fiscal year; and\n       Whereas, The federal Older Americans Act of 1965 has not \n     been reauthorized since 2006, although it was updated in 2009 \n     and funding for its programs has been authorized since that \n     date on an annual basis; and\n       Whereas, The congressional appropriations staff continue to \n     stress the tight spending caps on discretionary programs \n     imposed by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997; and\n       Whereas, A substantial number of older Americans living in \n     the State of California will be at risk if there are \n     significant reductions in allocated funds for the programs \n     funded by the act; and\n       Whereas, Further delay in the reauthorization of the \n     federal Older Americans Act of 1965 will erode the capacity \n     of the act's various structures to deliver services to meet \n     the needs of older Americans; and\n       Whereas, The federal Older Americans Act of 1965 should \n     immediately be reauthorized to preserve the aging network's \n     role in home- and community-based services, maintain the \n     advocacy and consumer directed focus of the act, and give \n     area agencies on aging increased flexibility in planning and \n     delivering services to vulnerable older Americans; and\n       Whereas, The federal Older Americans Act of 1965 should be \n     funded in the same manner in which the act has been funded \n     for the past 48 years: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature memorializes the \n     President and the Congress of the United States to enact \n     appropriate legislation that would reauthorize the federal \n     Older Americans Act of 1965; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to the \n     Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, to each \n     Senator and Representative from California in the Congress of \n     the United States, and to the author for appropriate \n     distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-49.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     protest against the closure of the Cherrybell Postal \n     Processing and Distribution Center; to the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2007\n\n       To the Members of the United States Congress:\n       Your memorialist respectfully represents:\n       Whereas, the Cherrybell Postal Processing and Distribution \n     Center (Cherrybell) serves the entire southern portion of \n     Arizona covering the counties of Pima, Santa Cruz and \n     Cochise. Currently, Southern Arizona is facing a potential \n     economic downfall due to the initial decision made by the \n     United States Postal Service Board of Governors to close \n     Cherrybell; and\n       Whereas, more than 1.8 million people and 23,197 businesses \n     use the Cherrybell postal services. According to United \n     States Postal Service officials, over 3 million pieces of \n     mail go through Cherrybell each day as it is the 15th largest \n     facility serving the 33rd largest population area in our \n     nation. Thus, the processing and sorting operations at \n     Cherrybell that are being proposed to be moved to Phoenix \n     affect approximately 280 jobs in Southern Arizona; and\n       Whereas, Southern Arizona, which includes both the Tohono \n     O'odham nation and Pasqua Yaqui tribal lands, encompasses the \n     California and Arizona border at Yuma south to Nogales, \n     across to Douglas and Bisbee in Cochise County and the \n     military installations located at Fort Huachuca and Davis \n     Monthan, depends on the Cherrybell Post office; and\n       Whereas, Council Member Richard Fimbres went on record \n     opposing the closure of Cherrybell Post Office and requested \n     that the Tucson City Council work directly with Tucson's \n     congressional delegation and community members to frame a \n     campaign to protect the vital jobs at Cherrybell; and\n       Whereas, Pima County Recorder F. Ann Rodriguez, objects to \n     the closure of Cherrybell and firmly believes this change \n     will clearly impact the activities of the state and county \n     elections officials in Arizona and will cause a detrimental \n     impact to voters. The information provided to the public by \n     the United States Postal Services is based entirely on \n     economic considerations with no apparent regard for the \n     impact of the change on the fundamental right to vote of all \n     citizens and, in particular, the significant additional \n     detrimental impact to Native American voters in the region; \n     and\n       Whereas, 600 people attended the public hearing, which was \n     scheduled three days after Christmas, and 6,000 people wrote \n     letters and signed online petitions urging the United States \n     Postal Service Board of Governors not to close Cherrybell.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States protest the \n     proposed closing of Cherrybell Postal Processing and \n     Distribution Center.\n       2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State \n     of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-51. A memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State \n     of Arizona urging the United States to propose an amendment \n     to the Constitution of the United States to provide rights to \n     victims of crime; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                          House Memorial 2002\n\n       To the Congress of the United States of America:\n       Your memorialist respectfully represents:\n       Whereas, criminal defendants are afforded numerous federal \n     rights and procedural protections; and\n       Whereas, victims of crime are not afforded any federal \n     constitutional rights or protections; and\n       Whereas, the people of this state believe in the individual \n     rights and liberties of all persons and have amended the \n     Constitution of Arizona to provide crime victims with rights, \n     and yet it is clear that without federal constitutional \n     rights, crime victims' rights are less meaningful and \n     enforceable.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States propose to the \n     people an amendment to the Constitution of the United States \n     that provides rights to crime victims and that embodies the \n     following principles:\n       (a) The right to be informed of and not excluded from any \n     public proceedings relating to the crime.\n       (b) The right to be heard regarding any release from \n     custody.\n       (c) The right to consideration for the safety and privacy \n     of the victim, the victim's interest in avoiding unreasonable \n     delay and the victim's interest in restitution.\n       (d) The right to be heard regarding any negotiated plea or \n     sentence.\n       (e) The right to receive notice of release or escape.\n       2. That any amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States to establish rights for crime victims grant standing \n     to victims of crime to assert all rights established by the \n     Constitution.\n       3. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\n     to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives and each Member of \n     Congress from the State of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-52. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada urging Congress to enact comprehensive \n     immigration reform; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, The United States is predominantly a nation of \n     immigrants that draws strength from the diversity of its \n     residents; and\n       Whereas, Hardworking persons who aspire to become citizens \n     of the United States have contributed to the prosperity of \n     the State of Nevada in extraordinary ways through the years; \n     and\n       Whereas, The operation of a strong and vibrant democracy is \n     likely to be impeded unless all men and women, regardless of \n     their race, creed, color, ethnicity or birthplace, are able \n     to participate meaningfully in the political process with \n     full rights and the equal protection attendant thereto; and\n       Whereas, We believe in the human dignity of all residents \n     of the United States, regardless of their immigration status, \n     and recognize the importance of the many contributions that \n     immigrants have made to the social and economic fabric of \n     Nevada; and\n       Whereas, A comprehensive approach to fixing our broken \n     immigration system would strengthen the economy of our State \n     and our nation, and would free aspiring citizens to make even \n     greater contributions to our communities, our State and our \n     nation; and\n       Whereas, We support immigration reform that keeps families \n     together, upholds our values as a nation, promotes economic \n     growth and provides long-term solutions to the current \n     problems resulting from our immigration system; and\n       Whereas, Comprehensive immigration reform must include a \n     significant reduction in the often unreasonable wait times \n     and arbitrary rules that keep families separated from their \n     loved ones; and\n       Whereas, Comprehensive immigration reform must include a \n     realistic pathway to citizenship for all hardworking and \n     taxpaying aspiring citizens who live in this country and meet \n     reasonable requirements; and\n       Whereas, Comprehensive immigration reform must provide a \n     mechanism for aspiring citizens who have grown up in this \n     country to become citizens and be better able to fully \n     contribute to our joint future; and\n       Whereas, The reform of our nation's immigration system must \n     occur in a thoughtful manner which builds the strength and \n     unity of working people, and guarantees the same rights, \n     obligations and basic fairness for all workers, no matter \n     their country of birth or origin; and\n       Whereas, Comprehensive immigration reform must include a \n     new temporary worker program that provides for strict \n     compliance with the labor standards and wage and hour \n     requirements of the United States, portability of work visas \n     so that workers may change jobs and the ability of workers to \n     petition for permanent residency; and\n       Whereas, The enforcement provisions which accompany \n     comprehensive immigration reform must restore respect for the \n     law by promoting strict adherence to our nation's values, \n     including due process, civil and human rights, accountability \n     and proportionality; and\n       Whereas, The focus of law enforcement, both within and at \n     the borders of the United States, should be to prevent \n     criminals, and those persons attempting to enter the country \n     for the purpose of doing harm to this nation, from entering \n     or remaining in the United States; and\n       Whereas, Comprehensive immigration reform must include a \n     funding stream to address the entire spectrum of fiscal \n     impacts that will be experienced by state governments as a \n     result of programs for guest workers, earned legalization and \n     increases in the number of immigrants; and\n       Whereas, Our federal elected officials must create an \n     immigration process that strengthens our nation's economy and \n     allows aspiring citizens to continue making contributions to \n     our communities, our State and our nation: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the 77th Session of the Nevada \n     Legislature hereby urge Congress to enact comprehensive \n     immigration reform as outlined in this resolution which \n     addresses: (1) earned legal residency accompanied by a clear \n     path to citizenship; (2) the future immigration of families \n     and workers; (3) improved immigration enforcement and border \n     security that is consistent with our nation's values; and (4) \n     a funding stream to address the entire fiscal impacts on \n     state governments; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the \n     presiding officer of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives and each member of the Nevada \n     Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-53. A joint memorial adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of Colorado urging Congress to adopt comprehensive \n     immigration reform; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                      Senate Joint Memorial 13-003\n\n       Whereas, Unlike most nations, America has a long and rich \n     heritage of generous immigration laws; and\n       Whereas, Many employers are faced with an insufficient \n     number of visas for workers to support the needs of the \n     United States economy, with arbitrary visa caps creating \n     backlogs, frequent exploitation by employers through wage and \n     workplace violations, and inadequate government \n     infrastructure to efficiently administer our numerous guest \n     worker programs; and\n       Whereas, Colorado's identity is defined by its promise of \n     equal opportunity, esteem for diversity and commitment to \n     innovation; and\n       Whereas, Coloradans have prospered because of the \n     contributions of hardworking immigrants who aspire to \n     citizenship; and\n       Whereas, We believe in the human dignity of all Colorado \n     residents, regardless of immigration status, and recognize \n     the importance of immigrants' many contributions to the \n     social and economic fabric of the state of Colorado; and\n       Whereas, Becoming a citizen of the United States means \n     taking a solemn oath to uphold our nation's Constitution and \n     to forsake allegiance to other nations; and\n       Whereas, Citizenship is the legal embodiment and symbol of \n     full membership and participation in society that should be \n     encouraged for all who can meet the lawful standards for \n     citizenship; and\n       Whereas, Keeping families together not only is the correct \n     and moral thing to do but is also good for the economy \n     because families provide a base of support that increases \n     worker productivity and spurs entrepreneurship; and\n       Whereas, It is universally recognized that adequate border \n     security is a fundamental prerequisite for successful and \n     lasting immigration reform; and\n       Whereas, America's current immigration system is widely \n     recognized as dysfunctional because it harms our economy and \n     does not reflect Colorado's values; and\n       Whereas, A well-designed and efficiently enforced \n     immigration system is a federal responsibility, and a \n     comprehensive approach to solve our broken immigration system \n     would strengthen Colorado's and the nation's economy and \n     would free aspiring citizens to make an even greater \n     contribution to our communities; and\n       Whereas, The federal government's inability to enact \n     immigration reform has created severe economic, cultural, and \n     political strains in communities across Colorado and has led \n     to a patchwork of state laws that inadequately address \n     immigration-related problems; and\n       Whereas, Immigration reform must occur in a comprehensive, \n     thoughtful manner that builds the strength and unity of \n     working people, keeps families together wherever possible, \n     and guarantees the same rights, obligations, and basic \n     fairness for all lawful workers, no matter where they come \n     from; and\n       Whereas, Comprehensive immigration reform must provide a \n     fair, equitable, and realistic mechanism for aspiring \n     citizens who have grown up in this country to become citizens \n     and be able to fully contribute to our joint future; and\n       Whereas, Comprehensive immigration reform must update the \n     legal immigration system so that the future flow of legal \n     guest workers more realistically matches our nation's labor \n     needs and is structured to protect the employment, wages, and \n     working conditions of U.S. and lawful immigrant workers; and\n       Whereas, Comprehensive immigration reform must strengthen \n     the small business workforce and customer base, reward \n     initiative with the American promise of opportunity, promote \n     productivity, reduce red tape, and strengthen the American \n     economy; and\n       Whereas, Any new guest worker visa program must provide for \n     strict compliance with United States labor standards and wage \n     and hour standards, portability of visas so that workers can \n     change jobs under prescribed circumstances, and the ability \n     for workers to petition for permanent residency; and\n       Whereas, Comprehensive immigration reform must aim to \n     reduce the unreasonable wait times and overly complex rules \n     that keep families unreasonably separated from their loved \n     ones; and\n       Whereas, Colorado citizens support a comprehensive \n     immigration reform that keeps families together wherever \n     possible, upholds our values as a state and nation, promotes \n     small business and economic growth, and provides long-term, \n     practicable and enforceable solutions to our broken \n     immigration system: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-ninth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein:\n       That we urge the 113th Congress to enact comprehensive \n     immigration reform as outlined in this Joint Memorial; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Joint Memorial shall be \n     delivered to the U.S. Speaker of the House, President of the \n     U.S. Senate, members of Colorado's Congressional delegation, \n     members of Colorado's General Assembly, and the Governor of \n     Colorado.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-54.

A bill to exclude from gross income compensation provided \nfor victims of the March 29, 2013, pipeline oil spill in Mayflower, \nArkansas; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, on March 29, 2013, the ExxonMobil \npipeline\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\nruptured spilling an estimated 147,000 gallons of oil into Mayflower, \nArkansas. Victims of this oil spill are rightfully being compensated by \nExxonMobil, but the Internal Revenue Service has said that compensatory \npayments will be considered taxable income. These families should not \nhave to pay taxes on this disaster relief assistance. The Mayflower Oil \nSpill Tax Relief Act of 2013 prohibits compensation to Mayflower oil \nspill victims from being taxed by treating it as ``a qualified disaster \nrelief payment'' under current law. My colleague Senator Pryor joins me \nin introducing this important legislation. I would also like to thank \nRepresentative Tim Griffin for his support and leadership on the House \ncompanion version of the Mayflower Oil Spill Tax Relief Act of 2013.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1350\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

MAYFLOWER, ARKANSAS OIL SPILL COMPENSATION EXCLUDED \n                   FROM GROSS INCOME.\n\n       For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986--\n       (1) the March 29, 2013, pipeline rupture and oil spill in \n     Mayflower, Arkansas, shall be treated as a qualified disaster \n     under section 139(c) of such Code, and\n       (2) any compensation provided to or for the benefit of a \n     victim of such disaster shall be treated as a qualified \n     disaster relief payment under section 139(b) of such Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 1353. A bill to provide for an ongoing, voluntary public-private \npartnership to improve cybersecurity, and to strengthen cybersecurity \nresearch and development, workforce development and education, and \npublic awareness and preparedness, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the cybersecurity legislation Senator \nThune and I introduce today is built upon several years of bipartisan \nhard work on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee. I am proud of that fact and proud of our work product.\n  I would like to sincerely thank Senator Thune for working closely \nwith me on this legislation. Senator Thune appreciates the gravity of \nthe cybersecurity threat to our national security and our economy--a \ngenuine threat to the free flow of commerce. He has been laser focused \nin finding workable, private sector led solutions to mitigate this \nexistential threat.\n  Our bill will go a long way to better secure our nation from ongoing \ncyber threats by having the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, NIST, a world-class, non-regulatory agency within the \nDepartment of Commerce--facilitate and support the development of \nvoluntary, industry-led standards and best practices to reduce cyber \nrisks to critical infrastructure and all businesses.\n  Our bill will give NIST the permanent authority it needs to continue \nthe standards development process initiated by the President's \nExecutive Order on Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity to \nensure such efforts remain industry led and voluntary.\n  It will also make sure that the Federal Government supports cutting \nedge research, works to increase public awareness, and improves our \nworkforce to better address cyber threats.\n  Our country's future economic success and security demands prompt \nattention to the cyber threat. It demands we all pull together to face \nthe reality of cyber intrusions into every aspect of our nation's \nbusiness, our electric grid, our trade secrets, our water supply, and \nso much more. The stakes are great. This is about our national \nsecurity--3 Directors of National Intelligence have said cyber attacks \nare the number 1 national security threat to our country. That is why \nwe have to find a way to reach a consensus that allows us to \nresponsibly legislate.\n  This bill is a very good start. There is a lot more we can and should \ndo to protect our critical infrastructure, including promoting more \nsharing of private sector threat information. I will certainly keep \nlooking for ways to work with my colleagues to provide this nation with \nthe tools and resources we need to take on this threat.\n  Again, I thank Senator Thune for dedicating his time, talent, and \nenergy to this legislation, and his fine staff.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1353\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Cruise Ship Act of \n     2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) cruise ships carry millions of passengers through North \n     American waters each year, showcase some of the most \n     beautiful ocean and coastal environments in the United \n     States, and provide opportunities for passengers to relax and \n     enjoy oceans and marine ecosystems;\n       (2) the natural beauty and health of the ocean and coastal \n     environment is what draws passengers to travel along these \n     waterways by ship;\n       (3) protecting the natural environment is beneficial to \n     both the environment and to the cruise industry;\n       (4) the number of cruise passengers continues to grow, \n     making the cruise industry 1 of the fastest growing tourism \n     sectors in the world;\n       (5) in 2010, more than 10,000,000 passengers departed from \n     North America on thousands of cruise ships;\n       (6) as of 2010, the average annual growth rate of cruise \n     passengers is 7.5 percent;\n       (7) during the 2 decades preceding the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the average cruise ship size has increased at a \n     rate of approximately 90 feet every 5 years;\n       (8) an average-sized cruise vessel generates millions of \n     gallons of liquid waste and many tons of solid waste;\n       (9) in just 1 week, a 3000-passenger cruise ship generates \n     approximately 200,000 gallons of human sewage, more than \n     1,000,000 gallons of water from showers and sinks and \n     dishwashing water (commonly known as ``graywater''), more \n     than 8 tons of solid waste, and toxic wastes from dry \n     cleaning and photo-processing laboratories;\n       (10) in an Environmental Protection Agency survey of 29 \n     ships traveling in Alaskan waters, reported sewage generation \n     rates ranged from 1,000 to 74,000 gallons per day per vessel, \n     with the average volume of sewage generated being 21,000 \n     gallons per day per vessel;\n       (11) those frequently untreated cruise ship discharges \n     deliver nutrients, hazardous substances, pharmaceuticals, and \n     human pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, directly \n     into the marine environment;\n       (12) in the final report of the United States Commission on \n     Ocean Policy, that Commission found that cruise ship \n     discharges, if not treated and disposed of properly, and the \n     cumulative impacts caused when cruise ships repeatedly visit \n     the same environmentally sensitive areas, ``can be a \n     significant source of pathogens and nutrients with the \n     potential to threaten human health and damage shellfish beds, \n     coral reefs, and other aquatic life'';\n       (13) pollution from cruise ships not only has the potential \n     to threaten marine life and human health through consumption \n     of contaminated seafood, but also poses a health risk for \n     recreational swimmers, surfers, and other beachgoers;\n       (14) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     ``Sewage may host many pathogens of concern to human health, \n     including Salmonella, Shigella, Hepatitis A and E, and \n     gastro-intestinal viruses. Sewage contamination in swimming \n     areas and shellfish beds poses potential risks to human \n     health and the environment by increasing the rate of \n     waterborne illnesses'';\n       (15) the nutrient pollution from human sewage discharges \n     from cruise ships can contribute to the incidence of harmful \n     algal blooms;\n       (16) algal blooms have been implicated in the deaths of \n     marine life, including the deaths of more than 150 manatees \n     off the coast of Florida;\n       (17) in a 2005 report requested by the International \n     Council of Cruise Lines, the Science Panel of the Ocean \n     Conservation and Tourism Alliance recommended that--\n       (A) ``[a]ll blackwater should be treated'';\n       (B) treated blackwater should be ``avoided in ports, close \n     to bathing beaches or water bodies with restricted \n     circulation, flushing or inflow''; and\n       (C) blackwater should not be discharged within 4 nautical \n     miles of shellfish beds, coral reefs, or other sensitive \n     habitats;\n       (18) that Science Panel further recommended that graywater \n     be treated in the same manner as blackwater and that sewage \n     sludge be off-loaded to approved land-based facilities;\n       (19) in a summary of recommendations for addressing \n     unabated point sources of pollution, the Pew Oceans \n     Commission states that, ``Congress should enact legislation \n     that regulates wastewater discharges from cruise ships under \n     the Clean Water Act by establishing uniform minimum standards \n     for discharges in all State waters and prohibiting discharges \n     within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone that do not meet \n     effluent standards.''; and\n       (20) a comprehensive statutory regime for managing \n     pollution discharges from cruise vessels, applicable \n     throughout the United States, is needed--\n       (A) to protect coastal and ocean areas from pollution \n     generated by cruise vessels;\n       (B) to reduce and better regulate discharges from cruise \n     vessels; and\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\n       (C) to improve monitoring, reporting, and enforcement of \n     standards regarding discharges.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to amend the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) \n     to establish national standards and prohibitions for \n     discharges from cruise vessels.\n\n     SEC. 3.
