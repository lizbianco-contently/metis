I would object, Mr. President, to any further proceedings \nwith regard to this bill at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed upon the calendar.\n\n\n                             U.S. Military\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the late military historian John Keegan once \nsaid:\n\n       Soldiers, when committed to a task, can't compromise. It's \n     unrelenting devotion to the standards of duty and courage, \n     absolute loyalty to others, not letting the task go until \n     it's been done.\n\n  The integrity of the American soldiers safeguards our American \ndemocracy. Their devotion to duty, even in the face of difficult, \ntrying circumstances, is what protects this Nation.\n  We have seen that up close the last 10 years or so with the war in \nIraq and the conflict in Afghanistan. So I am very thankful for members \nof the U.S. Armed Forces and that they do not compromise their honor.\n  This past weekend our military refused to abandon its duty, instead \nfulfilling its obligation to never, ever, leave a soldier behind.\n  The release of American prisoner of war SGT Bowe Bergdahl was the \nculmination of heroic efforts by our military, our government, and our \nPresident.\n  President Obama, as Commander in Chief, acted honorably in helping an \nAmerican soldier return home to his family. Sergeant Bergdahl's release \nis the answer to many Americans' prayers. I can't imagine how relieved \nhis parents and family must feel.\n  It is my understanding that the wait for the parents has been really \nunrelenting and difficult. We have seen his dad with his long, flowing \nbeard. He decided to grow that beard as long as his son was gone. His \nson is home now--or almost home.\n  Unfortunately, though, opponents of President Obama have seized upon \nthe release of an American prisoner of war, using what should be a \nmoment of unity and celebration for our Nation as a chance to play \npolitical games.\n  The safe return of an American soldier should not be used to score \npolitical points. When a man or woman puts on a uniform as a U.S. \nserviceman, they have America's uncompromising support.\n  Only a couple of weeks ago, the junior Senator from New Hampshire \nreleased a statement touting her diligence in calling upon the \nDepartment of Defense to ``do all it can to find Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl \nand bring him home.''\n  In April, the Republican leader and the junior Senator from \nPennsylvania sponsored a resolution ``to express the sense of the \nSenate that no member of the Armed Forces who is missing in action \nshould be left behind.''\n  Senator Inhofe, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, even said that the \nUnited States ``must make every effort to bring this captured soldier \nhome to his family.''\n  President Obama and his team did just that. They made every effort \nand brought this young man home. The request was made by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, the Republican leader, the junior Senator from \nPennsylvania, and the senior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Yet some of these Senators are now denouncing the very same efforts \nthat secured Sergeant Bergdahl's release. It is clear they are worried \nhis release could be seen as a victory for President Obama. As the \nPresident said, this is not a victory for him; it is a victory for the \nUnited States military and our country.\n  Let me put that notion to rest then. It is not a victory for \nPresident Obama. It is a victory for our soldiers, their families, and \nour great country. No member of the Armed Forces should be left behind, \nand President Obama saw to that.\n  There are questions regarding Sergeant Bergdahl's disappearance and \nwhether or not military code was violated. These are issues that will \nbe resolved by the U.S. Army, not Monday morning quarterbacks on \nCapitol Hill.\n  But let me just say this. For the sake of argument, let's assume that \nBergdahl did violate his sworn oath. What do we do? Do we mete out \njustice to an American soldier--us, our country? As the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff has said yesterday, or the day before, if he has \ndone something wrong, military justice will step in and take care of \nthat violation--if, in fact, there was one.\n  I don't know, but certainly that is a better approach than having the \nTaliban do it. I will choose the justice system, the U.S. Army, \nAmerican justice, every time.\n  We have seen the brutality of the Taliban. Whatever the results of \nthe military's inquiries, it doesn't change the fact that one more \nAmerican soldier is home safely.\n  What was the alternative?\n  Would any American honestly prefer that a U.S. soldier remain in \ncaptivity until all the questions have been answered? Of course not. In \nthe United States we rescue our soldiers first and ask questions later.\n  This is what RADM John Kirby said in a quote that is so powerful:\n\n       When you are in the Navy, and you go overboard, it doesn't \n     matter if you were pushed, fell or jumped. We're going to \n     turn the ship around and pick you up.\n\n  That is what Rear Admiral Kirby said--again:\n\n       When you are in the Navy, and you go overboard, it doesn't \n     matter if you were pushed, fell or jumped. We're going to \n     turn the ship around and pick you up.\n\n  I am grateful for the many people who refused to forget about \nSergeant Bergdahl and worked tirelessly to secure his release.\n  America is glad he is home.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                      Coal Country Protection Act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. President Obama's new energy regulations would shift \nmiddle class jobs overseas, splinter our manufacturing base, and boost \nenergy costs for struggling families.\n  The regulations could also lead to a reduction of nearly half a \nmillion jobs, according to an AFL-CIO union estimate. The union's \nleader characterized the job loss as ``long term and irreversible.'' He \nnoted that the President's regulations would not achieve ``any \nsignificant reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions''--this is an \nAFL-CIO union leader--in other words, lots of pain for minimal gain.\n  The President's energy regulations would hurt the poor, the \nunemployed, seniors, and especially families in Kentucky. Kentucky coal \nsector employment has collapsed by about 7,000 jobs since President \nObama took office.\n  Eastern Kentucky just saw a 3-percent reduction in coal jobs in the \nfirst quarter of 2014. At least three additional Kentuckians lose their \npaychecks indirectly for every mining job that is lost.\n  As one coal leader noted, the administration's proposed regulations \nwould only add to the economic challenges facing Kentucky--especially \nin Eastern Kentucky, which is ground zero for what is happening in coal \ncountry.\n  The Coal Country Protection Act is cosponsored by several Senators, \nincluding Senator Rand Paul, and is supported by the Kentucky Coal \nAssociation.\n\n[[Page S3389]]\n\n  It would require that simple but important benchmarks be met before \nthe President's new rules could take effect. No. 1, the Secretary of \nLabor would have to certify that the regulations would not generate a \nloss of employment.\n  No. 2, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office would have to \ncertify that the regulations would not result in any loss in American \ngross domestic product.\n  No. 3, the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration \nwould have to certify that the regulations would not increase \nelectricity rates.\n  No. 4, the Chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the \npresident of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation would \nhave to certify that electricity delivery would remain reliable. So the \nCoal Country Protection Act is just common sense.\n  Moments ago the majority leader blocked consideration of this \nmeasure. Unless we take this up, debate it, and pass it, the \nPresident's rules will cause job loss, utility rate hikes, and \npotentially brownouts. The President's regulations will actually \nincrease energy prices and create job loss.\n  Opponents of this bill will be supporting job loss in Kentucky, our \neconomy being hurt, and seniors' energy bills spiking for almost zero \nmeaningful global carbon reduction.\n  So the majority leader and the Democrats in this body need to listen. \nAnd even if they won't, Kentuckians should know I will keep fighting \nfor them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss EPA's joint \nproposed rule redefining waters of the United States.\n  Claims to the contrary notwithstanding, EPA has once again thrown \ndown the gauntlet with this massive expansion of Federal jurisdiction. \nThis new rule in its essence declares almost every body of water to be \nwithin Federal regulatory jurisdiction. By conjuring up even the most \nremote connection to a navigable body of water, EPA is now claiming \nthey can regulate ponds, ditches, and even low-lying areas that are \nactually dry during most of the year. EPA seems to think it has \njurisdiction if there is just a chance that a speck of dirt can travel \nthrough a stream, a pond, or even a field to traditional navigable \nwater, and that is clearly not what Congress intended. But the EPA, the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, and even the USDA are touting that they \nlistened to agriculture and that farmers' and ranchers' concerns were, \nin fact, reflected in this proposal. But if this 370-page rule actually \nprovides certainty and maintains exemptions for farmers, as EPA claims, \nthen why are most farm groups so opposed to it?\n  We have seen EPA become better and better at messaging to farmers, \nbut unfortunately the actual language of the regulations--their very \naggressive approach--really hasn't changed one bit. While EPA has shown \na willingness to meet and to listen, the reality is that the words on \npaper really are what matter.\n  When Administrator McCarthy came before an appropriations \nsubcommittee a few weeks ago, I pushed her on this issue. Not \nsurprisingly, she told me they are really trying to get this right and \nlisten to agriculture's concerns across the country. But as it stands \nright now, folks in farm country are justifiably alarmed.\n  EPA will point to a few exclusions in the rule, but if you look \nclosely, these exemptions are so very narrowly crafted that very few \nwaters actually would escape EPA's regulatory grasp and overreach. For \nexample, under the proposed rule, waters that are perennial, \nintermittent, or ephemeral can be subject to EPA regulation. That is \nright--EPA is trying to regulate bodies of water that only have water \nin them when it is raining. That is just one of the many examples in \nthis rule where it is clear that EPA is trying to push the envelope--\nand push it as far as they can.\n  In its so-called fact sheet on the benefits of the rule for \nagriculture, EPA touts that exemptions are, in fact, preserved for \nagriculture. Not only that, but according to the fact sheet, EPA will \nnow exempt 56 conservation practices from permitting requirements. It \nsays this will provide certainty and predictability. That all sounds \ngood as messaging until you actually examine the claims. These \nexemptions only apply to dredge and fill permitting. All other Clean \nWater Act permitting requirements do not have exemptions for \nagriculture. So whether a permit is required for other provisions of \nthe act is simply a function of whether the related waters are Federal \nwaters. Thus, because EPA vastly expanded the definition of Federal \nwaters, farmers are going to get a rude awakening when they are told \nthey need a 402 permit before applying pesticides or when they realize \nthis rule may require them to have a spill prevention, control, and \ncountermeasure plan in place or when they realize their farm pond is \nnot exempt simply because they allow livestock to drink from it. \nImagine the dismay of farmers when they realize that the much-touted \nexemptions are essentially meaningless and that they are subject to \nfines of tens of thousands of dollars per day.\n  Nonetheless, the Obama administration continues to tout this list of \n56 conservation practices that they are proposing to exempt as if \nfarmers should fall silent in gratitude. It is the classic smoke and \nmirror approach that has led to the tremendous mistrust of this \nadministration. They say one thing while putting policies in place that \ndictate something entirely different.\n  Consider this: Even these narrow conservation exemptions are wrapped \nin fine print and redtape. EPA also says that in order to be exempt, a \nconservation practice must specifically comply with USDA standards. \nAgain, it sounds reasonable, except that these standards, which were \ndeveloped for voluntary conservation programs, were never intended to \nbe the only means of avoiding a regulatory hammer. These are gold-\nplated standards. They are also very prescriptive. That may be fine for \nvoluntary programs that come with compensation for compliance. It is \nnot fine if farmers must follow them or face huge fines. There is \nnothing voluntary about that.\n  Can these farmers be sued because they didn't follow supposedly \nvoluntary USDA standards? Can EPA take action against these farm \nfamilies? Who will enforce compliance with those conservation \npractices? Will it be the USDA or will it be the EPA? Farmers generally \ntrust USDA's voluntary approach to conservation efforts, but what \nhappens to that trust if USDA is suddenly thrust into the business of \nenforcing EPA regulations on the farm? Conversely, is EPA going to hold \nany sway over USDA's voluntary conservation standards? Since they are \nplanning to use those standards to regulate farms, this is a great \nconcern.\n  Let me mention one additional cause for concern. These supposedly \nexempt practices are not even in the proposed rule; they are in a \nseparate document from the rule, and that document can change on the \nwhim of the EPA without warning and with no opportunity whatsoever for \npublic comment. So ranchers doing a practice consistent with the list \nmay get the rug pulled out from under them.\n  EPA claims this rule will provide certainty and predictability, and \nin one respect they are right. As a constituent of mine from Ogallala \nrightly put it, ``The only clarity the proposed rule provides is to put \nme on notice that everything is a water of the U.S. and that I need a \npermit to do anything.''\n  So it appears that in an effort to provide clarity, EPA has very much \ndone\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\nthe opposite. And I have just scratched the surface here today. But EPA \nstill has an opportunity to fix this mess. While the tendency of this \nadministration has been to overregulate from day one, there is still an \nopportunity to pull back the rule and admit they went too far.\n  I had high hopes when Administrator McCarthy took the reins and \nexpressed a desire to build trust with the ag community. In fact, she \ncalled it a priority. This rule, though, delivers the opposite message. \nIf Administrator McCarthy is serious about having a relationship with \nthe people I represent--ag producers--it would send such a powerful \nsignal to say: Hold on. Let's withdraw the rule. Let's not follow this \nmisguided direction. Call a timeout, and people would see that and say: \nI am going to listen. People would receive that so positively. This \nwould certainly get the attention of the ag community and really begin \nto build bridges instead of outlining rhetorical wishes.\n  The window of opportunity is still open, and I hope the Administrator \nseizes it by withdrawing the rule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

He said:\n\n       I'm a retired hospital CEO and glad to be retired because \n     of Obamacare.\n\n  He points out in an absolutely correct way that in most communities \nin Missouri, particularly our small and midsized communities, the \nhospital is a real source of pride and place of healing, a major \nemployer.\n  Of course, the potential end result of what is happening now with the \nchanges we made and how hospitals are treated, particularly hospitals \nin rural areas, hospitals in underserved inner-city areas, is that the \nprograms that were in place are basically going away. And why did they \ngo away? Because the President assumed and the Members of Congress, I \nam sure, who voted for this piece of legislation assumed, that \neverybody would be covered, that everybody would have insurance, so we \ndidn't need to have special programs that dealt with people who didn't \nhave insurance and hospitals that dealt with people who didn't have \ninsurance, and we didn't need special programs for underserved areas. \nClearly, that is not the case.\n  If we look back at the debate, many people were saying: This will not \nwork out the way the well-intended proponents of this law think it will \nwork out, and we are going to continue to have people without \ninsurance.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office reiterated again just \nrecently that at the end of 10 years, how many people won't have \ninsurance? Thirty million. Thirty million people didn't have insurance \nwhen we started, and to disrupt the entire health care tableau of the \ncountry to add possibly 10 million, I think we are going to have people \nwho lose insurance at work who previously had insurance through their \nwork. I think that will be one of the major unintended consequences as \nwe approach the end of this year and go into next year.\n\n  I am talking to too many employers in Missouri who are saying there \nis a place for people to go now. They can go to the exchange. We \nstruggled with this for a long time. Even though we are not covered by \nthe law, even though we don't have 50 employees, we are no longer going \nto provide the insurance at work--that many of these employers have \nprovided for decades and others have provided over all the time they \nhave been in business, even if it is less than decades.\n  Norman from Warrensburg, MO, is concerned about what would happen \nwith Medicare and Medicare Advantage. He says: I was struck with \nGuillain-Barre in 2005 which has left me disabled as well as other \nresulting health issues. We expend more than $3,000 out of pocket \nannually just for my prescriptions alone and that was under a Medicare \nAdvantage plan. This plus the Medicare premiums and the physician care \ntakes almost all of our Social Security benefits. We live in a small \ncommunity.\n  He describes Warrensburg as a small community of around 18,000, and \nit would probably be one of those communities to lose the Medicare \nAdvantage type of insurance, which is the gap that he thinks allows his \nfamily to have the health care they have and would like to continue to \nhave.\n  Paula from O'Fallon, MO, says she believes a lot of people's spouses \nare going to leave their jobs because they are going to look at who has \nthe better insurance and try to benefit from that better insurance. \nAccording to her, her husband's company is paying a large fine because \ntheir insurance is better than ObamaCare. I imagine more realistically \nwhat that letter might have said is that their insurance isn't exactly \nwhat the Department of Health and Human Services believes is the right \nkind of insurance, when the government makes these decisions instead of \nthe people or the people closest to them, their employers.\n  One of the benefits of the employer-provided system was that people \ndidn't have to worry about this. In fact, almost everybody looked at \ntheir insurance and they talked with their employer and they decided \nthey would get more information when they needed it, and when they \nneeded it usually the information they got was pretty good information \nfor them to have.\n  Now we have people trying to figure out, if they have choices, a \ncomplexity of choices and alternatives that they never had to deal with \nbefore. Frankly, they are not going to like that, and I think one of \nthe other unintended consequences of this law is that people are going \nto begin to say: I know a government-run program wouldn't be as good as \nthe health care I used to have, but I just don't want to be responsible \nfor it anymore. What we probably are doing is building a groundswell of \npeople who no longer want to be forced into the decisions they never \nhad to make, because 85 percent of everybody who had insurance had \ninsurance at work, and 90 percent of them thought the insurance they \nhad at work met their needs. I think we would be lucky if very far into \nthe Affordable Care Act, 90 percent of the people who have insurance \nthink the insurance they have moving forward meets their needs.\n  Angelyn from Dexter, MO, said her aunt and uncle are searching for a \nnew doctor after their doctor moved out of State. They are having \ntrouble finding a physician in the Dexter area that will take new \nMedicare patients--another unintended consequence.\n  The people who voted for this bill cut Medicare itself. I wasn't for \nit, but it is the law. One of the reasons I said I wasn't for it is we \nare cutting a program we already knew is challenged--Medicare--by $500 \nbillion to form a new program. There is no city council, there is no \ncounty government, there is nowhere else in America where people would \ngo to a meeting and say, OK, we have a program that is in real trouble, \nso what we are going to do is cut that program to start a new program--\nand particularly a program such as Medicare that people have been led \nto believe they can rely on. When we cut Medicare by $500 billion over \n10 years something happens.\n  What Angelyn's aunt and uncle are seeing is one of the things that \nhappens is people try to find a doctor who will take Medicare only and \nfind doctor after doctor who says: We are going to continue to serve \nthe Medicare patients we have as long as they are\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\naround to serve, but we are not serving new Medicare patients.\n  Joanna in Kansas City said her son goes to college where he is \nrequired to have health insurance. His health insurance he gets through \nthe school has increased 40 percent this year.\n  Wayne in Moberly said his premiums and prescription drug costs have \nincreased and he is concerned it is because of all the new requirements \nthat have to be met. He said: ``The future does not look good from \nwhere I stand as a small business owner and a farmer.''\n  Donna in Napoleon, MO, said her insurance had gone from $93 twice a \nmonth to $156 twice a month. The interesting point in her letter is she \nsaid her insurance would go up even more if she gets a chance to work \nmore. There is a lot to be said for assisting people to get health \ninsurance who cannot otherwise afford to get health insurance, but one \nof the things I never heard debated in any extensive way is what \nhappens when people are at the edge of moving to a new level of work \nwhich then gives them a lower level of benefit.\n  Donna is saying that if she gets to work more hours, she will have \nless assistance buying her health insurance and her health insurance \ngoes up. The government should not be in the business of looking for \nways to encourage people not to work, as in the part-time work we see \nall over the country now.\n  One of the great workplace impacts of the health care law was that \nthe government for the first time ever said to most employers--\nemployers of more than 50 people--you have to provide health insurance \nto anybody who works 30 hours a week. So what did employers for the \nfirst time hear the government saying? If someone works less than 30 \nhours a week, they don't have to have to provide health insurance. So \nemployer after employer made the decision that for new employees we are \ngoing to hire three people at 27 or 28 hours a week rather than two \npeople at 40 hours. We are going to meet our workforce needs in a new \nway. Consequently, those individuals don't have coverage. Many \nindividuals at that level of hourly work who used to have coverage no \nlonger have coverage. An awful lot of companies used to provide \ncoverage at half time--at 20 hours--but if the government says they \ndon't have to provide it until 30 hours, it turns out a lot of people \ndon't work more than 30 hours because they don't have an opportunity or \nmaybe they work almost 60 hours, but they have to work 60 hours at two \ndifferent jobs, as did a lady I mentioned just last week who contacted \nour office.\n  David in Kansas City said he is retired from the railroad industry, \nand on April 1 his former company canceled plans for retirees 65 and \nolder. David had access to a retiree plan from the railroad industry. \nHe doesn't have that anymore.\n  A lot of companies have done that, not just the railroad industry. \nIBM announced they would no longer provide health care coverage for \ntheir retirees. As soon as the retirees are 65 and older they are \nplaced on Medicare, but what kind of supplement do they have? They used \nto have a supplement that was part of a big IBM plan and now they don't \nhave that anymore. UPS announced the dependents and spouses who are in \npart of the UPS family wouldn't have insurance anymore. The unintended \nconsequences keep on coming, and we need to continually look at what we \nneed to do to see that people have access to great health care.\n  We are talking now--as we should be--about veterans health care and \nhow veterans could have access to great health care. This is the moment \nright now where we can look at this issue in a new way. The veterans \nservice organizations are looking at this issue. Alternatives are good. \nVeterans should have the best health care, in the best location for \nthem, in the best way the taxpayers can provide it.\n  The Veterans' Administration should be the best at some things. They \nshould be better than anybody else at dealing with IED accidents, eye \ninjuries, the loss of limbs, and other issues that are unique to \nveterans in unfortunate numbers because of the kind of conflicts in \nwhich we have been involved. Nobody should be better at that than the \nVA.\n  The VA may be the absolute best place to go for a particular injury, \nsuch as post-traumatic stress. Our veterans have problems because of \nthe conflicts they have been in, but they also have problems because \nthe National Institutes of Health says one out of four adult Americans \nhas a diagnosable mental health problem. In a hearing a couple months \nago, I asked the Secretary--the Surgeon General of the Army and the \nother forces about this: Do you think that is reflected in the \nmilitary, and the answer was yes. She said: We recruit from the general \npopulation. We don't have any reason to believe our population serving \nin the military doesn't reflect similarly with regard to mental health \nissues. Some of those mental health issues, such as post-traumatic \nstress, the VA should be better than anybody else at, but a lot of \nmental health issues in the VA, there is no reason they should be any \nbetter than any of the other facilities. Veterans may have to drive to \nanother State to get to a veterans facility or have to drive 120 miles \nor 150 miles in the VA's van transportation. If that is what someone \nwants to do as a veteran, I think we ought to be sure veterans can do \nthat, but if veterans want to get better care closer to home, more \nchoices, we should do that.\n  Let the Veterans' Administration compete to be the best at what they \ncan provide. There is no particular reason to believe the Veterans' \nAdministration is going to be better than everybody in the country at \nnormal internal medicine. There is no reason to believe the Veterans' \nAdministration is going to be the best at dealing with cancer or heart \nissues or other issues. If there is a veterans hospital that somehow \nhas figured out how to do that, fine, but don't make veterans drive 120 \nmiles by a dozen facilities that can do just as well or better because \nwe have decided to put people in a system that is totally defined by \nthe government.\n  One of the things we are learning is people can make better choices \nin so many areas than when the government makes those choices for them. \nSo as we think about our veterans, as we think about what we can do to \nbe sure they get the best care, that they are honored, their service is \nhonored in a way they were led to believe it would be honored, this is \na great time to have this discussion.\n  So whether it is health care for everybody else or health care for \nveterans, the Congress of the United States--and the country--has \nprobably never been in a better position to talk about these issues. We \nsee the unintended consequences of taking steps in the wrong direction. \nNow is a great time for our veterans and health care generally to see \nwhat we could do to take steps in the right direction.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to point out it has now been 342 \ndays since the Senate passed bipartisan, comprehensive immigration \nreform that would secure our border, turbocharge America's economic \ngrowth and provide a chance to heal America's broken families who are \nbeing separated by our dysfunctional immigration system.\n  Here is what we know: The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \ntold us that had we passed the bill this last year, we could have \nalready seen up to $80 billion of economic growth, $20 billion of \ndeficit reduction, 50,000 new jobs, $50 billion more in the Social \nSecurity trust fund, $2 billion of revenue for State and local \ngovernments, and 40,000 more brilliant STEM--science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics--graduates stay in the United States \ninstead of being told to go home.\n  Instead, we have not been able to achieve any of these important \ngains. Why is that? It is because the House has refused to do \nanything--underline anything--to try and fix our broken immigration \nsystem. To be clear, the\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\nreal problem is not that there is a difference of opinion between a \nHouse bill and a Senate bill on immigration that cannot be reconciled. \nThe problem is there is no House bill.\n  We are happy to meet our colleagues in the House part of the way. We \nwould love to sit down and negotiate, but there is no House bill. So \nthe problem is not that the two sides are irreconcilable, it is that \none side has refused to do anything. The problem is that House \nRepublicans have completely abdicated their responsibility to address \nimportant issues such as fixing our broken immigration system.\n  For the last few weeks I have explained the reason the House has done \nnothing on immigration is because the House Republican leadership has \nhanded the gavel of leadership on immigration to far-right extremists \nsuch as Congressman Steve King. He is truly extreme on this issue. \nSteven King says to do nothing--absolutely nothing--and the House does \nnothing, absolutely nothing.\n  Well, not only has this point not been refuted by anyone in the \nRepublican Party, it has actually been even further confirmed in the \nlast few days.\n  Let's start with Steve King himself. Last week King filed an \namendment to the Commerce, Justice, and Science appropriations bill \nthat would require the Department of Justice to ``investigate'' the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's use of prosecutorial discretion \ntoward certain immigrants, including beneficiaries of the Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals, or the DACA Program, that the Obama \nadministration announced in June of 2012.\n  When discussing his amendment, Steve King--listen to this--\npejoratively referred to the DACA Program as ``Deferred Action for \nCriminal Aliens.'' That is what he thinks. He thinks that every \nimmigrant is a criminal. When describing this program, Steve King said:\n\n       For everyone who's a valedictorian, there's another 100 out \n     there who weigh 130 pounds--and they've got calves the size \n     of cantaloupes because they have been hauling 75 pounds of \n     marijuana across the border.\n\n  Was King criticized for these comments? Was he chastised and told he \nhas no place in a modern Republican Party? Was King's amendment at \nleast ignored in the same way every other immigration bill has been \nignored?\n  Unfortunately, the answer to all of these questions is no. For the \nsecond time in a year, the House Republican leadership actually \nrewarded King and handed him the gavel yet again by giving him another \nvote on another politically motivated appropriations amendment. The \namendment to investigate the DACA Program is what received a vote last \nweek. Just as before, the House passed yet another inflammatory King \nappropriations amendment along partisan lines. His previous amendment \nwas to defund the DACA Program.\n  This is a man who just last week compared immigrants to Santa Ana's \narmy. He compared immigrants to a foreign invading army. It is a \ncomparison that implies that an immigrant's goal is to harm the \ninterest of the United States when they desperately want to be here and \nparticipate in the freedom--both economic and political--we love and \nenjoy. Yet again, after he said something like this, the Republican \nleadership hands him the gavel on immigration. That is why we continue \nto see nothing out of the House other than inflammatory, rhetorical \namendment show votes. The score is clear: Steve King is still \nundefeated, and he is increasing his margin of victory every day.\n  Well, it doesn't have to be that way. Steve King doesn't represent \nthe vast number of voters in either the Republican Party or even the \ntea party. Steve King does not represent Republicans in this House. \nWhen we joined together on a moderate bipartisan bill that would do so \nmuch good for America, it was supported by traditional Republican \ngroups--the business community, the high-tech community, the \nagricultural growers, the Catholic Church, the evangelical Protestant \nchurch, supported this bipartisan bill. Some on the left thought it was \ntoo conservative.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. Steve King doesn't have to write into \nlaw whatever the House does. Poll after poll is clear that even \nRepublican voters--conservative Republican voters--want to fix our \nbroken immigration system in a manner that secures our borders, fixes \nour legal immigration system, and allows those in the undocumented \nstatus to get right with the law after a long path, including paying \nfines, paying back taxes, learning English, having to work, and going \nto the back of the line and waiting.\n  Steve King is much like the Wizard of Oz when it comes to \nimmigration. He is pulling the levers behind the screen to make it seem \nhe has the power, but the Republican Party will learn sooner or later--\nas Dorothy did in the ``Wizard of Oz''--that King actually works by \nfear, and he doesn't have the power and the wizard's power is \noverstated. He can't really do very much. The only way to get back home \nand do something real is in ourselves, not in that man behind the \nscreen--the Wizard of Oz, Steve King. Where are the leaders in the \nRepublican Party with the courage to stand up to Steve King and the far \nright and say: Enough is enough, we will not let our authority be \nhijacked by extremists whose xenophobia causes them to prefer \nmaintaining a broken immigration system, where hundreds of thousands \nstill cross the border illegally, instead of achieving a fair, tough, \nand practical long-term solution?\n  Make no mistake, immigration reform will either pass this year with \nbipartisan support and a bipartisan imprint or it will pass in a future \nyear with only Democratic support and a Democratic imprint because \nDemocrats control Congress and the White House. Some Democrats argue it \nis better for us politically if the latter occurs, and many \nRepublicans, in their hearts, know that is true. But we don't want \nthat. We want to fix our country's problems. We want our GDP to grow \n3.5 percent as the GPO said it would if we pass this bill. We want to \nsecure our borders once and for all. We want a fair path to citizenship \nso that people who work and pay taxes can get right with the law.\n  Time is running out. We have less than 8 weeks to go to get something \npassed. There is still no serious proposal from Republicans. If the \nHouse fails to act during this window, the President would be more than \njustified in acting anytime after the summer is over to make whatever \nchanges he feels are necessary to make our immigration system work \nbetter for those who are unfairly burdened by our broken laws, but that \nis not the preferable way to go. The preferable way to go is to go the \nway the Senate did where Democrats and Republicans banded together to \ncreate a moderate, thoughtful, comprehensive bill that fixes our broken \nimmigration system once and for all.\n  In conclusion, I hope the immigration reform bill passes this year \nbecause our economy, our broken families, and our country so badly need \nit. Let's hope the House finally stops talking and finally stops paying \nobeisance to their Wizard of Oz on immigration, Steve King, and starts \nacting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/04/senate-section/article/S3392-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3392-S3394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor as the Senate \nbegins the debate on the nomination of Sylvia Burwell to be Secretary \nof Health and Human Services. If she is confirmed for that job, she \nwould be responsible for implementing thousands of pages of regulations \nrelated to the President's health care law. I think it is appropriate, \nas we consider this nomination, to take a little bit of time and talk \nabout the state of the President's health care law.\n  Just this morning I visited with a number of people from Uinta \nCounty, WY. I will tell you what they know and what we all know, and \nthat is there are many dangerous side effects of the law, such as \npeople losing access to their doctor and getting smaller paychecks.\n  Today I want to talk specifically about the expensive side effect so \nmany Americans are facing, and that is how much health insurance \npremiums are rising because of the law. States are starting to release \nthe proposed premiums insurance companies expect to charge next year \nunder the Obama health care law. The numbers are not good for the \nAmerican people--for people who wanted affordable care, quality\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\ncare, and access to care, the kinds of things the President of the \nUnited States looked into the camera and promised them.\n  Virginia was one of the first States to put out the numbers. What is \nhappening in the State of Virginia? Every health plan sold in the State \nexchange expects to raise its rates next year. The State expects some \npeople to pay as much as 17 percent more next year.\n  In Vermont, it is a similar story. There are two companies offering \nplans in the State exchange. Yesterday we learned that one intends to \nraise rates 10 percent, the other expects to raise its rates 15 percent \nnext year.\n  Last Friday Ohio released its proposed rates for people buying \ninsurance through the exchange. The average premium in the State's \nindividual market is expected to be 13 percent higher next year than it \nwas last year. According to State insurance regulators, it is bad news, \nbut it is what they expected.\n  The State Lieutenant Governor said:\n\n       Continued and unnecessary headwinds out of Washington are \n     making it more difficult for job creators, hard-working \n     Ohioans and their families to purchase health insurance.\n\n  President Obama said the Democrats should forcefully defend and be \nproud of the health care law. Is there a Democrat in this body--even \none--who is willing to come to the floor and forcefully defend premium \nincreases of 13 percent, 15 percent, or 17 percent in 1 year alone?\n  More States are going to be releasing their new premiums all summer. \nMore people around the country are going to see these kinds of rate \nincreases. This is an alarming side effect of the President's health \ncare law. That is on top of the rate increases people have already had \nto pay for insurance for this year.\n  It is astonishing when you look at the numbers. It is not just \nfamilies buying health insurance through the exchanges who are getting \nslammed. USA Today ran a headline last week which said:\n\n       More employees are getting hit with higher health insurance \n     premiums and co-payments, and many don't have the money to \n     cover unexpected medical expenses, a new report finds.\n\n  The report found that 56 percent of companies increased their \nemployees' share of health premiums for copayments for doctors' visits \nlast year after the health care law came into effect, and 59 percent of \ncompanies intend to do the same thing this year. So people buying \ninsurance in the exchange are being hurt, people who get insurance \nthrough work are being hurt, and small businesses are being hurt as \nwell.\n  There was an article in the Alaska Dispatch about this last Thursday. \nIt said: ``Alaska's small businesses feel the pinch of rising health \ncare costs.'' The article tells the story of a restaurant owner with 24 \nemployees. He wants to offer health insurance coverage, but he is \npaying $5,000 a month more than he paid last year for his share of the \ninsurance. He is somebody who wants to provide insurance, but it is now \n$5,000 more a month for his 24 employees. He says the costs are \ncrippling and that it is like meeting another payroll every month. This \nsmall business owner said the health care law is ``killing me.'' He \nsays, ``I just don't know how long we can keep absorbing these costs.'' \nThese are costs put on this business owner in Alaska by every Member of \nthe Senate who voted for this health care law--every one of them.\n  I invite any one of them to come down here to forcefully defend this \nlaw as the President requests that they do and be proud of what they \nhave done to this small business owner. Are Democrats in the Senate who \nvoted for this health care law proud of what the law is doing to this \nsmall business owner in Alaska? Are they willing to forcefully defend \nhis having to pay an extra $5,000 a month? That is what people are \ndealing with.\n  There is a story which just came out today about North Carolina--\nanother State where a Senator has said: If you like what you have, you \ncan keep it. The headline to this story is ``ObamaCare cripples North \nCarolina small business.''\n  It says:\n\n       A North Carolina woman currently living her dream--to own a \n     salon--could soon shatter and crumble, leaving her employees \n     to pay astronomical costs for health insurance, all because \n     of ObamaCare.\n       Julia Vittorio, owner of Fresh Salon for the past five \n     years, is worried that she will not be able to provide her \n     employees with health insurance.\n\n  She said: ``I think you just want the best for your employees.''\n  I think that is what many people around the country want: the best \nfor their employees.\n  She said: ``We are a small business and it's very much like a family, \nso I care about our staff.''\n  That is what she told a television station, WCNC in Charlotte.\n\n       She previously offered her employees health insurance and \n     paid part of it, but has been forced to reconsider her \n     decision because of the rising costs of premiums.\n       ``We've been very proud to even carry it for this long, but \n     it's certainly a concern moving into the future if we're \n     going to be able to keep doing it,'' she explained.\n\n  Veronica Cook, a hairdresser who has worked at Fresh Salon since it \nopened, said: ``It's frustrating and scary and you don't know what to \nexpect.''\n  I think that applies to many people around the country as a result of \nthe President's health care law--this quote: ``It's frustrating and \nscary and you don't know what to expect.'' She is not sure what she \nwill do if she has to pay for her own insurance. That is what this \ndevastating side effect of the President's health care law is doing to \npeople all around the country.\n  The President says he wants everyone to have a fair shot. Democrats \nsay it over and over. Is this small business owner getting a fair shot? \nAre the families of Ohio getting a fair shot when their premiums go up \nas much as 13 percent next year?\n  Some Democrats who voted for the health care law have come out and \nsaid that the rates may be going up, but not as fast as maybe they \nwould have without the law. But let's take a step back. When they were \ntrying to pass this health care law, Democrats said it would only raise \npremiums--no. Democrats never said it would only raise premiums by 10 \nto 13 percent. No. They said it would drop premiums by $2,500 a year. \nThat is what the President said--$2,500 per family per year, and he \nsaid by the end of his first term.\n  Well, we met with the President in February of 2010 at the White \nHouse at the roundtable discussion. Senator Lamar Alexander, my \ncolleague from Tennessee, asked specifically about the predictions that \nthe premiums, as we have seen, would go up. The President was making \nthese promises, claims that they would go down. The President denied \nagain to each of us in a face-to-face meeting that they would go up. \nThe President said: ``That's just not the case.''\n  Well, now what we do know is it is the case, and it was the case all \nalong. People believed the President when he promised he would save \nthem money. They thought that Democrats were giving them this fair shot \nthe President talks about. Now they are finding out what they got: \nhigher premiums, higher costs, higher deductibles, higher copays, loss \nof coverage, you can't keep your doctor. It is hard to believe the \nPresident of the United States.\n  This is not what people wanted. People wanted a fair shot. But it is \nnot what the President and Democrats in Congress actually gave them in \nthe health care law. Many of them who voted for it never read it. Nancy \nPelosi said first you have to pass it before you get to find out what \nis in it. But it did not stop the Democrats who voted for it from \nmaking those same promises--promises: If you like what you have, you \ncan keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. \nPremiums will go down. All of those promises--each one of them turned \nout to be not true.\n  A fair shot is exactly what Republicans have offered, and that is--\nand I can tell you this as a doctor--what patients want is patient-\ncentered care, not government-controlled and mandated care--a patient-\ncentered approach that would solve the biggest problems that families \nface: access to care, cost of care, quality care. That means measures \nsuch as allowing small businesses to pool together in order to buy \ninsurance more cheaply for their employees. It means letting people \nshop for health insurance that actually works for them and works for \ntheir families, not what the President says is best for them.\n  So in closing let me just say, these are just a couple of the \nsolutions Republicans have offered to give Americans the care they need \nfrom a doctor\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\nthey choose at lower costs, without the outrageous, expensive side \neffects of the President's health care law.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, after months and months of polarizing and \ndivisive debate in the Senate about the Affordable Care Act, I rise \ntoday to strongly support the nomination of Sylvia Mathews Burwell \nbecause I firmly believe she will help the Senate come together to \njointly work to improve American health care.\n  The reality is both political parties have had valid points on this \ncritical issue. My party believes passionately, as I do, that everyone \nmust be covered. Republicans feel equally passionate about having a \nreal role for the private sector to help hold down costs and promote \ninnovation. The Affordable Care Act does both. Working together, \nworking together under the leadership of a talented official like \nSylvia Mathews Burwell, we can build on that.\n  Ms. Burwell has earned much respect here in the Congress on both \nsides of the aisle. She had our distinguished colleague from Oklahoma \nTom Coburn and our friend from West Virginia Jay Rockefeller at the \nwitness table together talking about how she had worked with both of \nthem. She is a leader with a head and a heart, and she is qualified and \nexperienced for this critical job at this critical time.\n  She is a graduate of Harvard and Oxford, where she was a Rhodes \nScholar. Early in her career, she showed a commitment to service by \nbecoming part of the Clinton administration. She was the Staff Director \nof the National Economic Council beginning in 1993. Soon she \ntransitioned to be Chief of Staff to the Treasury Secretary. In 1997, \nshe became Deputy Chief of Staff to the President and moved the \nfollowing year to become the Deputy Director of OMB.\n  She has extensive experience in the nonprofit sector. She led efforts \nto address some of the most pressing global health challenges of our \ntime. In 2011 she became the head of the Walmart Foundation.\n  I noted Sylvia Mathews Burwell's support, but here are a couple \ncomments from the other side of the aisle. Senator Burr had this to say \nabout Sylvia Mathews Burwell: ``She comes with a portfolio of \nexperience that would make her a tremendous asset at addressing some of \nthe challenges that that agency specifically and uniquely has.''\n  Here is what Senator Coburn had to say: ``The fact is, when you have \nsomebody that's competent and also has strong character, you find a way \nto get past your differences to try to solve problems.''\n  So she has strong, vigorous support from both sides of the aisle.\n  Now, we all understand that the Affordable Care Act is going to be a \ncentral focus of her work every day as Secretary. Once she is \nconfirmed, I am convinced--and Senator Hatch and I have talked about \nthis again on a bipartisan basis--that we can come together to make the \nlaw work better.\n  For example, my colleague from Utah has done very good work in fixing \nthe dysfunctional reimbursement system for Medicare known as the SGR. \nWith Sylvia Mathews Burwell at the helm, we will get that done, and we \nwill improve Medicare transparency because the public and taxpayers and \nseniors should not be in the dark about critical services.\n  I know Senator Begich is going to be making some important remarks \nabout veterans, and I just appreciate my colleague giving me this quick \nminute or two because I wanted to bring a bipartisan case for Sylvia \nMathews Burwell to be confirmed. We will have the beginning of the \nprocess go forward today and more discussion about her and, I am sure, \nthe Affordable Care Act as well.\n  I strongly, strongly urge my colleagues to advance her nomination and \nto support her when we go to a final vote.\n  With that, I thank my colleague and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/04/senate-section/article/S3394-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3394-S3396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PROTECTING VETERANS\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I thank the Presiding Officer and thank \nmy friend from Oregon.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to be on the floor today to talk about \nveterans care. It is an important issue that is not only critical to my \nState but across the country. As we know, it has been in the papers, on \nthe TV, on the Internet, and everywhere else you can imagine.\n  There are few more important issues that we work on that have such a \ncritical potential for impact on so many people, when you think about \nit. These folks have sacrificed so much for us--our veterans--and now \nit is important for us to make sure they have the proper care for all \nof their service.\n  Of course, the VA system is all over the national news, as I \nmentioned. Whatever you read, everywhere you turn, there is something \nabout the system and what is going on. But I want to talk about \nAlaska's veterans programs that we are doing up there, especially \naround health care. For me, veterans are a big deal. It is a big deal \nbecause Alaska has so many.\n  Just to give you the lay of the land, we have over 77,000 veterans in \nAlaska. Almost 10 percent of the population of my State is veterans who \nhave served this country in many different aspects throughout their \ncareers and coming to Alaska to make it their home.\n  Along with the 77,000 veterans in Alaska, across the Nation the VA \nhas more than 11 million veterans registered or enrolled.\n  I have in the Chamber this picture of some rural veterans in Bethel, \nAK. I enjoyed being out there, and I have a story I will tell in a bit \nabout the impact of some of the things we are doing in rural Alaska.\n  I think of these veterans like my uncle, U.S. Army Infantryman Joe \nBegich from up in the Iron Range of Minnesota, who will be there this \nweekend on an Honor Flight from Minnesota. My family is very proud of \nhis service and the service of my late father-in-law Lou Bonito, who \nwas an Army colonel in Vietnam.\n  We need to listen to their stories--not just on Memorial Day, not \njust on the D-day anniversary, which is this Friday. We need to listen \nto our veterans every single day. They deserve to be heard, just as \nthey deserve to receive the benefits for which they fought.\n  Make no mistake about it. When I hear from veterans, the vast \nmajority love the VA health care system and what is being provided to \nthem.\n  I was in Alaska last week and met with veterans from all over the \nState. We do not have to wait for some headline or for CNN to run some \nstory about what is wrong with the VA system.\n  My staff and I know what is going on with our care. We have regular \nmeetings with the VA. As a matter of fact, when I first came to the \nSenate, some of the first issues we dealt with had to do with the VA \nand trying to make sure the Veterans Administration is dealing with \nAlaska's unique situation of how diverse it is and how far apart many \nof these services are in getting to our veterans.\n  When this issue started coming up on a national level this last week \nand over the last few weeks regarding the problems, especially in \nPhoenix--don't get me wrong. I am outraged, as is every American and \nevery Alaskan, about what was going on there and what probably is \nhappening in other VA facilities around the country as we hear about \nmore internal audits being done. But we saw this problem. I saw this \nproblem growing in Alaska. It was clear to me there was inadequate \nstaffing in Alaska, along with some other programmatic problems, and \nsystematic delivery system problems. What it meant was in Alaska, when \nI saw this problem, we had over almost 1,000 people waiting 2, 3 months \nfor just their initial appointment to get VA health care services. This \nwas unacceptable. So I convened a field hearing in Alaska to look at \nthese issues and figure out what we could do to improve the system.\n  Today, the average wait time for our VA veterans, our veterans in \nAlaska, to get their initial appointment is now down to 9 days. As a \nmatter of fact, the list, which we monitor on a regular basis from our \noffice, is down to less than two dozen. That fluctuates from\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\nday to day, but from 900-plus down to a few dozen is an incredible \nsystem change.\n  We didn't sit around and wait, as I said earlier, for some story to \nbust loose or someone to get some bumper sticker out there or make some \npolitical hits. We saw the problem and we took action. I was aggressive \nabout it. I didn't sit around and wait for the Veterans' Administration \nto come up with an answer; I participated, as did my staff, because \nthese results are real. As a matter of fact, Alaska is a model around \nthe country on how to do this, because we figured out how to partner \nwith folks around the State to make sure the highest priority--\ndelivering health care to our veterans--was done, and especially in our \nvery rural areas.\n  I know the State of the Presiding Officer is like my State: very \nrural, small population, people spread all over the place. Trying to \nget to their clinic or their hospital for VA care is not as easy. The \nPresiding Officer is more fortunate because she has road access to a \nlot of the places. In my State, 80 percent of the State cannot be \naccessed by roads, but we have veterans throughout Alaska who \ndesperately need to get care. We solved the problem. We didn't sit \naround and talk about it and do nothing. We actually talked about it \nand came up with a solution.\n  When I ran for office, we had the heroes health card, and then we \nmodified it to make sure we could access all we wanted to do. For \nexample, here is a beautiful hospital in Nome, AK. It is way up north. \nIt is a beautiful hospital. Indian Health Service, our tribes, runs an \nincredible delivery system. It is one of the best in the country when \nwe talk about health care delivery systems. Our Indian health care \nsystems in Alaska are rated in the country as one of the best. But I \nhave 800 veterans, Native and nonnative, who could not access that care \nin that building. They lived near it. They might live right here, but \nthey couldn't go there. They had to fly hundreds of miles to Anchorage \nto go to a clinic and if the service wasn't there, they would have to \nfly to Seattle. Outrageous--800 veterans.\n  So what did we do? We sat down--and I dragged General Shinseki to \nAlaska to some very rural areas to give him a little experience about \nwhat was going on. Nome, AL, is up north and Anchorage is down here, as \nwe see on this map. Seattle is not even on the map, because it is kind \nof small, anyway; it is not like Alaska in size. There are hundreds of \nmiles people have to travel. It was not right.\n  So what did we do? We partnered with our Indian health care services \ndelivered by our tribes--incredible care. Instead of just here and \nhere, it is now everywhere that they can access health care. So that \nmeans the veterans have a choice--a choice they did not have before we \nput this program into place. It is unique to Alaska, and only in Alaska \nright now. But those 800 veterans now have a choice. They can go to \nNome or they can go to Anchorage or to Fairbanks or down to Seattle if \nthey want, but they get a choice now. They don't have to fly hundreds \nof miles.\n  What does this do? It saves money for the VA system not paying for \nairfare, and guess where that money goes: health care for veterans.\n  I will give an example. The earlier photo I had up here with all of \nthose veterans in Bethel--that was a couple of years ago. I remember \ntelling them about this idea we were trying to implement. They were a \nlittle skeptical; they didn't think it would work. This weekend I am in \nBethel, AK, in the same VFW hall. This one guy pulls his hand out and \nshows me all of these scars where he had to get work done, and he says, \nI had to go to Anchorage to get this done. I thought he was going to \nget mad at me because that is where he had to go. He says now--these \nare the Bethel folks up there in the post--now he can go right down the \nstreet to get his therapy on his hand.\n  Do you know what he said to me? He said, Mark, I am able to save my \nairfare and give more care to my brothers and sisters who served with \nme in the military. Because he doesn't have to fly to Anchorage. He has \na choice. He gets to get his care right there. We went after this issue \naggressively, because we knew these veterans fought for our country and \ndeserved the best--the best--and we knew we could offer it through this \nsystem.\n  The other thing: We have been aggressive, as members of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, about bringing more resources to veterans and the VA \norganization. Just in Alaska, in 2010, we had about a $160 million \nbudget. Today, it is over $260 million in 4 years. Why? Because we are \nimplementing programs that have success, that work, that deliver care. \nIs it perfect? No. Is it better than what they had 5 years ago? \nAbsolutely. We didn't, again, sit around.\n  It is always amazing to me to go around this place. So many new ideas \npop out because they read about it in the paper. Well, do your work. I \ndid. We are getting results. Care is better today than it was 5 years \nago. That one veteran--for him, it was incredible. The Presiding \nOfficer knows what it is like when we are out traveling and meeting \nconstituents and they are going to say things and we are not sure they \nare going to be very nice and friendly. He was a little intense about \nit. But when he showed me his results, I said, I want to take a picture \nof your hand, because that hand is the result of the work we are doing, \nto take 1,000 people off the primary list of waiting, down to a couple \nof thousands. Instead of waiting 120 days, now it is 8 days. As a \nmatter of fact, when a veteran is enrolled in our delivery system in \nAnchorage through our tribal delivery system or our community clinic \nthere, a veteran could potentially get--the likelihood is same-day \nservice. They walk in, they get service, no delay, because we have a \nsystem that is maximizing our Federal resources. All of those are paid \nby Federal tax dollars. Why not use them? Use them for the betterment \nof making sure our veterans have the care they need.\n  There are a couple of other things we could do right now, and I have \nwritten to the VA about this. For example, we have Public Health \nService doctors who work in the community health service programs, but \nthey are not in the VA. They have the ability to do it under title 38, \nI think it is; they just have to make it happen. This is important \nbecause we have over 5,000 of these folks in many different professions \nserving our country. Let's put them to work even more. They are working \nhard now, but maybe we could deploy them in ways to help our VA.\n  I also support the proposal in Senator Sanders' bill to increase loan \nforgiveness for these folks who want to participate in our Public \nHealth Service. Senator Pryor introduced a bill that would increase \nsupport for psychiatric services for vets through a pilot program \noffering loan forgiveness for a gap in our service. We don't have \nenough.\n\n  One thing we also did, to speak about another program for our \nveterans in rural parts of our country--what did we do? Because \nsometimes the copay for accessing telehealth medicine is enough to tell \npeople, I don't want to do it. I had a bill on the floor, or a bill \nthat I introduced, but again General Shinseki decided to do it. So now \nthere is no copay if veterans want to access mental health through \ntelemedicine. Why? Because it has proven to be very successful. In \nremote communities such as in my State and the Presiding Officer's \nState, we want them to have access to mental health services. We have a \nlimited amount of mental health dollars. So why not create an \nopportunity to use technology and limit the cost to the VA or to \nveterans, and give them the services they need? It is critical.\n  As I said earlier, what happened in Arizona is unacceptable. If it \ncontinues, if we see other places where these lists were falsely put \ntogether, then people need to be held accountable and prosecuted. But \njust dealing with that does not solve the problem. Solving the problem \nmeans being innovative and thinking out of the box. I have to say, if \nwe can do it in Alaska, in the most remote area of this country, we can \ndo it anywhere. We have a model that is working. We have veterans who \nlike their care, they love their care, they have access they never had \nbefore. It is important that we figure out a solution.\n  I know Senator Sanders' bill is an important bill. I hope we will \nhave it on the floor and we can debate it and ultimately we will get to \na bipartisan decision. Because if the Presiding Officer will remember, \nthis bill failed before by two votes. They complained it\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\ncost too much. These are veterans who served our country, who went to \nwar for us to be in this Chamber, to be able to have free education, \npublic education, to be able to have an incredible country. People are \nfor veterans or people are against veterans. It is not a complicated \nissue. The bill that failed told me where some people were. Some were \nfor veterans and some were against veterans. We had two wars unpaid \nfor, trillions of dollars. Now it comes time to pay the bill for the \npeople who have served our country, and we debate that we can't do \nthat.\n  We are going to have a bill in short order on providing all kinds of \ntax extenders for horses in Kentucky to get special tax breaks, but we \nare not going to pay for that. We are not going to pay for that. But \nwhen it comes to veterans: Oh, we have to pay for that. Too bad. No. \nWhen that bill comes forward, it is time to see who is for veterans and \nwho is against veterans. It is not complicated. In the tax bill there \nare special deductions for horse racing. We are not going to pay for \nit. Somehow, horses are important.\n  Veterans are important. This is an issue we take care of. Complaining \nabout what it will cost--veterans have paid the ultimate price. They \nhave served our country. And the people who are not coming back have \nserved and paid the ultimate price.\n  My poor staff sometimes wonders where I am going with my \npresentation. I get pretty outraged about this, because in Alaska \nveterans are an important issue. This country is important. And for us \nto debate the few couple billion or a few hundred million that we are \ncomplaining about--some people have--we have spent $2 trillion-plus on \nwars. It is time for us to pay the debt to these veterans.\n  I know we are going to have a hearing this week in the committee. We \nwill be working on the bill that Senator Sanders has put together and I \nhave participated in, as has every other member of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee. It is time to do the right thing for our veterans.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to be on the floor. As an Alaskan I \nrecognize the importance of our veterans. I believe everyone in this \nChamber recognizes the importance of our veterans. But they will have a \nchance. They will have an opportunity to decide if they are for \nveterans or if they are against veterans. If they come down with \nconvoluted Washington, DC, doublespeak about how they can't do the bill \nbecause of this or that--people are fed up in this country. I know when \nI go back home, they just ask me a very simple question: Can we get \nbetter health care for our veterans? Can we access the GI bill to make \nsure veterans get an opportunity to get a better education? Is there an \nopportunity for them to take the skill they learned in the military and \nput it to work to get a job? These are the things we should be fighting \nfor.\n  I have a feeling we will be down here with some Members quibbling \nover some small detail because they really don't want to pass the bill. \nAgain, they are for veterans or they are against veterans. It is not \ncomplicated.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today, the Senate will vote on the \nconfirmation of three nominees to serve on the U.S. district courts in \nMassachusetts, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee reported two of these nominees unanimously to the \nfull Senate, and the third nominee with strong bipartisan support.\n  These nominees are not controversial and in past years would have \nbeen confirmed weeks, or even months, ago. Instead, Republicans \ncontinue to refuse to give consent for votes on any judicial nominee, \nirrespective of their qualifications or the support of home State \nSenators. As a result, yesterday the Senate was forced again to waste \nvaluable time voting to end the unnecessary filibusters of three highly \nqualified nominees. The Senate has now voted to end the filibusters of \n44 judicial nominees so far during 2014. It is every Senator's right to \ndemand continued debate on any measure or nomination before this \nchamber. But I would say to any Senator who requires a cloture vote on \na qualified, consensus nominee to at least speak about the nominee and \nnot to obstruct for obstruction's sake.\n  I hope that this partisan fever will break in the near future, and \nthat Republicans will stop reducing the Senate's constitutional role of \nadvice and consent into a tool of obstruction. These delays should \nstop.\n  Mark Mastroianni has been nominated to fill a judicial vacancy on the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. He has served \nsince 2011 as district attorney in the Hampden district attorney's \noffice and previously worked in private practice. Following law school, \nhe served as an assistant district attorney in the Hampden District \nAttorney's Office from 1990 to 1995. Mr. Mastroianni has the support of \nhis home State senators, Senator Warren and Senator Markey. The \nJudiciary Committee reported him favorably to the full Senate by voice \nvote on March 6, 2014.\n  Judge Bruce Hendricks has been nominated to fill a judicial vacancy \non the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. She has \nserved since 2002 as a U.S. magistrate judge for the\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\nDistrict of South Carolina. During her judicial service, she presided \nover thousands of criminal and civil cases. She served as an adjunct \nprofessor at the College of Charleston from 2000 to 2001, teaching \nclasses on the structure of the Federal and State court system and \ncivil processes and procedures. She previously served as an assistant \nU.S. attorney in the District of South Carolina from 1991 to 2002. \nJudge Hendricks' nomination received the American Bar Association's \nhighest rating of ``unanimously well qualified.'' She has the support \nof her home State Republican senators, Senator Graham and Senator \nScott. The Judiciary Committee reported her favorably with bipartisan \nsupport to the full Senate by roll call vote of 16-2 on March 6, 2014.\n  Tanya Chutkan has been nominated to fill a judicial vacancy on the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Tanya Chutkan has \nworked in private practice as a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner \nLLP, where she has served as a partner since 2007 and as a counsel from \n2002 to 2006.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n          Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar No. 8\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 2 weeks ago I came to the Senate floor \nto ask unanimous consent to ratify the protocol amending our tax treaty \nwith Switzerland. I argued that the new protocol would no longer permit \nSwiss banks to withhold information on U.S. individuals who have hidden \nbehind Swiss bank secrecy laws to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  Today I come to the Senate floor to ask unanimous consent to ratify \nthe bilateral income tax treaty with Chile.\n  If the protocol with Switzerland is the perfect example of how tax \ntreaties enhance our efforts to prevent tax evasion, the treaty with \nChile--the first between our two countries--is the perfect example of \nwhy the United States pursues tax treaties. We pursue them to promote \ngreater trading investment.\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\nWe pursue them to protect American companies from double taxation. We \npursue them to expand new markets and develop new business \nopportunities for companies and investors.\n  On April 1 the Foreign Relations Committee, with strong bipartisan \nsupport, reported favorably on a proposed new income tax treaty with \nChile. If ratified, the treaty would be only the third U.S. tax treaty \nin all of Latin America, but it would be a significant step forward in \na region critical to U.S. international economic interests and would be \nwith one of our strongest allies in the hemisphere.\n  What does this treaty do? Simply put, it promotes trade and \ninvestment between the United States and Chile. It provides for reduced \nwithholding rates on cross-border payments of dividends, interest, and \nroyalties. It would prevent avoidance or evasion of the taxes, includes \nrigorous protections against treaty shopping, and ensures exchange of \ninformation between our nations' tax authorities.\n  Let me also add, the American private sector's support for this \ntreaty is unequivocal. To quote from a 2013 letter to Senate leaders \nfrom the National Foreign Trade Council, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and other major U.S. \nbusiness associations, `` . . . ratification would represent an \nimportant milestone in lowering tax barriers to U.S. companies \noperating in Latin America . . . and would protect the interests of \nU.S. taxpayers'' in Chile.\n  This protects and grows U.S. investment in Chile. It expands U.S. \neconomic engagement in the region, and that is a win-win-win.\n  I know there are those in the Chamber who do not see it that way, but \nthese are the facts of economic engagement and economic statecraft in \nthe hemisphere.\n  In the last decade, Chile has taken a regional leadership role on \ntrade issues. It is one of our most important bilateral economic \npartners in the region. Total bilateral trade has nearly tripled since \n2003, and U.S. investment in Chile has more than tripled from $10 \nbillion in 2004 to roughly $35 billion today. Ratifying this treaty \nwill take the bilateral commercial relationship to the next level.\n  I understand newly inaugurated Chilean President Michelle Bachelet \nplans to travel to Washington later this month to continue the close \npartnership between our two countries. Ratifying this treaty would send \nPresident Bachelet a strong message that we value our partnership with \nChile and we are serious about further expanding economic opportunities \nbetween our two countries.\n  Madam President, 1,421 days have passed since the last time this \nSenate ratified an income tax treaty. We can end that ignoble streak \nright now.\n  So I ask unanimous consent, at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader, in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 8, treaty \ndocument No. 112-8; that the treaty be considered as having advanced \nthrough the various parliamentary stages up to and including the \npresentation of the resolutions of ratification; that any committee \ndeclarations be agreed to as applicable; that any statements be printed \nin the Record as if read; that if the resolution of ratification is \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I think it \nis important to remember that the vast majority of Americans are law-\nabiding Americans who reside either here or overseas and that they do \nhave an expectation of privacy and they do have a right to privacy. \nThose who break the law should be punished, but we can't forget about \nthe innocent Americans who are not breaking the law who do have a right \nto privacy.\n  We have had treaties such as this for decades, and I am not opposed \nto the treaties. There are beneficial aspects to the treaties. Past \ntreaties have had a standard which said that one had to be committing \ntax fraud or that one had to be engaged in fraudulent activity, the \nsame way every American here expects that the government is not going \nto look at a person's bank account unless they have gone to a judge \nwith evidence that a person is cheating on their taxes. The government \ncan't just look at everybody's information in the bank without probable \ncause. The previous standard was that there had to be some evidence \npresented that a person was cheating on their taxes. I think there \nshould be some evidence presented.\n  The new standard is they can look at any of a person's records that \nmay be relevant. This is a much lower standard, and I think it will be \ninjurious to the vast majority, if not the overwhelming majority, of \nAmericans who are actually innocent but just happen to be living \nabroad.\n  I would be willing to work with whoever is willing to work with me on \nthis to get the treaties passed if we can keep the same standard we \nhave had previously, which is a standard of fraud, not a standard that \nthese may be relevant.\n  So for this reason, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I would have more extensive remarks, \nbut I know my colleague from Maryland has a different unanimous consent \nrequest. Let me make just three quick points.\n  Chile's and other tax treaties the Foreign Relations Committee has \nreported favorably do not represent the first time the Senate has \nconsidered treaties providing for information exchange based on a \n``foreseeably relevant'' or ``may be relevant'' standard.\n  In fact, since 1999--so that is about 15 years now--the Senate has \nadopted resolutions of advice and consent for at least eight other tax \ntreaties using the relevant standard. This standard has been part of \nthe model of U.S. tax treaties since 2006. So it is not correct that \nthe ``may be relevant'' or ``foreseeably relevant'' standard is vague \nor ambiguous. In fact, it has been extensively defined in agreed \nguidance to which no country has expressed a dissenting opinion to \ndate.\n  I must say that not only are these objections ultimately not \nproviding all the benefits that all of the private-sector interests \nhave expressed--as I referred to before, the entire business \ncommunity--but by the same token, I simply have a tough time accepting \nthat those who cheat get away with cheating and that somehow we are \ngoing to make it easier for them to cheat when the average American \ndoes not have the opportunity nor the desire nor do they cheat in terms \nof their payment of whatever are the taxes they owe to the Federal \nGovernment in a way that helps sustain all of the things we seek as \nAmericans: the best armed forces in the world, security here at home, \neducational opportunity for our kids.\n  So there is a fundamental difference here. I will push these tax \ntreaties, and I will urge the majority leader to give us votes then in \na process because it has overwhelming support and we cannot have one \nMember of the Senate object to a process that can provide such benefits \nand such equity across the board.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n          Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar No. 9\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me underscore the point Senator \nMenendez, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has made in \nregard to these tax treaties.\n  I want to make two principal points, and then a few other comments, \nand then I am going to propound a unanimous consent request in regard \nto the Swiss protocols.\n  The two points I want to raise--first on the standard of fraud, the \nrelevancy standard that has been included in tax treaties ratified by \nthe Senate since the 1990s. There are at least eight treaties that have \nused this standard. This is the international standard on fraud. It is \nnot the U.S. Standard. It is not the Swiss standard. It is not the \nChilean standard. It is the international standard.\n  There may have been one time when the United States could dictate \nwhat tax treaties would include. But we are part of an international \ncommunity. It is part of international negotiations.\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\nThis is the international standard for cooperation among taxing \nauthorities in order to establish a level playing field.\n  Secondly, our Constitution provides for the ratification of treaties \nby the Senate and provides for a two-thirds vote. It is an \nextraordinary vote. It is a heavy vote. It is a heavy burden for \nratification of the treaties. It is not 100 percent; it does not \nrequire every Senator to agree to it, but it takes two-thirds of the \nSenators.\n  I would urge my colleagues that we need to return to regular order. \nEveryone talks about returning to regular order in the Senate. Well, if \nwe need to go through lengthy debates and votes on a treaty that is \ntotally noncontroversial, I am not sure we are serving the best \ninterests in the Senate. Let's have an open debate, but let's vote. If \nsome Senators disagree, well, at least allow the vote to go forward so \nwe can get the two-thirds of the Senate to agree.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the committee. He gave me the \nopportunity to chair the hearings. So I was at the hearings during \nconsideration of these treaties. We had a full panel of witnesses. Not \none testified in opposition and not one was concerned about the issue \nthat my colleague from Kentucky has raised on the fraud standard. In \nfact, they all said this is the level playing field. This will allow \nour country to support our companies and provide a level playing field \nfor international investment in the United States.\n  The absence of this treaty affects America's ability to attract \ninvestment. Make no mistake about it. It hurts our companies. It hurts \nAmerican companies that want to do business in other countries. They \nneed a level playing field, to be protected against multiple layers of \ntaxation and compliance issues. So this allows for that level playing \nfield, so we can have fair agreements.\n\n  Let me mention one company that has come to us and said this is very \nimportant: McCormick. McCormick is a company that has been \nheadquartered in Maryland for 125 years. They have 2,000 employees in \nmy State of Maryland and 10,000 employees globally. They are hurt by \nthe failure to have these treaties ratified.\n  It presents a level playing field. It allows for investment. It \nprotects the privacy. Our laws protect privacy. Swiss laws protect \nprivacy. What this does is establish a level playing field so all are \nprotected.\n  I appreciate the fact that we may want to negotiate this in a \ndifferent way. Well, let's work with our negotiators and work with the \ninternational community. It is not going to be the United States \ndictating what that standard should be. Quite frankly, the relevancy \nstandard has worked well. There have been no complaints whatsoever on \nprivacy issues on the eight treaties we have ratified. To the contrary, \nwhat it does is it removes the veil from those who are tax cheats, to \nallow us to get that information. It provides for the transparency \nnecessary between taxing jurisdictions so you cannot hide and commit \nfraud against one country where you have the treaty.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to allow us to proceed on these \ntreaties. It is very important to economic growth in our own State.\n  With that, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to \nbe determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider \nCalendar No. 9, treaty document 112-1; that the treaty be considered as \nhaving advanced through the various parliamentary stages up to and \nincluding the presentation of the resolutions of ratification; that any \ncommittee declarations be agreed to as applicable; that any statements \nbe printed in the Record; that if the resolution of ratification is \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, let me make \none point very clear. One Senator cannot prevent a vote in this body. \nThe vote can occur at any point in time. One Senator can prevent sort \nof expedited passage without extensive debate.\n  One of the things our Founding Fathers did with this body, by \nallowing filibuster and by allowing procedural ways to slow things \ndown, was to allow Senators who are in the minority to try to influence \nlegislation.\n  I am open to a discussion on the language of this treaty, and I am \nopen to a discussion on how we would have the standard promulgated. But \nI am very aware that when people talk about the criminal aspect of \npeople they want to punish--I am in favor of that as well--you have to \nbe aware that the vast majority of Americans who reside overseas are \nnot criminals, are not tax cheats, and are law-abiding citizens.\n  So I do not think we should agree to a standard that is less than our \nnormal standard here in the country. I also do not think we should \nagree to a standard that might allow bulk collection of data on \neveryone who lives overseas. Realize that this can be putting us \nbeholden to other countries as well, accessing records of their \ncitizens who are here as well.\n  So I think we have to be very careful about lessening the standard, \nand it is very much worth a debate. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me point out that it has now been 4 \nyears since we have ratified treaties--4 years--because of time \nrestraints of doing business in the Senate. It is one Senator holding \nup an expedited way under the Senate rules so we could get a vote. He \ncan cast his vote any way he wishes on this issue.\n  I will just say, we have so many of these tax treaties that are \nbacked up now, not just the two we have spoken about today. There are \nother tax protocols and treaties that are waiting for Senate \nratification. I would hope we could find a way that would satisfy \ncolleagues to allow an up-or-down vote on these treaties. They are \nnoncontroversial, but they are extremely important to the businesses of \nour country and moving our economy along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With regard to the Selig nomination, under the \nprevious order, the motion to reconsider is considered made and laid \nupon the table, and the President will be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmajority control the time from 2 p.m. until 3 p.m. today and the \nRepublicans control the time from 3 p.m. until 4 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I come today and I am honored to \nsupport my friend Sylvia Mathews Burwell. Sylvia is a native of West \nVirginia, and I have always said that we are all a part of our \nenvironment. If you know where Sylvia came from, the type of area where \nshe was raised and the neighborhood, it will tell you everything about \nwho she is today and why she has been so successful and why public \nservice runs through her veins, truly giving something back.\n  The little town of Hinton, WV, is where Sylvia is from. It is in \nbeautiful Summers County in the southern part of the State. It is right \non the New River. It is a train town. Trains will come there and \ndispatch, and they will get them turned around to go in the right \ndirection.\n  I will never forget when they introduced Sylvia. I think it was \nSenator Alexander who was speaking. He was talking about his father, \nwho worked in the rail yard and was always responsible for turning the \ntrains and getting them moving. I said: Well, one thing about that, \nSylvia comes from a train town. She knows how to get the train on the \ntrack and how to get it moving in the right direction, and she has \nproven that.\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\n  She is an unbelievable, blessed person. She is gifted, as smart as \nthey come--a Rhodes scholar. In West Virginia we are so proud to have a \nperson with those types of skills and the ambition to serve.\n  Now we will get into a little bit about her mom and dad because it is \nreally who she is. Her father is an eye doctor there and is well \nrespected in the town, and he is an immigrant who came from Britain. \nHer mother Cleo Mathews was the mayor. When I was Governor of West \nVirginia and I would come to town, Cleo would always call and tell me \neverything I did wrong. She was usually right, and we would get things \nworked out. We always had a great relationship. But she had skills and \nshe had to give something back. You had to be involved. You just \ncouldn't sit around. You couldn't be satisfied with your life just \nthinking, well, I work and I have a paycheck. There was always \nsomething.\n  I think that comes from--I am second generation also--coming to this \ncountry and hearing your grandparents talk about all the wonderful \nopportunities they have been provided and how privileged they believe \nthey are and how honored and why we always have to give something back. \nYou had to volunteer, be involved. You had to go out and contribute. \nYou had to do something. That is the type of background Sylvia comes \nfrom.\n  When you look at every job she was asked to do, she was in the \nClinton administration. If fame and fortune were her desire, she could \nhave gotten it a long time ago. She did public service, and she did it \nin an exemplary fashion. Then after the Clinton administration she went \nto the Gates Foundation. She went to the Walmart Foundation. She is \nalways with a foundation. She is somebody who is willing to help others \nand give back, trying to invest in the best of America. Then she came \nback and she became our Director of OMB. She got totally unanimous \nsupport.\n  Now the President has tasked her to come and take the reins of the \nDHHS. I say to my friends, whether or not you support the Affordable \nCare Act, Sylvia is not coming here to change your minds. She is not \ngoing to tell you: I am going to tell you why you should be for it, and \nyou are wrong if you are not for it. She is not going to do that. She \nis going to make the system work. She is going to be following the law \nand listening to everybody--those who support it and those who do not \nsupport it--and making adjustments and recommendations. I trust that \nshe will take good, solid recommendations to the President: If change \nis needed, this is where we need it. If this is not working, this is \nwhy it is not working. If the numbers don't add up and we cannot afford \nit, we will make adjustments to make sure it does work so all Americans \ncan benefit.\n  I come to the floor because I know Sylvia Mathews Burwell. I know \nwhere she comes from. I know her family. I know her friends. I know her \ntown. That speaks volumes. As I said in the opening, we are all \nproducts of our environment. Sylvia Mathews Burwell is a product of her \nenvironment, which is as nurturing and loving and caring as any one of \nus could ever hope for. To have that quality of a person who is going \nto be serving at the highest level is something I am very proud of--not \njust because she is a West Virginian but because she is such an \naccomplished person and she wants to give something back. She has lived \nthe American dream. Her parents made that come true for her, and that \nis who she is.\n  I would ask all of my colleagues, when they are voting, who do you \nthink would have better values, who would have the ability, and who has \nthe knowledge and the experience to make sure there is fairness and \nbipartisanship? Every person is going to be listened to, and she will \ngive a direct answer as to exactly how she has come to a decision. That \nis all you can ask for. When you have an opportunity to get somebody at \nthat level in the private sector, you would jump all over it. You would \ndo whatever it would take to get somebody with her qualities.\n  In public service, we have such a hard time today recruiting the \nyoung, recruiting this new crop of leaders. Some of them will be \nSenators, some of them will be Congresspeople. They are going to be \nleaders in their communities. They care at a young age. We have a hard \ntime recruiting this younger crop of people, and when we have it, we \nbetter hold on to it.\n  We have a chance to hold on to Sylvia, to take us to a new level \nwhere health care could be affordable for the masses. We could have a \nhealthier population. We don't have to rank 43rd in the world as far as \nwellness and longevity. It shouldn't be that we are spending more money \nthan anybody else and not getting results. We need somebody like Sylvia \nMathews Burwell, who could put all of this together and make sense out \nof it because she comes from a family and a community that is all-West \nVirginian and all-American.\n  I say to my colleagues, I hope you will vote in favor of Sylvia \nMathews Burwell and show that we can come together, we can work in a \nbipartisan fashion and pick the best person for the job--not because \nthey are Democratic or Republican or Independent or have any political \naffiliation but because they are the best qualified person for the job.\n  I would say thank you to all of my colleagues for allowing me to give \na little bit of insight into a most amazing young lady, a mother, a \ndaughter, and a loving friend to all who really gives all she can.\n  Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak in support \nof Sylvia Burwell's nomination to lead our efforts at HHS and to follow \nup on the comments of her great friend Senator Manchin.\n  I would like to add two points to what I think was a great \npresentation by the Senator from West Virginia. We rarely get someone \nwho has this kind of background in both the public and private sector \nand of course who is perfectly suited for a tour of duty at the helm of \nthe Nation's largest public-private partnership.\n  HHS is obviously the payer for our Medicare Program and for much of \nour Medicaid Program, but they are doing business with literally \nhundreds of thousands of private entities and private companies all \nthroughout the country--primarily health care practitioners from the \neast coast to the west coast--and the Affordable Care Act is an \nenormous private-public partnership. We expanded coverage through both \nthe traditional Medicaid Program and also through millions of people--8 \nmillion and counting--who have signed up for private insurance with a \nlittle bit of help from their government through tax credits. It is \nthis background that she has on both sides of the public-private divide \nthat I think will put her in a perfect position to lead this agency.\n  When she came before the HELP Committee, I was particularly pleased \nthat she was very willing to be flexible and aggressive in her work \nwith Governors throughout the country who have not yet expanded \nMedicaid. I think there is growing willingness on behalf of many \nRepublican Governors to look at some innovative ways to expand \nMedicaid, and Sylvia Burwell is the perfect Secretary to work with \nGovernors to find a way--perhaps with subsidies--that will help people \nin the lower income brackets afford private insurance that could \ncapture those 5 million individuals across the country who do not have \naccess to Medicaid because their States have not expanded it.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes in the context of this debate answering \nwhat I imagine will be a growing chorus of concerns and criticism from \nour Republican friends regarding some of the new rate announcements \nfrom exchanges all across the country. It has been hard to follow a lot \nof the criticism of the Affordable Care Act because it seems as though \nit mutates on a pretty regular basis. It started out with claims that \nthe Web site could never work given its initial rollout problems. Of \ncourse it is working very well today.\n  Another criticism was that nobody would sign up for this new benefit \nbecause it was not affordable. We hit 8 million in terms of those who \nsigned up for private insurance.\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\n  They said young people would not sign up. Private insurers are \ntelling us their mixes of enrollees are exactly as they hoped, \nespecially with respect to the young people signing up.\n  Then they said people would not pay their premiums. In a House \nhearing about 1 month ago, the private insurers said that in fact 80 to \n90 percent of people were paying their premiums, which is comparable \nwith the non-ACA plans.\n  Of course, there was the general claim that it will bankrupt the \nTreasury, even though it is saving us trillions in terms of deficit \nsavings as well as savings to the overall health care spending line \nitems of the Federal Government.\n  Now the critique is that these rate increases are unjustifiable as \ninsurers are getting ready to offer rates on the new exchanges coming \nout for open enrollment at the end of this year.\n  First of all, it is important to note that there are a lot more \ninsurance companies offering health care on these new exchanges. \nConnecticut will get at least one new entrant. New Hampshire, for \ninstance, went from one insurer to five insurers. There is very good \nnews coming with the new exchanges. There will be a lot more options \nbecause the insurers have figured out it is a pretty good deal for them \nas well as their consumers.\n  It is important to have a little bit of context. I have a couple of \nexamples of the kind of premium increases that have been asked for by \nprivate insurers all across the country in the last several years. In \n2010, Anthem in California proposed a 25- to 39-percent increase in \npremiums. Again in 2010, Anthem asked for a 23-percent increase in \nMaine. The year before in Michigan, Blue Cross Blue Shield asked for \nincreases up to 56 percent for some populations.\n  The reality is that on average we have seen a premium increase for \nthe individual market of 15 percent or above over the last 10 years. \nThat is not good news, but it does provide some context for the \nrequests for premium increases we are going to see in the exchanges \nthis year. Actually, the reality is that since the law passed, there \nhas been a fairly precipitous decline in the number of premium \nincreases above 10 percent that have been requested by private \ninsurers. There are less requests for premium increases above 10 \npercent today than there were in the corresponding period before the \nAffordable Care Act was passed.\n  Just because the rate increases that are being requested--or may be \nrequested--as we roll out the next year of open enrollment for the \nState-based exchanges may be below the historical averages of the last \nfew years, that certainly is not any reason for people to jump for joy. \nFifteen percent is unaffordable, fifty-six percent is unaffordable, and \n10 percent is still unaffordable.\n  It is also important to note some of the protections that are in the \nbill. For instance, one of the most important provisions of the \nAffordable Care Act that very few people have noticed is the provision \nthat says that an insurer has to spend 80 percent of all the money it \ntakes in on care. If at the end of the year they have not spent 80 \npercent of the money they have taken in from ratepayers and premium \npayers on direct care, then they have to rebate money to consumers.\n  Thus, if these premium increases are above what is justified based on \nthe actual experience, there is going to be a rebate paid to \nratepayers. Those rebates thus far have saved patients and consumers \nall across the country $5 billion, and it is a significant, historic \nprotection against unjustifiable premium increases that are not \nbacked by actual experience in terms of claims paid.\n\n  The protections are even broader. While rate increases are not new, \nwhat is new is that consumers are back in charge of their health care \nagain. Ten years ago insurers were charging 15 percent, 20 percent \nincreases and they were also denying health care to millions of \nAmericans who were sick. In some parts of the country they were \ncharging women 50 percent more than what they were charging men. They \nwere putting annual limits on health care coverage that ended medical \ninsurance for many of the sickest individuals and families all across \nthe country. All of those abuses, under the Affordable Care Act, are \nhistory.\n  While I will admit we still have work to do to bring down the cost of \nhealth insurance in this country, at the very least today consumers are \nback in charge of their health care, the worst excesses and abuses of \nthe insurance industry are no longer permitted.\n  While I want to see a day when health insurance premium increases are \n2, 3, and 4 percent, what we are seeing thus far in the wake of the \npassage of the Affordable Care Act is premium increases that are less \nthan the historical average before the law was passed.\n  Those are the facts. I know that is not solace for individuals who \nare receiving these premium increases, but what we have seen are \npremium increases coming down and not going up since the Affordable \nCare Act was passed.\n  There is still an enormous amount of work to do. The news is \ngenerally very good. More people are being enrolled in the Affordable \nCare Act than what was expected. Over the last 6 months alone, the rate \nof uninsured individuals in this country has come down by 20 percent. \nMedical inflation is at a near-term historic low. Whether it be \ninfection or readmission rates, outcomes are getting better.\n  Our next Secretary of Health and Human Services will have a lot of \nwork to do to continue to perfect this law, but she is going to have a \nlot of good work and a lot of good outcomes upon which to build, based \non her experience in both managing private sector entities and large \npublic sector entities. Even with these challenges, Sylvia Burwell is \nthe right choice for HHS, and I hope we will confirm her in a big vote \ntomorrow.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor to discuss the \nnominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services because as a \nphysician I am very concerned and want to make sure Americans can get \nhealth care. I think getting care is actually much more important than \ngetting the insurance component of that, but that is nothing new, and I \nsaid that to the President. In so many ways, the President has actually \noffered empty coverage but is not actually providing an opportunity for \ncare for people. We have seen situations where people are paying higher \npremiums, higher copays, and higher deductibles, all of which are the \nmany side effects of the President's health care law.\n  When I hear my colleague from Connecticut make reference to rates \ngoing up, let's face it. What the President of the United States said \nis that premiums would drop $2,500 per family by the end of his first \nterm. The President didn't say, well, it will not go up as fast or that \nit will go up some, but don't worry about it. The facts are that people \nare continuing to be hurt by the health care law, and much of it is as \na result of the expense of the law.\n  Last week USA Today had a report that said: ``Many employees hit with \nhigher health care premiums.'' They go on to say:\n\n       More than half of companies increased employees' share of \n     health care premiums or co-payments for doctors' visits in \n     2013. . . .\n\n  Why? Because of the health care law. What other things have \nbusinesses that are trying to provide health insurance for their \nemployees had to do? Thirty-two percent of the time the businesses \ndelayed raises for the individuals because the cost of insurance under \nthe President's health care law has gone up so much. People who are \nconcerned about take-home pay are getting hurt by the health care law.\n  According to this USA Today report, 22 percent eliminated or cut back \non benefits, and 21 percent of these folks were cut back from full-time \nwork to part-time work. That is obviously a hit to somebody's take-home \npay.\n  The report says health care premiums have increased 80 percent since \n2003, nearly three times faster than wages and nearly three times \nfaster than inflation. The health care law has actually failed to do \nwhat the President promised when it comes to actually providing care \nand affordable care.\n  As I look around the country, it is interesting to see what is \nhappening. There was a report out very recently about hundreds of \nthousands of Iowans who don't have coverage. The report goes on to talk \nabout a woman who said she drove a half hour from\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\nMitchellville recently to seek care for flu-like symptoms at a free \nclinic in Des Moines. She is an assistant manager of a convenience \nstore. She has been offered insurance by her employer but would have to \npay $111 every 2 weeks for her part of the premium, and she said: ``I \ncan't afford that. . . . There's no way on Earth.''\n  Our colleague from Connecticut said it is working. It is not working, \nand it is because of the mandates of the law, such as the mandate that \npeople have to get insurance that the government says they need as \nopposed to what may be good for them or their family.\n  The woman, Reinna, said she heard most Americans are required to have \nhealth insurance this year or pay a penalty. Democrats who voted for \nthis said if someone doesn't buy the insurance, they have to pay a \npenalty. She heard that and learned it was equal to 1 percent of her \nincome.\n  According to this article from the Des Moines Register where they had \ntheir primary elections yesterday, in Iowa, the Des Moines Register: \nThe lady laughed ruefully at the prospect. ``I don't care. They can \nfight me for it.''\n  So this is a woman in Iowa, knows about the penalty, knows about the \nmandates, and she would say to my colleague from Connecticut who was \njust on the floor that it is not working for her.\n  She bristled at the new requirement to obtain insurance. She said, if \nwe could afford it, do you think we would be standing out here? Of \ncourse, where she was standing was in a line for a free clinic, nodding \nat a half dozen others in line on the sidewalk waiting for the free \nclinic to hold one of its twice-a-week sessions.\n  I come to the floor today, as I have repeatedly, to talk about the \nissues of the health care law as a doctor trying to make sure patients \nget the care they need from a doctor they choose at lower costs, and \nseeing that the President's health care law has failed miserably \nbecause so many people have been hurt by this health care law. They \nhave had their insurance canceled, even though the President said, Oh, \nno, it won't happen. He said, If you like what you have, you can keep \nit. National folks who assessed this called that the lie of the year.\n  We also see that many people cannot keep their doctors, and they are \nfinding out that their copays are higher, their premiums are higher.\n  It is interesting, because it is affecting people in so many \ndifferent ways. Minnesota is another State where there has been a lot \nof debate and discussion about the health care law. The headline in the \nMankato Times: ``Minnesota Schools to lose more than $200 Million \nbecause of ObamaCare.'' My colleague from Connecticut just said it is \nworking. Well, if it is working, why are the Minnesota schools losing \n$200 million because of the health care law? The article says: State \nRepresentative Paul Torkelson said the wasteful spending on ObamaCare \nthat has left many taxpayers outraged will soon be making a significant \nimpact on Minnesota's schools--a significant impact on Minnesota \nschools. According to documents released by Minnesota's management and \nbudget office, over the next 3 years, the total unfunded costs \nassociated with Affordable Care Act compliance will cost school \ndistricts statewide at least $207 million.\n  It is troubling news for our schools, the State representative said. \nThis is $200 million that school districts won't be able to use to hire \nmore teachers or improve their educational programs. This is an \nunneeded expense that does absolutely nothing for our students.\n  The senator concludes by saying: It is pretty sad when schools are \nforced to prioritize ObamaCare compliance over the education of our \nchildren.\n  So I come to the floor when I hear my colleague from Connecticut \nsaying it is working to say it is not working all across the country. \nIt is not working in so many ways that the President said it is. The \nPresident said Democrats should forcefully defend and be proud of the \nhealth care law. I don't know how a Senator can stand up who voted for \nthis and be proud of what we are seeing happening to school districts \nall across the State of Minnesota.\n  The President continues to tout some number of people who signed up \nacross the country, and I always ask, How many of them actually have \ninsurance?\n  In Oregon, a story just out in the last week or two, in The \nOregonian: Thousands have not paid premiums for Cover Oregonian health \npolicies, placing coverage at risk. So in spite of what my colleague \nfrom Connecticut may have said, this article says a large number of \npeople who have signed up for private health insurers through the Cover \nOregon health insurance exchange have not paid their first month's \npremiums, meaning they are at risk of going without coverage through \nNovember.\n  More than 81,000 people went through Cover Oregon--either through \npaper or electronic applications--to select a private plan. We know \nabout the failures of that exchange. We know that the FBI, I believe, \nis investigating it. Of those, 5,000 have already canceled policies or \nbeen terminated for lack of payment. Thousands more have not yet paid \ntheir first month's premiums, meaning they have not completed their \nenrollment, according to the carriers.\n  The President talks about the numbers of enrollees. I don't know how \nmany people actually paid to continue--to consistently say they have \ninsurance, and consistent insurance, all the way through. Insurers say \nanywhere between 66 to 80 percent of consumers have paid, meaning \nanywhere from 20 to 34 percent have not. So it is hard for me to say \nthat things are working.\n  It is interesting. Unions, which have supported the law, have come \nout with concerns. UNITE HERE, a union in Las Vegas, representing many \nof the casino workers, 2,000 housekeepers, waiters, others at 9 of 10 \ndowntown Las Vegas casinos, are concerned about the cost. One of the \nunion leaders has said, when we first supported the calls for health \ncare reform, we thought it was going to bring costs down.\n  That did not happen, and that is why I am here on the floor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Certainly. Absolutely. Yes, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator. I couldn't help but hear outside \nthe Chamber the Senator from Wyoming talking about Oregon. So I just \nwanted to ask, in Oregon, 400,000-plus people have signed up for health \ncare through the Affordable Care Act. Some of those may have had \ninsurance before. We are not sure if it is 25,000, maybe it is 50,000; \nthere are conflicting numbers on that. But is it a good thing or a bad \nthing that 350,000 or more individuals have gained access to health \ncare through this plan?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I would say that many people in Oregon have been helped \nand many have been hurt. That is the problem with this health care law. \nThere are people who have been helped, absolutely. I just believe that \nthe costly side effects, the harmful side effects, the dangerous side \neffects of this health care law have actually hurt people. So for \npeople who may have been helped, there are as many, if not more, who \nhave been hurt through higher premiums, higher copays, loss of their \ndoctor, can't go to their hospital--all of those things--plus, at the \nexpense of significant amounts of taxpayer money wasted. I think we are \nseeing that situation in Oregon right now with potential lawsuits being \nfiled, FBI investigating, whether there was oversight, and hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, as reported in today's Wall Street Journal, of \nwasted taxpayer dollars. Oregon, I believe Massachusetts as well; \nMaryland, Minnesota, States that I have been talking about here.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Could the Senator explain how it is for those 350,000 or \nmore--maybe 400,000--who have newly gained access to health care, how \nthey have been hurt by gaining access to health care?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I am referring to people who have been hurt by the \nhealth care law all across the country. I worry about the more than 5 \nmillion people who have lost their coverage as a result of the health \ncare law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The time of the Senator from \nWyoming has expired.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you. I am merely trying to respond to my \ncolleague.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank very much the Senator for responding to my \nquestions.\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Debt\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am very proud to begin a \nconversation on the floor with a number of my colleagues about one of \nthe most urgent and pressing challenges that face us as a body here in \nWashington, making laws, but even more preeminently to families and \nstudents around the country who literally, right now, are sitting at \ntheir kitchen tables, in their living rooms, in family gatherings, \ntrying to find a path forward in financing their education, their \nchildren's education, their grandchildren's education.\n  We must do better as a nation. We have to do better in giving a fair \nshot to them--to the innovators and entrepreneurs and investors of the \nfuture--the people who will power our economy with ideas and energy as \na result of college education, which is part of the American dream--\npart of giving everybody in America a fair shot at that dream.\n  I have been doing a lot of listening over these past weeks, over \nthese past 3\\1/2\\ years, and over three decades in public service. I \nthink listening is one of the most important things we do as public \nofficials. There is an old saying that God gave us two ears and one \nmouth so that maybe we do a little more listening than talking. When I \ntalk to students--and I have been doing a lot of that at commencement \naddresses and classrooms and roundtables around the State of \nConnecticut--I tell them I want to listen. What I have been hearing at \nAnsonia High School and Windham High School and The Stanwich School--\nhigh schools around the State of Connecticut--is they are seeing dreams \ncrushed by the cost of college education. The pages who are here today, \nour children, when we go home at night can tell us about how \ndevastating these costs are, how their hopes and aspirations for the \nfuture are constrained and sometimes crippled financially by the cost \nof college education. We must bring it down. The costs of tuition and \nexpenses must be reduced.\n  At the same time, we need to find better financing options for our \nstudents. That is the reason we are reintroducing today the Bank on \nStudents Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, with some minor changes, \nbecause we have listened to people who have told us improvements that \ncould be made in that measure. But, most importantly, we have listened \nto students, both the high school students and college students, who \nare telling us about dreams deferred and dreams devastated by the costs \nof college education. So we must make sure that the $1.2 trillion that \noverhangs them and our economy is addressed.\n  This measure would help the students of today and tomorrow. It would \nhelp the students of today because it offers promise for the future, \nand the students who already have debt would be able to reduce that \ndebt. Those students who are paying 7 or 8 or 10 or 11 percent would be \nable to reduce it, refinance, not just--we all do refinancing of our \nhome loans and our car loans right now. There is no possibility of \ndoing it with student debt loan, and that is what this measure would \nenable them to do. For folks who have graduated and who cannot start \nfamilies, begin businesses, buy homes, contribute to our economy, it \nwould enable them to accomplish those dreams rather than deferring or \nabandoning them.\n  I am often heartbroken, as I talk to people who have these debts. \nThey did the right thing; they played by the rules, went to college, \nand now find themselves crushed by that debt. Those who are laboring \nunder these crushing debt loans often have pursued careers in medicine \nand other professions such as nursing that would enable them to do an \nenormous good for this country if they were helped, if that crushing \nburden were somehow reduced. Giving them a fair shot is good for our \neconomy because it will increase consumer demand. It is also good for \nour social fabric--literally economically, socially, and physically \ngood for our health by enabling some of those doctors and nurses to \nwork in communities that are underserved right now. We ought to give \nthem public service options, enable some of that debt to be paid down \nor paid off through community and public service. But the measure I \nthink we can agree is urgent and pressing, where there ought to be \nconsensus, is enabling the commonsense refinancing of current debt.\n\n  There are other measures that are vitally important, such as \nclarifying and requiring more accuracy and truth in the forms that are \ngiven to students at the time they take these loans so they know what \ntheir debt will be; enabling more of them to have grants rather than \nloans, bringing down the cost of tuition; enabling more public service \noptions as a means to pay down or pay off debt. But let's focus right \nnow on what is clearly an imperative--a moral imperative and a social \nimperative for our Nation--to enable more refinancing right now. For \nfederal student loans that were originated in the years between 2007 \nand 2012, the government will make $66 billion. Mr. President, $66 \nbillion. That money goes into the U.S. Treasury fund when, in fact, \ninstead it should be invested in our students and our communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in this effort and to focus on those \nadditional measures we can achieve.\n  I see my colleague from Illinois is here. He has championed and I \nhave been pleased to join him in efforts to enable student debt to be \ndischarged in bankruptcy. One of the great, gaping gaps in our present \nbankruptcy system is that students cannot find any relief from this \nstudent debt. Almost every other form of debt can be discharged from \nbankruptcy but not student debt.\n  So there are other measures we can and should achieve, but a fair \nshot for everyone ought to begin right now with this measure on the \nfloor, enabling students and former students to refinance so they have \nthe best shot at paying off those loans and a fair shot at the American \ndream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut for \nreferencing a measure in which we both share an interest. He is right; \na student loan is not like another loan. It is not like the mortgage on \nyour home. It is not like the money you borrowed to buy a car or a boat \nor a line of credit you might have needed at some point in your life. A \nstudent loan is a debt that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. No \nmatter how bad things get, you are going to carry that debt with you to \nthe grave, and believe me, they will pursue you all the way.\n  We just had a report in the Wall Street Journal. There was a \ngrandmother receiving Social Security benefits. They levied her \nbenefits because grandma decided to befriend her granddaughter by \ncosigning her student loan, on which her granddaughter defaulted. So \nnow grandma finds her Social Security check being levied to pay off her \ngranddaughter's student loan. It never ever ends.\n  So I support my colleague from Connecticut. He and I both believe \nthis ought to change. This is awful. For goodness' sake, we have to \nhave some recognition of what is happening with student debt today. It \nis not the way it used to be. Those of us fortunate enough to get the \nearly government loans--the National Defense Education Act, that is how \nI went to college and law school. Scared to death when the Soviets \nlaunched sputnik, this Senate and the House created a loan program for \nkids like me from East St. Louis, IL, to borrow money to go to college. \nI had to pay it back over 10 years with 3 percent interest. I did not \nthink I ever would, but I did. Now look at what students are faced \nwith.\n  Hannah Moore, of the suburbs of Chicago--I have gotten to know \nHannah. I want to tell you Hannah Moore's story. This young lady went \nto community college first. A good idea, right--affordable, a local \ncollege. Then she decided to sign up at the Harrington College of \nDesign. They were going to give her a special education. Well, they \nsure as heck did. The Harrington College of Design is a for-profit \ncollege. Hannah Moore signed up for the course. It is owned by Career \nEducation Corporation. It is a for-profit school. You ought to know \nsomething. Career Education Corporation is under investigation in 17 \ndifferent States for their activities in luring students into worthless \ncollege courses. Hannah Moore was one of those victims.\n  What happened to Hannah? Well, at the end of the day, when she \nfinished\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\nher so-called course at the Harrington College of Design, she ended up \n$124,000 in debt, and it is growing. She cannot keep up with it. She \ncannot earn enough money to keep up with it. Do you know what has \nhappened? She has moved into her parents' basement. That is where she \nhas to live now. Her dad has come out of retirement to help her pay off \nthe loan. That is what she faces.\n  So we are going to do something about it with the help of a few \nRepublicans. I hope a few of them will stand and join us. We are going \nto give students across America who are not in default an opportunity \nto refinance their college loans with lower interest rates. Those of us \nwho have had a few mortgages in our life know what that means--a lower \ninterest rate, a lower payment or more money reduced from the \nprincipal. It is the only way some of these people ever get out from \nthis burden of student debt. Senator Elizabeth Warren put the bill \ntogether. I have cosponsored it with a number of others. We think this \nis the only way that students deep in debt have a fair shot at a \nfuture; otherwise, they are going to be swamped with debt and never get \nout of it.\n  The prospect of going back to school for Hannah? Impossible. She \ncannot borrow money for that. Buying a car? Out of the question. Her \nown apartment? No, sorry, you cannot do that either. I have met young \ncouples who have said: We are putting off raising a family because of \nthe debt.\n  Now we have a bill that is going to be introduced by Senator Warren, \nbrought to the floor, and we need Republican support. We cannot pass it \nwithout Republican support. So far not one Republican has joined us--\nnot one--for refinancing college debt. But that can change. It will \nchange if our Republican colleagues will simply go home to their States \nand have a town meeting and ask the people in attendance: What do you \nthink; should we give college students a lower interest rate? Should \nthe Federal Government make less money off these college students so \nthey can get out from under this debt once and for all?\n  They will find what I found in Illinois--overwhelming support for \nthis approach.\n  So if we are going to do something in the Senate Chamber that really \naffects the lives of working families--where young people and their \nparents can say, well, thank goodness somebody in Washington is finally \nlistening to problems families face--this is it: refinancing college \nstudent loans. This is our opportunity to give a fair shot to kids from \nworking families all across America, the kind of opportunity I had, the \nkind of opportunity millions of others have had.\n  There is a lot more we need to do to clean up this mess when it comes \nto college loans and when it comes to the schools that are ripping off \nstudents, but let's start at the right place. Let's help students in \ndebt get out from under that debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators be permitted to speak for up to \n5 minutes each during the majority's controlled time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I would like to yield now to Senator \nMerkley and then to Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I am honored to be here joining Senator Blumenthal, Senator Durbin--\nSenator Baldwin is going to be here--Senator Schumer, and many others \nto come and address this important topic, and this topic is the college \nloan debt trap.\n  I have a letter here from Stephanie from Oregon, and she writes to me \nabout the trap she and her husband feel they are in. She says:\n\n       I am writing to you as a potential investor into Oregon's \n     economy and the economy of the United States. Unfortunately, \n     however, I will not be able to be this investor until mine \n     and my husband's Private Student Loans . . . are paid off. We \n     owe a little less than $100,000 in . . . Student loans and \n     pay $1,100 per month. We will pay this amount for the next 12 \n     years. Because of our student loans and the 7-7.2% interest \n     [rate] they are set at, we cannot afford to purchase a house \n     in the neighborhood we love . . . cannot buy a car, and \n     cannot even fathom starting a family. We can't even afford to \n     go on vacation, whether that is around Oregon, or outside of \n     that to the many other wonderful states and countries. We pay \n     rent, utilities, and try and buy good, healthy food, but in \n     order to even afford these basics I have to work 2 jobs at 7 \n     days a week.\n\n  She goes on later to say:\n\n       It has been nothing but spinning in place. . . .\n\n  This is a growing reality for millions of Americans who have \ngraduated with student loan debt the size of a home mortgage and higher \ninterest that make these huge student loans the equivalent of a \nmillstone around their necks. When our aspiring young adults in \nAmerica--who have graduated, who have gone on to start their careers--\nwhen they cannot afford to buy a house, that enhances inequality in the \nUnited States of America because home ownership is the major vehicle by \nwhich middle-class families in America establish a nest egg, establish \nwealth, establish a slice of the American dream. What is more joyous in \nlife than having children, being able to raise children? That is the \nmost tremendous, tremendous experience. But she is saying she and her \nhusband cannot even think about starting a family.\n  The picture was quite different when I was graduating from high \nschool in 1974. My father--when I was in grade school, we lived in a \nworking-class neighborhood--had taken me to the school doors and said: \nSon, if you go through those doors and you work hard, you can do just \nabout anything here in America.\n  Well, that was a message about the fact that there is a pathway to \nthrive, a pathway to fulfill your potential, a pathway to pursue your \ndreams, and in the process of doing that you are strengthening our \nentire Nation because when you aspire to your potential, when you \naspire to your dreams, then you also find yourself giving back in all \nkinds of other ways, including having enough income to pay a Federal \nincome tax and contribute property taxes and revenue, as well as the \ntalents or fruits of your profession.\n  Well, I still live in that blue-collar community. My kids still go to \nthe same high school I went to. But the message to our students today \nis very different. They are familiar with many families such as \nStephanie and her husband. They are familiar with the fact that student \ntuition has gone up faster than virtually anything else in our society. \nIt is a much bigger share. I think a rough estimate is about 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes the amount in terms of a working income than it was when I was \ngoing to school, starting college. Let's make this comparison: In \nGermany, the cost of a year in college is around 4 percent of the \nmedian income. In the United States of America, the cost of a year in \ncollege is about 50 percent of the median income. Well, what a \ndifference between less than $1 out of $20 and $1 out of every $2. What \nan incredible difference. So, at a minimum, shouldn't we be acting \ntoday to enable those who have these high-interest student loans to \nrefinance them to a reasonable low rate? Shouldn't we be able to do \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I will wrap up simply by saying that this is common sense. Let's \nlower this burden, and then let's go on and do much more: control the \ncost of tuition, raise the impact of Pell grants, and pursue low-\ninterest student loans as a tool for our students from here going \nforward.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to have had this chance to speak to a \nfundamental challenge to young Americans in every State of the United \nStates of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first let me salute my colleague from \nConnecticut for bringing us all together to talk about this important \nissue, the good words of my colleague from Oregon--always on the money, \nalways understanding what average folks need\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\nand have to go through--and, as well, our sponsors of this legislation. \nI salute Senators Warren and Franken, who are our two lead sponsors.\n  The bottom line is very simple. It is amazing to think that there are \n40 million Americans and their families--at a time when interest rates \nare at about a record low--who are paying 7 to 14 percent on their \nstudent loans. It is amazing to think that the average student \ngraduates with over $30,000 of loans on his or her back. It is amazing \nto think that so many of our young people are living at home because \nthey cannot afford not to because of student loans. Thirty-six percent \nof all individuals between 18 and 31 live with their parents--the \nhighest percentage in 4 decades.\n\n  Why should people be paying more? And even more outrageous, guess who \nis making the profit much of the time? Sometimes it is the private \nbanks. That is bad enough, but sometimes it is the Federal Government. \nFor the Federal Government to charge people nearly double the going \nrate for their student loans is so unfair.\n  So we Democrats are hoping to give people a fair shot, a fair shot at \nbeing able to repay the cost of college at a reasonable interest rate. \nThat is all we want. We are dedicated to helping the middle class, to \nhelping working people, to helping people who do not have so much money \nget a fair shot at living decently well, the way they always have in \nAmerica but in a way that is beginning to decline.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we would beg of them \nnot to stand in the way but to join us. How do they defend charging \nthose who have graduated from college 7, 10, even 14 percent for their \nstudent loans?\n  Now, we just got a CBO score. Our bill, which is paid for by simply \nthe Buffett rule, which says that someone making over $1 million should \npay the same rate as their secretary, as an average person.\n  Well, that is how we pay for it. Again, I cannot believe my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle would disagree with that. \nAnyway, we have a $21 billion net positive on our bill. So for anyone \nwho is worried that we do not pay for the bill, we actually pay for the \nbill and return some money to the Treasury. So a fair shot is what is \nneeded here, a fair shot for everyone to afford college.\n  Last year we lowered the interest rate for people already in college. \nBut what about the 40 million who are out of college and are saddled \nwith high interest rates, people who got out of college before 2010? \nLet's not forget the effect this has on the rest of the economy and new \nhomes. Young people are not buying homes at the rate they used to--\nfirst time home buyers. Why? Well, one of the reasons--we cannot \nquantify how much yet, but we will be doing that--is that they are \nsaddled with so much student debt at high interest rates.\n  So it affects our entire economy because construction jobs are not up \nto what they should be. A large part of that is because people are not \nbuying homes the way they used to. So the bottom line is, it is very \nhard to resist the logic of the proposal that Senators Warren and \nFranken have put together.\n  Here are some numbers from my State. Fifty-four percent of Long \nIslanders between the ages of 25 and 29 live at home with their parents \nor relatives--more than one in two. Amazing. That is the American \ndream, to be able to get out of college and go live on your own, find a \njob, maybe find the person you want to spend the rest of your life \nwith. That is the American dream. It is a lot harder to do that when \nyou are living at home, as much as we all love our parents. But because \nof student debt, because of high interest rates on student debt, people \nare forced to do that.\n  So, again, I thank all of my colleagues who have joined in our fair \nshot effort--our fair shot effort on minimum wage, our fair shot effort \non pay equity, and our fair shot effort on college affordability. We \nwill continue to fight as hard as we can to see that the average \nmiddle-class family is finally given a fair shot. We hope and we pray \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not stand in the \nway.\n  I know my colleagues from Connecticut and from Minnesota, who has \nbeen a great leader on this--and very few in America, let alone in this \nSenate, have such an understanding of the needs of average families and \nthe middle class than the Senator from Minnesota. So I am happy to \nyield the floor so she may say a few--what I am sure will be very \nprescient--words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of the Senator \nfrom New York, and also his keen focus on these issues for the middle \nclass, giving everyone a fair shot.\n  I rise today to talk about the problems of student debt in this \ncountry and the effects that it has on millions of Americans. I think \nwe all know that it is not just students, as much as that is the first \ngroup we think about--students--it is also their parents. Those are the \nones I hear from a lot, and how hard it is, and how they have that next \nkid coming.\n  While maybe they were able to patch together loans and some income to \nhelp one kid go through college, the second one comes along and it is \nincredibly difficult. They literally have this Sophie's choice about \nwhich kid they are going to send to college or what are they going to \ndo with the third kid. It just should not be happening in America \ntoday.\n  I thank Senators Franken, Blumenthal, and Baldwin for bringing us \ntogether on the floor, as well as Senators Harkin, Warren, and Durbin \nfor their leadership on this issue. In the United States we appreciate \nthe value of education. We know it leads to higher-paying jobs, better \nhealth, and even longer lives. I know the value of education. My \ngrandpa worked 1,500 feet underground in a mine in Ely, MN. He was not \nable to graduate from high school because when his parents died, the \ntwo oldest boys had to go to work in the mines. They were only 15 years \nold. That is what they did. They went to work in the mines. They were \nable to keep the entire family together.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S3406, June 4, 2014, in the second column, last \nparagraph, the following language appears: I thank Senators \nBlumenthal and . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: I thank Senators \nFranken, Blumenthal, and . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The youngest girl had to go to an orphanage in Duluth for a while, \nand then they were able to bring her back. Those two oldest boys never \ngot to graduate from high school, never went to college, and worked in \nthe mines their entire life, worked underground at a very dangerous \ntime in our country. When the sirens would go off, they would not know \nwhose family member had been killed.\n  That is what my grandpa did. He wanted a better life for my dad. He \nliterally saved money in a coffee can in the basement of their house so \nthat he could send my dad to college. Then my dad went to college and \nbecame a newspaper reporter. My mom, during the same time period, \ngrowing up in Milwaukee during the Depression, ended up going to \nMilwaukee Teachers College and then came to Minnesota and was a \nteacher.\n  Here I am standing today on the Senate floor, the daughter of a \nteacher and a newspaper man and the granddaughter of an iron ore miner. \nIt would not have happened without education. It would not have \nhappened without my mom's parents struggling to make sure she went to \ncollege, and without my grandpa saving that money in a coffee can after \nworking underground in the mines and never being able to go to school \nhimself.\n  That is what I know about education. That is a story we hear again \nand again from people in this country. Higher education provides \nstudents with the skills they need to be competitive in today's global \neconomy. At a time when more and more jobs require some form of \npostsecondary school, we cannot allow cost to be a barrier to that \nopportunity. We cannot allow only the wealthy to be able to send their \nkids to college. It is really that simple.\n  This country was built on the middle class. This country was built on \nthis idea that no matter where you come from, if you are in a little \niron ore mining town in northern Minnesota, that there is a chance that \nyour kid can go to college. My dad did not start at some fancy college. \nMy dad went to a community college which is now Vermilion Community \nCollege, which was then Ely Junior College, and got his 2-year degree. \nThen he went to the University of Minnesota. Back then it was so \nincredibly affordable. He would still send his laundry back to my \ngrandma in Ely, and she would do his laundry and she would send it \nback. He got by on barely nothing.\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\n  But he went on from that degree at the University of Minnesota to \nbecome a journalist and interview everyone from Ginger Rogers to Mike \nDitka to Ronald Reagan. It all started in that hardscrabble mining \ntown. That is what education is about in this country. Outstanding \nstudent loans now, they are not like something you can fit in a coffee \ncan. Outstanding student loans now total more than $1.2 trillion, \nsurpassing total credit card debt and affecting 40 million Americans.\n  One in seven borrowers defaults on Federal student loans within 3 \nyears of beginning repayment. Other borrowers are struggling too. \nThirty percent of Federal Direct student loan dollars are in default, \nforbearance or deferment. It costs a lot of money. When there are not \nhigh-paying jobs right out of school or when kids have really high \ncosts from school, and when they are in a job that maybe eventually \nthey will get enough money, they have trouble paying off their loans.\n  But make no mistake, student loan debt impacts everyone, not just \nstudents. Student loan debt hangs like an anchor around not just \nindividual students but around our entire economy. It is dragging us \ndown. Graduates with high debt may delay making key investments like \nsaving for retirement or getting married or buying a home. Student debt \nmay even impact a person's career choices, by deterring some graduates \nfrom taking jobs in crucial fields like education.\n  According to a report I released as chair of the Joint Economy \nCommittee on the Senate side, Minnesota actually has one of the highest \nrates of student debt in the country. Seventy percent of the recent \ngraduates in Minnesota have loan debt, compared to 68 percent \nnationally. So it means a lot in our State.\n  The good news is that there are actions we can take----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent for another 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Last summer we acted to prevent the interest rate from \ndoubling. We have also introduced the Bank on Students Emergency Loan \nRefinancing Act. I urge the Senate to consider this very important bill \nso more students can manage their debt and build a better future for \nthemselves and their family. I am proud to support this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we need to rethink financial aid in this \ncountry. We need urgent action if we are to reform our system, to \nreturn to the roots, the ideals that made college affordable for \ngenerations past, and hopefully for this generation and generations to \ncome. Back in the 1970s and 1980s when several Members of today's \nSenate were college students, the Pell grant, which is the cornerstone \nof our Federal student aid programs, covered as much as 72 percent of \nthe cost of attendance at a 4-year public college.\n  For the 2014-2015 academic year, the maximum grant is expected to \ncover less than one-third of the cost. Investing in things like Pell \ngrants is critical to ensuring the doors to higher education remain \nopen to all students with the talent and desire to pursue a college \ndegree.\n  Young people today deserve the same fair shake that Members of this \nbody got when we were undergraduate students, when grants and not loans \ncovered most of the cost of college.\n  Now, I was fortunate enough at 17 to join the Army and attend West \nPoint. So I did not have to face the rigors of financing college \neducation. But everyone I know in my generation will tell you it was \neasier then because there was a strong Federal commitment to supporting \nmen and women of talent and desire to go on to college. Ever-rising \ncosts today are just pricing out a whole generation from college \neducation.\n  We see more and more hard-working young people and their families \nfalling behind as they try to pay for their degrees that were supposed \nto help them get ahead. In fact, an analysis of student loan debt by \nDemos predicts that today over $1 trillion in outstanding student loan \ndebt will lead to a total lifetime wealth loss of $4 trillion for \nindebted households. Not only do people start off after college with \ngreat debt, but their ability to build assets in the future is also \nreduced. So it is a much deeper hole than even the initial debt.\n  Student loan debt is jeopardizing this generation's ability to buy a \nhome, to start a business, to start a family, to do things that my \ngeneration took for granted after getting out of college. For the last \n30 years, tuition increases have outpaced inflation. Outstanding \nstudent loan debt has quadrupled since 2003. It is time for action.\n  First, we must provide relief for borrowers who are currently \nrepaying their loans. We must ensure that student loan servicers are \nheld accountable for providing borrowers with accurate and clear \ninformation and the full range of borrower benefits they are due. That \nis why I was pleased to join Senator Durbin in introducing the Student \nLoan Borrower Bill of Rights Act.\n  Even more important to families' bottom line is reducing their \npayments and overall debt burden. We should allow borrowers with high \nfixed-rate loans to refinance at the lower rates approved on a \nbipartisan basis under the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act that \nbecame law last year. That is the premise of Senator Warren's Bank on \nStudents Emergency Loan Refinancing Act which I am also very proud to \ncosponsor.\n  I hope my colleagues will let us vote on this proposal so we can \nprovide relief to millions of Americans who are struggling under the \nweight of student loan debt.\n  We also have to demand more responsibility from colleges and \nuniversities. While student loan debt skyrockets, we are also seeing \ncollege executive salaries climb ever higher. Clearly institutions need \nto have more skin in the game when it comes to student loans. That is \nwhy I introduced, along with many colleagues, the Protect Student \nBorrowers Act, specifically with Senators Durbin and Warren. The \nProtect Student Borrowers Act will hold colleges and universities \naccountable for student loan default by requiring them to repay a \npercentage of defaulted loans. As the percentage of students who \ndefault rises, the institution's risk-share payment will rise. \nEssentially, they will now have an interest, and a real interest, in \nensuring that their students take out appropriate loans and they have \ncoursework that leads to remunerative employment after they graduate. \nColleges can play a key role in all of these things. Today it is a \nspotty record. Some are very good, some are indifferent, and some are \nvery bad.\n  The Protect Student Borrowers Act also provides incentives for \ninstitutions to take proactive steps to ease student loan debt and \nreduce default rates. Institutions can reduce or eliminate their \npayments if they implement a comprehensive student loan management \nplan--again, if they talk to their students, if they advise them what \nto do, if they help them manage this debt.\n  The risk-sharing payments will be invested to help struggling \nborrowers, preventing future default and delinquency, and reducing \nshortfalls in the Pell Grant Program. This money will stay in the \nsystem to help other students.\n  With the stakes so high for students and taxpayers, it is only fair \nthat institutions bear some of the risk in the student loan program. I \nwould argue a basic premise, that they will do a lot better as \ncustodians and managers and advisers for the students when they have \nmoney at risk.\n  Right now, it is the students and their families who bear it all--and \nthe government, if there is default. As a result, you don't have the \nactive participation at the institutional level that could make a real \ndifference.\n  In many respects, this is a lesson we learned, at a very expensive \ncost, during the financial crisis in the mortgage markets, where \nmortgage makers had no interest in who was borrowing money. They didn't \ncare if they could pay it back, because the minute the paper was \nsigned, they sold it off to the secondary market and they walked away \nto the next closing. We can't have that attitude pervasive in higher \neducation.\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\n  We know there are many forces that are driving increases in costs in \nhigher education, and one of the cost drivers is, frankly, the falloff \non State contributions to public higher education. According to the \nState Higher Education Finance report, state spending per full-time \nequivalent student reached its lowest point in 25 years in 2011.\n  I have introduced the Partnerships for Affordability and Student \nSuccess Act to reinvigorate the Federal-State partnership for higher \neducation with an emphasis on need-based grant aid. Remember back in \nthe sixties and seventies, nearly 80 percent of the financing was grant \naid. You didn't have to pay it back. You had a chance to get an \neducation and start off without a lot of debt.\n  Simply put, I believe the States have to begin to renew their \ninvestment in education at the college level.\n  I urge the Senate to come together with a sense of real urgency on \nfinding solutions to all of these issues, to move forward, and to give \nthis generation and the next generation the same opportunity that many \nof us here took for granted in the sixties, seventies, and eighties.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island, who has been \nsuch a champion and a leader in these efforts over so many years. Well \nbefore I came to the Senate, he was there working and fighting for more \naffordable loans for our students.\n  The comments that have been heard on the Senate floor over the past \nhour reflect a growing awareness and worry in the country, a worry \nabout what happens to America in the future, whether we will leave a \nlesser America, and whether the American dream will be not only \ndeferred but denied to so many students who are wondering and worrying \nright now about their personal futures as well as the future of the \ncountry.\n  These comments and this conversation will be extended over this day \nand the days to come as we prepare for a crucial vote next week on this \nbill. One of the chief authors of this bill, Senator Warren, is to be \nthanked and commended. She will be on floor later today or tomorrow to \nspeak for herself, but she has shown, through her career, how often \npeople who most need this kind of help, whose finances most cry out for \nthis assistance, are impacted, and in fact constrained in their futures \nby the big banks and lending institutions that take advantage of them--\nand, in this case, even the U.S. Government itself that is profiting \noff their backs--billions of dollars in profit at the expense of our \nstudents when we should be investing in them.\n  We have an obligation and a historic opportunity to make things right \nfor young people and older people, whose present lives are impacted and \nwhose futures are constrained by the daunting and financially crippling \noverhanging debt. It is an overhanging debt that impacts our economy \nbecause it prevents the entrepreneurs from taking risks. It prevents \nyoung people from buying homes and starting families. It financially \ncripples our economy as well as those individual lives.\n  So in the light of self-interest, we ought to argue for all of us to \nsupport this legislation. For myself, I am going to be listening to \nthose students who discussed their futures with me at Ansonia High \nSchool, Stanwich, at roundtables across Connecticut, at the \ncommencements where I spoke, and the college students who spoke to me \nat Quinnipiac, or the law school students there who talked to me about \nhow their present lives and their spirit, their hope for public \nservice, as well as for gaining for themselves the promise of their \nfutures, will be impacted and maybe put out of reach by the debt they \nhave, not just hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars, but tens of \nthousands of dollars and, for some, hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  We can do better for them and for ourselves if we enable them to \nrefinance. Right now, student debt is not only one of the few debts \nthat is nondischargeable in bankruptcy, but it is one of the few debts \nthat is nonrefinanceable.\n  Let's treat these students as we would other debtors. In fact, let's \ngive them a fair shot. Let's give our country a fair shot.\n  I am proud to support this legislation. I thank all of my colleagues \nwho are here today, and all who will support--I hope on both sides of \nthe aisle--this vote we will have next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise for a moment to talk about the \nSylvia Burwell nomination, pending confirmation to be Secretary of \nLabor at HHS, and also to talk about the Affordable Care Act, because \nyou can't separate the two.\n  I have the good fortune of being on the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee and the Finance Committee. The good fortune of that \nis it allowed me to twice be able to interrogate--and I use the word \ninterrogate understanding its many definitions--Ms. Burwell over issues \nthat were important to me both in the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee, as well as in the Finance Committee.\n  I found her to be articulate, forthright, straightforward, and \ncandid--something we haven't had in the Secretary of Labor-HHS for the \nlast year or so. I am looking forward to having somebody in there who \nwill be able to answer the hard questions. I might not like the answer, \nI might not agree with the solutions, but I like having somebody who \nhas the intellect, the capability, and the willingness to communicate \nwith Members of Congress, regardless of their party. So I will vote for \nSylvia Burwell to be confirmed as Secretary of Labor and HHS, and I \nwish her the best.\n  No one should confuse that vote, however, for being a vote in support \nof the Affordable Care Act and what it is doing to health care in the \nUnited States today. I want to talk about that for a second. Some of \nthese things I want to talk about are questions I asked Ms. Burwell in \nthe confirmation hearing.\n  When I was on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, \nand we did the markup in terms of the health care bill, we met for \n69\\1/2\\ hours. I heard every debate on every amendment; I heard every \ndebate on every philosophy; I heard every proposal that was made, and \nit became quite clear to me that the premise of that legislation, based \non the President's recommendation, was diametrically opposed to my \npersonal philosophy in terms of where government's role should be.\n  I think the President--and it has been said by the leader Harry Reid \nrecently--thought a single-payer health care system was the right way \nto go. I think the Affordable Care Act is designed to drive America \ntoward a single-payer health care system.\n  I would rather have a competitive private sector system that is on a \nplaying field that the government makes sure is fair and level but that \nthe winners and losers in health care become those who compete the best \nin terms of quality and service.\n  In fact, the intent of the ObamaCare act and Affordable Care Act has \ndirected a lot of things to happen. Three of them were not good.\n  Premiums have gone up. The costs to the consumer have gone up, \nprincipally because taxes have been levied on the insurance industry. \nThat is No. 1.\n  Access has been more limited and more restricted based on the Bronze \nPlan, the Silver Plan, the Gold Plan, and differences between the \nexchanges.\n  Third and foremost, there is a great uncertainty in America about \nwhat happens next and where health care is going, because the President \nhas selectively given waivers and put off the impact of certain \nprovisions of the law, while lifting up and actually repealing with his \nown signature and his own pen provisions that were in the law. So there \nis a lot of uncertainty.\n  Two things I want to focus on from the cost standpoint. One of them \nis what is called the HIT, the health insurance tax, which went into \neffect this year. This year $8 billion in taxes were levied against \nsmall- and medium-size group insurance providers in the exchanges for \nhealth care. It is an arbitrary number that was used to help determine \nand pay for the Affordable Care Act, and it is assessed based on the \nmarket share of the companies.\n\n[[Page S3409]]\n\n  Think about this for a second. The U.S. Government is taxing health \ninsurance providers based on their market share of health insurance, \nand adding that cost to where? To the premium that is paid by the \nconsumer.\n  It has been estimated that the premium cost is going to go up about \n$512 a year for the average consumer, just in order for the moderately \nsmall- and medium-sized group provider to pay the fine or pay their \nshare of the tax of $8 billion. That $8 billion in 2014, in 2019 goes \nto $14.3 billion and will go up ad infinitum as it will continue to \nclimb--which means costs will continue to climb.\n  Access has been restricted because a lot of people aren't playing in \nthe system. A lot of specialty hospitals have chosen not to join the \nplans. That has meant that specialty care to a lot of children and \nadults is not available.\n  Another problem we have had is with navigators, and I want to focus \non the navigator point for a second, because it fundamentally \nunderscores my belief in the private sector.\n  For years I ran a business. It was a business where we had some \nemployees but mostly had independent contractors. We provided group \nmedical benefits for our employees, but only access to salesmen who \nwould sell group plan health plans for independent contractors.\n  They got a commission when they sold a plan, when they provided the \nservices, and the employee or the independent contractor in my company \ndecided to buy. What we did in the Affordable Care Act--or what the \nAffordable Care Act and those who voted for it did--it basically did \naway with all the salesmen in the country who were selling group \nmedical plans to individuals and small businesses. Why? Because it had \na medical-loss ratio maximum of 80 percent or 85 percent, meaning your \nmedical costs had to be 80 percent to 85 percent of the premiums. \nAdministrative costs could only be 15 to 20, and it counted the \ncommission for selling the product as an administrative cost, which \nmeant commissions weren't available to be paid.\n  So what happened? All the people in sales in terms of group medical \ninsurance got out of the business and went to selling something else. \nWhat happened because of that? Navigators came about.\n  So we ended up hiring a bunch of unqualified, unknowledgeable, \nlimited-talent people as navigators to offer to try and sell insurance \nunder the new exchanges created by the ObamaCare act. What happened is \nsales of those policies were not very robust. In fact, it was very \ndifficult for the President to get his minimum goal of 7 million people \nbeing covered. Why? Because the navigators weren't salesmen, No. 1; No. \n2, they weren't as well educated as they should have been; and, No. 3, \nthe States did not embrace it.\n  So that is the private sector solution that had been used for years \nand years in our country; that is, independent agents making sales of \nindependent insurance products through independent contractors. That \nhas now gone away. They have to now go find an employee who is a \nnavigator, who has no incentive, because they are on a salary and not a \ncommission, to provide a plan or to sell a plan. They merely are there \nto collect their paycheck and offer information, if in fact somebody \ncan find them.\n  My point is this: Ms. Burwell is taking on a serious challenge in \nterms of Labor HHS. The Affordable Care Act presents a lot of problems \nin terms of access, cost, and quality of health care for the American \npeople that will only get greater as the years go by. We are going to \ntake somebody of her competence and her candid nature to help us join \ntogether to see to it that what has become a major problem that looms \nfor our country, the Affordable Care Act, is revisited to look at a new \nway to go back to the private sector, go back to competition, go back \nto a level playing field and out of the business of selective taxation, \nless access, more cost, and more bureaucracy. That is what we have with \nthe Affordable Care Act right now. That is what is untenable.\n  I wish Ms. Burwell the best. I intend to be very aggressive and \nactive in my work on the Health, Education, Labor, & Pensions Committee \nand the Finance Committee in trying to get to the bottom of some of the \nquestions that have gone unanswered from the Department. I wish her the \nbest, and I hope I get the answers to those questions when she is \nconfirmed as the new Secretary of HHS.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Roberts pertaining to the introduction of S. 2430 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Energy Regulation\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this last fall Environmental Protection \nAgency Administrator Gina McCarthy embarked upon a national listening \ntour to gather feedback on possible new energy regulations that could \nbe ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory power. \nNotably absent from her tour across the Nation were the major coal-\nproducing or user States.\n  Now, my State of Indiana was notably absent from that despite our \nrequest that she listen to what Hoosiers had to say about their source \nof energy, what it does for the state's economy, how it helps attract \njobs to our State, and how it helps our residents to keep utility bills \nin line. So we were very disappointed that we were not included in that \nlistening tour. Other States, surprisingly--or maybe not surprisingly--\nwhich are also coal-producing energy States were also bypassed. \nApparently, they didn't want to hear from us.\n  I think on Monday we found out exactly why it was done that way, \nbecause in the latest installment of the administration's ongoing ``war \non coal'' as it is described, Administrator McCarthy announced that the \nEPA is putting forward new rules on existing fossil fuel powerplants. \nThese new proposed regulations are essentially an energy tax that will \ndamage our national economy as well as the economy of Indiana and hike \nelectric bills for every Hoosier.\n  As the seventh highest coal-producing State in the Nation, Indiana \nrelies on coal-fired electricity to meet well over 80 percent of its \nenergy needs. Our industry provides thousands of jobs and contributes \nthree-quarters of a billion dollars to the Indiana economy. Because of \nthis, the EPA proposed rule will place a choke hold on Indiana's \nprimary and most affordable energy source, driving up utility costs, \nand putting our State at a disadvantage in competing with other States \nto lure companies and to attract residents.\n  It is worth noting that the EPA's announcement ignores the progress \nthe utility industry has made in recent years, and, in fact, in recent \ndecades. Energy providers in Indiana and across the country have spent \nbillions of dollars to control air pollution that has resulted in \nsignificant declines in emissions. In fact, we have significantly \ncleaned our air and water through environmental regulation and through \ncapital investment to produce an environment that is the envy of many \nnations. This has been done at a competitive disadvantage to our \ncompanies, because we are competing in a global economy and we know \nthat nations such as China and India and others have not made the same \ncommitment that Americans have in controlling their emissions.\n  We have also been a leader in Indiana in reclamation and restoration \non the mining front. So those who say it is a desecration of the land \nto extract coal need to come and see what we have done in terms of \nreclamation. Instead of barren hillsidesbarren of grass and trees, you \nwill find lush pastures and scenic views where you would never have \nknown mining had taken place.\n  Penalizing Hoosier energy producers with unattainable environmental \nrestrictions, I believe, is the wrong approach. In effect it is a \nbackdoor way\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\nfor unelected bureaucrats to impose regulations similar to the cap-and-\ntrade scheme previously pushed by the White House. Not only did a \ntotally Democratic-controlled Congress fail to pass this similar \nproposal in 2010, I think it is clear that there will not even be 50 \nvotes for the EPA's proposed regulations in the Senate today, much less \nthe 60 votes required for passage. I think the President realizes this.\n  So what does he do? He bypasses Congress, which I think is an \nunconstitutional means of enforcing what ought to be done through \nlegislation--debated and passed by those who are elected and are \nresponsible to the people who elected them--and bypasses that by \nessentially moving it to an agency and saying: You do it by rulemaking. \nThen unelected bureaucrats make the decisions that we ought to be \nmaking in this Congress.\n  This is not the first time that one country has had to limit one type \nof energy to the detriment of economic growth and the pocketbooks of \nhard-working families. These new sweeping rules on coal-fired \npowerplants brought to mind my friends in Western Europe. As U.S. \nAmbassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005, I had a front row seat for the \nsimilar transition away from fossil fuels that most Germans now regret.\n  When the German legislature passed a renewable energy law in 2000, \nGermany gave solar and wind producers 20 years of fixed high prices and \npreferable access to the country's electricity grid. Following a \nfashionable green wave of the moment, the main political parties in \nGermany reached a hasty decision to phase out all 17 of that country's \nnuclear power plants. German leaders vowed to eliminate clean nuclear \npower while simultaneously aiming to reduce carbon emissions from 80 to \n95 percent by 2050. These overly ambitious and seemingly contradictory \ntargets they said would be achieved by an extravagant government plan \nto encourage the development of renewable energy production methods.\n  Under the plan the so-called ``energiewende'' or ``energy \ntransition'' renewables, mostly solar and wind, would supply--they \nsaid--80 percent of Germany's electricity and 60 percent of the \ncountry's total energy requirements. If those goals look impossible, it \nis because it has been impossible for them to reach and they realize \nthat. Germany's ongoing subsidization of alternative energy means \nGermans pay significantly higher prices for energy than the global \naverage, putting their industries at a competitive disadvantage. Their \nconsumers pay some of the highest electric rates in the world.\n  Earlier this year the German government revealed that nearly 7 \nmillion families--and they only have 80 million in the country--are in \n``energy poverty,'' meaning they have to receive major subsidies from \nthe government in order to pay their electric bills. Today German \ncitizens and their businesses and manufacturing entities complain \nloudly about these extra costs that Americans and most other European \nnations do not face. It has triggered a potential crisis from an \neconomic standpoint. Companies are threatening to move offshore, \nelsewhere in Europe or to the United States or to other places. Users \nand residents are complaining loudly about the fact that they are \nsubsidizing an unworkable plan.\n  While the government subsidies finance inefficient technologies and \nthe government obsesses about emissions goals, Germany has ramped up \nits coal use, ironically, to 45 percent of total electricity \ngeneration.\n  Think about this for a minute.\n  A government plan to mandate and subsidize alternative energy \nsources, to close their nuclear plants, to cease using coal-fired \nplants to provide power has now put Germany in a situation where 45 \npercent of its energy is provided by the import of coal--high sulfur \ncoal with high emissions, because that is what burns the hottest.\n  Now the question here is: Can we learn some lessons from this? What \nwe are embarking on here essentially is a plan very similar to what has \nalready been tried and failed. This is a cost too high for our economy \nin the United States. Without a course correction, I think President \nObama's war on coal will receive the same results as Germany's or \nperhaps even worse, higher prices and real potential for electricity \nsupply disruptions.\n  I talked to a number of the electric companies that derive from coal \na source of energy that provides a very reliable base load. Base load \nis what you absolutely have to have to keep the lights on and to run \nthe factories and to keep energy flowing. Their concern is that the \ncurrent plan will disrupt that base load to the point where we cannot \nguarantee energy will reach homes at a time when a polar vortex has put \npeople at subzero freezing temperatures or when the temperatures climbs \nto triple digits during the summer. These baseloads cannot be reached \nby turning windmills, and many days--particularly in my State and \nothers--the Sun is not shining. That is not a dependable source for \nproviding the baseload that is necessary, particularly at times of \nstress on the system.\n\n  President Obama has often seen elements of European socialism as \nsomething he would like to impose on Americans. Well, this is one time \nwhen I think the President should learn from European socialism and \nEuropean mistakes and avoid duplicating the situation in Germany by \nsimply letting proven energy providers do their jobs and produce the \nenergy that is needed.\n  Once again, I have to say the United States has a pretty commendable \nrecord of addressing the issues of emissions. We all want clean air, we \nall want clean water, and we all want to have a safe environment for \nourselves, our children, and the future.\n  Hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars have been spent \nover the years trying to control those emissions, and we have a pretty \ngood record. Can we go farther? Absolutely. Can we do more? Absolutely. \nCan we put ourselves on a much more sustainable path to a cleaner \nenvironment with less emissions? Absolutely. But setting a mandatory \nnumber in terms of percentage and a mandatory deadline in terms of \nreaching something that has proven to be unreachable and threatens our \nability to provide sustained energy to our businesses and residents is \nsomething we need to take careful assessment of before we rush into \narbitrarily setting a rule that bypasses the debate that would take \nplace in Congress, bypasses the positions of our elected Members of \nthis Congress, and done through a process the Constitution has \nestablished in terms of how we make decisions.\n  I urge my colleagues and the President to take a second look at what \nthe possible consequences could be. It is nothing but pie in the sky, \nideologically driven rules and regulations that are driving this. We \nhave a model of a major industrial nation that has taken similar steps \nand has seen those steps fail.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to look very carefully at what is \nhappening through this proposed rule, and I trust we will be able to \neffectively address this situation in a responsible and reasonable way.\n  I see my colleague from Tennessee is prepared to remark on perhaps \nthis or something else, but there is probably no one better suited to \ntalk about alternative energy and its consequences than my colleague \nSenator Alexander.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am delighted to be on the floor to \nhear the distinguished Senator from Indiana, and former Ambassador to \nGermany, tell the story of Germany, which has gotten itself into what \ncan only be described as an energy mess.\n  He summed it up pretty well. They basically adopted the policies the \nPresident seems to be suggesting. Where did they end up? They closed \ntheir nuclear plants and they are buying their nuclear power from \nFrance. They subsidized wind and solar, and now they are buying natural \ngas from Russia--of all unreliable people. As a result of all this, \nthey ended up having to build coal plants.\n  I think I was with the Ambassador in Germany, and I said to the \nEconomic Minister: This has produced a situation where you have nearly \nthe highest electricity prices in the European Union. What do you tell \na manufacturer when they say they want to come to Germany? The minister \nsaid: I tell them to go somewhere else.\n  Well, somewhere else is the United States today, and we want those \njobs.\n  I thank the Senator for his experience.\n\n[[Page S3411]]\n\n  I come to the floor on another subject. Tomorrow we will vote on the \nnomination of Sylvia Matthews Burwell to be the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. I intend to vote yes on the nomination. Ms. Burwell has \na reputation for competence, and she is going to need it. She is being \nasked to oversee a big mess this administration has created in health \ncare and so far has lacked the leadership to clean up. Republicans know \nhow to clean it up. We want to take our health care system in a \ndifferent direction, and we need to be able to work with Ms. Burwell to \ndo it.\n  In a few minutes, I am going to spell out two things: first, what Ms. \nBurwell can do to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor in working with \nCongress and serving the American people, and second, what Republicans \nwould like to do with our health care system. I have five items to \nsuggest for her to work on with us.\n  No. 1, end the secrecy. Last year I said the NSA could have learned \nsomething from Secretary Sebelius because getting information about the \nObamaCare exchanges was next to impossible for Members of Congress.\n  The administration owes the American taxpayers and their elected \nrepresentatives under the Constitution information about how the \nadministration is spending our money. We should not have to rely on \nanonymous news sources.\n  No. 2, work with Congress. This administration has made at least 22 \nunilateral changes in the new health care law, many of which should \nhave been made by Congress. At this rate, the President may be invited \nto speak at the next Republican convention for having done the most to \nchange his own health care law.\n  Our Founders did not want a king. Some Presidents have stepped over \nthe line the Founders intended, but I don't think any President has \ngone as far as this one. He has appointed more czars than the Romanovs. \nHe made recess appointments when the Senate was in session. He turned \nhis Education Secretary into the chairman of the national school board. \nThis President has swung the furthest from the kind of elected leaders \nour Founders envisioned, George Washington modeled, and our \nConstitution prescribed.\n  Will Ms. Burwell follow the President's steps or will she seek to \nwork within the framework of the Constitution? I hope she chooses the \nlatter.\n  No. 3, please don't solicit from companies you regulate. This is \npretty simple, but the former Secretary solicited from companies she \nregulated, and she should not have. This kind of behavior should leave \nwith her.\n  No. 4, be a good steward of taxpayer dollars. Apparently the \ngovernment is set to spend more than 1 billion Federal tax dollars in \ntechnology costs on the ObamaCare Web site. We know that nearly $\\1/2\\ \nbillion was wasted on four failed State exchanges. This kind of waste \nmakes American taxpayers furious. They earned those dollars, paid those \ntaxes, and don't deserve to see that money flushed down the drain by \nWashington bureaucrats who didn't care enough to see that things were \ndone right.\n\n  No. 5, show Americans some respect. That means don't announce major \npolicy changes in blog posts. When Congress asks if you are in trouble, \ndon't pretend everything is fine. If Secretary Sebelius had been \nupfront about the Web site problems before the rollout, we might have \nsaved Americans precious time and money.\n  Most importantly, recognize that the majority of Americans disapprove \nof the new health care law and start taking a look at Republican health \ncare proposals as a way to repair the damage done by ObamaCare.\n  At Ms. Burwell's hearing before the Senate HELP Committee, where I am \nthe ranking Republican, I laid out again what Republicans would do if \nwe could--what we would like to do with our health care system. We have \nbeen saying this since 2009 when the legislation was first introduced.\n  When I was a boy, my grandfather was a railroad engineer in Newton, \nKS. He drove a big steam locomotive. He would drive a switch engine \ninto a roundhouse and onto a turntable. It might have been headed to \nSanta Fe, and then he would turn it around and head it off to another \ndirection, maybe to Denver or Houston. It is hard to turn a big train, \nso that is what they had the turntables for.\n  Ms. Burwell understands this. She is from a railroad town in West \nVirginia, as it turns out, and that is what Republicans would like to \ndo with our health care system, we would like to turn it around and \nhead it off in a different direction--not back but in a different \ndirection. We want to repair the damage ObamaCare has done, and we want \nto prevent future damage as responsibly and rapidly as we can. We would \nlike to move in a different direction to put in place health care \nproposals that would increase freedom, increase choices, and lower \ncosts. We trust Americans to make those decisions themselves, and we \nbelieve that is the American way.\n  Four years ago Congress and the President made what we believe was an \nhistoric mistake. Congress passed a 2,700-page bill. Republicans said \nwe don't believe in trying to rewrite the whole health care system. \nLet's instead go step by step to create more freedom, more choices, and \nlower costs.\n  Let me take you back for a moment to the health care summit at the \nBlair House 4 years ago. The President invited three dozen Members of \nCongress. He spent 6 hours with us, all on national television. I was \nasked to speak first for the Republicans. I said what I thought was \nwrong with the President's plan. I said it would increase health care \ncosts, and it has.\n  USA Today reported that health care spending in the first quarter of \nthis year rose at the fastest pace in 35 years. The Hill newspaper \nreported that insurance executives say premiums in the new exchanges \nwill double or triple in parts of the country the next year. Even with \nsubsidies, many Americans are finding that deductibles, copayments, and \nout-of-pocket expenses are so high they can't afford health insurance.\n  We said people would lose their choice of doctors, and many have. We \nsaid ObamaCare would cancel policies, and it has. At least 2.6 million \nAmericans have had their individual plans outlawed by ObamaCare. I \nremember that Emilie from Lawrenceburg, TN, had a $52-a-month policy. \nShe has lupus, and her policy fit her needs and her budget. It was \ncanceled. Now she is in the exchange, and it costs about $400 a month. \nShe says it is more coverage than she needs and she can't afford it.\n  Millions more Americans who get their health care through small \nbusinesses will find the same thing will happen to them later this \nyear.\n  We said jobs would be lost, and they have. The President of Costa \nRica is hosting jobs fairs and welcoming medical device companies that \nhave been driven out of the United States by the onerous 2.3-percent \ntax on revenues.\n  We said Medicare beneficiaries would be hurt, and they have. The \naverage cut for a Medicare Advantage beneficiary will be $317 between \nthis year and next.\n  We said the only bipartisan thing about the bill would be opposition \nto it, and it is. A recent Gallup poll says that 54 percent of \nAmericans are opposed to the law.\n  During the debate, I said every Senator who voted for the new health \ncare law ought to be sentenced to go home and serve as Governor in \ntheir home State and try to implement it. There are 16 Governors \nstruggling with that today who won't implement the Medicaid expansion \nbecause they are worried about costs down the road, and they should.\n  When I was Governor of Tennessee, Medicaid costs were 8 percent of \nthe State budget, and that was in the 1980s. Today it is about 30 \npercent. These Governors are wondering what costs will be in 10 years.\n  The most important thing we said was what we would do if we could. We \nsaid: Let's go step by step in a different direction. Our Democratic \nfriends said: Wait a minute, that is not a comprehensive plan. We said: \nYou are right; we don't believe in comprehensive. If you are expecting \nMitch McConnell to wheel in a wheelbarrow with a 2,700-page Republican \nhealth care bill on it, you will wait until the Moon turns blue because \nwe are policy skeptics. We don't believe we are wise enough to write a \n2,700-page bill that will change the whole system, but we believe we \ncan go step by step in the right direction, and we outlined our steps.\n  Senator Johnson has a proposal that would allow more Americans to \nkeep\n\n[[Page S3412]]\n\ntheir insurance plans, as the President promised.\n  Senator McCain has a proposal that allows you to buy insurance in \nanother State if it fits your budget and your needs.\n  Senator Enzi has a proposal for a small business employer so that he \nor she can combine purchasing power with other employers and offer \nemployees lower cost insurance.\n  Senators Burr, Coburn, and Hatch have a proposal to allow to you buy \na major medical plan to ensure you against a catastrophe and a health \nsavings account to pay for everyday expenses.\n  I have a proposal to make it easier, not harder, for employers to \nreward employees who live a healthy lifestyle. That is what we mean by \ndoing what my grandfather did with that train and turning it around and \nheading it off in a different and correct direction.\n  As rapidly and responsibly as we can, we would like to repair the \ndamage ObamaCare has done. We would like to prevent future damage. We \nwant to move in a different direction that provides more freedom, more \nchoices, and lower costs. We trust Americans to make decisions for \nthemselves. That is the American way.\n  Since President Obama will still be in office for the next 2 years, \nif Ms. Burwell is confirmed, as I fully expect she will be by a good \nvote, we will need her help to accomplish that.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                             VA Challenges\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss important veteran and VA \nissues--issues we are all properly focused on like a laser beam right \nnow--and I will be joined over the next several minutes by Senators \nRubio, Inhofe, and Heller, who share all of my concerns.\n  I have been coming to the floor pretty relentlessly--because \napparently that is what is necessary--to talk about one specific \npriority with regard to veterans in Louisiana; that is, moving--there \nis no good reason we can't move--on expanding outpatient clinics that \nare overdue in 27 locations and in 18 States, including 2 new expanded \noutpatient clinics in Louisiana, specifically in Lafayette and Lake \nCharles. These clinics have been planned for, on the books, and paid \nfor for several years now. They are not being built, they are not being \nmoved into purely because of an administrative glitch at the VA that \ndelayed the whole process by a year. Then, in that intervening year, a \nso-called new scoring issue came up on Capitol Hill at the CBO. We have \nblown through all of that. We have solved those problems, finally, \nafter a lot of delay. We have solved those problems, and now there is \nabsolutely no reason to not take up a bill that has been passed by the \nHouse, put a simple amendment on the bill and pass it through the \nSenate, and get on with building these new and necessary expanded VA \nclinics at 27 locations around the country, in 18 States, obviously \nincluding the State of Louisiana. There are two locations there, as I \nmentioned--in Lafayette and Lake Charles.\n  I again take the floor in the context of this much broader VA scandal \nto urge us to come together and act in this simple but important way. I \nhave been coming to the floor to urge this action for months now--well \nbefore this current VA scandal erupted. But I think that new context of \nthis national VA scandal makes bipartisan action on this and anything \nelse we can agree on more necessary than ever. So I again urge all of \nmy colleagues to come together to get this simple but important work \ndone and to continue to work on all of the other very necessary changes \nwe need at the VA.\n  In terms of these 27 outpatient clinics, there is no disagreement \nabout this. A bill has been passed through the House--with one \ndissenting vote--to get this done. It sits in the well of the Senate. \nThere is no objection to the merits of the bill as long as we add one \nperfecting amendment that has been worked out with every Member of the \nSenate. There is no substantive objection to that. However, it has been \nheld up and objected to by Senator Sanders, the head of the veterans \ncommittee, purely because he wants to use it as leverage to pass his \nmuch broader veterans bill on a host of other topics.\n  As I have said many times before, those other topics are very \nimportant. Those broader topics have only been underscored in the last \nfew weeks with this developing VA scandal. We need to address many \nareas, but we shouldn't hold veterans hostage and we shouldn't hold up \nprogress in any area we can agree on simply to create a hostage to try \nto forge movement in these other areas.\n  In fact, in terms of that general proposition, I think Senator \nSanders agreed with me. Back on November 19 of 2013, Senator Sanders \nadopted and endorsed this approach with regard to other matters. There \nwas another set of work on other veterans issues, and issues were \nworked out so that a specific proposal could move forward by unanimous \nconsent. Senator Sanders came to the floor and basically said: Yes, \nlet's agree on what we can agree on. Let's move forward with what we \ncan move forward on.\n  I am happy to tell you that I think that was a concern of his.\n  He was speaking about another Senator on this other veterans issue.\n\n       We got that UC'd last night. So we moved that pretty \n     quickly, and I want to try to do those things. Where we have \n     agreement, let's move it.\n\n  Senator Sanders was urging us, particularly in the context of the \noverall VA scandal and VA mess: Let's start acting. And where we have \nagreement, let's move it.\n  We are not going to solve every veterans problem in one bill \novernight, but we can start. A bite at a time, a step at a time, we can \nstart to do positive work, and these 27 clinics in 18 States are very \npositive, very concrete.\n  So where we have agreement--and we have complete agreement in this \narea--``let's move it''--a direct quote from Senator Sanders from late \nlast year. I am sorry to say that Senator Sanders is not allowing us to \nmove it. We have absolute agreement on the substance of these clinics. \nWe can call that bill off the calendar right now. We can put the \nperfecting amendment on it. There is absolutely universal agreement on \nthe substance of that bill with that amendment. But we are not moving \nit, apparently because he wants to use that as some sort of leverage \nfor other VA proposals. I want to work on those proposals, but where we \nhave agreement, let's move it.\n  Veterans want us to come together in a bipartisan way. They want us \nto act not in a month or a year, not after more and more studies, they \nwant us to start to act now where we can, where we have agreement.\n  I think it is very important that we act. It is very important that \nwe do so in a bipartisan way. This is one focused area where that is \npossible immediately, today, so I urge us all to do that.\n  There are other areas where we need to act. Senator Sanders is in \ndiscussions with many of us, being led on the Republican side by \nSenators Burr and McCain. I hope that broader agreement comes together. \nI hope it comes together very soon. I have been assured by both sides--\nby Senator Sanders on the Democratic side and Senators Burr and McCain \non the Republican side--that certainly this clinic issue will be \nincluded in any such agreement. But let's come together here and now \nwhere we have agreement--and we do on these clinics. Let's act for \nveterans as soon as we can, and we can right now with regard to these \nclinics.\n  I urge us to adopt that positive, commonsense approach: Act where we \nhave agreement, immediately. Build consensus and continue to work on \nthose areas where there is continuing discussion, and act and build \nagreement and build consensus as quickly as we can in those other \nareas. I urge us to do that as soon as we can, wherever we can, \nwhenever we can, and that can start today--if Senator Sanders will let \nus--with regard to these 27 expanded outpatient clinics in 18 States.\n  I see Senator Heller has joined us on the floor, and I will defer to \nhim. I look forward to the comments of Senators Rubio and Inhofe as \nwell about the broader veteran and VA challenges as well as this \nspecific clinics issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I first wish to thank my good friend from \nLouisiana for putting together a proposal that would ultimately \nincrease\n\n[[Page S3413]]\n\nveterans access to care. As does he, I believe our veterans are \nentitled to a VA system that provides them with the services they were \npromised--not only promised but to receive them in a timely manner. As \nmy colleague from Louisiana mentioned, I support his efforts to \nauthorize 27 VA clinics, and I cannot understand why the Senate is not \nacting on this commonsense proposal.\n  I would also like to thank my other friends; for example, Senator \nRubio from Florida, who is fighting to bring some sort of \naccountability to the VA. His bipartisan, bicameral proposal is a much \nneeded step in the right direction to give the VA the tools to fire VA \nexecutives who are not doing their jobs.\n  Unfortunately, after talking extensively with veterans in Nevada, I \nbelieve these problems of management, of accountability, and of \nefficiency extend well beyond the Veterans Health Administration. The \nVeterans Benefits Administration continues to struggle to eliminate the \nveterans disability claims backlog as it operates in what I consider to \nbe a 1940s system here in the 21st century. There are more than 3,600 \nveterans in Nevada and nearly 300,000 nationwide who are stuck in a VA \ndisability claims backlog. My home State of Nevada has the longest wait \nin the Nation at 348 days for a claim to be processed.\n  What veterans need is for Congress to take action to reform a broken, \noutdated claims-processing system. That is why Senator Casey and I came \ntogether a year ago to address this issue with a targeted approach to \nfix the claims process. So here is what we introduced. It is the ``VA \nBacklog Working Group March 2014 Report.'' These solutions we are \nspeaking about are included in our 21st-century Veterans Benefit \nDelivery Act, which Senator Casey and I introduced in March.\n  Our legislation addresses three main areas of the claims process: \nsubmission, VA regional office practices, and the agency's response to \nVA requests. I recognize that the claims process is complex, and there \nis no silver bullet that will solve this problem, but the VA's current \nefforts will not eliminate this backlog.\n  I think my colleagues here today would agree this is a bipartisan \nissue. There isn't a Member of the Senate whose State is not impacted \nby the VA claims backlog. Yet this bipartisan legislation remains in \nthe backlog of bills yet to be considered by the Senate.\n  It is past time for Congress to give this issue the attention it \ndeserves. Congress needs to reform the VA and when doing so cannot \nignore the problems that plague its benefits administration.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to applaud the work of the Senator \nfrom Nevada and echo his sentiments. I am a member of this bipartisan \nworking group on the claims backlog. I am a coauthor of the bipartisan \nlegislation he helped spearhead, along with Senator Casey. It is \nanother very good example of a bipartisan consensus where we can act. \nWe can move it. So let's come together and let's act in a responsible, \nbipartisan way, and let's move it. That is what veterans want. That is \nwhat veterans tell me all across Louisiana. That is what the veterans \nservice organizations are saying.\n  This crisis demands action. It demands bipartisan action. This is an \narea where we can act now and act effectively. We should. The clinics I \nspoke about are an area where we can act now and act effectively in a \nbipartisan way. We should.\n  I also applaud Senator Inhofe, who may be coming to the floor, for \nhis leadership on this clinics issue. We need to authorize those and \nmove on with them and get that done.\n  I also thank Senator Rubio, who will be speaking later about the \nlegislation he has that has already passed the House to give the \nleadership--the new leadership, thank goodness--of the VA the authority \nthey need to take dramatic action when necessary, to clean house when \nnecessary, and get people in place who are going to make a difference \nin that broken bureaucracy.\n  So let's act now, in a bipartisan way, where we can. Again, that is \nabsolutely possible in these areas, including these 27 outpatient \nclinics in 18 States, the 2 in Louisiana that I discussed.\n\n  We have complete agreement in the Senate on the substance of these \nclinics. We have legislation that has already passed the House. So \nplease, Senator Sanders, release your obstacle, release your blockade. \nLet's move forward. Let's agree where we can agree. Let's act where we \ncan act, here and now, and continue to work on those other vital areas \nwhere we also need agreement.\n  There is a common saying: Time is money. Well, in terms of what we \nare talking about, time can be lost lives. We have seen cases of that, \ndocumented cases of that with regard to veterans who were waiting for \nso long they died. Time in health care can be lost lives.\n  This past week, as I traveled in Louisiana, I had a townhall meeting \nin New Orleans, among other places, and a New Orleans police officer--a \nfemale police officer--came and told me about the case of her father \nwho, because of a lack of attention and time lapsed in the VA system, \ndied, literally died directly related to that. Her name is Gwen Moity \nNolan, and although she has lost her father, she wants to make sure \nthat does not happen to any other veteran's family, that what happened \nto Richard Moity does not happen to others. Her case was looked at by \nthe VA, and they admitted fault, they admitted negligence, and they \nactually reached a substantial settlement with her over their lack of \nattention to her father. But she really wants to make sure that does \nnot happen to any other veteran's family. She came to me pleading: Can \nyou make sure they have taken the necessary steps to fix those problems \nin the New Orleans VA?\n  So I have written to the VA and said: I want to see the results of \nthat investigation with regard to Richard Moity. You say you have taken \ncorrective action? I want to understand exactly what that corrective \naction is.\n  Time is money? No. In this case, time can be lost lives--the life of \nRichard Moity, the lives of veterans in Arizona, the lives of veterans \naround the country for whom inattention, delay, and lack of \nresponsiveness in the VA system meant lost lives.\n  So let's not delay here in the Senate. Where we have agreement, let's \nmove, let's act. We have agreement on these clinics. We have agreement \non action to address the VA backlog Senator Heller talked about. Let's \nact. Let's move because delay can lead to serious consequences in \nhealth care, even the loss of life.\n  I thank Senators Inhofe and Rubio, who may be coming to the floor \nlater to talk about these issues, for their determined work. I look \nforward to moving on this issue. I look forward to Senator Sanders \nhopefully reaching agreement on a broader set of proposals, including \nthis clinics issue, in the very near future, and if not, I will be back \nto the floor demanding action on these clinics within a few days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy relating to the introduction of S. 2428 are \nprinted in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not see anybody seeking recognition, \nso I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here for the 69th straight \nconsecutive week that the Senate has been in session to try to wake us \nup to the harm that carbon pollution causes to our oceans, to our \ncommunities, to our ecosystem, and to our health.\n  The effects of climate change are all around us, from melting \nglaciers in our national parks, to drought-stricken land across the \nAmerican Southwest, to rising seas along my eastern seaboard. In \nWashington, DC, the iconic cherry blossoms are blooming earlier. Snook, \nnative to South Florida, are being caught off the coast of Charleston; \ntarpon and grouper off the coast of Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S3414]]\n\n  This is all happening now--not tomorrow, not sometime in the distant \nfuture but now--right now. Projections show that it will get much worse \nin the coming years unless we wake up and take real action. Happily, \nthis week, the Environmental Protection Agency used its Clean Air Act \nauthority as established by Congress and affirmed by the Supreme Court \nto propose carbon pollution standards for the country's existing \npowerplants.\n  Before this, there were no carbon pollution limits--believe it or \nnot--none. As you can see on this chart, the 50 dirtiest U.S. \npowerplants--this is the whole U.S. powerplant fleet. These are the 50 \ndirtiest powerplants. They put out more carbon than Korea, which is a \npretty industrialized country. They put out more carbon than Canada, \nour neighbor to the north.\n  I congratulate the administration on developing these smart, sensible \nlimits that will put our Nation on a better path economically and on a \nbetter path environmentally. Thank you to the scientists, the \nengineers, the staffers, the attorneys, and the experts who invested so \nmuch time and energy in developing this historic standard. Through an \nunprecedented public engagement, EPA held more than 300 public \nmeetings, working with stakeholders of all kinds and all across the \npolitical spectrum.\n  The result: EPA has put the States in the driver's seat to come up \nwith their own plans to meet State-specific targets. States and power \ncompanies will have a wide variety of options to achieve carbon \nreductions, like boosting renewable energy, establishing energy savings \ntargets, investing in efficiency or joining one of the existing cap-\nand-trade programs. States can develop plans that create jobs, plans \nthat cut electricity cost by boosting efficiency, plans that achieve \nmajor pollution reduction.\n  What is not to like? Already, a diverse array of groups support the \nnew EPA pollution standard. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in \na letter to Administrator McCarthy wrote: ``These standards should \nprotect the health and welfare of all people, especially children, the \nelderly, as well as poor and vulnerable communities, from harmful \npollution emitted from power plants and from the impacts of climate \nchange.''\n  The Catholic bishops went on to point out that ``the best evidence \nindicates that power plants are the largest stationary source of carbon \nemissions in the United States, and a major contributor to climate \nchange.''\n  We are also hearing from 600 State and local elected officials who \nrecently sent a letter to the President in support of the EPA plan. \nThese are the mayors, council members, and State legislators for whom \nclimate change is a day-to-day reality at home right there in their \ncommunities.\n  The letter is signed by officials from both red States and blue, \nincluding Texas, Iowa, Arizona, and the ground zero of climate change \nin this country, the State of Florida. The business community has \nweighed in. Over 125 companies including American giants like Nike, \nLevi's, and Starbucks sent a letter of support for the new rule.\n\n       Our support is firmly grounded in economic reality. The new \n     standards will reinforce what leading companies already know: \n     climate change poses real financial risks and substantial \n     economic opportunities and we must act now.\n\n  VF Corporation is an American apparel manufacturer in North Carolina \nwhose brands include North Face, Timberland, Wrangler, and many others. \n``As a company that makes innovative apparel and footwear for people \nwho love the outdoors, we know how important addressing climate change \nis to our consumers, and therefore, our business,'' said Letitia \nWebster, VF's director of global sustainability. ``Today's rules \nprovide the long-term certainty that VF needs to continue to invest in \nclean energy solutions so that we can do our part to reduce the impacts \nof climate change.''\n  Major utilities are behind the new rule. Tom King, the President of \nNational Grid, which serves my home State of Rhode Island, said:\n\n       The Obama administration, through the good work of EPA \n     Administrator Gina McCarthy and her staff has worked in a \n     transparent manner to craft regulation that promotes \n     environmental and human health through a host of clean energy \n     options. Rather than picking winners, this proposed rule \n     supports market-based solutions.\n\n  Major public health groups agree. Here is what Harold Wimmer, \nnational president and CEO of the American Lung Association had to say: \n``For the 147 million--nearly half of all Americans--already living in \nareas with unhealthy levels of ozone or particle pollution, curbing \ncarbon pollution emissions is a critical step forward for protecting \npublic health from the impacts of climate change happening today.''\n  As widespread and broad as the support is for this rule, not everyone \nis applauding. Big polluters have enjoyed a long and happy holiday from \nresponsibility for the carbon pollution they have dumped into our \natmosphere and oceans. This free pollution they have enjoyed emitting \nis a market failure, a market failure recognized even by groups as \nconservative as the American Enterprise Institute--a market failure \nwhich allowed these polluters to dump billions of dollars in costs and \nharm on their fellow Americans.\n  They did this to their fellow Americans without apparent shame or \nregret, and they are fighting desperately to preserve this loophole. \nThey do not want you to know that we can achieve these reductions \nresponsibly. They do not want you to know that we can do this and help \nour economy. Indeed, before the proposed rule was even available to \nexamine, the climate deniers at the so-called U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nsaid it would cost electricity customers hundreds of billions of \ndollars and zap the U.S. economy of tens of billions in GDP and \nhundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  Do not believe it. These claims are exaggerated at best and flat out \nfalse at worst. Do not just take my word for it. Republicans, citing \nthe chamber's report--of course some of our colleagues jumped to cite \nthat report. When they did, they earned a PolitiFact ``false'' and four \nPinocchios from the Washington Post fact checker.\n  The problem with the big polluters is that they only look at one side \nof the ledger. They ignore the costs of carbon pollution on the rest of \nus. These costs are real. People see them in their lives, in real lives \nat home in our communities--damage to coastal homes, roads, and \nbusinesses from rising seas and erosion; asthma attacks in children \ntriggered by smog, sending them to the emergency room; forests dying \nfrom beetle infestations and swept by unprecedented wildfire seasons; \nfarms ravaged by worsened drought and flooding. Our side of the ledger \ncounts too.\n\n  If the big polluters were accountants and they filed financial \nstatements that only looked at one side of the ledger, they would go to \nprison. But this is politics, so without consequence or shame or \nregret, they ignore the harm they cause the rest of us.\n  If the Chamber of Commerce and the big polluters want to talk about \njobs, let's not forget about the jobs they hurt by their carbon \npollution. Fishermen in Rhode Island have seen their winter flounder \ncatch nearly disappear in recent decades as the water temperature in \nour Narragansett Bay has risen 3 to 4 degrees. That is an ecosystem \nshift for these species.\n  Actually, there are now more jobs in clean, green energy than in oil \nand gas, more jobs in solar than in coal mining.\n  This rule is a job creator in innovation and clean energy. The \npolluters just won't count that side of the ledger.\n  It is an old story: tobacco, seatbelts in cars, acid rain, lead \npaint, ozone depletion, and more. Same old strategy: Muddle the \nscience, manufacture doubt, manufacture cost, exaggerate the costs, and \nignore the economic benefits.\n  The Clean Air Act, according to a 2011 EPA assessment, will benefit \nAmericans more than it costs by a ratio of 30 to 1, $30 of value in \npreventing hospital visits and premature deaths, avoiding missed work \nand school days, improving environmental quality, helping people live \nhealthier, more productive lives--$30 of value to Americans for every \n$1 they had to pay in cleanup costs.\n  Opponents of clean air standards have been proven wrong time and \nagain. Here is the bottom line: Excessive carbon pollution is bad for \nour health, bad for our environment, and bad for our economy, even bad \nfor our\n\n[[Page S3415]]\n\nnational security, if you read the Department of Defense's own \nQuadrennial Defense Reviews.\n  The largest source of carbon pollution in the United States is \npowerplants. Until now there were no limits on the carbon pollution \nthese plants could spew into our atmosphere and oceans. This week \nchanges that. If the big polluters don't like the change, many of us \nwill work with them on a legislative alternative. Perhaps as many \nRepublicans support an economywide price on carbon pollution, which \ncould generate a financial benefit for taxpayers and even provide \ntransition assistance to affected industries. But they can't just keep \ndumping their pollution on the rest of us. Doing so might be free for \nthem, but the costs are too high for us. Their long holiday from \nresponsibility has to come to an end. It is time for them to wake up.\n  A number of my Republican colleagues have come to the Senate floor to \nrespond to the administration's proposal. Those of us seeking to stave \noff the worst effects of climate change welcome this opportunity to \nengage in a bipartisan discussion on the challenges of climate change.\n  In the past, Republican colleagues have coauthored and voted for \nbipartisan climate change legislation. They have spoken out in favor of \na carbon fee and, of course, our Republican colleagues represent States \nsuch as Florida that are every bit at risk from the effects of climate \nchange as States represented by Democrats. So we think our Republican \ncolleagues could have a lot to offer if they wish to join us in \nexploring solutions.\n  A number of us have requested that time after votes on Monday, June \n9, next Monday, be reserved for us to engage in a robust, bipartisan \nexchange of views about carbon pollution. We invite all our colleagues, \nRepublican and Democrats, to join us then on the floor. We hope to find \nthe Republican Party in the Senate is not a uniform monolith of climate \ndenial.\n  We earnestly believe the costs of failing to exercise American \nleadership and solve this carbon pollution problem are very high, \nterribly high, with ramifications for our health, safety, economic \nwell-being, our food and water supplies, and our national security and \nstanding.\n  I look forward to a vigorous discussion on Monday. I hope my \ncolleagues show up.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Today I would like to discuss the nomination of Sylvia \nBurwell to be Secretary of Health and Human Services. I am going to \nmake some criticisms of her performance and the background she lacks in \ntaking on this huge agency.\n  I have met with her, worked with her some as OMB Director. I like \nher, and she is courteous and capable, so I am not talking personally \nin any bad way about her, but this is an important agency, one of the \nmost important agencies in our Nation. The Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services oversees several of the largest programs in the entire \nFederal Government. Crucially, the Secretary is also the person tasked \nwith implementing the President's health care law. It is essential that \nanyone who fills this position possess great skill, relevant \nexperience, proven managerial experience, and who will act with \nindependence and in the best interests of the American public--one who, \nat this critical time, puts country over politics. They cannot be a \npolitical loyalist, but they must be someone of stature, integrity, and \nsound judgment who is willing to tell the President no if asked to \ncircumvent the law, provide false information, or otherwise act against \nthe public interest.\n  From the President's own perspective, he needs desperately someone \nwho is able to evaluate these major programs such as ObamaCare with \nwisdom and tell him and help him--and particularly tell the American \npeople the truth.\n  Ms. Burwell does not have the background one associates with a \nposition of this magnitude. She just does not. Nor does she possess the \nspecific skills critically needed today. The OMB office she now holds \nhas 500 employees. HHS has 72,000.\n  Aside from her short tenure at the Office of Management and Budget, \nwhich has just been 13 months, she is just now beginning to find her \nway around, presumably, that office. She has never run any major \ndepartment, any major health care department, a department or an \nagency, a major business, a significant city, or a State. There are \nmany very capable people in this country who would be much more ready \nto assume the august responsibilities of this job.\n  It appears her most significant health care role prior to this was \nserving as a board member--part-time board member--of a local \nuniversity medical center.\n  In fact, 2 months ago in a Budget Committee hearing, Ms. Burwell \ndeclined to answer a basic health care question until she said she \nwould seek Secretary Sebelius's expertise on the matter, but she never \nprovided that answer anyway.\n  Her time as Director of the Office of Management and Budget was \ncontroversial. The budget plan she submitted to Congress plainly \nviolated the spending caps Congress and the President agreed to and \npassed into law. She produced a budget plan that would increase \nspending by nearly $791 billion over 10 years. That is above the Ryan-\nMurray agreement that passed in Congress that set these spending limits \njust a few weeks before, including, in that budget, a proposal to \nincrease spending by $56 billion over the budget next year.\n  As the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, I have been \ninvolved in this and observing it. To my dismay, she went to enormous \nlengths during her testimony before the committee to try to conceal \nthis increase in spending. It was very amazing to me.\n  On the day the President's budget was submitted, the Associated Press \nreported that the plan Ms. Burwell authored ``lays waste to the \nspending caps that the White House and Congress agreed to late last \nyear.''\n  Also at the same time The Hill reported the budget this way--Obama's \n``$3.9T budget busts spending limits.''\n  Remember, Ms. Burwell was the Director of Office of Management and \nBudget. Her staff produces the budget and defended the budget.\n  It goes on to say in the first paragraph the truth of the situation \nin The Hill. The article is by Erik Wasson.\n\n       President Obama on Tuesday released a $3.9 trillion \n     election-year budget blueprint that would bust the bipartisan \n     budget ceiling agreed to in December with $56 billion in new \n     stimulus spending.\n\n  This was 10 weeks after they had agreed to one level of spending. She \nwalks in and produces a budget that is $700-, $800 billion almost more \nin spending over the budget of 10 years, and $56 billion more the next \nyear.\n  When I asked her about that, apparently it was politically sensitive. \nApparently they had decided they didn't want to admit they were \nspending more money. The Associated Press says they did. Politico said \nthey did. The budget they submitted that was in law--laid before the \nBudget Committee--plainly demonstrated it spent more than they agreed \nto spend.\n  I asked her about it. It went something like this. It was a very long \nexchange. It was frustrating for me. I will quote from some of them, \nbecause I think we need to understand these issues. I asked her about \nthe spending excess:\n\n       Mr. SESSIONS. So you're proposing that we alter Ryan-Murray \n     [that is the law that set new spending limits, allowed more \n     spending than we previously agreed to, but it continued to \n     set some limits] so you can spend $56 billion more next year \n     alone. Yes or no; is that correct?\n       Ms. BURWELL. We propose a paid-for [initiative] . . .\n       Mr. SESSIONS. Can't you answer that question simply? Yes or \n     no? Do you propose to spend $56 billion more than Ryan-Murray \n     allows?\n       Ms. BURWELL. Senator, we do propose a change in the law \n     that would be fully paid for that would invest in things that \n     we believe are necessary for the economic health of the \n     nation.\n       Mr. SESSIONS. Do you want to spend more than the President \n     agreed to when he signed the Ryan-Murray 10 weeks ago?\n       Ms. BURWELL. Senator, we signed Ryan-Murray . . .\n\n[[Page S3416]]\n\n       Mr. SESSIONS. Now, I'm just asking, yes or no; are you \n     [spending] more or less?\n       Ms. BURWELL. Senator, I think there are some questions that \n     are not simply yes or no questions . . .\n       Mr. SESSIONS. This one is a yes or no question. You're \n     refusing to answer it . . .\n\n  I simply asked a public servant who is paid by the taxpayers: Are you \nspending more money than the Ryan-Murray budget had agreed to and the \nPresident signed? And she refused to answer. It was really frustrating. \nBut I think it is indicative of the fact that they were allowing \npolitics to interject itself here--because the White House didn't want \nto admit, and she stood up for the White House and wouldn't admit it. \nBut, as Politico says, it plainly was true that they were spending \nmore.\n  So rather than acting as an independent steward of taxpayer dollars \nand simply telling the plain truth to a simple question, she acted as \nan extension of the President's campaign arm--advancing their spin \nwithout honestly acknowledging the clear and plain facts to the \nAmerican public asked by a representative of the people of the United \nStates. There was no doubt that they spent more money than Ryan-Murray \nwould allow, but they never acknowledged it because she politically did \nnot want to admit it.\n  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is more than a \npolitical position. The Director serves the President, yes, but it is \nat bottom an important public servant, and the person who holds that \njob must act as a disciplined manager of taxpayers' dollars and do so \nwith clarity and openness. The Director is managing the world's largest \nbudget.\n  However, Ms. Burwell submitted a financial plan--a budget--that would \nhave increased spending more than $700 billion above the current, \nagreed-upon, in-law budget levels while, amazingly, suggesting her plan \nreduced spending. It was a tax-and-spend budget that would have added \n$8 trillion to our debt while doing virtually nothing to reform the \nentitlement programs heading for impending insolvency. It completely \nbusted the budget law the President signed. It was a grossly \nirresponsible plan.\n  According to Ms. Burwell's own budget submission, the plan would have \ncaused interest payments on the debt to nearly quadruple, from $221 \nbillion in interest paid last year alone to more than $800 billion 10 \nyears from now. So this is really a serious matter. There is no attempt \nto balance the budget in her plan even over 10 years. Indeed, it flatly \nrejected the very idea of a balanced budget.\n  Additionally, despite her public commitment during her confirmation \nthat she would deliver the budget in accordance with the legal \ndeadlines, the President's budget was again delivered more than a month \nlate.\n  Importantly, Ms. Burwell failed to comply with Federal law requiring \nher to submit Medicare improvement legislation after the Medicare \ntrustees issued their funding warning. Medicare is heading to financial \nruin. The law says that if Medicare reaches a point where its future is \nfinancially in doubt, it must notify the President, and the President, \nthrough his Office of Management and Budget Director, is supposed to \nsubmit to Congress a plan to get Medicare off the path to disaster. It \nwas submitted to President Bush. He submitted a plan to Congress to fix \nMedicare. But this President has steadfastly refused to do so, and so \ndid Mrs. Burwell as his Office of Management and Budget Director.\n  It states that within 2 weeks of the budget submission, legislation \nmust be sent to Congress to comply with this so-called Medicare \ntrigger. It requires a plan to fix the program. During her confirmation \nas OMB Director, she was asked about this duty she was going to have, \nand she made a commitment to respond and produce the Medicare trigger. \nSpecifically, she said she would ``do everything in her power'' to \ncomply with the Federal law, bringing an end, in effect, to the \nadministration's several-years-long defiance of plain law.\n  As the President's Budget Director, under 31 USC, 1105, Sylvia \nBurwell was the person responsible for complying with the Federal law. \nHaving willfully violated this requirement, it is ironic now that, if \nconfirmed as Health and Human Services Secretary, she will serve on the \nboard of trustees of the Medicare trust fund, she will be responsible \nfor overseeing their finances, and she will be issuing to her former \noffice--OMB--the same funding warnings that the administration received \nand ignored while she served as budget director.\n  Ms. Burwell has also violated law and denied Congress needed \ntransparency with respect to the President's troubled health care law. \nSpecifically, the Omnibus appropriations bill signed into law in \nJanuary required HHS to include in its fiscal year 2015 budget a \ndetailed accounting of spending to implement the health law. Fair \nenough. But neither the budget Ms. Burwell delivered nor the agency \njustification that later joined it satisfied the requirements set in \nlaw. They should do that. They are public servants. They should tell us \nhow to handle the problems of financing in health care law.\n  As OMB Director--the budget submitted to the Congress by Ms. Burwell \nreclassified the budgetary treatment of the ObamaCare risk corridor \nprogram without statutory authority to do so. Under this approach, it \nappears HHS attempts to escape congressional accountability for its use \nof certain funds. So this is a clear violation of the congressional \npower to appropriate money, and it is pretty clear that to fund this \nprogram they are going to have to ask Congress to fund it. But by \nmoving this around, they are attempting to spend money without asking \nCongress to appropriate it--against the Constitution.\n\n  Regrettably, it seems Ms. Burwell followed a consistent pattern. \nRather than using OMB as the central agency to reform this massive, \nout-of-control spending government, to stop wasteful spending and tame \nthe debt--as former OMB Directors such as Mitch Daniels and Rob Portman \ndid; now-Senator Portman submitted a balanced budget when he was OMB \nDirector under President Bush--she has not submitted any reforms to \nbring our government under control in OMB.\n  One of the concerns I had about her appointment was that it is such a \ncritical part of our government, we have to have a strong OMB Director \nto control this massive government and control wasteful spending. That \nis the President's right arm. That is the person who brings the Cabinet \nSecretaries in to say: You are spending money. I hear complaints about \nwaste. I hear about duplication. The President wants you to fix this.\n  We saw none of that under her leadership. Her tenure at OMB evidenced \nno drive to even tackle the magnitude of our financial challenges. She \nproposed to bust the spending caps that Congress and the President \nagreed while trying to suggest otherwise. She ignored the Medicare \ntrigger. She tried to put a positive spin on a dangerous financial plan \ninstead of trying to actually solve the serious financial challenges \nfacing our country today.\n  With ObamaCare in chaos and disarray, threatening the very economy \nand the health care of Americans by the millions, what we desperately \nneed in this key position is someone who will be independent, \nforthright, and honest, someone who will resist political pressure from \nthe White House, and someone who knows what they are doing. This \nposition demands that we find one of the best and most respected health \ncare experts in the world. That is what we should be looking for. Ms. \nBurwell, as nice as she is, sadly, is just not that person. She does \nnot have those skills.\n  ObamaCare was passed into law on a series of egregious falsehoods. \nThe American people intuitively recognized that this was an overreach \nand would not work, and the American people are now paying the steepest \nof prices for this complex, failed piece of legislation. One of the \nfalsehoods was that it would not add to the debt--not a dime, the \nPresident said. Well, we now know it would add more than $6 trillion to \nthe long-term debt of the United States. That is a huge amount of \nmoney.\n  A Secretary of Health and Human Services must tell the American \npeople the truth about the law's finances. If they fail to do so, if \nthe Secretary will not acknowledge the truth and the challenges that \nour finances face, then the entire future, financially, of America will \nbe at risk.\n  So I believe Ms. Burwell is a good and well-meaning person. Senators \nManchin and Rockefeller from West\n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\nVirginia like her, and Senator Wyden of the Finance Committee and I \nlike her. But I cannot support her bid to control the health care \nfuture of millions of hard-working Americans by placing her in charge \nof this massive agency that so desperately needs mature, aggressive, \nstrong leadership--somebody who understands these issues before they \ntake the job. I will vote no on her nomination as Secretary of Health \nand Human Services.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Warren pertaining to the introduction of S. 2432 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. WARREN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                          Concern for Veterans\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, during Memorial Day and last week, I spent \nmuch of the time traveling Ohio with Michael Fairman, a retired Navy \ncorpsman and a Columbus resident, who served with the Marines in \nAfghanistan from 2007 to 2011. His son Zack is a third-generation Navy \ncorpsman serving with the Marine Corps First Tank Battalion deployed in \nthe Middle East.\n  Based on his own combat experiences and his concern for other \nveterans and the suicide of a friend, a fellow veteran, Mr. Fairman \ncame to my office with an idea of how we can help both servicemembers \nand veterans--veterans like Alexander Powell, a student at the \nUniversity of Toledo who joined us in Northwest Ohio. Mr. Powell was \ndeployed in Iraq in 2006 when his gun truck was struck by an IED. He \nhad no physical or visible injuries. He went back to duty the next day, \nbut he began experiencing blackouts and dizzy spells. It wasn't until \n2009 that he was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and \nhospitalized to begin treatment.\n  Mr. Powell is not alone. The VA reports that some 300,000 veterans \nstruggle with post-traumatic stress. The Defense Department reports \nthat out of 300,000 TBI injuries, there are 25,000 cases of what they \ncall mild traumatic brain injuries because mild TBI is an invisible \ninjury. Think of an NFL player getting a concussion or a series of \nconcussions over a period of a career. Think of a soldier getting what \na number of soldiers said to me--marines and air men and women and \nsoldiers and sailors talk about getting their ``bell rung'' when they \nget a head injury. It is an injury that is not serious enough for an \nNFL player to sit down, not serious enough for a soldier to be sent \nhome, perhaps not serious enough for a soldier to get any medical \ntreatment at all, but one of a series of concussive events of invisible \nor minor head injuries can lead to problems a number of years later.\n  So when veterans or servicemembers seek service-connected \ndisabilities for related injuries, they often don't have the necessary \ndocuments needed to establish the connection between their military \nservice and their claim with the VA. That was the case for Mr. Powell. \nHe told me last week:\n\n       It was my job [after returning home] to gather up any proof \n     that I had to show that my truck was hit by an IED and gather \n     statements from people who were there to corroborate my \n     story. That is a task, if not done immediately after the \n     incident, that is almost impossible to accomplish.\n\n  So 5 years, 6 years, 7 years later, Mr. Powell is back in Ohio trying \nto piece together the series of head injuries he sustained, what \nexactly happened, finding witnesses, his unit commander, and comrades \nto be able to prove to the VA that his disability is earned and \nwarranted and trying to explain to his doctor what his head injuries \nmight have entailed. The burden is on the veteran to provide the VA \nwith information establishing the connection between their claim and \ntheir service. This can lead to denied claims. It can lead to improper \nmedical care. It increases the disability claims backlog.\n  We are all concerned--even though the VA has shrunk that backlog by \n50 percent in the last year or so, we also know that one of the reasons \nfor the backlog at the VA is it takes so much more time for the VA \nemployee and the soldier to try to piece together the record of \ninjuries that might have taken place 5 years ago, a decade ago, a \ndecade and a half ago. That is why I introduced the Significant Event \nTracker Act, which Mr. Fairman helped to create. This bill will improve \nthe claims process for veterans and servicemembers. Mr. Fairman visited \na number of House and Senate offices. The only one who responded was \nactually Senator Cornyn's office, from Texas. He and I have talked \nabout this bill, and we both understand how important this can be to \nveterans. Let me explain the bill.\n  First, it would allow unit commanders to document events, such as a \nroadside bombing, that each servicemember in their command is exposed \nto and which might later be connected to these ``invisible injuries.''\n  Second, recording this information on an individual basis will help \nmilitary medical officers better diagnose and treat military members \nwho have mental health concerns.\n  Finally, for veterans and military retirees, this act will help them \nfile better initial claims--claims with supporting documentation from \nDOD. In other words, veterans should be able to focus on their \nrecovery, not on having to prove the cause of their injury.\n  Let me say that again. A soldier going to the VA in Dayton, OH, or \nCincinnati or to a veterans clinic in Mansfield should be able to focus \non her recovery and not having to prove the cause of her injury. This \nbill puts the responsibility on the Army, on the Marines, on the \nDefense Department, not on the veteran, to track and connect \nsignificant events to individual servicemembers that would later \npotentially lead to post-traumatic stress or to traumatic brain injury. \nCommanders already report major injuries. We want commanders to report \nabout individual servicemembers who were involved in any kind of a \nminor or ``invisible'' head injury.\n  This was a big idea that came to me from Michael Fairman. He visited \na number of Senate offices and House offices. Senator Cornyn showed \ninterest in it. My office has written the legislation with Michael \nFairman. This Nation is rightfully proud of our veterans. This idea \ncame from a veteran. This idea deserves to be seriously entertained by \nthis Senate and, frankly, by the Defense Department, if we can work \nwith them, on finding ways to implement some of these ideas.\n\n\n                  25th Anniversary of Tiananmen Square\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to commemorate an event that happened 25 years \nago today not just in Beijing, China, but in other places in China when \nmillions of people across that country, in Tiananmen Square and other \nplaces, rallied in support of democracy, human rights, and an end to \nofficial corruption.\n  Like many Americans, I was inspired. At the time, I wasn't a Member \nof Congress. Living in Ohio, I was inspired by the courage and pursuit \nof individual fundamental freedoms--freedoms that we hold dear in this \ncountry and sometimes take for granted, that are not always granted in \nother countries around the world. I recall the optimism of that moment \nand how it was crushed when the tanks rolled in.\n  Today we assess what the last 25 years meant to the Chinese but also, \nmore importantly, to U.S.-China relations and what our policy should \nbe. China has made tremendous leaps forward in the past 40 years since \nnormalization, but following Tiananmen Square we have missed \nopportunity after opportunity to integrate China into the global rule-\nbased community of nations to protect our economic interests and to \nmove China in the right direction on political reform.\n  It is not an easy task, but 25 years later China is still \nfundamentally undemocratic. It too often refuses to play by the rules--\nrules that would benefit China short term and long term. The question \nnow is whether China will address the challenge facing it or will it \ncontinue to take a more doctrinaire and hardline stance, one that \nundermines the progress China has made and, because of China's \ninfluence, could undermine the global system and regional stability.\n  In many respects China has reaped the benefits of open trade with the \nrest of the world while avoiding many of its obligations. Our trade \ndeficit with China at the time of Tiananmen Square 25 years ago stood \nat $6 billion; that is, we bought from China $6 billion in goods more \nthan we sold to China. Last year it grew to 50 times that\n\n[[Page S3418]]\n\namount--$318 billion--the highest ever. That means almost every single \nday of the year on the average, every single day of the year, we buy \nfrom China $900 million more in goods than we sell to China. That trade \ndeficit and China's currency manipulation has cost Americans millions \nof jobs and significantly reduced our Federal budget.\n  I know what unbalanced, unfair, and not playing on a level playing \nfield trade with China has done to places such as Springfield, OH, \nMarion, OH, and Chillicothe and Lima, and my hometown of Mansfield, and \nRavenna, OH, all over my State, all over the Midwest, all over the \ncountry. In the end, we compromised as a nation too much. We bought \ninto the myth that China's economic integration after Tiananmen Square \nwould bring about human rights and respect for the United States and \ninternational rules. That is not what has happened.\n  Through the commission I chair, the Congressional Executive \nCommission on China, we have tried to honor the memory of Tiananmen \nSquare by making sure that China's obligations toward human rights and \nthe rule of law are not forgotten.\n  The commission highlighted many concerns: cyber theft threats to \ndemocracy in Hong Kong, illegal, unfair trade practices, denial of \nvisas, or threats of denial of visas to foreign journalists, food \nsafety, environmental, and public health concerns, a crackdown on human \nrights activists, including Ilham Tohti, a peaceful activist for the \nUyghur minority group in Tibet.\n  It is my hope we have an open and transparent debate about our China \npolicy. Whether it be on trade agreements, where we continue to be on \nthe short end every single year, or whether it is about growing Chinese \nforeign investment in this country, this debate must be given proper \nweight rather than ignoring our concerns over human rights, the rule of \nlaw, labor, public health, and the environment.\n  Above all, the debate about U.S. policy toward China must include all \nsegments of our society and not the way we typically do trade \nagreements in this country, supported by newspaper publishers, \neconomists at Harvard, but not fundamentally supported by the American \npeople and the public.\n  Our workers and small businesses need to be included, NGOs and human \nrights groups, instead of being led by powerful interest groups such as \nlarge corporations. Debate needs to be inclusive and it needs to draw \non the interests and aspirations of all parts of American society.\n  More must be done as we honor 25 years in the memory of Tiananmen \nSquare. The world must continue to seek improvements on China's record \nof human rights and the rule of law. More must be done. Only by \nrecognizing the legitimate aspirations of its people and the \nobligations of the international system can China assume the role to \nfit its history and its size.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Freedom of Speech\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in the wake of some recent Supreme Court \ndecisions touching on our system of campaign finance, there has arisen \nin the Senate, frankly, this bizarre notion that we are going to amend \nthe Constitution to undo the Bill of Rights, and particularly the First \nAmendment and its protection of the freedom of speech.\n  Of course, the proponents don't describe it that way. To hear the \nmajority leader, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nyesterday, he said: They are merely trying to keep what he called dark \nmoney out of American politics.\n  By giving Congress the ability to regulate political speech and the \nmeans by which that is paid for and disseminated, this amendment would \ninvite all manner of partisan mischief and abuses and effectively \ndismantle one of the most fundamental liberties secured by our \nConstitution which makes America the envy of the world, and in many \nways unique in that we protect freedom of speech without regard to the \ncontent of the speech and without regard to the identity of the \nspeaker, whether they be rich, poor, or a member of the middle class. \nWhether that opinion is informed or not necessarily well-informed, we \nbelieve in the marketplace of ideas where the American people are the \nonly judge as to what they believe the truth is. We don't try to stifle \nor squelch speakers, particularly in the political process.\n  As our good friend the Republican leader said yesterday:\n\n       If incumbent politicians were in charge of political \n     speech, a majority could design the rules to benefit itself \n     and diminish its opponents. And when roles reversed, you \n     could expect a new majority to try to disadvantage the other \n     half of the country. And on it would go.\n\n  So this power the majority leader has proposed in amending the \nConstitution so Congress could regulate political speech could be an \ninstrument of incumbent protection where the party in power could use \nthat as a weapon against the minority trying to persuade the country \nthat they should be restored to the majority rather than linger as a \nminority.\n  Is this really the kind of system our colleagues who are proposing \nthis constitutional amendment want? Well, you have to ask whether they \nhave any realistic belief that this will actually become law. And of \ncourse it would have to pass both Houses of the Congress by a two-\nthirds vote, and it would have to be ratified by three-quarters of the \nStates. I don't think it is an overstatement to say they have no chance \nof this becoming law.\n  Why in the world is such an outlandish proposal being made by \nsomebody such as the distinguished majority leader of the Senate and \nother folks in his party? Well, it is no exaggeration to say this \nproposed amendment would undermine American democracy as we know it, so \nthere has to be some other reason other than the substance of the \namendment they are trying to get at.\n  Lest we forget the whole purpose of the First Amendment is to ensure \nthat all political speech--as a matter of fact all speech, period--is \nprotected from government interference, and that is why it is in the \nBill of Rights, at the time our country was founded there was a serious \ndebate about whether we needed an explicit Bill of Rights or whether \nthe very structure of our government with its checks and balances and \nour shared power between the judicial, executive, and legislative \nbranches would itself provide that protection. But the Federalists \nsaid, no, we are not going to settle for that. We want an explicit \nprotection of those rights that are not derived from government but \nwhich precede government--which don't come from government but come \nfrom our Creator.\n  Under the logic used by the proponents, the government should change \nthis provision in the Bill of Rights that has been the law of the land \nfor more than 200 years and now start regulating how much money \nnewspapers, magazines, and Web sites are allowed to spend on articles \nconcerning politics and public policy. After all, when media outlets \npublish this information, they are using their financial advantage over \nordinary citizens to be able to get their views out to the public. And, \nof course, they are trying to persuade citizens and voters and trying \nto affect political outcomes, both in terms of public policy choices \nand elections.\n\n  The majority leader, if he were on the floor, might say: Well, we \nhave a provision in here that we will not grant Congress the power to \nabridge freedom of the press. If you could turn off and on the money by \nwhich the press disseminates its point of view, if you can regulate \nperhaps even to the point of zero on the part of political actors and \ntheir ability to disseminate their views in the public or influence \nvoters before the election, this carveout is effectively meaningless.\n  It would most certainly grant Congress the power to abridge the free \nspeech of individuals and groups as disparate as the American Civil \nLiberties Union, the National Rifle Association, and the Sierra Club, \nwhich obviously have different views but enjoy and are entitled to the \nsame freedom to speak their views and persuade people to their point of \nview as much as anybody else. It would also grant Congress the power to \nabridge other freedoms in the First Amendment, such as freedom of \nassembly and freedom to petition government for the redress of \ngrievances, and it would allow State governments to ride roughshod even \nover freedom of the press.\n  You have to wonder why in the world would intelligent, highly \neducated, experienced Senators--people who are\n\n[[Page S3419]]\n\nknowledgeable about all of the matters I have talked about--propose \nsuch a wrongheaded idea and one they know will never become the law of \nthe land?\n  Well, unfortunately, this is part of an effort to intimidate and \nstigmatize people from participating in the political process. We know \nthe majority leader comes out to the floor and talks daily about the \nKoch brothers, whom he happens to disagree with, and he disagrees with \ntheir right and ability to participate in the political process and to \naffect elections. He doesn't talk about other political actors, such as \norganized labor, which has essentially been carved out of the \nlimitations on political contributions and political spending. He \ndoesn't talk about people such as Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund \nmanager who says he will spend $100 million against anyone who supports \nthe Keystone Pipeline or anyone who opposes his views on climate \nchange.\n  This cherry-picking in terms of trying to intimidate people and to \nsquelch political speech is pretty apparent. It becomes apparent \nbecause obviously the majority leader is very worried about the \nupcoming midterm election and what might happen when we see the \npushback from voters in the Senate races all across the country over \nthe last 5 years, and this great, huge growth in government and its \nintrusiveness in their lives.\n  Here is the bottom line: Free speech is free speech, period. To quote \na recent Supreme Court decision:\n\n       There is no right more basic in our democracy than the \n     right to participate in electing our political leaders.\n\n  As they said, there is nothing more basic.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, thankfully the Founders were wise enough \nnot only to give us the Bill of Rights and our Constitution but to make \nit very difficult to amend it in the first place, so we know the \nmajority leader's amendment has no chance of actually passing. Yet its \nmere introduction, the fact that a major political party and a majority \nin the Senate apparently believes in shrinking the First Amendment in \norder to weaken their political opponents, should be a cause of \nbroadspread concern in the country. People ought to ask the question: \nWhy in the world would you propose to do something as draconian and as \ndamaging as that?\n  Well, it is the kind of amendment we would expect to see not in the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world, and certainly not in the \nSenate, but maybe some banana republic or some country that does not \nhave our experience or our foundation in constitutional self-\ngovernment. Therefore, it is not merely enough to reject this amendment \nand then quickly move on to something else. We need to send a clear, \nunambiguous message that the Bill of Rights is not up for debate. We \nneed to send a clear, unambiguous message that our First Amendment \nfreedoms represent the bedrock of American democracy, and we will not \nagree to undermine that, damage it, or otherwise impair it on our \nwatch.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the fall of last year, Adrian College in \nAdrian, MI, made an announcement that received national attention. \nAdrian, one of the finest private liberal arts colleges in America, \nmade a promise to prospective students: Beginning this fall, incoming \nstudents who graduate from Adrian carrying student loan debt and are \nunable to find a job that pays above a set income will be eligible for \nsupport from the college to pay part or all of that student's loan \npayments. The program, known as AdrianPlus, will ensure that students \nwho are not able to find good-paying jobs after graduation will still \nbe able to begin their work careers without facing crushing debt \npayments all alone.\n  This announcement was notable for two reasons. The first is that it \nrepresents a visionary choice on the part of President Jeffrey Docking \nand the rest of Adrian's leadership. I am grateful to them for showing \nthe kind of leadership that makes Adrian a proud example of my State's \noutstanding higher education institutions. Adrian has long been \nrecognized not just for the quality of its instruction, but for its \nefforts to make that education accessible and affordable, and this is \njust the latest example of the school's forward thinking.\n  The second reason this announcement was so notable is that it was so \nnecessary.\n  As President Docking said in announcing the program, ``Student debt \nload continues to be a national concern.'' That is surely the case. \nAccording to the Project on Student Debt, nearly two-thirds of \ngraduates from Michigan colleges and universities leave school with \nstudent debt. They owe an average of more than $28,000. The rising tide \nof student loan debt threatens to overwhelm the financial futures of \nthese graduates before they can even get their working lives started. \nAnd the looming prospect of heavy loan debt threatens to keep many \nyoung people from even reaching a college campus.\n  Adrian College's program will not completely erase this problem, but \nit is a good start. Likewise, no single piece of legislation will make \ncollege more affordable, increase access to education for middle-class \nfamilies, or eliminate the mountain of debt many students carry. But it \nis time for us to start taking some steps in the right direction. A \nnumber of Senators have introduced or are working on student loan \nlegislation, including legislation allowing students to refinance their \ndebt at lower interest rates. I believe the Senate should take up, \ndebate and pass legislation to lighten the all-too-formidable load. We \nshould explore other ways to ensure that college education is indeed \naffordable to all.\n  Study after study shows that a college education makes an enormous \ndifference in allowing Americans to pursue rewarding careers. But if we \ncan not ensure that all Americans have access to higher education, we \nshut off access to the American dream. We cannot let the disturbing \ntrends in student debt and college costs continue unabated, and I hope \nthat, inspired by the Adrian College example, we will act to halt and \nreverse those trends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/04/senate-section/article/S3419-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3419-S3420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate confirmed Mark \nMastroianni to fill a judicial vacancy in Western Massachusetts on the \nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts.\n  Mr. Mastroianni came highly recommended by the Advisory Committee on \nMassachusetts Judicial Nominations. The advisory committee is comprised \nof distinguished members of the Massachusetts legal community, \nincluding prominent academics and litigators, and is chaired by former \nMassachusetts district court judge Nancy Gertner. Their recommendation \nreflects the strong sense of the Massachusetts legal community--and in \nparticular the legal community of Western Massachusetts--that he will \nmake an excellent district court judge.\n  Mr. Mastroianni is a true son of Western Massachusetts--born in \nSpringfield and a lifelong resident of Hampden County. Prior to his \nconfirmation, he served as the elected district attorney for Hampden \nCounty--a position he has held since 2011. He graduated with honors \nfrom the American International College in Springfield, MA and went on \nto earn his law degree from Western New England College School of Law--\nalso in Springfield, MA.\n  Mr. Mastroianni began his career in the Hampden County district \nattorney's office. He served there as an assistant district attorney \nfor over 5 years, gaining prosecutorial experience in a wide variety of \ndistrict and superior court matters. He then moved into private \npractice, where he built a significant career as a defense attorney \nrepresenting clients in criminal and civil matters. Over the course of \n16 years, he represented clients in matters before the Massachusetts \nState trial courts and appeals courts, as well as the district court to \nwhich he has been nominated.\n  In November 2010, Mastroianni ran as an independent and was \nsuccessfully elected to serve as the district attorney for Hampden \nCounty in the western part of Massachusetts--a position that returned \nhim to lead the office where he began his career. As district attorney, \nhe was responsible for managing the prosecution of all cases in the 23 \ncities and towns that make up Hampden County.\n  Aside from the impressive qualifications of this candidate, the fact \nof Mark's nomination is particularly important because the seat he has \nbeen nominated to fill has been vacant for far too long--since U.S. \nDistrict Court Judge Ponsor took senior status in 2011. The vacancy has \nstrained the Federal judicial system in Western Massachusetts, causing \ncases to be postponed, forcing judges from Boston to travel to \nSpringfield to hold hearings, and impeding the ability of citizens to \nget their day in court. Filling this vacancy as quickly as possible has \nbeen a top priority for me since I arrived in the Senate last year, and \nhis confirmation will significantly improve the administration of \njustice in Western Massachusetts.\n  I am proud to have recommended Mark Mastroianni to President Obama. \nHe is an independent-minded district attorney whose diverse litigation \nexperiences, both as a top prosecutor and as a top defense attorney, \nwill enrich the Federal bench in Massachusetts. I have no doubt that he \nwill have a long and distinguished career as a member of the judiciary.\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on April 11 of this year President \nObama nominated Sylvia Burwell to be the new Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services--HHS--a position that was \nvacated that same day by former Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n  Article II, Section 3, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution \ngrants the President, as the chief executive, plenary power to nominate \nmembers of his cabinet. But that same clause reserves the power of \nappointment--that is, the power to accept or reject the nominee--\nexclusively to the Senate.\n  The Constitution explains this unique division of power as follows: \nthe President ``shall nominate, and''--this is important--``by and with \nthe Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other \npublic Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all \nother officers of the United States.''\n  Far from a perfunctory practice, the responsibility to review the \nfitness of presidential nominees is one of the essential mechanisms in \nour Constitution's system of checks and balances.\n  And for the Members of this body who took an oath to ``support and \ndefend'' the Constitution, this is one of the most solemn duties \nincumbent upon those occupying the office of United States Senator.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to demand that prior to confirmation Ms. \nBurwell provide concrete, specific, and forthright answers--in \nwriting--to the questions that have been asked of her by Members of \nthis body.\n  I refuse to sit idly by and witness the same Washington charade in \nwhich stated commitments to transparency are more important than actual \ndemonstrations of candor.\n  If we do not insist that Ms. Burwell's appointment be contingent upon \nthe transparency of her confirmation process, we will have established \na dangerous precedent for the future of this body.\n  Let's not forget: much of the authority that resides in HHS \nultimately derives from the delegation of authority from Congress. And \nwhenever Congress delegates power to the executive branch, we do so \nbased on the premise that we retain the power of oversight.\n  Therefore, we cannot, in good faith, hand over the reins of one of \nthe most important executive departments at a time when questions \nremain unanswered and information is still undisclosed. Doing so would \nundermine the institutional prerogatives of the Senate.\n  When we only partially carry out our constitutional duties to check \nand balance the other branches, we alone are to blame for the continued \naccumulation of power in the executive, where unelected bureaucrats are \nnot always as wise or as impartial as their proponents claim them to \nbe.\n  The unprecedented accumulation of power in the executive today is a \ndemonstrable fact. But it remains an open question whether we in \nCongress care enough to do anything about it.\n  At this point, there is good reason for pessimism--if the kind of \nacquiescence demonstrated in this confirmation process is any \nindication.\n  But I remain optimistic, because I know that the American people \nstill get it. Outside the beltway, Americans still instinctively \nunderstand the universal truth articulated by James Madison, the father \nof the Constitution, over 200 years ago--that ``The accumulation of all \npowers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, \nwhether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, \nor elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.''\n  This is precisely the type of accumulated power possessed by \nexecutive departments such as HHS.\n  This power cannot be curtailed or dispersed overnight. But it will \ncontinue to expand inexorably toward tyranny unless Members of \nCongress--exercising our powers as officers of a separate and coequal \nbranch of government--don't push back.\n  We can begin by subjecting this nomination to the close scrutiny it \ndeserves.\n  The first thing we must recognize is that this is not the average \npresidential nomination. We are not talking about the next secretary of \nthe Department of Motor Vehicles. Quite the opposite: Ms. Burwell has \nbeen nominated to preside over one of the largest and most important \ndepartments in the Federal Government. No matter who the nominee, this \nis a job that should be filled with caution and circumspection.\n  By way of illustration, the HHS Secretary oversees an annual \noperating budget of about $1 trillion--that is nearly 25 percent of all \nFederal spending--as well as 11 separate operating divisions, including \nthe very important Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--CMS--and \nthe Food and Drug Administration--FDA.\n  Moreover, the next HHS Secretary is going to assume the helm of an \nexecutive leviathan in the midst of implementing the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act. Obamacare is not only the most complex--and \ncontroversial--law in recent memory, but it delegates an unprecedented \namount of authority to the HHS Secretary.\n  Often this delegation comes in the form of sweeping, open-ended \ngrants of\n\n[[Page S3421]]\n\npower that give the Secretary discretion to shape and reshape the law. \nLike an unending series of blank checks to the bureaucracy, Obamacare \ncontains 700 instances of the ultimate carte blanche--``The Secretary \nshall . . .''--to give the Secretary wide latitude to ``develop \nstandards,'' ``award grants,'' ``establish committees,'' ``make \nadjustments,'' etc.\n  This kind of massive delegation of authority is justified--especially \nby those who see it as a convenient way to avoid the difficulties of \nlawmaking--on the theory that Congress will retain and exercise some \ndegree of oversight.\n  And it is true that both chambers of Congress have the ability to \nhold hearings in which we subpoena executive officials to testify and \nanswer questions about laws, rules, and regulations under their \njurisdiction. But as we have seen over the past few years with the \nimplementation of Obamacare, this power is significantly impeded if \nthose executive officials refuse to answer our questions.\n  These facts raise the central question that ought to guide the \nSenate's consideration of Ms. Burwell's nomination--namely, how will \nMs. Burwell exercise the expansive authority delegated to HHS vis-aa-\nvis the powers and responsibilities of Congress?\n  Much of the job of the next HHS Secretary will be to facilitate \nCongressional oversight of the Department, especially in its \nimplementation of Obamacare. Therefore, the Senate's decision should be \ncontingent upon Ms. Burwell's record of engaging with Congress.\n  Sadly, Ms. Burwell's tenure as the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, as well as her performance in the Senate \ncommittee confirmation hearings, gives me concern that she will \ncontinue in the pattern of obfuscation and evasion established by \noutgoing Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n  I therefore respectfully submit that we should proceed cautiously in \nconsideration of this nominee. More cautiously, indeed, than we have up \nto this point.\n  For over the past 6 weeks, since the President nominated Ms. Burwell, \nmany in this body have neglected our end of the constitutional division \nof power--preferring to act as if Ms. Burwell's appointment was a fait \naccompli.\n  This state of affairs is troubling--and not simply because questions \nremain unanswered, and information undisclosed, about Obamacare. The \nproblem is more fundamental than any one law.\n  The Senate's reluctance to protest against the equivocation and \ndistortion seen in this confirmation process undermines the separation \nof powers and the system of checks and balances upon which our \nconstitutional order depends.\n  Respecting and upholding these principles of our Constitution is not \na matter of adhering to some arcane formality or following some \noutdated tradition of the 18th century.\n  At issue here is whether or not this institution still believes in \nthe reason our Constitution divides power in the first place. Do we \nstill believe, as Madison said, that ``power is of an encroaching \nnature, and that it ought to be effectually restrained from passing the \nlimits assigned to it''?\n  If we do, then we must employ the tools at our disposal to assert our \ninstitutional prerogatives. Doing so will demonstrate to the other \nbranches that the power of government is not simply up for grabs.\n  Here again Madison's insights are instructive: in the famous \nFederalist 51, he says, ``the great security against a gradual \nconcentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in \ngiving to those who administer each department the necessary \nconstitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of \nthe others. [. . .] Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The \ninterest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of \nthe place.''\n  But if we disagree with Madison about the encroaching nature of power \n. . . if we are undisturbed by the great accumulation of power in the \nexecutive branch, which predates and will outlive Obama's presidency . \n. . if we prefer to elevate policy preference and party allegiance over \nlove of liberty and the constitutional rights of Congress . . . then we \nmust not be surprised when--not if--our government takes on the \ncharacter and the spirit of tyranny.\n  Let me be clear: the kind of tyranny that threatens us is not of the \nSaddam Hussein or Bashar al-Assad variety. The tyrannies of Saddam's \nIraq and, today, Assad's Syria are barbarous, murderous dictatorships \nthat extinguish every semblance of freedom and maintain their power \nthrough violence and brutality.\n  What I am talking about is the kind of soft despotism that arises \nwhen power is consolidated under the auspices of a paternal, benevolent \ngovernment.\n  At the end of his study of democracy in 19th-century America, Alexis \nde Tocqueville explained how this kind of tyranny could emerge within a \ndemocratic republic such as ours. Standing as a kind of warning for us \ntoday, Tocqueville envisioned ``an immense and tutelary power'' that \n``extends its arms over society as a whole,'' covering it ``with a \nnetwork of small, complicated, painstaking, uniform rules through which \nthe most original minds and the most vigorous souls cannot clear a way \nto surpass the crowd.'' It does not ``break wills,'' he said, ``but it \nsoftens them, bends them, and directs them; it rarely forces one to \nact''--even Tocqueville didn't foresee the individual mandate--``but it \nconstantly opposes itself to one's acting; it does not destroy, it \nprevents things from being born.''\n  This is certainly a dark image. But we cannot forget that Tocqueville \nwas bullish about America. He believed that American democracy had the \nright attributes needed to avoid descending to these depths.\n  Chief among these attributes were our constitutional structures that \ndivided power and, more importantly, the spiritedness, courage, and \nlove of freedom that animated the American people and transformed the \nmere ``parchment barriers'' of the Constitution into true limits on \ngovernmental power.\n  It is precisely this spirit of freedom that the Senate must recover \nif we are going to fulfill our constitutional obligations in this \nconfirmation process. Once we recognize the need to assert and defend \nour interests as a separate and coequal branch of the government, we \nwill begin to focus on what is really at stake in our consideration of \nthis nominee.\n  The main issue here is not Ms. Burwell's character or credentials--\nboth of which are first-rate--but whether or not her appointment will \nimprove or further deteriorate the legislature's oversight over the \nexecutive departments to which Congress has delegated vast amounts of \nauthority.\n  The question is not whether Ms. Burwell deserves to be HHS Secretary, \nbut whether the HHS, under Ms. Burwell's management, will continue in \nthe pattern of obstinate autonomy and limited cooperation established \nunder her predecessor.\n  If the answer is no, we cannot possibly vote to confirm this \nnominee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/04/senate-section/article/S3421-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3421-S3422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN REMEMBRANCE OF D-DAY\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to remember and honor the brave \nNevadans and all Americans who risked their lives defending our liberty \non the beaches of Normandy, France 70 years ago. The sacrifices our \nbrave soldiers made on this day set America and the world on a path to \npeace, freedom, and liberty that all Americans enjoy today.\n  At dawn on June 6, 1944, the Allied powers stormed the beaches of \nNormandy and started their march across Europe to defeat Hitler. It was \none of the most important days in American history and one the biggest \ntests our Nation has ever faced. What is known as D-day marked the \nbeginning of the demise of one of the worst enemies that the United \nStates has ever had to face. The brave men that stormed Omaha Beach \nthat day sacrificed their lives, their ambitions, and their \nrelationships with loved ones to liberate those who were enslaved by \nthe Nazis. Their courage demonstrated that America would not sit idly \nby as countries across the Atlantic suffered, reaffirming America's \nbelief that violations of basic human rights will not be tolerated. \nTheir unwavering service is what has made this country so great and a \nbeacon of democracy. These men believed that freedom was worth fighting \nfor and that reflects what is most inspiring about the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\n  It is an honor to be able to commemorate this day on behalf of my \nfellow Nevadans as we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice \nand died to defend freedom. Our soldiers' commitment to this country, \nas well as their dedication to their families and communities, \nexemplified why the legacy of all World War II veterans must be \npreserved for generations to come. These heroes truly are the \n``greatest generation''--selflessly serving not for recognition, but \nbecause it was the right thing to do. As a member of the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize that Congress has a \nresponsibility not only to honor these brave individuals, but to ensure \nthey are cared for after their return home. I remain committed to \nupholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada \nand throughout the Nation.\n  I ask that we remember the Americans who stood against tyranny and \npersevered. The brave men and women who risked everything to come to \nthe aid of others deserve our respect and appreciation, and I am both \nhumbled and honored to recognize them here today. May we never forget \nthe brave actions by these heroes that allowed the Allied troops to \ndefeat tyranny.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/04/senate-section/article/S3422-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THANKING SENATE PAGES\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP.

Mr. President, I wish to honor CDR Robert Adams \nHatch, who retired from the U.S. Navy on June 1, 2014, after more than \n28 years of honorable service.\n  Commander Hatch is a supply corps/logistics officer 3105 and retired \nfollowing his final assignment in Voluntary Training Unit 6767 Atlanta \nat the Navy Operational Support Center at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in \nMarietta, GA. Prior to his service at Dobbins ARB, he most recently \ncompleted a 3-year assignment in Joint Operations with Navy Reserve \nJoint Staff South in Suffolk, VA, supporting the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \nAdditionally, he was commanding officer of the 50-member Operational \nSupport Unit 0867 in Atlanta, GA, from May 2007 through April 2009.\n  From 1994 to 2003, Commander Hatch spent much of his career overseas \nwith the Joint Contact Team Program military-to-military contacts \nprogram in Eastern Europe as part of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff initiative established in 1992 to illustrate the standard of \nU.S.-style military under civilian control, and to promote peace, \nstability, military professionalism and closer ties to NATO for former \nCommunist countries in Eastern Europe. He served on the Military \nLiaison Team, living and working in Albania under arduous conditions \nfrom 1994 to 1998, and was twice evacuated from Albania in March 1997 \nand August 1998. After the second evacuation in 1998, then-Lieutenant \nCommander Hatch worked at Headquarters, United States European Command/\nECJ5-J, as joint contact team program desk officer for Poland, Ukraine, \nGeorgia, Moldova, Armenia and Azerbaijan. He returned to the United \nStates in 2003.\n  Commander Hatch is also a key team leader on the Atlanta Funeral \nHonors Team, having conducted more than 450 Navy, Coast Guard, and \njoint military funerals for Reserve and Active Duty veterans since \n2008.\n  Born in Abington, PA, Commander Hatch moved in 1972 to Atlanta, GA, \nand grew up in that great city. His father, CAPT James C. Hatch, served \nin the U.S. Navy Supply Corps, and was a classmate of President Jimmy \nCarter at the Naval Academy. His father retired after dedicating 26 \nyears of active service, including World War II, and in the Korea and \nVietnam wars. Following his retirement, I had the pleasure of working \nwith Jim Hatch at Northside Realty. And the family's Georgia \ncredentials don't stop there. Captain Jim Hatch's brother, Edwin I. \nHatch, was president of Georgia Power Company, and the Edwin I. Hatch \nNuclear Plant, located near Baxley, GA, was duly named in tribute to \nhis leadership.\n  In addition to his distinguished military career, CDR Robert Hatch \nhas had a meaningful civilian life, including 4 years with Coca-Cola \nUSA. He is currently managing director and independent marketing \nassociate of Ignite/Stream Energy, a funeral attendant with Service \nCorps International in Atlanta, and an actor participating in movies \nand television shows filming in Georgia.\n  Commander Hatch's military decorations include the Defense \nMeritorious Service Medal, four Joint Service Commendation Medals, Navy \nCommendation Medal, six Joint Meritorious Unit Awards, Navy Meritorious \nUnit Commendation, two National Defense Service Medals, Armed Forces \nExpeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Sea Service \nDeployment Ribbon, nine Navy & Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbons, \nArmed Forces Reserve Medal and a Navy Pistol Marksmanship Medal.\n  I send my great thanks to Commander Hatch for his extensive \nmeritorious service to our proud nation, and I thank and congratulate \nhis family and friends for supporting his service to the United States \nof America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/04/senate-section/article/S3422-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ROSLYN, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I wish to \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of Roslyn, SD. Since its founding in \n1914 the city has flourished from its humble pioneer origins to a \nvibrant South Dakota community. The people of Roslyn will be \ncelebrating their centennial anniversary the weekend of June 20-22.\n  Named by the area's first postmaster after his native city in \nScotland, the township was moved from Old Roslyn to its current \nlocation alongside the Soo Railroad. In 1914 on the same day that \nRoslyn's lots were first sold at public auction, a troupe of \nentertainers performed for the community, setting a lively foundation \nfor the city.\n  Residents of Roslyn will start off the centennial celebration with an \nantique tractor run. The weekend will continue with musical concerts, a \n5k walk/run, and many other activities. On Sunday, the festival will \nwrap up with a non-denominational service and a string band performance \nby Threshing Bee.\n  Small towns like Roslyn embody what it means to be a South Dakotan \ncommunity. I am pleased to recognize the achievements of Roslyn and to \noffer my congratulations to the residents of the town on this historic \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/04/senate-section/article/S3422-4", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/04/senate-section/article/S3422-5", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3422-S3423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/04/senate-section/article/S3423-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2422.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure that \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs provides temporary care in the most \ncost effective manner when patients are relocated during medical \nfacility construction and renovation projects, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, following the resignation of Secretary \nShinseki last week, it is time for some deep soul-searching about the \nfuture of the Department of Veterans Affairs. As details slowly emerge \nfrom the inspector general's investigation, I am struck by a disturbing \naspect of organizational culture within the VA that prioritizes meeting \ngoals and checking boxes instead of providing true quality care for \nveterans. Secretary Shinseki himself was a decorated veteran, and I am \nsure he must have been as frustrated as all of us to find some of the \nthings that were happening.\n  There is an overwhelming current rushing toward the path of least \nresistance for ``reporting'' care for the men and women who served this \nNation admirably and with dedication. But we should not lose sight of \nthe hard work and commitment of the many men and women working in the \nVA system every day striving to provide effective and timely care to \nveterans. We have to tell ourselves that there is really no shortcut to \nquality care for veterans. The VA has rightly been under intense \npressure and scrutiny to live up to the promise we made to veterans \nwhen they agreed to serve.\n  We have many people in this body and the other body who voted for a \nwar that I think historians will call a disaster--the war in Iraq. For \nthe first time in America's history, they voted for a war and did not \ndo anything to pay for it--no tax to pay for it or anything else. Ten \nyears later, though, they say: We have to watch the cost of VA health \ncare and all that; we have to find the money. Well, that did not bother \nthem when they sent these men and women to war. Let's take care of them \nnow.\n  It has become apparent that at facilities across the United States \nsome VA employees have decided to choose to simply tell those above \nthem and those of us with oversight responsibility what they want to \nhear, over providing quality care in a timely fashion. And that is \nappalling and unacceptable.\n  But most VA employees are tireless servants. Many are veterans \nthemselves. For those men and women who give their all for our \nveterans, it is becoming evident that the system of incentives and \ndisincentives may have worked against them. For example, it appears \nthat the criteria for bonuses are too weighted towards reported \nmetrics, rather than toward taking the time to understand the outcomes \nbehind the statistics. What sort of message is sent to good employees \nwhen their ``success'' depends only on a small part of the picture of \nveterans' care?\n  There should be no shortcut to quality care for veterans in \nWashington policymaking circles either. The mere replacement of a \ncabinet secretary results in neither accountability nor reform. Even \nwidespread firing of SES-level government employees will not \nautomatically result in providing quality care for veterans. Other \nmeaningful and more comprehensive reforms are needed, and without \ndelay. Earlier this year my distinguished colleague from Vermont \nSenator Sanders introduced an expansive collection of many needed \nreforms. Unfortunately, like so many bills we have tried to consider \nthis year, partisan objections stalled progress based on procedural \nrather than substantive matters. Some of the same people who have been \nso critical of this administration and the VA were the same ones who \nvoted to block going forward with needed reforms.\n  Well, the Senate is going to get another opportunity to consider a \ncomprehensive collection of reforms. It must prompt some meaningful \nbipartisan action here in the Senate. Let's not play ``gotcha.'' Let's \nplay ``help you'' to the veterans. That is what we need to do. Congress \nhas an obligation to consider, debate, and vote on the reforms needed \nto make our system of care for veterans both efficient and effective.\n  My wife began her nursing career as a brand new registered nurse in a \nVA hospital. I know how hard she and those around her worked. They were \nveterans of a different generation, but they needed help and care just \nas much as everybody else.\n  So I look forward to the Senate's consideration of the legislation \nintroduced yesterday by Senator Sanders. I am proud to cosponsor it. \nMany reforms are needed within the VA, and the Ensuring Veterans Access \nto Care Act takes important steps toward achieving these changes.\n  Of course, additional reforms are needed. So today I am introducing \nlegislation to address one shortfall at the VA that has existed far too \nlong. Current law provides a disincentive to cost-effective, onsite \nmedical care solutions when operating rooms are refurbished or rebuilt \nwithin a VA hospital or care facility. Because the VA must report any \nmajor medical facility costs exceeding $10 million to Congress, the VA \nis encouraged to pay for veterans care at outside facilities, including \ntravel to and from those facilities, out of the medical services \naccount. It is robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is a different pot of \nmoney. So that way they do not have to have an extensive report. But \nthe best solution for veterans and the bottom line may very well be a \ntemporary onsite facility.\n  The bill is simple but attempts to take the allure of a shortcut away \nby ensuring that the expenses of temporary offsite care are also \ncalculated and reported.\n  Senator Sanders, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, has \nsaid: ``If you think it's too expensive to take care of our veterans, \nthen don't send them to war.'' He is right. We paid for two unfunded \nwars on a credit card. Now it is time we invest in those who put \nthemselves in harm's way to protect our security. It is time for us to \nworry about some of the things we need to do here at home. It is time.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS:\n  S. 2430. A bill to establish the Office of the Special Inspector \nGeneral for Monitoring the Affordable Care Act, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I first congratulate my colleague Senator \nIsakson for doing a good job of summarizing exactly where we are and \nthe problems we are experiencing with the complexity of the Affordable \nCare Act and the hope that the new Secretary will be responsive, as the \nSenator so eloquently pointed out when he questioned her when she came \nbefore the committee. I thank the Senator for making an excellent \nspeech and making excellent points, and I will endeavor to do the same, \nas we are talking about the same subject.\n  My remarks are once again on the Affordable Care Act. I know we have \nother issues, many important issues--the Veterans' Administration, the \nrelease of terrorists in an exchange--but it is equally important we \ncontinue to shed light on the many failings of this law.\n  During the very first debate on the Affordable Care Act, I distinctly \nremember comparing this rush to government health care as akin to \nriding hell-for-leather into a box canyon to find the only alternative \nwould be to turn around, ride back out, and get on a more realistic, \nmarket-oriented health reform trail.\n  Then I put it another way. I said: There are a lot of cactuses out \nthere. We didn't have to sit on every one of them.\n  We never even saw the bill before we voted on it. I think everybody \nunderstands that. I voted no and so did every Republican Senator and \nMember of Congress. This was not a bipartisan effort.\n  I regret to say to my colleagues that I told you so, and here we are \nin a box canyon. Until the administration provides us more details to \nthe contrary, we have to assume that more Americans are losing the care \nthey liked,\n\n[[Page S3427]]\n\nthrough cancellation notices, than they have enrolled in the exchanges. \nThey are in a box canyon.\n  It is now estimated that ObamaCare will cost the Nation nearly $2 \ntrillion and has created higher premiums, higher taxes, less choice, \nconfusion, delays, and problem after problem. Unfortunately, the \nPresident and his allies in the Congress continue to protect this law, \ndespite its toll on our economy, our patients, and our providers.\n  The President promised, as we all remember: We'll lower premiums for \na typical family by $2,500 per year.\n  Valerie from Wichita, KS, wrote me a letter to share her story on \nthis broken promise. She writes:\n\n       I wanted to let you know that I had to drop my company \n     health insurance due to the Affordable Care Act. My premium \n     before the Act was $250 a month and my employer paid $100 a \n     month toward the premium.\n       My insurance year expired April 1st and the new year is \n     under the ACA health insurance. The new plan is now much \n     higher at $565 a month and my employer can only afford to \n     pitch in $150 a month. I had to drop my plan due to \n     unaffordability. I could not pay the $415 a month.\n\n  The President also promised, highly publicized: ``If you like your \nhealth care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, \nperiod,'' and, ``If you like your doctor, you'll be able to keep your \ndoctor.''\n  This law has significantly disrupted the individual health insurance \nmarket by imposing mandates and causing at least 5 million Americans to \nlose the insurance they had or have.\n  Doug, also from Wichita, wrote to share his personal story on this \none. He said:\n\n       I am a small business owner who just got my family's health \n     insurance cancelled. I have talked it through with [the \n     insurance company] and at a minimum I will be paying 63% more \n     per month for coverage that has a deductible 3 times greater \n     than what I had and my doctor may or may not be in the \n     network.\n\n  Doug continues on to say:\n\n       The only topic that matters in Washington is stopping the \n     insanity of [ObamaCare].\n\n  Most important, the President promised, ``I will protect Medicare.'' \nThis law cuts over $700 billion from Medicare to pay for ObamaCare. \nPart of those cuts come from the establishment, the establishment of an \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board--what a wonderful acronym for this \nboard--IPAB. This Board is supposed to be made up of 15 unelected \nbureaucrats who will decide which treatments in Medicare coverage \nshould be taken away with regard to reimbursement. As I have stated on \nthe Senate floor before, the IPAB has no accountability and their \ndecisions are practically impossible to overturn.\n  The administration continues to give us piecemeal data on exchange \nenrollments, delays provisions of the law that they can't implement on \ntime or simply wants to delay--a large serving of politics involved--\nand is providing exclusive waivers and special deals to unions and \nothers from the yoke of ObamaCare.\n  In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service confirmed \nthat the administration has missed half of the mandated deadlines of \nthis law. Most recently, press reports have indicated the government \nmay be paying incorrect subsidies to more than 1 million Americans for \ntheir health care plans in the new Federal insurance exchanges, and \nthey have so far been unable to fix the errors. Obviously, this poses a \nlot of problems for a lot of people.\n  Unfortunately, the President and his allies in Congress continue to \nprotect this law despite its toll on our economy, patients, and \nproviders.\n  A new Health and Human Services Secretary has been nominated, Sylvia \nMathews Burwell, as Senator Isakson referred to, but with ObamaCare, \nnothing will alter. We are headed for socialized medicine. ObamaCare is \nthe President's legacy. The President will unilaterally change what \nsuits him best.\n  The hard-working taxpayers who are paying for this law, in large part \nfrom the 21 tax increases contained in it, have a right to some \nanswers. That is right, I said 21 tax increases. Just some of these \ntaxes include the following: the individual mandate tax, where people \nhave to pay the government for not having insurance, even if they can't \nafford it; the employer mandate tax, where an employer pays a tax \nbecause they may have chosen to forgo providing insurance to their \nemployees instead of having to lay off workers; the health insurance \ntax, which will be passed along to individuals in the form of higher \npremiums; the medical device tax.\n\n  I could go on and on. Many of these taxes have bipartisan support to \nbe repealed, but we can't even get a vote on those.\n  With a $1.8 trillion pricetag, this bill is so far-reaching it is \ndifficult to find a Federal agency that doesn't have a hand in this \npot; from your doctor's office to your wallet, to your privacy. That is \nwhy I am introducing today a bill to require a special inspector \ngeneral for monitoring the Affordable Care Act. We call it the SIGMA \nAct. It is the Special Inspector General for Monitoring the Affordable \nHealth Care Act.\n  While all of the Federal agencies charged with implementing the \nAffordable Care Act have Offices of the Inspector General--and they do, \nthey are all investigating this law in their own silo--where have we \nheard that before with a lot of problems within the Federal \nGovernment--the Health and Human Services inspector general isn't \ntalking to the Treasury IG or the Department of Labor IG or the \nHomeland Security IG or any one of those with each other.\n  This bill would give appropriate authority to investigate and to \naudit any programs or activities related to this law across the many \nFederal departments, State exchanges, and private contractors.\n  The legislation will require a report to be submitted to Congress and \nthe American people 6 months after enactment and quarterly reports for \nthe duration of time the Affordable Care Act is on the books. They have \nbroad authority to review all aspects of the law. Things such as the \nfollowing:\n  Changes in the health insurance marketplace, the amount of folks who \nhave seen their premiums and out-of-pocket costs increased, shrinking \nphysician and other provider networks. We have a right to know that.\n  The employer mandate, its effect on worker hours, employers' hiring, \nand the number of businesses subjected to the penalty. We have a right \nto know that.\n  The healthcare.gov Web site, its security, functionality, and \nverification systems. We have read a lot about that, but we have a \nright to know.\n  Duties of the Internal Revenue Service, plans for calculating subsidy \noverpayments and underpayments, how they will notify these individuals \nand what their plans are for recapturing these overpayments.\n  Medicare cuts via the IPAB, they will provide an analysis of the \nimpact on medical outcomes for our seniors as a result of these cuts. \nWe should know that.\n  All of these questions could and should be answered by a special \ninspector general. The bill would equip the special IG with the same \ninvestigative and law enforcement authority as standing inspectors \ngeneral, including subpoena and audit powers to compel responses from \nthe administration.\n  President Obama has claimed that his--his--is ``the most transparent \nadministration in history'' and that his administration is committed to \ncreating an unprecedented level of openness in government. Given these \nstatements, I think the President should embrace the idea of a special \ninspector general for his health care law. After all, we need to know \nthe outcomes of the 41 changes he has already made to the law.\n  It would provide increased transparency so the general public has a \nbetter understanding about this law. It would protect taxpayer dollars, \nand by providing an independent analysis of this law, it will allow the \nadministration and Congress to make more informed decisions and work \ntogether on how we move forward with reforms to our health care \nsystem. I believe we need to do everything possible to repeal and \nreplace this law with real health care reform--reforms that lower costs \nand restore the all-important relationship between a patient and a \ndoctor.\n\n  However, as long as this law is on the books, we need a watchdog or a \nspecial inspector general to investigate the implementation of this law \nand ensure that our scarce taxpayer dollars are being spent in an \nappropriate manner. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of this bill in calling for\n\n[[Page S3428]]\n\nincreased oversight of the affordable--or unaffordable--health care \nlaw.\n  Let's ride out of the box canyon. Let's get on a better health care \nreform trail, and on the way we certainly don't have to sit on every \ncactus that comes along.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. WARREN (for herself, Mr. Franken, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Reed, \n        Mr. Durbin, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Reid, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Stabenow, \n        Mr. Cardin, Mr. Brown, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Udall \n        of Colorado, Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Begich, \n        Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Schatz, Mr. \n        Murphy, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Markey, Mr. Booker, Mr. \n        Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Menendez, \n        and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2432. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nfor the refinancing of certain Federal student loans, and for other \npurposes; read the first time.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, outstanding student loans now total more \nthan $1.2 trillion and millions of young people are struggling to keep \nup with their payments. But we have a chance to give those borrowers \nimmediate relief by cutting the interest rates on existing student \nloans. Make no mistake--this is an emergency. Federal watchdog agencies \nsuch as the Federal Reserve, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nand the Treasury Department are already sounding the alarm.\n  Forty million Americans are saddled with student loan debt. It is \nholding them back, and it is holding our economy back too. Crushing \nstudent loan debt is keeping many young people from moving out of their \nparents' homes, from saving for a downpayment, from buying homes, \nbuying cars, starting small businesses, saving for retirement, or \nmaking the purchases that grow our economy.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. Congress set artificially high \ninterest rates on old student loans that generate extra money for the \ngovernment. The GAO recently projected that just the slice of Federal \nstudent loans issued between 2007 and 2012 will generate $66 billion \nfor the U.S. Government. Those are the kinds of profits that would make \na Fortune 500 CEO proud.\n  These young people didn't go to the mall and run up charges on a \ncredit card. They worked hard and learned new skills that will benefit \nthis country and help us build a stronger America. They deserve a fair \nshot at an affordable education. We can give them a fair shot by \ncutting those interest rates and cutting those government profits.\n  Along with more than 30 of my colleagues, I introduced the Bank on \nStudents Emergency Loan Refinancing Act to do just that. The idea is \nsimple. With interest rates near historic lows, homeowners, businesses, \nand even local governments have refinanced their debts. But a graduate \nwho took out an unsubsidized loan before July 1 of last year is locked \ninto an interest rate of nearly 7 percent. Older loans run 8 percent, 9 \npercent, 10 percent, and even higher. We need to bring those rates \ndown, and we need to do it now. The Bank on Students bill would give \nstudent loan borrowers the opportunity to lower their interest rates on \nold loans to match the rates the government offers to new borrowers \ntoday. That is 3.8 percent for undergraduate loans, 5.41 percent for \ngraduate loans, and 6.41 percent for PLUS loans.\n\n  I want to be clear. These rates are still higher than what it costs \nthe government to run the student loan program. The government won't be \nsubsidizing student loans. In fact, the government will be making a \nprofit on these loans--just a much smaller profit. And let's also be \nclear that our work is not done until we eliminate all of the profits \nfrom the student loan program.\n  But this is a step that both Republicans and Democrats can easily \nsupport right now. Last year nearly every Republican in Congress in \nboth the House and the Senate voted for the exact same loan rates that \nare in this legislation. If Republicans believe that 3.86 percent is \ngood enough for new undergraduate borrowers, then it should be good \nenough for all the existing undergraduate borrowers. There is no reason \non Earth to say that some kids could get a better deal than others when \nthey all worked hard to do exactly what we wanted them to do--get an \neducation.\n  Passing this bill would have a real impact for people who are \nstruggling to make it--college students, young graduates who are only \nstarting to build their lives, parents who are juggling their own \nstudent loans and trying to figure out how they are going to pay for \ntheir kids' educations, and parents who guaranteed their kids' student \nloans. Student loan refinancing can save real money for millions of \nAmericans, and they are voicing their support. Letters, emails, and \nphone calls are already pouring in, and petitions for the bill's \npassage have already garnered hundreds of thousands of signatures. \nThink tanks such as Demos and the Center for American Progress, student \ngroups such as Generation Progress and Young Invincibles, and teachers \ngroups such as the AFT and NEA have all come forward and endorsed this \nproposal.\n  Today the Congressional Budget Office announced that the bill \nactually saves billions of dollars and reduces the Federal deficit. \nThat is because the refinancing proposal is fully paid for by \nimplementing the Buffett rule, which limits the ability of millionaires \nand billionaires to exploit tax loopholes and pay a lower tax rate than \nmiddle-class families.\n  Later today we will introduce an updated version of this legislation \nin the hopes that we will be able to consider it on the floor of the \nSenate very soon.\n  I am encouraged by the fact that some Republicans have also come \nforward to say they are open to considering a refinancing proposal. I \nwant to be clear. This should not be a partisan issue. I am eager to \nwork with any of my colleagues regardless of party who believe that we \nneed to do something about this growing debt crisis. If they have \nissues with the proposal, if they want to suggest different offsets or \npolicy changes, they should bring their ideas forward. We are ready to \nhear them.\n  What we cannot do is continue to ignore this problem and hope that it \nwill go away on its own. Congress made this mess by setting \nartificially high interest rates that are crushing our kids. It is \nCongress's responsibility to clean it up. Refinancing won't fix \neverything that is broken with our higher education system, but the \nneed for comprehensive reform must not blind us to the urgency of \naddressing massive debt that is already crushing young people.\n  This is personal for me. I grew up in an America that made it a \npriority to invest in young people, and it opened a million doors for \nme. I will keep fighting to make sure that every kid who works hard and \nplays by the rules gets a fair shot. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this bill. Student loan borrowers don't have armies of \nlobbyists to fight for them, but they have their voices and they are \nasking for our support. Let's give it to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/04/senate-section/article/S3428-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3428-S3429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 467--RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF FISHERMEN'S \nTERMINAL IN THE PORT OF SEATTLE AND CELEBRATING SEATTLE'S RICH MARITIME \n            HERITAGE AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mrs. Murray) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Reg. 3109) on \n     June 25, 1941, declaring that ``there shall be no \n     discrimination in the employment of workers in defense \n     industries and in government because\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\n     of race, creed, color, or national origin'' and established \n     the Fair Employment Practices Commission to oversee that \n     order;\n       Whereas Mr. Randolph urged President Harry Truman to end \n     segregation in the Armed Forces of the United States;\n       Whereas, after the urging of Mr. Randolph, President Truman \n     issued Executive Order 9981 (13 Fed. Reg. 4313) on July 26, \n     1948, declaring that ``[T]here shall be equality of treatment \n     and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without \n     regard to race, color, religion or national origin. This \n     policy shall be put into effect as rapidly as possible, \n     having due regard to the time required to effectuate any \n     necessary changes without impairing efficiency or morale.'' \n     and closed the segregated Marine Corps boot camp at Montford \n     Point in Jacksonville, North Carolina;\n       Whereas Mr. Randolph was actively involved in the planning \n     and organization of many civil rights efforts, including the \n     prayer pilgrimage for freedom in 1957, the marches for school \n     integration in 1958 and 1959, and the March on Washington in \n     1963;\n       Whereas Mr. Randolph was the first speaker of the day at \n     the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, during which Dr. \n     Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his famous ``I Have a \n     Dream'' speech;\n       Whereas the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-352; 78 \n     Stat. 241), the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Public Law 89-110; \n     79 Stat. 437), and the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Public Law \n     90-284; 82 Stat. 73) are the fruits of the seeds that Mr. \n     Randolph and others like him sowed many years before;\n       Whereas Mr. Randolph helped to found the Leadership \n     Conference on Civil and Human Rights;\n       Whereas Amtrak named one of its luxury sleeping cars, the \n     Superliner II Deluxe Sleeper 32503, the ``A. Philip \n     Randolph'' in honor of Mr. Randolph;\n       Whereas a bust in the likeness of Mr. Randolph stands in \n     Union Station in Washington, DC, as a tribute to his work on \n     behalf of African-American rail workers;\n       Whereas, in 1964, Mr. Randolph was awarded the Presidential \n     Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon Johnson;\n       Whereas the civil rights revolution was launched, in no \n     small part, based on the efforts of Mr. Randolph and the work \n     of statesmen like him; and\n       Whereas, upon the celebration of the 50th anniversary of \n     the March on Washington in 2013, it is fitting to honor the \n     work of Mr. Randolph and his commitment to a better United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate honors the legacy of A. Philip \n     Randolph and salutes his efforts on behalf of the people of \n     the United States to form ``a more perfect union''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/04/senate-section/article/S3430-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING THE LIFE, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND LEGACY OF BILLY FRANK, JR.\n\n  Mr. REID.
