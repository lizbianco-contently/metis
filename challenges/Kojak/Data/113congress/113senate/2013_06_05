SENSE OF THE SENATE RELATING TO EMERGENCY FOOD \n                   ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) food insecurity and hunger are a fact of life for \n     millions of individuals in the United States and can produce \n     physical, mental, and social impairments;\n       (2) recent data published by the Department of Agriculture \n     show that approximately 50,000,000 individuals in the United \n     States live in households experiencing hunger or food \n     insecurity, and of that number, 16,700,000 are children;\n       (3) the Department of Agriculture data also show that \n     households with children experience food insecurity nearly \n     twice as frequently as households without children;\n       (4) 5.1 percent of all households in the United States \n     (approximately 6,100,000 households) have accessed emergency \n     food from a food pantry 1 or more times;\n       (5) the report entitled ``Household Food Security in the \n     United States, 2011'', published by the Economic Research \n     Service of the Department of Agriculture, found that in 2011, \n     the most recent year for which data exists--\n       (A) 14.9 percent of all households in the United States \n     experienced food insecurity at some point during the year;\n       (B) 20.6 percent of all households with children in the \n     United States experienced food insecurity at some point \n     during the year; and\n       (C) 8.8 percent of seniors living alone were food insecure;\n       (6) as of the date of enactment of this Act, long-term \n     unemployment is still at a record high, with over 37 percent \n     of unemployed individuals nationally out of a job for 6 \n     months or longer, an additional 7,900,000 people working \n     part-time due to reduced hours, and rising gas prices and \n     State budget cutbacks having left millions of hungry \n     Americans struggling;\n       (7) the problem of hunger and food insecurity can be found \n     in rural, suburban, and urban portions of the United States, \n     touching nearly every community in the Nation;\n       (8) although substantial progress has been made in reducing \n     the incidence of hunger and food insecurity in the United \n     States, many Americans remain vulnerable to hunger and the \n     negative effects of food insecurity;\n       (9) the people of the United States have a long tradition \n     of providing food assistance to hungry individuals through \n     acts of private generosity and public support programs;\n       (10) the Federal Government provides nutritional support to \n     millions of individuals through numerous Federal food \n     assistance programs, including the emergency food assistance \n     program established under the Emergency Food Assistance Act \n     of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 7501 et seq.)
