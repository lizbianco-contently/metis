Pursuant to the order of the Senate of \nJanuary 24, 1901, as amended by the order of February 15, 2013, the \nSenator from New Hampshire (Ms. Ayotte) will now read Washington's \nFarewell Address.\n  Ms. AYOTTE, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\nTo the people of the United States\n  Friends and Fellow-Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that \nthis resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in, the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared \nto be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much \nearlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself, and every day the \nincreasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade \nof retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied \nthat if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services, \nthey were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, while \nchoice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism \ndoes not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the \ndeep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved \ncountry for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still more for \nthe steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and for the \nopportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable \nattachment by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness \nunequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these \nservices, let it always be remembered to your praise and as an \ninstructive example in our annals that, under circumstances in which \nthe passions agitated in every direction were liable to\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\nmislead, amidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune \noften discouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently want of \nsuccess has countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your \nsupport was the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the \nplans by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this \nidea, I shall carry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to \nunceasing vows that Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of \nits beneficence; that your union and brotherly affection may be \nperpetual; that the free constitution, which is the work of your hands, \nmay be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every department \nmay be stamped with wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of \nthe people of these states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made \ncomplete by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this \nblessing as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the \napplause, the affection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a \nstranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of \nyour national Union to your collective and individual happiness; that \nyou should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; \naccustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of \nyour political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation \nwith jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a \nsuspicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly \nfrowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any \nportion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties \nwhich now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings, and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The South \nin the same intercourse, benefitting by the agency of the North, sees \nits agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its \nown channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular \nnavigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to \nnourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation, it \nlooks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself \nis unequally adapted. The East, in a like intercourse with the West, \nalready finds, and in the progressive improvement of interior \ncommunications by land and water will more and more find a valuable \nvent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at \nhome. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to its growth \nand comfort--and what is perhaps of still greater consequence, it must \nof necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its \nown productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime \nstrength of the Atlantic side of the Union, directed by an indissoluble \ncommunity of interest as one nation. Any other tenure by which the West \ncan hold this essential advantage, whether derived from its own \nseparate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any \nforeign power, must be intrinsically precarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a primary \nobject of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to \nweaken its bands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants\n\n[[Page S795]]\n\nof our western country have lately had a useful lesson on this head. \nThey have seen in the negotiation by the executive--and in the \nunanimous ratification by the Senate--of the treaty with Spain, and in \nthe universal satisfaction at that event throughout the United States, \na decisive proof how unfounded were the suspicions propagated among \nthem of a policy in the general government and in the Atlantic states \nunfriendly to their interests in regard to the Mississippi. They have \nbeen witnesses to the formation of two treaties, that with Great \nBritain and that with Spain, which secure to them everything they could \ndesire, in respect to our foreign relations, towards confirming their \nprosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of \nthese advantages on the Union by which they were procured? Will they \nnot henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such there are, who would \nsever them from their brethren and connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay by the adoption of a Constitution of government better \ncalculated than your former for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government. But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower and the right of the people to establish government presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character with the real design to \ndirect, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action \nof the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental \nprinciple and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to \ngive it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of \nthe delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but \nartful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to \nthe alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public \nadministration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects \nof faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans \ndigested by common councils and modified by mutual interests. However \ncombinations or associations of the above description may now and then \nanswer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, \nto become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled \nmen will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for \nthemselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very \nengines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be \nto effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some \nprevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, \nturns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the \nruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it \nthe interest and the duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain \nit.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to \nthe government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the \npolicy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will \nof another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of \npublic opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \nit demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, \nlest instead of warming it should consume.\n  It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the\n\n[[Page S796]]\n\ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories and constituting each the guardian of the public \nweal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments \nancient and modern, some of them in our country and under our own eyes. \nTo preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If in the \nopinion of the people the distribution or modification of the \nconstitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected \nby an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let \nthere be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may \nbe the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free \ngovernments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly \noverbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which \nthe use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less \nforce to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend \nto it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation \nof the fabric?\n  Promote then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public \nopinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected \nthe permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachments for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it \nastray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against \nanother disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay \nhold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable \nwhen accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence frequent \ncollisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation, \nprompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the \ngovernment, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government \nsometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts through \npassion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated \nby pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace \noften, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or justification. \nIt leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealousy, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity, gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealousy to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery\n\n[[Page S797]]\n\nremote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, \nthe causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence \ntherefore it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial \nties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary \ncombinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rival-ship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements (I hold the maxim no less applicable \nto public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best \npolicy)--I repeat it therefore, let those engagements be observed in \ntheir genuine sense. But in my opinion it is unnecessary and would be \nunwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectably defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed--in \norder to give to trade a stable course, to define the rights of our \nmerchants, and to enable the government to support them--conventional \nrules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual \nopinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time \nabandoned or varied, as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \nconstantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for \ndisinterested favors from another--that it must pay with a portion of \nits independence for whatever it may accept under that character--that \nby such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given \nequivalents for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with \ningratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \nexpect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an \nillusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to \ndiscard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is that I have at least \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take--and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverence, and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress without interruption \nto that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give \nit, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\nGeo.

Mr. President, the Senate has a great deal to accomplish, \nincluding the long-delayed confirmation of former Senator Chuck Hagel \nto lead the Defense Department.\n  This week the Senate will also consider two plans to avert \ndevastating across-the-board cuts to military spending as well as \ndomestic initiatives that keep our American families and businesses \nstrong. To give our economy a foundation for growth, Congress must \nreplace these cuts--the so-called sequester--with a balanced approach \nto deficit reduction.\n  Democrats would temporarily replace this harsh austerity with a \ncombination of smart spending reductions and measures that close \ncorporate tax loopholes, end wasteful subsidies, and ask the wealthiest \nAmericans to pay a little bit more, and it would avoid harmful cuts \nthat will hurt American families, harm military readiness, and hinder \nour economic recovery. Families and businesses in every State of the \nNation--in red States and blue States--are at risk because of these \nhaphazard cuts.\n  In the Presiding Officer's home State of Virginia, 170 teachers who \nwork with disabled children could lose their jobs. That doesn't count \nany other teachers. Thousands of children will go without lifesaving \nvaccines--they will go without lifesaving vaccines--and 90,000 Pentagon \nemployees will be furloughed. It is easy to talk about furloughs unless \nyou are one of those people being furloughed. We don't know how many \ndays a week it will be, how many days a month it will be, but it will \nbe days.\n  In Nevada 120 teachers could lose their jobs. Local law enforcement \nagencies will lose essential funding to prosecute crime, and thousands \nof Defense Department employees will be furloughed, losing wages that \nsupport their families and our State's economy.\n  Residents of the Republican leader's home State would also suffer. \nKentucky will lose Federal funding that helps police catch and punish \ndomestic abusers, buys meals for needy seniors and keeps at-risk \nchildren in Head Start programs, and more than 11,000 Kentuckians who \nwork for the Defense Department will be furloughed.\n  Nationwide, sequester cuts will cost more than 750,000 jobs. More \nthan 70,000 boys and girls will be kicked out of their Head Start \nprograms. Meat inspectors, air traffic controllers, FBI officers, and \nBorder Patrol agents will be furloughed. Small businesses, which create \ntwo-thirds of all new jobs in this country, will lose access to crucial \nFederal loans. Thousands of researchers working to cure cancer, \ndiabetes, and scores of other life-threatening diseases will lose their \njobs.\n  But Congress has the power to prevent these self-inflicted wounds. We \nhave the power to turn off the sequester, protect American families and \nbusinesses, and ensure our national defense.\n  In the House and in the Senate, Republicans and Democrats voted to \nimpose these cuts. It will take Republicans and Democrats working \ntogether to avert them. Twenty-eight Republicans in the Senate and 174 \nRepublicans in the House voted to impose these painful cuts. To say \nthis is President Obama's sequester is absolutely wrong: 174 \nRepublicans in the House voted for these cuts--that is more than 70 \npercent--and in the Senate more than 60 percent of the Republicans \nvoted for the sequester. So it is unfair to say it is the President's \nsequester. We did this together. This would not have passed but for the \noverwhelming vote of the Republicans in the House and in the Senate.\n  If those same Republicans would work with Democrats to find a \nbalanced way to reduce the deficit, Congress could avert the delayed \nsequester today--now. Unfortunately, Republicans would rather let the \ndeficit cuts go into effect than close a single wasteful tax loophole. \nThey would rather cut Medicare, education, and medical research than \nask a single millionaire to pay a single dollar more in taxes.\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans wants us to compromise before \ntheir neighbors, friends, and family members get pink slips or notices \nthat they can only work a few days this week or this month.\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans--including 56 percent of \nRepublicans--supports Democrats' balanced approach. It is all over the \ncountry. All over the country Americans favor this approach, a balanced \napproach, by a large margin, including 56 percent of Republicans.\n  So once again the only Republicans in the entire country rejecting a \nreasonable, balanced compromise are Republicans in this building--\nRepublicans in Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S798-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, last week, about the time Congress \nrecessed, the President's immigration plan was leaked to the press and \nwas commented on generally. A group of Senators here have been trying \nto work on a comprehensive plan and expressed dismay at what it \ncontained and said it was not acceptable.\n  A brief review of the enforcement section of the President's \nimmigration plan confirms, I think, what my concern has been all along. \nIt is a smoking gun, in truth, that demonstrates this President is not \nserious about enforcement. That is where we are. Any immigration plan \nthis Nation implements has to be founded on the simple legal principle \nthat people can come to our country in generous numbers, as they always \nhave done, but they should wait their turn. There should be a lawful \nsystem. You can't have a lawful system if you are not prepared, not \nwilling, and not committed to ensuring that the laws are enforced.\n  What we have seen for the last several years is very dramatic. In \npoint after point, I, formerly a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 \nyears, can tell you it effectively neutralized the ability of our \ncurrent laws to be enforced.\n  This bill is confirmation the President hasn't had a change of heart. \nHe hasn't had a change of heart. They are continuing to talk as if they \nexpect and plan to establish a lawful system of immigration. When you \nget down to it and read the language of the legislation, it is not \nthere.\n  Here are some examples of what the President thinks amounts to \nenforcement. This is so sad. I will say, with absolute confidence, if \nthe President of the United States had done what he sort of said he was \ngoing to do in 2008 when he was running for office, he would make this \nlegal system work. If he had invested time, effort, leadership, moral \nauthority, and maybe a little more money--but it won't take a whole lot \nof money--and begin to show the kind of progress we need to have, show \na commitment he would work to enforce the law in the future, he would \nbe in a much better position to ask for a large reform of law.\n  Let's look at what his plan reveals. It explicitly, openly, and \ndirectly prohibits State and local governments from enforcing \nimmigration laws and from even asking someone for their immigration \nstatus.\n  We have former Governors here in the Senate, former State police \nsuperintendents--and I have dealt with this issue for a very long \ntime--that is a stunning development. There are only about maybe 20,000 \nFederal agents dealing with immigration. There are 600,000 State and \nlocal law enforcement officers, in every county, city, hamlet, and town \nin America who are the ones who come in contact every single day with \npeople in their areas for drunkenness, fighting, burglaries, and drugs. \nWhen they find somebody in the course of doing their duties, they \ndiscover people who are here illegally.\n  We want to have a relationship with them and to utilize their \ncapabilities. The Federal Government can then respond, identify the \nperson, and see\n\n[[Page S799]]\n\nwhat the truth is about their background. This eliminates that and \nsteps backward from some of the progress we have slowly made, some at \nmy insistence, over the last several years.\n  The proposal the President put forth eliminates the congressional \nrequirement that the Department of Homeland Security put in place a \nbiometric exit system for those who enter the country legally but \noverstay their visas. People come into the country on a visa and don't \never leave. Experts are telling us as many as 40 percent of the people \nwho are here illegally today overstayed their visas. They need to clock \nin when they come in, but there is no clocking out. We have no real \nidea who came and overstayed their visas.\n  The President's plan eliminates a legal requirement that has been in \nplace for approximately 17-plus years, which required a biometric exit \nsystem to clock out people when they come in. It is not hard to require \nthem to pay a few dollars to purchase a card, and when you exit, it \nwill be read like your credit card. You exit and you are clocked out. \nWe have some control over that.\n  The proposal from the President restricts the ability of Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement agencies to obtain information \nregarding whether a person is illegally present in the United States. \nThink about this. It would prohibit Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement agencies, particularly law enforcement agencies that need \nto know something about a person they may have come in contact with in \nthe course of their public safety duties, to know whether they are \nlegally in the country.\n  This means if a law enforcement agency is holding an illegal \nimmigrant for a criminal offense not deemed serious enough--a criminal \noffense, but somebody in Washington and Homeland Security said is not \nserious enough--the law enforcement agency cannot contact Federal \nauthorities.\n  This also means States with laws that require a determination of \nimmigration status will no longer be able to use Federal databases to \ndetermine if a person is eligible for a driver's license, for example. \nYou need to be able to turn somebody down for a driver's license if you \ncan't check to see if they are lawfully in the country.\n\n  This is something I have worked hard on over the years, for a decade. \nIt puts the final nail in the coffin of the 287(g) Program. That \nprogram states that State and local law enforcement officers are no \nlonger allowed to function as immigration officers.\n  We had a program the Federal Government did not want, really, the \npoliticians did not want to see happen. The law enforcement officers \nwanted it, and this was a program which would allow Federal immigration \nofficials to train State and local law officers--some of them at the \nprisons, some of them in State offices, some of them in regional \noffices--how to deal with people who are in the country illegally.\n  The average 19-year-old police officer in Middleburg, VA, or in \nMonroeville, AL, may arrest a mayor for fraud or assault, but needs to \ntake 2 weeks of training before he can be certified to arrest somebody \nillegally in the country, not even a citizen. This is the way it is \nworking in the real world. It had some beneficial aspects. It is \nsomething I supported and thought we should expand nationwide.\n  There are highly trained people within State law enforcement, \nofficers who are trying to cooperate with the Federal agents to try to \ncreate a system that will actually work. The President's plan would \napparently eliminate that.\n  The President's plan would allow private individuals to hire border \npatrol agents to protect them and their property, when it is the \nfederal government should be fulfilling its duty to protect them \nitself.\n  Is this a capitulation? You have a situation in which you are being \nbasically invaded, the sovereign territory of the United States. It is \nnot just a private individual's farm, ranch, property, it is U.S. \nterritory. It should be protected from those unlawfully able to go \nthere. They shouldn't have to hire their own police officers.\n  It includes a feel-good measure such as giving illegal immigrants \nfree legal representation and creating border community liaison \nofficers, in part to receive complaints about Border Patrol agents.\n  It allows the Attorney General to cancel deportation of criminal \naliens convicted of aggravated felonies if they do not serve a sentence \nof 5 or more years. The law says if you are convicted of offenses and \nyou are apprehended here illegally, you should be deported. It states \nthis is only for serious offenses and you received time in jail, \nFederal felony offenses.\n  The President's plan goes even farther than that. It says to the \nAttorney General, if they served less than 5 years, he may waive that \nand not follow the law and deport people who violated the law. It gives \nthe Attorney General authority to waive other legal requirements as \nwell.\n  The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is directed to \nprovide appropriate training to agents enforcing laws and goes into a \ngreat deal of training of civil rights and that sort of thing that is \nrequired.\n  There is no mention of interior enforcement. There are no measures to \nsecure our borders.\n  As I have stated, I have just begun to review this plan. What I have \nread causes me great concern and confirms the suspicions I have had all \nalong, which means when this legislation goes from some sort of outline \nthat sounds good in theory, the actual legislation is not going to be \nwhat it is promised to be. Why did I say that? Because it happened in \n2006 and 2007.\n  The bill did not fulfill the promises their sponsors made of it when \nit was carefully examined. When we saw that, the American people spoke \nout, and it went away.\n  If you don't have a lawful system that effectively requires \nenforcement of the law, you are not serious about protecting people in \nthis country from illegal workers who would take their jobs and have \nthe net effect of pulling down their wages.\n  We already have the problem that the President is suing States that \nwant to help the Federal Government enforce their laws. He has had his \nown United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents sue him, \nthe Director of ICE, and the Secretary of Homeland Security for \nblocking them from being able to do their legal duty to enforce the \nlaw. That is going forward. They voted unanimously no confidence in Mr. \nMorton, the head of the United States Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement agency. And there are a lot of other problems.\n  I want to say, in sum, we have just begun to review the President's \nleaked plan and there are massive holes in it. It reveals a continued \nagenda to simply not allow a lawful system of immigration to be \nestablished in America and, therefore, it is unacceptable. I believe \nand am afraid that same mentality will impact the negotiations. We will \nend up, no matter how hard people try, with an inability to reach an \nagreement on a kind of plan that will actually work.\n  What needs to happen is we need to continue our generous, historic \naffirmation of immigration where we welcome people to our country in \nnumbers that are very large, but we believe people should come \nlawfully. People who aren't entitled to come should not be allowed to \nenter. The people who come here should serve the national interest, not \nsome group's special interests. If we do that, we could be proud of \nthat system. I am so deeply disappointed that the President fails to \nmeet those qualifications.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S799-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S799-S800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BACHARACH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of Magistrate Judge Robert Bacharach of Edmond, OK, to be \nthe next judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Bacharach \nis well-qualified for this position and has received widespread support \nand accolades from across the State of Oklahoma, including members of \nacademia and members of both the Oklahoma and Federal Bar Associations. \nIn fact, last year, the Oklahoma Bar Association passed a resolution \npraising Judge Bacharach's legal abilities and supporting his \nconfirmation.\n\n[[Page S800]]\n\n  This broad array of support is indicative of his exceptional legal \nbackground. Judge Bacharach received his B.A., with high honors, from \nthe University of Oklahoma in 1981 and his J.D. from Washington \nUniversity School of Law in 1985. Judge Bacharach began his legal \ncareer as a law clerk for fellow Oklahoman, Chief Judge William J. \nHolloway, Jr., on the Tenth Circuit; thus, he is already quite familiar \nwith those chambers. Following his two-year clerkship, he joined the \noutstanding Oklahoma-based law firm Crowe & Dunlevy, becoming a \nshareholder in 1994. After 12 years of private practice, he was \nappointed by the judges of his district court as a United States \nMagistrate Judge for the Western District of Oklahoma where he \ncurrently presides. In addition to serving as a magistrate judge, Judge \nBacharach also served as an adjunct professor at the University of \nOklahoma School of Law and received a number of outstanding awards and \nrecognition for his years of scholarship and service.\n  In addition to his clear legal qualifications, even more important to \nmy decision to support Judge Bacharach's nomination are the strong \ntestimonies to his integrity and commitment to service outside of his \njudicial role. He is currently the Vice President of the Federal Bar \nAssociation (FBA) for the Tenth Circuit and formerly served the \nOklahoma City Chapter of the FBA as President, Vice President, and a \nmember of the Board of Directors.\n  Furthermore, Judge Bacharach serves the Oklahoma legal community \nbeyond his professional capacity. One of his primary areas of service \nto his colleagues is through his involvement with the Oklahoma Bar \nAssociation's Lawyers Helping Lawyers Committee, which helps attorneys \nwho are experiencing personal problems such as depression, alcoholism, \nand drug dependency. He has served on the committee for three years and \nalso joined the Board of Directors of the Lawyers Helping Lawyers \nFoundation. Judge Bacharach serves Oklahoma outside of the legal \nprofession as the Director and Executive Committee Member of Big \nBrothers Big Sisters of Greater Oklahoma City and on the Board of \nTrustees of the Temple B'nai Israel.\n  I believe Judge Bacharach will uphold the highest standards and \nreflect the best in the American judicial tradition by joining the \nTenth Circuit as a distinguished and respected member of the Oklahoma \nlegal community. The Judiciary Committee received many letters of \nsupport for Judge Bacharach's nomination, including recommendations \nfrom judges, deans and professors from Oklahoma law schools, several \nbar associations, and attorneys from Judge Bacharach's former law firm, \nCrowe & Dunlevy.\n  Equally important to Judge Bacharach's qualifications is his judicial \nphilosophy. I believe his record and his hearing testimony demonstrate \nthat he respects the limited role our founders intended judges and the \nfederal government to play in our constitutional democracy.\n  Based on all of these factors, I believe Judge Bacharach will be an \nexcellent addition to the Tenth Circuit, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport his nomination.\n  I offer my congratulations to Judge Bacharach and his family on this \nmomentous occasion of his confirmation and wish him well in his new \nendeavor.\n  Judge Bacharach's nomination got caught up in the political \nshenanigans the majority leader and the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee carried out at the end of the last Congress. Never before has \na circuit court nominee come to the floor without notification of the \nvery members of the Judiciary Committee who sponsored their nomination \nin the committee. So it was purely a political trick. And for that I \nthink the Senate owes Judge Bacharach an apology for the delay. I have \nno doubt he will be confirmed, and I doubt there will be anybody who \nwill vote against him.\n  That leads me to two other comments I wish to make. I have sat on the \nJudiciary Committee for four Supreme Court nominees, and so what I am \nabout to say may strike some people as hyperbole, but it is not. The \nfour Supreme Court nominees who appeared while I sat on the Judiciary \nCommittee displayed great qualities, and what I am about to say doesn't \ndiminish their characteristics or qualities at all, but I must say that \nJudge Bacharach has the two qualities that are at such a high level \nthat we should want each and every judge who sits on our Federal bench \nto have them.\n  The first is personal integrity. Now, those words are used a lot in \nour country, but this man has demonstrated it with his life, with his \ncommitments to other people, his commitment to helping other people, \nwith the way he spends his time, with his commitment to his family and \nto his faith. You cannot find a blemish on this man in terms of his \npersonal integrity, and very rarely can we say that about anybody. He \nis actually a stellar individual, exactly the type of individual our \nFounders had in mind, someone who has the kind of personal life that \nexemplifies the characteristics and qualities that built this country, \na love for the law, and an understanding that the rule of law is the \nglue that holds our society together.\n  That leads me to the second quality. I have interviewed a lot of \ncandidates for the Supreme Court and for judgeships and circuit court \npositions, and I have never met anybody who knows the Constitution, its \nlimitations, and its intent better than Judge Bacharach. I think he \nquite assuredly impressed every member of the Judiciary Committee with \nhis knowledge, his insight, and his background.\n  So Judge Bacharach brings together the two qualities that are so \nimportant and represent the upper end of all the candidates I have seen \nin my 9 years in the Senate of those whom we would ask to fulfill some \nof the most important positions in our country and in our society.\n  I believe Judge Bacharach is the first judge I will have voted for \nwhom I have no doubt of his absolute fidelity to the U.S. Constitution. \nSo I sleep well at night. I wish we had 100 Judge Bacharachs--100--to \nput on the bench today. I don't believe he can be influenced by \nanything other than stare decisis, precedence, and the U.S. \nConstitution and the statutes. His personal life gives reflection and \ninsight into how he is going to be a judge, how he will carry himself, \nhow he will act in this position of power. When you meet him, what you \nfind is one of the humblest of men with one of the greatest intellects \nI have ever known in my life.\n  So I will just say that I fully support his nomination. I \ncongratulate him because I know he is going to be approved, and I say, \nMr. President, bring us more Robert Bacharachs.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S800-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S800-S801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE LONG-TERM DEBT REDUCTION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it has been 1,398 days since the Senate \npassed a budget. People wonder why we are lurching from one budget \ncrisis to another one in Washington. The fact is this is not the only \ndeadline that has been missed. This year the President failed to \nsubmit, by February 4, his proposed budget. But the truth is even last \nyear when he submitted a budget, and it was voted on by the entire \nSenate, it received zero votes. In other words, it was not viewed as a \nreasonable and practical solution to the financial crisis that faces \nour country with $16.5 trillion in debt and 40 cents out of every \ndollar being spent by the Federal Government being borrowed from our \ncreditors.\n  Even before we reach the upcoming crisis which is known as the budget \nsequester--and I suggest most Americans would not consider a 2.4-\npercent cut in spending to be a crisis, but even before we reach this \nnext stage in the budget negotiations, we know President Obama has \nproposed the same old solution to every budgetary question; that is, to \nraise taxes even though on December 31, with the fiscal cliff \nnegotiations, we saw the President get his pound of flesh when it came \nto spending, and that is $600 billion in additional revenue.\n  But this does, indeed, seem like the Washington version of Groundhog \nDay.\n\n[[Page S801]]\n\nWe know the President has rejected his own bipartisan fiscal \ncommission's recommendations, the so-called Simpson-Bowles Commission \nrecommendation, and he has rejected budget proposals put forward by the \nHouse of Representatives. Even though our gross national debt has gone \nup by nearly $6 trillion under his watch, and even though it is \nprojected to go up another $9.5 trillion over the next decade, the \nPresident seems to be stuck on telling us it is only going to take a \nlittle bit more in taxes in order to solve the problem.\n  The American people understand we do not have a revenue problem, we \nhave a spending problem--spending money we do not have--and the only \nway to reduce our long-term debt burden is through reining in that \nspending. And not just the 39 percent of it which represents \ndiscretionary spending; we need to reform our entitlement programs, \nMedicare and Social Security, in order to preserve and to protect those \nprograms for future generations. Yet when we try to enact spending cuts \nor entitlement reforms, the President, unfortunately, has resorted to \nshameless fear mongering.\n  He is now warning that it will be the end of western civilization, or \nsomething like it, if we cut the Federal budget by 2.4 percent. When we \nconsider that Federal spending has gone up over 19 percent since 2008, \nand when we consider how much inefficient and duplicative and downright \nwasteful spending there is in the Federal Government, it is hard to \ntake this argument seriously.\n  For example, no one should be talking about raising more taxes from \nthe American people on top of the $600 billion that was extracted as a \nresult of the fiscal cliff negotiations. No one should be talking about \nraising more taxes when the Federal Government made more than $220 \nbillion in improper payments over the last 2 years--that's right, $220 \nbillion in improper payments in the last 2 years--and this is just one \nexample of costly government waste.\n  The President does not appear to believe in the urgency of the \nmoment. He does not appear to believe that our country is headed for a \ntrue crisis. We all know interest rates are at historically low levels \nat this time. If interest rates were to go up just 1 percent or 2 \npercent more, for each percentage increase it would represent more than \n$1 trillion in additional interest we would have to pay on our debt. It \nis easy to see if interest rates were to go back up to historic norms, \n4 or 5 percent, that very quickly we would lose control of our \nfinancial system, and we would be able to do little more than pay \ninterest on the debt and pay for Medicare and Social Security.\n  Both Senate Republicans and Democrats have shown that they understand \nthe nature of the crisis we have before us, but we believe it is \nimperative that we support a budget that reduces our long-term debt.\n  The only way we can see a significant path forward to debt reduction \nis if the President joins us in these important negotiations. \nUnfortunately, so far, the President seems truly allergic to genuine \nbipartisan compromise.\n  Until the Obama administration, virtually every landmark domestic \npolicy change in American history was achieved with bipartisan support. \nWe all understand that; it cannot happen any other way. For example, \nboth the 1935 Social Security Act and the 1964 Civil Rights Act were \nsigned by a Democratic President and supported by large majorities of \nSenate Republicans. The 1996 Welfare Reform Act signed by President \nClinton was backed by every single Member of the Republican Senate \ncaucus, along with the majority of Senate Democrats.\n  Likewise, during the Reagan years, most Senate Democrats voted for \nthe 1983 Social Security amendments, and a whopping 94 percent of \nSenate Democrats voted for the 1986 Tax Reform Act. Under President \nGeorge W. Bush 84 percent of Senate Democrats voted for No Child Left \nBehind.\n  In other words, Presidents have traditionally understood that reform \nand results take leadership and only then will bipartisan support \nfollow. Yet the President seems to neglect this obvious fact and \ninstead prefers to continue what seems like a perpetual campaign and \nknock down straw men rather than actually doing something about our \nskyrocketing debt.\n  Real debt reduction will require Presidential leadership, the kind of \nleadership that President Clinton displayed in 1993 when he convinced \n47 percent of Senate Democrats and 40 percent of House Democrats to \ndefy organized labor and support the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. Since then, U.S. trade with Canada has nearly tripled, and \nU.S. trade with Mexico has increased almost sixfold.\n  My hope is that the President will ultimately show the kind of \nleadership we have seen throughout this Nation's history when we are \nconfronted with big challenges. He has acknowledged the need for \nserious reform.\n  I believe he understands the problem perfectly: We cannot preserve \nand protect Social Security and Medicare unless we deal with those \nprograms now. Yet he has never acted on his words, instead choosing to \nengage in the perpetual campaign.\n  As a result, Washington keeps spending money it doesn't have and \nsaddling our children with more debt. Meanwhile our safety-net programs \nare spiraling toward a collapse that will leave the poor and elderly \neven more vulnerable. It is time for a change, and it is time for the \nPresident to take his rhetoric about debt reduction and turn it into \nreal meaningful reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S801-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S801-S802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, as I have every year since I came to the \nSenate, I rise to commemorate Black History Month. This year, we are \nprivileged to recognize Bill Strickland, a man whose approach is unique \nand whose accomplishments are of great consequence to African-\nAmericans, and in fact, to all Americans. From the age of 19, Bill \nStrickland has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of those living \nin poverty, to give them a setting they can thrive in and a future they \ncan take pride in.\n  Bill grew up in the Manchester neighborhood of Pittsburgh, on the \ncity's north side. Prior to the decline of industry in the city in the \nmid-1960s, Manchester was a solid, working class community. But by the \ntime Bill was in high school, the area around him had slid into urban \ndecay and instability. Though surrounded by poverty, Bill's mother was \ndetermined to provide a safe environment for her family. And though she \ndidn't have a high school diploma herself, Bill's mother held firm to \nthe belief that a good education was the ticket to a better life. At \nOliver High School, when he began his senior year Bill had neither \nplans for after graduation or a clear picture of what his future might \nlook like.\n  Then one day while walking down the hallway at school, Bill was \nattracted by the smell of fresh coffee. The coffee, along with the \nsounds of jazz, led Bill to the art room in Oliver High where he \nwatched a pot being formed from a mound of clay on a turntable. Seated \nat the potter's wheel was Frank Ross, Oliver High's art teacher who \nwould become Bill's close friend and mentor. Over the next year, in the \ncalm atmosphere of Frank's well-lit art studio, Bill would develop a \ntalent for ceramics. As importantly, it provided a safe and stable \nsanctuary from the chaos of the streets. At the potter's wheel Bill \nfound his passion, and although he didn't know it yet, he was also \nforming the beginning of a vision that would become Manchester Bidwell \nCorporation.\n  In 1967, Bill graduated from Oliver High School and, at the instance \nof Frank Ross, applied to the University of Pittsburgh where he was \naccepted, but only as a probationary student. Although he had begun his \nstudies full-time, Bill never lost the connection with his \nneighborhood. In the summer of 1968, as Manchester grappled with the \nracial tensions that swept many inner cities, Bill decided to open an \narts center in his neighborhood. He had seen the power a bright, \norderly, safe place like Frank Ross' studio and the artistic work done \nthere had had on his own life. He wanted to give the young people of \nManchester a place where they too could escape the effects of economic \nand social devastation and experience something beautiful. A \nconversation with a young minister working in the area led Bill to his \nfirst $25,000 in funding and the Manchester\n\n[[Page S802]]\n\nCraftsmen's Guild was born as an after-school art program in a donated \nrow house on Buena Vista Street. It was not an overnight success, but \nBill never gave up. When young people in the neighborhood weren't \nimmediately taken with ceramics, Bill redoubled his efforts, hitting \nthe streets to reach out to as many people as possible and bring them \nto his center. People noticed Bill's efforts and the popularity of the \nGuild grew. As more people came to the center, the center needed more \nclay, more wheels, and Bill needed to secure more funding.\n\n  Along the way, an interesting phenomenon occurred. Teachers began \nnoticing that their students who regularly went to the Guild were doing \nbetter academically and behaving better in school. Without intending \nto, Bill had stumbled across a simple, yet empowering, philosophy--\nenvironment shapes people's lives. By providing a safe space for the \nManchester youth, and by introducing them to the beauty of the arts, \nBill was simultaneously inspiring a large-scale change in his \ncommunity.\n  Despite starting as a probationary student, Bill graduated from Pitt \ncum laude with a BA in History in 1970. Bill continued to work with the \nManchester Craftmen's Guild and a few years after graduation, he became \ndirector of the Bidwell Training Center, a school whose mission was to \nprovide education in the building trades disadvantaged and dislocated \nworkers. When Bill assumed his role as head of Bidwell, what he \ndiscovered was a dilapidated warehouse in a seedy parking lot and a \n$300,000 back tax bill from the IRS. But Bill saw its potential and \ndidn't give up. Bill began to transform Bidwell into a forward-thinking \nschool that offered its students a real chance to dramatically improve \ntheir lives. He realized that the changing job market required less \nfocus on construction trades and redirected Bidwell's focus to the \nhightech and medical industries. He also forged important partnerships \nwith corporations like IBM, Heinz) and Bayer to design curriculums that \nwould train the workers that employers needed. While he worked to \nimprove the staff and the quality of the education, the nature of \nBidwell's funding meant that Bill could not address what he saw as one \nof the institutions central flaws: The building. With funding for \nsocial projects harder to come by in the 1980s, Bill was forced to lay-\noff nearly one-third of his staff just to make payroll. But despite the \nset-back, in his own eyes, Bill's vision was clearer than ever. Bill \nrealized that what he needed to make Bidwell succeed was a center of \nwhich students, faculty, and neighbors could be proud.\n  To achieve his dream, Bill contacted legendary Pittsburgh architect \nTasso Kastelas, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, to design a world \nclass center in one of the worst neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. For \n$10,000, Bill commissioned the architect to build a model of what would \nlater become the home of the Manchester Bidwell Corporation, as the \ncombined programs of the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild and the Bidwell \nTraining Center would come to be known. Bill had a vision for his \nbuilding and the conviction that the future of his cause lay in its \nconstruction. Just as he had done before, Bill took it upon himself to \nturn his dream into a reality and spearheaded a $6.5 million capital \ncampaign. Model in hand, he implored the Pittsburgh corporate community \nto help fund his dream. When the city's corporate donors, who had \nsupported him previously, told him that Manchester didn't need such a \nspectacular center, he told them in no uncertain terms that it did. \nWhen he was told he needed matching funds to obtain his corporate \npledges, he turned to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for additional \nsupport.\n  In 1986 the new 62,000 square foot arts and career training center \nopened. Originally the center consisted of studios as well as \nclassrooms, workshops, gallery spaces, and a 350-seat auditorium. Over \nthe years the building has expanded as Bill's vision expanded. In 1987 \nthe jazz hall, which has seen performances from the likes of Dizzy \nGillespie and Nancy Wilson, was added and in 2003 the 40,000 square \nfoot state-of-the-art greenhouse opened. The center currently provides \ntraining in fields as varied as gourmet food preparation, chemical, \noffice, and medical technologies, and education arts programming in \nceramics, design arts, digital arts, and photography.\n  Bill's center and his students success stories are a testament to the \npower of social entrepreneurship. What began as a mission to provide an \nescape from the ghetto has produced unparalleled results in educational \nempowerment and community growth. Manchester Craftsmen's Guild ``Youth \nin Arts'' is a program that strives to educate and inspire urban young \npeople through the arts. Ninety-three of the high school students who \nparticipate in the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild ``Youth in Arts'' \nprogram graduate from high school, a noticeable improvement over the \nnational graduation rate of 75.5 percent. The Bidwell Training Center \nhas changed lives by providing market-driven career training to \ndisadvantaged adults in transition. Its training programs continue to \nplace skilled technicians in middle-class jobs at companies such as \nBayer, Mylan Labs, and Heinz. MCG Jazz, Manchester-Bidwell's record \nlabel, has been nominated for seven Grammy awards and has brought four \nhome to Pittsburgh. The orchids grown in the facility's greenhouse have \nwon Best in Show at a Western Pennsylvania orchid fair and are even \navailable for purchase at Whole Foods. And while they are learning \nmedical coding or how to center clay, each student is fed a gourmet \nlunch prepared by culinary students in the center's top-of-the-line \nkitchen.\n\n  Realizing the opportunity to strengthen other communities and effect \nchange on an even larger scale by using the Manchester Bidwell model of \ncommunity and educational development as a template, Bill helped found \nthe National Center for Arts and Technology to replicate the Manchester \nBidwell education model across the nation. NCAT collaborates with local \nnonprofits and businesses to assess their community's needs and then \nworks together with the community to design a fitting center for arts \nand technology. Bill's Pittsburgh model has been replicated in San \nFrancisco, Cincinnati, Cleveland, New Haven, Connecticut and Grand \nRapids, MI. He gained some powerful backers including Jeff Skoll, \nfounder of eBay and the Skoll Foundation. The Skoll Foundation was one \nof Bill's earlier investors; it recognized the potential of his \nprograms to drive large scale positive social change by using \nentrepreneurial discipline and methods. With the Skoll Foundation's \nhelp, Bill clarified his sales pitch--that he could help solve problems \nfaced in communities, had a strategic business plan showing the \nbenefits of working together, and offering people meaning and hope \nthrough transforming experiences.\n  Bill has said that ``environment determines behavior'' and he has \ncreated a remarkable environment where men and women living in poverty \nare treated with dignity and respect. Knowing firsthand that poverty \ncreates self-defeating assumptions and restrictive labels but does not \ndefine a person's potential, Bill has dedicated his life to changing \nthe lives of others by offering them hope, meaning, and belief in the \npower of their own creative possibilities. Bill's methods might be \nunconventional, but his results are success stories of epic \nproportions. And so in the Senate today we express our gratitude to \nBill for never giving up on the poor kids or his vision. His passion \nand his belief in the abilities of each and every individual that walks \nthrough his doors has touched lives far beyond Manchester and, thanks \nto his tireless efforts, truly has the potential to reach around the \nworld.\n  I thank Bill Strickland for his contribution to the City of \nPittsburgh, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This week, the country is facing indiscriminate across-\nthe-board cuts from sequestration if Congress does not come to an \nagreement. The automatic cuts that will otherwise occur are in the tens \nof billions of dollars at a time when our economy is finally recovering \nbut remains fragile. Among those who will have to endure these cuts are \nthe overburdened Federal courts that are already suffering from \nlongstanding vacancies that number almost 90. Budgetary cuts will mean \nmore difficulty for the American people to get speedy justice from our \nFederal justice system.\n  According to the sequestration report released by the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the sequestration would lead to a $555 million \nreduction for our Federal courts. Despite their higher caseloads and \nthe needs of the American people, the courts' funding will be capped at \na level last utilized 6 years ago. This could result in elimination of \nnearly one third of the courts' staff, as many as 6,300 employees, or \nmonth-long furloughs system wide. The sequester will result in cuts \nthat will force courts to hear fewer cases and hear them more slowly. \nCourt proceedings will be delayed. Some 30,000 civil cases have already \nbeen pending for more than 3 years and this will only exacerbate the \nproblems of delay. Sequestration cuts could even result in the \nsuspension of civil jury trials in some courts. And consider that if \nprobation and pretrial services offices are affected, that can mean \nthat defendants in pretrial release and those convicted but not in \nprison may not be properly supervised.\n  Sequestration is bad for the courts, bad for the economy and bad for \nthe American people.\n  Today, after an unprecedented filibuster, Senate Republicans will \nfinally allow a vote on the nomination of Robert Bacharach to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Judge Bacharach should be a \nconsensus nominee. He received the ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary's highest possible rating of well qualified. He was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote last year and, again, \nthis year. Despite his experience, qualifications and bipartisan \nsupport, he was filibustered by Senate Republicans since July last \nyear.\n  The filibuster of his nomination, which was supported by the Oklahoma \nSenators who had previously supported the nomination and who will \nlikely reverse themselves again and support confirmation today, was the \nne plus ultra of an unprecedented campaign of obstruction Senate \nRepublicans have waged against President Obama's judicial nominees. \nThat obstruction has spread to executive nominees, as well, including \nthe nomination of Chuck Hagel, a recent Republican Senator from \nNebraska whose nomination to serve as Secretary of Defense was \nfilibustered earlier this month.\n  Judge Bacharach is the kind of nominee who every Senator should \nsupport. Over his 13-year career as a U.S. Magistrate Judge in the \nWestern District of Oklahoma, he has handled nearly 3,000 civil and \ncriminal matters, presided over 400 judicial settlement conferences, \nand issued more than 1,600 reports and recommendations. As an attorney \nin private practice, he tried 10 cases to verdict, argued two cases \nbefore the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, and briefed scores of other \ncases to the Tenth Circuit and the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n  Judge Bacharach's judicial colleagues in the Western District of \nOklahoma stand strongly behind his nomination. Vicki Miles-LaGrange, \nChief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nOklahoma, has said of Judge Bacharach:\n\n       He is an outstanding jurist and my colleagues and I \n     enthusiastically and wholeheartedly recommend him for the \n     Tenth Circuit position. . . . We knew that we were lucky to \n     have Bob as a Magistrate Judge, and he's been remarkable in \n     this position for over 12 years. He is an absolutely great \n     Magistrate Judge. His research and writing are excellent, his \n     temperament is superb, his preparation is top-notch, and he \n     is a wonderful colleague to all of the judges and in general \n     to the entire court family. . . . All of the other judges and \n     I--Republicans and Democrats alike--enthusiastically and \n     wholeheartedly recommend Judge Bob Bacharach for the Tenth \n     Circuit position. All of us believe very strongly that Judge \n     Bacharach would be a superb choice for the position.\n\n  Throughout the careful and deliberate process in which Judge \nBacharach has been thoroughly vetted, considered, and voted on by the \nJudiciary Committee, I have not heard a single negative word about him. \nThere is no Senator who opposed his nomination on the merits. He was \npraised extensively by his home State Senators. Senator Inhofe has said \nof him:\n\n       I believe Judge Bacharach would continue the strong service \n     Oklahomans have provided the Tenth Circuit. Throughout his \n     career and education, he's distinguished himself. In 2007, \n     the Oklahoma City Journal Record profiled Judge Bacharach as \n     an example of leadership in law, where he simply stated that \n     as a future goal he intends to improve. Always working to \n     improve has defined Judge Bacharach. . . . [H]is colleagues \n     have characterized his service as remarkable, demonstrating \n     superb judicial temperament, and a real asset to the Western \n     District court family and legal community.\n\n  Senator Coburn said:\n\n       Judge Bacharach is well qualified for this position and has \n     received widespread praise and hearty recommendations from \n     Oklahomans, including members of academia and fellow members \n     of the bar. . . . I believe that Judge Bacharach will uphold \n     the highest standards and reflect the best in our American \n     judicial tradition by coming to the bench as a well-regarded \n     member of the community. At a time when our country seems as \n     divided as ever, it is important that citizens respect \n     members of the judiciary and are confident they will \n     faithfully and impartially apply the law. . . . I believe \n     Judge Bacharach would be an excellent addition to the Tenth \n     Circuit.\n\n  Unfortunately, along with 42 other Senate Republicans, Senator Inhofe \nand Senator Coburn filibustered Judge Bacharach since last July. The \npeople of Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming have \nbeen needlessly denied his service as a Tenth Circuit judge for 7 \nmonths. Republican Senators in Oklahoma, Kansas, Utah and Wyoming could \nhave prevented the filibuster but went along with the obstruction that \nserved no good purpose and established another damaging precedent: \nJudge Bacharach is the first circuit court nominee to be filibustered \nwho had received bipartisan support before the Judiciary Committee. \nSenator Coburn was quoted last year admitting: ``There's no reason why \nhe shouldn't be confirmed.'' There was none other than the obstruction \nof Senate Republicans.\n  Their partisan obstruction was wrong, and it is damaging to our \nNation's courts and the American people. The nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service has reported that the median time circuit nominees \nhave had to wait before a Senate vote has skyrocketed from 18 days for \nPresident Bush's nominees to 132 days for President Obama's. This is \nthe result of Republicans' partisan obstruction.\n  This obstruction has contributed to the damagingly high level of \njudicial vacancies that has persisted for over 4 years. Persistent \nvacancies force fewer judges to take on growing caseloads, and make it \nharder for Americans to have access to speedy justice. While Senate \nRepublicans delayed and obstructed, the number of judicial vacancies \nremained historically high and it has become more difficult for our \ncourts to provide speedy, quality justice for the American people. \nThere are today 89 judicial vacancies across the country. By way of \ncontrast, that is more than double the number of vacancies that existed \nat this point in the Bush administration. The circuit and district \njudges that we have been able to confirm over the last four years fall \nmore than 30 short of the total for President Bush's first term.\n  Over the last 4 years, Senate Republicans have chosen to depart \ndramatically from Senate traditions in their\n\n[[Page S804]]\n\nefforts to delay and obstruct President Obama's judicial nominations. \nUntil 2009, Senators who filibustered circuit court nominees generally \nhad reasons to do so, and were willing to explain those reasons. When \nSenate Democrats filibustered President Bush's most extreme circuit \ncourt nominees, it was over substantive concerns about the nominees' \nrecords and Republicans' disregard for the rights of Democratic \nSenators as they unfairly short-circuited the process of consideration \nover and over again. On the other hand, Senate Republicans have \nfilibustered and delayed nearly all of President Obama's circuit court \nnominees even when those nominees have the support of their Republican \nhome state Senators and their rights have been fully protected in a \nfair consideration process.\n  Until 2009, when a judicial nominee had been reported by the \nJudiciary Committee with bipartisan support, they were generally \nconfirmed quickly. Until 2009, we observed regular order, usually \nconfirmed nominees promptly, and we cleared the Senate Executive \nCalendar before long recesses. Until 2009, if a nominee was \nfilibustered, it was almost always because of a substantive issue with \nthe nominee's record. We know what has happened since 2009. The average \ndistrict court nominee is stalled 4.3 times longer and the average \ncircuit court nominee is stalled 7.3 times as long as it took to \nconfirm them during the Bush administration. No other President's \njudicial nominees had to wait an average of over 100 days for a Senate \nvote after being reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Senate Republicans have also forced the Majority Leader to file \ncloture on 30 nominees, which is already in 4 years 50 percent more \nnominees than had cloture filed during President Bush's eight years in \noffice. Almost all of these 30 nominations were noncontroversial and \nwere ultimately confirmed overwhelmingly. Fewer than 80 percent of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees have been confirmed compared to \nalmost 90 percent of President George W. Bush's nominees at this point \nin their Presidencies.\n  The record is clear: Senate Republicans have engaged in an \nunprecedented effort to obstruct President Obama's judicial \nnominations. Chief Justice Roberts, in his year-end Report on the \nFederal Judiciary in 2010 pointed to the ``[P]ersistent problem [that] \nhas developed in the process of filling judicial vacancies . . . This \nhas created acute difficulties for some judicial districts. Sitting \njudges in those districts have been burdened with extraordinary \ncaseloads . . . There remains, however, an urgent need for the \npolitical branches to find a long-term solution to this recurring \nproblem.'' Despite bipartisan calls to address longstanding judicial \nvacancies, Senate Republicans have continued their unwarranted \nobstruction of judicial confirmations. In the case of Judge Bacharach, \nthere was not even a pretense of any substantive concern--Senate \nRepublicans just decided to shut down the confirmation process and \ncontorted the ``Thurmond rule.''\n  At a time when judicial vacancies have again risen to almost 90, we \nmust do more for our overburdened courts. It is past time for the \npartisan obstruction to end. We have a long way to go. After 4 years of \ndelay and obstruction, we remain far behind the pace of confirmations \nwe set during President Bush's administration, and there remain far too \nmany judicial vacancies that make it harder for Americans to have their \nday in court. During President Bush's entire second term, the 4 years \nfrom 2004 through 2008, vacancies never exceeded 60. Since President \nObama's first full month in office, and as far into the future as we \ncan see, there have never been fewer than 60 vacancies, and for much of \nthat time many, many more. The Senate must do much more to fill these \nvacancies and make real progress.\n  The Senate today will finally vote on the nomination of Robert \nBacharach. He has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge on the United \nStates District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma since 1999. \nPreviously, from 1987 to 1999, he was in private practice at the \nOklahoma City law firm of Crowe & Dunlevy, P.C. From 1985 to 1987, he \nserved as a law clerk to Judge William J. Holloway, Jr. of the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the same court to which he has \nbeen nominated. Judge Bacharach was twice reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee by voice vote--last June and again this month.\n  The Judiciary Committee has been working to vet, consider, and report \nnominees, and just before the recess we reported another dozen circuit \nand district nominees, all of whom had to be renominated from last \nyear. The longest pending of these nominations is that of Caitlin \nHalligan, who the President first nominated to the D.C. Circuit back in \n2010. At that time, there were already two vacancies on that court, a \nnumber which has now doubled to four. The purported justification for \nthe partisan Republican filibuster of the Halligan nomination was that \nthe circuit did not need another judge. The circuit is now more than \none-third vacant and needs several, including Caitlin Halligan. I urge \nthat the Senate act quickly on long-pending nominations. Further delay \ndoes not serve the interests of the American people. Hardworking \nAmericans deserve better.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Robert E. \nBacharach, nominated to be United States Circuit Judge for the Tenth \nCircuit. Mr. Bacharach's nomination was pending before the Senate last \nyear. In accordance with Senate custom and practice, the nomination was \nplaced on hold, along with other circuit judge nominations, pending the \noutcome of the 2012 Presidential election. Unfortunately, the \nnomination was subjected to some unnecessary political theater when a \ncloture motion was filed and defeated last July.\n  It is well-known that the practice and tradition of the Senate is to \nstop confirming circuit judge nominees in the closing months of a \nPresidential election year. One has to go back 20 years to find a \nPresidential election year when the Senate approved a circuit court \njudge in the latter part of the year. Of course, the rationale has been \nthat whoever wins that election should be the one to pick these \nlifetime nominees who will run our judiciary system.\n  A Congressional Research Service report on this subject stated:\n\n       The Senator who most frequently has asserted the existence \n     of a Thurmond rule has been the current chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee.\n\n  The CRS report noted that on March 7, 2008, the chairman recalled:\n\n       When President Reagan was running for President and Senator \n     Thurmond, then in the Republican minority as ranking member \n     of the Judiciary Committee, instituted a policy to stall \n     President Carter's nominations. That policy, known as the \n     ``Thurmond Rule,'' was put in when the Republicans were in \n     the minority. It is a rule that we still follow, and it will \n     take effect very soon here.\n\n  Again, this was in March of that Presidential election year, not June \nor July. So that rule was very carefully laid out March 7, 2008--that \nthey didn't intend to approve any more nominees after that point.\n  CRS went on to note the strong support the majority leader has \nexpressed for the so-called Thurmond rule. According to CRS:\n\n       Senator Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, has \n     expressed agreement with Senator Leahy about the existence of \n     a Thurmond rule. In April 10, 2008, floor remarks, Senator \n     Reid said, In a Presidential election year, it is always very \n     tough for judges. That is the way it has been for a long \n     time, and that is why we have the Thurmond rule and other \n     such rules.\n\n  Five days later, the Majority Leader said:\n\n       You know, there is a Thurmond doctrine that says: After \n     June, we will have to take a real close look at judges in a \n     Presidential election year.\n\n  These quotes indicate not only the expectation, but in fact a support \nfor slowing down and cutting off the confirmation of judges in a \nPresidential election year.\n  Even setting aside the so-called Leahy-Thurmond rule, by any \nobjective measure, President Obama has been treated fairly.\n  For example, with regard to the total number of confirmations, we \nconfirmed 171 district and circuit nominations during President Obama's \nfirst term. We also confirmed two Supreme Court nominations during \nPresident Obama's first term. When Supreme Court nominations are \npending in the committee, all other work on nominations is put on hold.\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\n  The last time the Senate confirmed two Supreme Court nominees was \nduring President Bush's second term, and during that term the Senate \nconfirmed a total of only 119 district and circuit court nominees.\n  Let me put it another way. Under similar circumstances when Supreme \nCourt nominees were considered--the Senate confirmed 52 more district \nand circuit nominees for President Obama than for President Bush.\n  During the 2008 Presidential election year, the Senate confirmed a \ntotal of 28 judges--24 district and 4 circuit. During the 2012 \nPresidential election year the Senate greatly exceeded those numbers, \nhaving confirmed a total of 49 judges--44 district and 5 circuit. In \nfact, President Obama's confirmations during the 2012 election year \nexceed the previous five Presidential election years.\n  Furthermore, President Obama has the highest percentage of circuit \nconfirmations over the past four Presidential terms. With regard to \ndistrict confirmations, President Obama had more during the 112th \nCongress that in any of the previous eight Congresses, going back to \n1994.\n  So those who say that this President is being treated differently \neither fail to recognize history or want to ignore the facts, or both.\n  With regard to today's nomination, I would like to say a few words \nabout the nominee. I expect he will be approved and congratulate him on \nhis confirmation.\n  Judge Bacharach graduated from University of Oklahoma with a B.A. in \n1981 and earned his J.D. from the Washington University School of Law \nin 1985. Upon graduation, Judge Bacharach served as a law clerk from \n1985 to 1987 to the Honorable William J. Holloway, Jr. on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. After completion of his \nclerkship, he was hired as an associate at Crowe & Dunlevy, where he \nbecame a shareholder in 1994. He remained at the firm until becoming a \nU.S. magistrate judge in 1999. At Crowe & Dunlevy, he primarily \npracticed in commercial litigation, focusing on antitrust and franchise \nlitigation. He also handled a considerable number of cases involving \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, from 1996 to 1998.\n  From 1997 to 1999, Judge Bacharach served as an adjunct professor of \nlaw at the University Of Oklahoma School Of Law. During this period, he \nwas a coinstructor for a class titled ``Civil Pretrial Litigation.''\n  In 1999, the U.S. district judges for the Western District of \nOklahoma appointed Judge Bacharach to be a U.S. magistrate judge. As a \nmagistrate judge, he manages all aspects of the pretrial process in \ncivil and criminal cases: conducting evidentiary hearings, ruling on \nnondispositive motions, making reports and recommendations regarding \ndispositive motions, and issuing criminal complaints, search warrants, \nand arrest warrants.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that we have just \nconfirmed Judge Bacharach. He is going to make a great Federal judge. I \nhave just been real pleased, I have to admit; I was literally running \nfrom the airport to get here because they had plane troubles, and I saw \nSenator Pryor was in the same situation. So let me, first of all, thank \nthe leadership for holding that vote open so I would not find myself in \nthe embarrassing position of not voting to confirm my best friend from \nOklahoma. So we are in that situation.\n  Let me just say that I am very proud of him. He actually started on \nthe Tenth Circuit as a clerk. So he really knows this stuff. He has \nbeen there for a long time. As part of his profile, as a future goal, \nhe intended to improve. He has actually made that statement. I believe \n``always working to improve'' has been a defining characteristic of \nJudge Bacharach's career.\n  He graduated in the top 4 percent of his class in law school. He \nreceived all kinds of academic awards and maintained memberships in the \nhighest orders of law school students. He began his legal scholarship \non Law Review and has continued writing in a number of law journals.\n  As I said, he actually started in the Tenth Circuit working as a law \nclerk for the chief judge. So he knows that circuit. I do not think \nthere is anyone out there who would know it better.\n  Judge Bacharach has multiple years of litigation experience working \nfor the firm Crowe and Dunlevy in Oklahoma City and in public service \nas a Federal magistrate for the U.S. District Court in the Western \nDistrict of Oklahoma. As evidence of his career of distinction, when \nJudge Bacharach was chosen to be a magistrate judge from a pool of many \nwell-qualified candidates, the chief judge characterized the decision \nas ``an easy one.''\n  Since that time his colleagues have characterized his service as \nremarkable, demonstrating superb judicial temperament, and being a real \nasset to the Western District family and the\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\nlegal community. As with any position in the judicial branch that comes \nwith a lifetime appointment, the Senate must deliberate carefully; and \nwe did and gave all the thought to this nominee, as was shown, clearly \ndemonstrated by a unanimous vote for confirmation. You do not see this \nvery often, but you saw it with Judge Bacharach.\n  So I appreciate the opportunity to support him today and to have been \nable to call and be the first to congratulate him in this new part of \nhis career, of which we are going to be very proud. I can assure the \nPresiding Officer and all the rest of us this is a guy of whom we will \nalways be proud.\n  So I say congratulations to Judge Bacharach. You are going to do a \ngreat job. We will depend on that, and we will be watching to make sure \nthat happens.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Less than 7 years ago, Republicans and Democrats in the \nSenate and in the House of Representatives joined together to \nreauthorize key expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. \nWe explained and documented our findings that this landmark civil \nrights law was still needed because of continuing discrimination and to \npreserve the progress that had been made. Because of this extensive \nrecord and the acceptance of the Voting Rights Act's importance in our \ncountry, our 2006 reauthorization of this crucial law was marked by \nMembers of Congress from both parties and from every corner of the \nNation coming together to renew one of the cornerstones of American \nDemocracy.\n  It is a sad irony that on the same day we will be honoring Civil \nRights icon Rosa Parks by unveiling her statue in the U.S. Capitol, the \nfirst full statue of an African American to stand in the halls of \nCongress, across the street the Supreme Court will be hearing arguments \nfrom those challenging the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act \nreauthorization named in part for her. In the pending case, the \nchallengers seek to strike down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act even \nthough that critical section has protected constitutional guarantees \nagainst discrimination in voting where 100 years of prior civil rights \nlaws failed. The Supreme Court got it right four years ago when it \nupheld the constitutional authority of Congress to reauthorize Section \n5 against a similar challenge. Neither the words of the Constitution \nnor the importance of these critical provisions for protecting the \nright to vote has changed in the last four years. Under the specific \nwords of the 14th and 15th Amendments, Congress has the power to remedy \ndiscrimination and enforce the Amendments by enacting laws that address \nracial discrimination in connection with voting. That is what we did \nnearly unanimously less than 7 years ago. And over the past year lower \ncourts have repeatedly upheld both its constitutionality and its \nprotections. In light of the lengthy court findings from just the last \nyear, there can be no doubt that the operation of the Voting Rights Act \nis continuing to protect American voters from discrimination.\n  In his historic ``I Have a Dream'' speech, Martin Luther King, Jr. \nproclaimed: ``When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent \nwords of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they \nwere signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall \nheir.'' The Voting Rights Act is one of our most important means for \nenforcing this promise and upholding the Constitution's guarantee of \nequal rights and equal protection of the law. Reauthorizing and \nrestoring the Voting Rights Act was the right thing to do, not only for \nthose who fought and bled for its passage but also for those who come \nafter us--our children and our grandchildren. We owe it to them to \ncontinue our commitment to this vital Act. No one's right to vote \nshould be abridged, suppressed or denied in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  As we celebrate Black History Month and the significant progress we \nhave made as a Nation, let us not forget the promissory note to future \ngenerations and the continuing need for civil rights laws such as the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  Our Nation has grown stronger since its Founding as more Americans \nhave been able to exercise their right to vote. The actions taken by \nprevious generations--through a Civil War, through Constitutional \namendments, and through the long struggles of the civil rights \nmovement--have worked to break down barriers that stood in the way of \nall Americans participating in our Democracy.\n  It has not been an easy road. The pervasive discriminatory tactics \nthat led to the original Voting Rights Act were deeply rooted. As a \nnation, this effort to ensure equal protection dates back more than 140 \nyears to the ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1870, the last of \nthe post-Civil War Reconstruction amendments. Yet, it took 95 years \nfrom the passage of the 15th Amendment and a historic struggle for \ncivil rights for people of all races to begin the effective exercise of \nthe rights guaranteed by that Amendment. The struggle reached a crucial \nturning point on March 7, 1965, on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, \nAL, when state troopers brutally attacked John Lewis and his fellow \ncivil rights marchers who were trying to exercise their civil rights. \nThe events of that day, now known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' were a catalyst \nto the passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act, which finally ensured \na century after the enactment of the Civil War amendments that the \nConstitution's guarantees of equal access to the political process, \nregardless of race, would not be undermined by discriminatory \npractices.\n  Prior to the Voting Rights Act, minorities of all races faced major \nbarriers to participation in the political process, through the use of \nsuch devices as poll taxes, exclusionary primaries, intimidation by \nvoting officials, language barriers, and systematic vote dilution. \nSection 5 provides a remedy for unconstitutional discrimination in \nvoting by requiring certain jurisdictions with a history of \ndiscrimination to ``pre-clear'' all voting changes with either the \nJustice Department or the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia. This remedy combats the practice of covered jurisdictions \nshifting from one invalidated discriminatory voting tactic to another, \nwhich had undermined efforts to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment for \nnearly a century.\n  In 2006, congressional leadership stood together on the steps of the \nCapitol to introduce a bill to reauthorize and reinvigorate the Voting \nRights Act--an historic announcement in an era of intense partisanship. \nWe came together in recognition that there are few things as critical \nto our Nation, and to American citizenship, as voting. In sharp \ncontrast to the tremendous resistance and bitter politics which met the \ninitial enactment of the Voting Rights Act, our efforts in 2006 \novercame objections through discussions, the hearing process and by \ndeveloping an overwhelming record of justification for extension of the \nexpiring provisions. The legislation contained specific findings about \nthe need for reauthorization and concluded that without reauthorization \nthe gains we have made would be undermined. Our efforts reached \ncompletion when President Bush signed the bill into law after a \nunanimous vote in the Senate and nearly unanimous vote in the House.\n  At that time, I was the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and the lead Democratic Senate sponsor of the \nreauthorization. Over the course of 19 hearings, the Senate and House \nJudiciary Committees developed a comprehensive record supporting the \ncontinuing need for a reauthorized and reinvigorated Voting Rights Act. \nIn the Senate Judiciary Committee alone we received testimony from 46 \nwitnesses, including a\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\nrange of constitutional scholars, voting rights advocates, and Supreme \nCourt practitioners, regarding the need for reauthorization of the \nexpiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act. In addition, the \nCommittee gathered and considered thousands of pages of testimony, \narticles, letters, and other evidence from these witnesses and other \nsources discussing these issues. This evidence, along with voluminous \nevidence gathered in the House--under the leadership of then-Judiciary \nChairman James Sensenbrenner, Mel Watt, John Conyers and John Lewis--\nprovided an overwhelming demonstration that Section 5 continues to be \nan effective and necessary tool for protecting minority voting rights.\n\n  At the time the Senate voted, we had before us the House Committee \nReport, the full debate from the floor of the House of Representatives, \nincluding debate surrounding four substantive amendments to H.R. 9 that \nwere all rejected, leading up to final passage of the Voting Rights Act \nreauthorization. Before we voted, I also provided the Senate with some \nof the extensive evidence received over several months of hearings in \nthe Judiciary Committee about the persistence of discriminatory \npractices in Section 5 covered jurisdictions.\n  The record gathered by the Judiciary Committee included three \ncategories of evidence supporting the continuation of Section 5. First, \nwe found evidence that even with Section 5 in place, covered \njurisdictions continued to engage in recurring discriminatory tactics, \noften in subtle forms that play on racially polarized voting to deny \nthe effectiveness of the votes cast by members of a particular race. \nSecond, we found evidence that Section 5 provides an effective \ndeterrent against bad practices in covered jurisdictions. Finally, we \nfound evidence that Section 5 plays a vital role in securing the gains \nminority voters have achieved against the risk of backsliding.\n  Most importantly, of course, at the time we voted, all Senators had \nbefore them the detailed findings in Section 2 of the legislation based \non the record and all Senators endorsed those findings with their \nvotes. For example, those findings explicitly include:\n\n       Evidence of continued discrimination includ[ing] . . . the \n     hundreds of objections interposed, requests for more \n     information submitted followed by voting changes withdrawn \n     from consideration by jurisdictions covered by the Voting \n     Rights Act of 1965, and section 5 enforcement actions \n     undertaken by the Department of Justice in covered \n     jurisdictions since 1982 that prevented election practices, \n     such as annexation, at-large voting, and the use of multi-\n     member districts, from being enacted to dilute minority \n     voting strength; . . . the number of requests for declaratory \n     judgments denied by the United States District Court for the \n     District of Columbia; [and] . . . the continued filing of \n     section 2 cases that originated in covered jurisdiction . . .\n\n  By passing the legislation, Congress adopted and reaffirmed these \ndetailed findings, including Congress' determination that:\n\n       [t]he continued evidence of racially polarized voting in \n     each of the jurisdictions covered by the expiring provisions \n     of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 demonstrates that racial and \n     language minorities remain politically vulnerable, warranting \n     the continued protection of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\n  Now some suggest that Section 5 should be a victim of its success. In \nmy view abandoning a successful deterrent just because it works defies \nlogic and common sense. When Congress finds an effective and \nconstitutional way to prevent violations of the law, the courts must \nuphold it. In fact, since 1966, whenever the Supreme Court has reviewed \nor even cited to the Voting Rights Act, it has affirmed the Act as a \nvalid exercise of congressional authority. That is what the Court \nrightly did again in 2009.\n  Nothing we have seen in the time since Congress reauthorized the \nVoting Rights Act in 2006 or since the Supreme Court again upheld \nSection 5 in 2009 has invalidated Congress' determination to \nreauthorize that critical remedy for racial discrimination in voting. \nIn fact, the events of last year's election only serve to remind us \nanew of the continuing need for Section 5. Last year, panels of judges \nappointed by presidents of both parties found that Texas intentionally \ndiscriminated against minority voters in redistricting, and that Texas \nfailed to demonstrate that its voter ID law does not impose greater \nburdens on minority voters. A separate panel of three Federal judges \napproved South Carolina's voter identification law under Section 5 \nstarting this year, with judges appointed by Republican and Democratic \nPresidents noting that South Carolina legislators passed a less \nrestrictive law than they desired specifically in order to comply with \nthe Voting Rights Act. Without Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, \nworse laws would be in place and the fundamental rights of many \nAmericans would be diminished.\n  The Voting Rights Act is one of the most important laws ever passed \nby Congress, transforming America by ushering the nation out of a \nhistory of discrimination into an era of greater inclusion. The Act has \nbeen a tremendous source of protection for the voting rights of those \nlong discriminated against and a great deterrent against discriminatory \nefforts cropping up anew. As we celebrate Black History Month, we \nshould reflect not only on how far we have come, but how far we still \nmust travel to truly secure the guarantees of the Constitution for all \nAmericans.\n  Ensuring that all Americans are able to vote and have their vote \ncounted should be an issue of concern to Democrats and Republicans, and \na matter of conscience for all of us regardless of political party. \nThat is how it was in 2006, when members of Congress, Republicans and \nDemocrats, stood together on the Capitol steps to reaffirm our \ncommitment to full democratic participation by reauthorizing the key \nexpiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  I am confident that this week when the Justices review the \nsubstantial record relied upon by America's elected representatives in \nCongress, they will again do the right thing. Congress is at the height \nof its power when giving enforceable meaning to the 14th and the 15th \namendments. That is what Congress did when passing the Voting Rights \nAct in 1965, and what we did when we voted nearly unanimously to extend \nthe vital remedies of Section 5 in 2006. Now the Supreme Court is \ncalled upon to respect the role of Congress by upholding this vital \ncivil rights legislation as it rightly did in 2009.\n  There are few things as critical to our Nation, and to American \ncitizenship, as voting. Like the rights guaranteed by the First \nAmendment, the right to vote is foundational because it secures the \neffective exercise of all other rights. As people are able to register, \nvote, and elect candidates of their choice, their interests and rights \nget attention. The very legitimacy of our government is dependent on \nthe access all Americans have to the political process. Our democracy \nand our Nation have been better and richer for the protection of the \nVoting Rights Act. Now is no time for backsliding. Now is the time to \nrenew our commitment to the right to vote for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S807-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S807-S808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have often said, Mr. President, that the Senate is \nsupposed to be, it can be, and often is the conscience of the Nation. \nWell, we became the conscience of the Nation 2 weeks ago when Senators, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, voted overwhelmingly to pass the \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act and the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act. We made protection of these victims our \ntop priority. After compromise and extensive negotiations, we set \npartisanship aside and came together.\n  The Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act will \nprovide immeasurable help to all victims of domestic violence and of \nrape throughout our country and to victims of human trafficking in the \nUnited States and around the world. The Senate passed it with an \nappropriate show of bipartisan unity. A majority of Republican Senators \nvoted for our bill, as did every woman elected to this body and every \nsingle Democratic Senator and the two Independents who caucus with the \nDemocrats. My amendment adding significant human trafficking \nlegislation passed with the support of 93 Senators.\n  Senators from across the political spectrum have shown that stopping \ndomestic and sexual violence in the most effective way possible is an \nissue above politics. I mention this not to pat ourselves on the back \nbut to say that, in contrast to this action where Republicans and \nDemocrats came together to\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\nprotect women in this country, the House leadership is poised to once \nagain take a different route. Tomorrow they are scheduled to substitute \nour bipartisan bill with a partisan alternative that leaves vulnerable \nvictims without protection and mires our efforts in partisan politics, \nwhich delays getting help to victims. I hope they reconsider this ill-\nconceived approach. The overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate \nfor the VAWA reauthorization Senator Crapo and I introduced sent a \npowerful message to survivors of violence. But this bill is about so \nmuch more than sending a message. It includes real, meaningful \nadditions to the law to fill gaps and address needs that law \nenforcement, victims, and the service providers who work with victims \nevery day have identified for us. None of these provisions are about \npolitics. They are about preventing terrible crimes and helping the \nsurvivors of violence.\n  The Senate-passed bill takes new steps to prevent domestic violence \nhomicides. It will increase the focus of law enforcement and victim \nservice providers on rape and sexual assault crimes that too often slip \nthrough the cracks. It will take needed steps to address the horrifying \nepidemic of domestic violence in tribal communities and to increase \nprotections for vulnerable immigrant victims. It ensures access to \nservices for LGBT victims who experience domestic and sexual violence \nat rates at least as high as the rest of the population but often have \nno place to go for help.\n  Our bill strengthens protections on campuses, where too many students \nexperience devastating violence instead of the wonderful experience of \nlearning and growth that we all wish for our children. It includes new \nbipartisan measures to ensure that rape kits are promptly tested so \nthat victims no longer live for years in fear when the perpetrators \ncould be identified and taken off the streets. Our bill would give law \nenforcement and service providers new tools to crack down on sex \ntrafficking and labor trafficking and help the victims of these \nappalling crimes. These common sense provisions will make a real \ndifference in so many lives.\n  The poor substitute the Republican House leadership is putting \nforward once again takes a tragically different approach. Instead of \ntaking up legislation developed over years of work with victims and \nthose who help them, they have presented a version put together by a \nfew here in Washington. For reasons I cannot understand, they have \njettisoned the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \naltogether and stripped provisions developed by Senator Cornyn, Senator \nGrassley, and me to take meaningful steps to reduce the backlog of \nuntested DNA evidence in rape kits. Those provisions could help victims \nand could help law enforcement keep our communities safe.\n  The House substitute drastically weakens protections for vulnerable \nvictims. It eliminates key protections intended to keep college \nstudents safer. It fails to include meaningful language to ensure that \nLGBT victims can get the same help as any other victims. For immigrant \nvictims, the House substitute actually adds new hurdles that would make \nit harder for victims to help law enforcement and receive assistance. \nIt adds new burdens and loopholes to protections for Native women who \nexperience domestic violence at horrific rates. The House substitute \nwould continue to allow the most aggressive abusers of native women to \nescape justice since the most that could be charged in tribal courts \nwould be a misdemeanor. That is not justice for the most vulnerable \nvictims of domestic violence.\n  I have been working on this legislation for years. During the last \nyear we have amended and tweaked its language many times to accommodate \nthe requests of various Republicans who support the effort. I stand \nready to work with House leadership and have reached out to Speaker \nBoehner several times. I have not heard from House leadership once this \nyear. I appreciate the efforts of such conservative House Republicans \nas Congressmen Tom Cole and Darrell Issa, who have tried to find common \nground with reasonable compromise approaches to the tribal provisions. \nI know there are many others in the House of Representatives who \nbelieve that we must reauthorize and reinvigorate the Violence Against \nWomen Act so that it protects all victims. It is not too late for \nothers in the House to follow their lead and come together to pass a \nmeaningful reform that protects all victims.\n  The poor substitute the Republican House leadership is proposing will \ndisappoint the community of violence survivors and those of us who are \ntrying to prevent further violence by passing needed protections. If \nthe House leadership were serious about getting the Violence Against \nWomen Act reauthorized and protecting our most vulnerable victims \nagainst rape, sexual violence, stalking, and human trafficking, they \nwould simply take up the Senate bill. So many Republicans, Democrats, \nand Independents here support it and passed that bill.\n  I don't understand this picking and choosing about who is going to be \nconsidered a victim. I have said this so many times on this floor, I \nalmost wonder if anybody hears it, but, as many other Senators have, I \nhad the privilege of being a prosecutor before I came here. I went to a \nlot of very violent crime scenes at 2 and 3 and 4 o'clock in the \nmorning, and some of them I remember almost as graphically as if it \nwere yesterday, with a victim of severe violence, often dead, there on \nthe floor. The police never said: Well, we have to find out if this \nvictim is gay or straight, if this victim is Native American or an \nimmigrant. No, they knew that a victim was a victim was a victim. If \nsomebody has been treated that way, a crime has been committed, and the \npolice want to find out who committed the crime and stop them before \nthey do it again.\n  Back then, we didn't have anything like the Violence Against Women \nAct--an act which has protected so many people before they could become \na victim, and which provides the tools to prevent this sort of \nvictimization. I think of some of the victims I saw, sometimes in the \nmorgue, and I know if we had something like our Violence Against Women \nAct at that time, they would be alive today.\n  So let's put aside gamesmanship and let's worry about the real \nvictims in this country. None of us here will face the horrendous \nthings these women go through, but we can help stop these horrendous \nthings from happening to them, and we should do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S808-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S808-S809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL J.

Mr. Mulligan \ndemonstrated great dedication to enhancing the safety and security of \nthe United States Senate, staff, and visitors.\n  Beginning his career as a combat engineer officer in the U.S. Army, \nMr. Mulligan served a 15-year tour at Fort Ritchie, MD, as the Chief of \nEngineering and Plans. During this time, he directed the largest \nexpansion of facilities, infrastructure, and community planning in the \ninstallation's history. While on temporary assignment to the Army Corps \nof Engineers in Kuwait, Mr. Mulligan led technical advisors to provide \nengineering assistance to restore two war damaged air bases.\n  Mr. Mulligan went on to serve as Director of Facilities at the \nAlternate Joint Communications Center-Site R. He directed operations to \nsustain facility excellence in engineering, contingency planning, life \nsupport, and logistics in support of Continuity of Operations for the \nsenior DOD leadership--a mission which he ably executed on September \n11, 2001.\n  Mr. Mulligan was appointed to the Senior Executive Service in 2011. \nAs a senior leader in the National Security Agency, Mr. Mulligan \nprovided invaluable stewardship of an important classified program that \nsupported the National Security Emergency Preparedness program.\n  Furthermore, Mr. Mulligan has authored several writings on public \nadministration and leadership and received numerous service medals and \ncommendations for exceptional public service.\n  I, along with my colleagues in the Senate, congratulate Mr. Mulligan \non his well-earned retirement and wish him all the best in his future \nendeavors.\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S809-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING JUSTICE MARY ANN McMORROW\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President today I wish to pay tribute to Justice Mary \nAnn McMorrow, a devoted public servant and a pioneer of the Illinois \nlegal community who passed away last weekend at the age of 83.\n  Justice McMorrow was a native Chicagoan, attending Immaculata High \nSchool and Rosary College which is now Dominican University. She went \non to attend the Loyola University School of Law, where she was elected \nclass president and served as associate editor of the Law Review. She \ngraduated in 1953 as the only woman in her class. Yet as Justice \nMcMorrow set off on her legal career, she refused to let glass ceilings \nstop her from reaching the greatest heights.\n  Justice McMorrow embarked on a public service career that would span \ndecades and culminate in her service as the first woman on the Illinois \nSupreme Court and its first female chief justice. Her public sector \ncareer began with a post as an assistant State's attorney in Cook \nCounty, where she became the first woman in Cook County to prosecute \nmajor felonies. On one occasion she was told by a supervisor in the \nState's attorney's office that she would not be presenting an oral \nargument before the Illinois Supreme Court because women had not done \nthat before. Well, before long Justice McMorrow would preside over the \nvery same arguments from which she was once excluded.\n  In 1976, Justice McMorrow was elected as a judge of the Circuit Court \nof Cook County, and she joined the Illinois Appellate Court in 1985. \nShe was elected to the Illinois Supreme Court in 1992 and became the \nchief justice of that court in 2002. The importance of this achievement \ncannot be overstated. As Justice McMorrow said upon becoming chief \njustice, ``When I went to law school, women couldn't even dream of such \na thing. I hope this would forever indicate that there's nothing that \nlimits women in any job or any profession.'' Justice McMorrow served as \nchief justice until her retirement in 2006, and overall she wrote 225 \nmajority opinions during her Supreme Court tenure.\n  Justice McMorrow was an active member of her church, St. Mary of the \nWoods, and along with her late husband Emmett she was committed to her \ncommunity and to various charities. Among the many accolades Justice \nMcMorrow received during her career were the Medal of Excellence award \nfrom the Loyola University School of Law Alumni Association, the \nChicago Bar Association's Justice John Paul Stevens Award, the American \nBar Association's Margaret A. Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award, \nand the Myra Bradwell Woman of Achievement Award, the highest award \ngiven by the Women's Bar Association of Illinois. In addition to these \nhonors, she also received four honorary degrees and numerous other \nawards. When asked about her illustrious career, Justice McMorrow \nresponded, ``I just simply tried to do my best in every task that was \npresented to me.''\n  Justice McMorrow was truly a model of what hard work and humility can \naccomplish. During a time when women were not accepted as equals in the \nlegal profession she proved herself superior. When young women in \nclassrooms across Illinois are asked what they want to be when they \ngrow up, they can confidently respond that they will be judges and have \nJustice McMorrow as a beacon to strive towards. Today as we mourn her \npassing we also celebrate her achievements and the legacy of \nopportunity she has created for countless young women in our State.\n  Loretta and I send our condolences to Justice McMorrow's daughter \nMary Ann, her sister Frances, and her other family and friends across \nIllinois and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S809-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S809-S810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

The preceding two \n     sentences shall not apply when a witness appears as the \n     nominee. Interrogation of witnesses at hearings shall be \n     conducted on behalf of the Committee by Members of the \n     Committee or such Committee staff as is authorized by the \n     Chair or Ranking Minority Member.\n       (3) Witnesses appearing before the Committee shall file \n     with the Clerk of the Committee a written statement of the \n     prepared testimony at least two business days in advance of \n     the hearing at which the witness is to appear unless this \n     requirement is waived by the Chair and the Ranking Minority \n     Member.\n       (c) Any witness summoned to a public or closed hearing may \n     be accompanied by counsel of his or her own choosing, who \n     shall be permitted while the witness is testifying to advise \n     the witness of his or her legal rights. Failure to obtain \n     counsel will not excuse the witness from appearing and \n     testifying.\n       (d) Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, and other \n     materials may be authorized by the Chair with the consent of \n     the Ranking Minority Member or by the consent of a majority \n     of the Members of the Committee. Such consent may be given \n     informally, without a meeting, but must be in writing. The \n     Chair may subpoena attendance or production without the \n     consent of the Ranking Minority Member when the Chair has not \n     received notification from the Ranking Minority Member of \n     disapproval of the subpoena within 72 hours of being notified \n     of the intended subpoena, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and \n     holidays. Subpoenas shall be issued by the Chair or by the \n     Member of the Committee designated by him or her. A subpoena \n     for the attendance of a witness shall state briefly the \n     purpose of the hearing and the matter or matters to which the \n     witness is expected to testify. A subpoena for the production \n     of memoranda, documents, records, and other materials shall \n     identify the papers or materials required to be produced with \n     as much particularity as is practicable.\n       (e) The Chair shall rule on any objections or assertions of \n     privilege as to testimony or evidence in response to \n     subpoenas or questions of Committee Members and staff in \n     hearings.\n       (f) Testimony may be submitted to the formal record for a \n     period not less than two weeks following a hearing or \n     roundtable, unless otherwise agreed to by Chair and Ranking \n     Member.\n\n\n                        Confidential Information\n\n       (a) No confidential testimony taken by, or confidential \n     material presented to, the Committee in executive session, or \n     any report of the proceedings of a closed hearing, or \n     confidential testimony or material submitted pursuant to a \n     subpoena, shall be made public, either in whole or in part or \n     by way of summary, unless authorized by a majority of the \n     Members. Other confidential material or testimony submitted \n     to the Committee may be disclosed if authorized by the Chair \n     with the consent of the Ranking Member.\n       (b) Persons asserting confidentiality of documents or \n     materials submitted to the Committee offices shall clearly \n     designate them as such on their face. Designation of \n     submissions as confidential does not prevent their use in \n     furtherance of Committee business.\n\n\n                          Media & Broadcasting\n\n       (a) At the discretion of the Chair, public meetings of the \n     Committee may be televised, broadcasted, or recorded in whole \n     or in part by a member of the Senate Press Gallery or an \n     employee of the Senate. Any such person wishing to televise, \n     broadcast, or record a Committee meeting must request \n     approval of the Chair by submitting a written request to the \n     Committee Office by 5 p.m. the day before the meeting. Notice \n     of televised or broadcasted hearings shall be provided to the \n     Ranking Minority Member as soon as practicable.\n       (b) During public meetings of the Committee, any person \n     using a camera, microphone, or other electronic equipment may \n     not position or use the equipment in a way that interferes \n     with the seating, vision, or hearing of Committee members or \n     staff on the dais, or with the orderly process of the \n     meeting.\n\n\n                             Sub-committees\n\n       The Committee shall not have standing subcommittees.\n\n\n                           Amendment of Rules\n\n       The foregoing rules may be added to, modified or amended; \n     provided, however, that not less than a majority of the \n     entire Membership so determined at a regular meeting with due \n     notice, or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S810-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S810-S811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Field Hearings.--Field hearings of the full Committee, \n     and any subcommittee thereof, shall be scheduled only when \n     authorized by the Chairman and ranking minority member of the \n     full Committee.\n\n                            RULE II--QUORUMS\n\n       1.

This rule may be \n     waived with the concurrence of the Chairman and the \n     ranking minority member of the full Committee.\n\n                   RULE V--SUBPOENAS; COUNSEL; RECORD\n\n       1. Subpoenas.--The Chairman, with the approval of the \n     ranking minority member of the Committee, may subpoena the \n     attendance of witnesses for hearings and the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. The \n     Chairman may subpoena such attendance of witnesses or \n     production of materials without the approval of the ranking \n     minority member if the Chairman or a member of the Committee \n     staff designated by the Chairman has not received \n     notification from the ranking minority member or a member of \n     the Committee staff designated by the ranking minority member \n     of disapproval of the subpoena within 72 hours, excluding \n     Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of the subpoena. If \n     a subpoena is disapproved by the ranking minority member as \n     provided in this paragraph, the subpoena may be authorized by \n     vote of the Members of the Committee, the quorum required by \n     paragraph 1 of rule II being present. When the Committee or \n     Chairman authorizes a subpoena, it shall be issued upon the \n     signature of the Chairman or any other Member of the \n     Committee designated by the Chairman. At the direction of the \n     Chairman, with notification to the ranking minority member of \n     not less than 72 hours, the staff is authorized to take \n     depositions from witnesses. The ranking minority member, or a \n     member of the Committee staff designated by the ranking \n     minority member, shall be given the opportunity to attend and \n     participate in the taking of any deposition. Witnesses at \n     depositions shall be examined upon oath administered by an \n     individual authorized by law to administer oaths, or \n     administered by any member of the Committee if one is \n     present.\n       2. Counsel.--Witnesses may be accompanied at a public or \n     executive hearing, or the taking of a deposition, by counsel \n     to advise them of their rights. Counsel retained by any \n     witness and accompanying such witness shall be permitted to \n     be present during the testimony of the witness at any public \n     or executive hearing, or the taking of a deposition, to \n     advise the witness, while the witness is testifying, of the \n     witness's legal rights. In the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Chairman may rule that representation by \n     counsel from the government, corporation, or association or \n     by counsel representing other witnesses, creates a conflict \n     of interest, and that the witness may only be represented \n     during testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not \n     from the government, corporation, or association or by \n     personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     subparagraph shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event the witness's counsel is ejected for \n     conducting himself or herself in such manner as to prevent, \n     impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with the orderly \n     administration of a hearing or the taking of a deposition. \n     This subparagraph may not be construed as authorizing counsel \n     to coach the witness or to answer for the witness. The \n     failure of any witness to secure counsel shall not excuse the \n     witness from complying with a subpoena.\n       3. Record.--An accurate electronic or stenographic record \n     shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in executive \n     and public hearings and depositions. If testimony given by \n     deposition is transcribed, the individual administering the \n     oath shall certify on the transcript that the witness was \n     duly sworn in his or her presence and the transcriber shall \n     certify that the transcript is a true record of the \n     testimony. The transcript with these certifications shall be \n     filed with the chief clerk of the Committee. The record of a \n     witness's testimony, whether in public or executive session \n     or in a deposition, shall be made available for inspection by \n     the witness or the witness's counsel under Committee \n     supervision. A copy of any testimony given in public session, \n     or that part of the testimony given by the witness in \n     executive session or deposition and subsequently quoted or \n     made part of the record in a public session, shall be \n     provided to that witness at the witness's expense if so \n     requested. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Clerk of the Committee, a witness may \n     request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors. The witness may also \n     bring to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about \n     those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript. The Chairman or a member of the Committee staff \n     designated by the Chairman shall rule on such requests.\n\n                   RULE VI--BROADCASTING OF HEARINGS\n\n       Public hearings of the full Committee, or any subcommittee \n     thereof, shall be televised or broadcast only when authorized \n     by the Chairman and the ranking minority member of the full \n     Committee.\n\n                        RULE VII--SUBCOMMITTEES\n\n       1. Hearings.--Any member of the Committee may sit with any \n     subcommittee during its hearings.\n       2. Change of Chairmanship.--Subcommittees shall be \n     considered de novo whenever there is a change in the \n     chairmanship, and seniority on the particular subcommittee \n     shall not necessarily apply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S811-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S811-S812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN D. BENNETT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also wish to recognize and pay \ntribute to Mr. John D. Bennett, the Director of the National \nClandestine Service, NCS, of the Central Intelligence Agency, who will \nretire from the CIA, for the second time, on February 28, 2013. Mr. \nBennett's career spans over 30 years in the CIA during which he \ndistinguished himself as a patriot, leader, and friend of the U.S. \nSenate. John Bennett also served as an infantry officer in the U.S. \nMarine Corps from 1975 to 1980.\n  It is a rare opportunity to pay tribute publicly to one of the men \nand women who serve beyond the front lines, working in secret to \nprotect and serve the Nation. Having ``come in from the cold,'' I am \npleased to be able to say a few words about John.\n  A Massachusetts native, Mr. Bennett received a B.A. degree in \ngovernment from Harvard University in 1975 and an M.A. in National \nSecurity Studies from Georgetown University in 1991.\n  Since joining the CIA in 1981, John served more than 17 years abroad \nin multiple assignments, including as chief of station in multiple \ncountries, in Southeast Asia and Africa, where he was able to use his \nlanguage fluency of French. In addition to returning from retirement to \ntake the helm of the NCS in July 2010, he has held Senior Executive \nService level Headquarters assignments as Deputy Director of the \nNational Clandestine Service for Community Human Intelligence from \n2005-2006; Chief, Special Activities Division from 2003-2005; and \nDeputy Chief, Africa Division and Chief of Africa Operations from 1995-\n1999. Mr. Bennett served also as the Executive Assistant to the Deputy \nDirector of Central Intelligence from May 1990 to May 1991.\n  When Director Panetta asked John to return to service he stated:\n\n       John says what he thinks and he does what he says. I trust \n     him, and I rely on him.\n\n  He has helped guide the agency through some of the most complex and \nchallenging operations imaginable, including the historic takedown of \nOsama bin Laden.\n  John Bennett served with distinction as the Director of the NCS for \nthe past 3 years. In this capacity, John had frequent interaction with \nSenators and staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. His \nprofessionalism, mature judgment, expertise, and frank advice earned \nhim the respect and confidence of the committee. His sound judgment, \ncourage, and candor also directly contributed to his successful \nrepresentation of the CIA's interests before the committee and \nCongress.\n\n[[Page S812]]\n\n  Throughout his career, John Bennett demonstrated a profound \ncommitment to our Nation, selfless service to the CIA, deep concern for \nagency officers and their families, and a commitment to excellence. \nJohn is the consummate intelligence professional whose performance, in \nover 30 years of service, has personified those traits of courage, \ncompetency, and integrity that our Nation expects from its professional \nintelligence officers.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Mr. John Bennett for his \nhonorable service to the Central Intelligence Agency and the people of \nthe United States, and also to thank John's wife Kit for her support \nand understanding, as well as her sacrifices in allowing John to \nselflessly commit himself to protecting our Nation.\n  We wish John and Kit Bennett all the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S812-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO L. CHRISTINE HEALEY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ndedicated career and service to the Congress and the Nation of Louise \nChristine ``Chris'' Healey, who is retiring at the end of this week \nafter nearly 30 years of work for the legislative branch. I am pleased \nto have the opportunity to publicly thank her and to note my \nappreciation for her dedicated and dignified efforts.\n  Chris is leaving the Senate as the general counsel on the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, serving as the top legal advisor to \nthe committee.\n  As committee counsel and general counsel over the past 8 years, Chris \nhas been instrumental in the debating and drafting of every significant \npiece of intelligence legislation passed, and in some cases not passed, \nover the past decade. She was the principal drafter of the FISA \nAmendments Act of 2008, which is among the most complex pieces of \nlegislation recently enacted, and certainly one of the most important \nto the security of our Nation. She has been as responsible as anyone \nfor the passage of a string of four annual intelligence authorization \nbills, including the fiscal year 2013 act that was completed in \nDecember.\n  In her time at the SSCI, Chris has exemplified the professional and \nbipartisan spirit of the committee, working closely with Members and \nstaff on both sides of the aisle. She has invested herself in \nconducting oversight, drafting bills, carrying out investigations, and \nreviewing and shepherding the President's nominees to Senate-confirmed \npositions, among many other things.\n  Her approach has always been dignified and calm. I am proud to be \nable to say that the rancor and divisiveness of the Senate over the \npast years has not infiltrated the work of the committee. Among the \nreasons we have been able to work together, review and debate serious \nissues, and come to bipartisan solutions is that we have people like \nChris Healey who are more interested in getting the right results the \nright way rather than succeeding at the expense of someone else.\n  Prior to working for the committee, Ms. Healey worked for the \nGovernment Affairs Committee on the landmark legislation that reformed \nthe intelligence community and created the position of the Director of \nNational Intelligence. She was a senior counsel and team leader on the \n9/11 Commission. And prior to that, she spent a decade on the House \nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence, including as staff \ndirector. Chris has been the institutional memory of intelligence in \nthe Congress, and her expertise and experience will be sorely missed.\n  But while a leading voice within these congressional committees and \ncommissions and in interactions with the nonprofit community and \nexecutive branch, Chris has managed the rare feat of having a life as \nwell.\n  She married musician Ryan Brown in 1989 and had her first son, \nNathaniel, in 1990. Nathaniel has begun following Chris' footsteps, \nexploring his own work in government and politics. Chris and Ryan had \ntheir second son, Gabriel, in 1994, and he, too, has now grown up and \nis nearing his graduation from Oberlin College. Chris has walked to \nwork every day from her Capitol Hill home, while supporting in many \nways Ryan Brown's Opera Lafayette. He notes that in addition to her \ndedication to public service, Chris is an avid reader and an \nenthusiastic theater and concert goer, and looks forward to exploring \nthe wider world in the years to come. I wish her the very best as she \nnow has the time to pursue those interests, rather than being stuck in \na windowless office in front of multiple computers for long hours.\n  Mr. President, I am one of many Members of Congress to have benefited \nfrom the advice and hard work of Chris Healey, starting with Barbara \nKennelly, including Nancy Pelosi and Jane Harman, and ending with Jay \nRockefeller and myself. On behalf of them, and the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, I thank Chris Healey and wish her the very best in what I \nknow will be a long and productive retirement from the Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S812-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BRILLO PAD CENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Armaly \nBrands on the 100th anniversary of its iconic Brillo pad product. The \nBrillo pad was introduced on January 13, 1913. In 1921, the \nmanufacturing of the product was moved to a factory in London, OH, \nwhere it has been produced ever since. Brillo was a revolutionary \nproduct, as Americans transitioned from heavy cast iron cookware to \naluminum pots and pans in the early 20th century.\n  The Brillo pad has been featured in motion pictures, songs, and \nhouseholds nationwide. In 1964, the Brillo pad reached the height of \nits cultural popularity when Andy Warhol created a series of shipping \ncartons highlighting the iconic logo.\n  Besides being a staple of the modern kitchen, the Brillo pad has also \nbrought jobs and manufacturing to Ohio. Brillo's London factory employs \nover 50 Ohioans whose products are shipped around the world.\n  Since 2010, Brillo has been owned by Armaly Brands of Walled Lake, \nMI.

Shaylee Rizzo of \nKenai and Samuel Allred of Wasilla have just been named State Honorees \nin the 2013 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards Program, an annual \nhonor conferred on only one high school student and one middle-level \nstudent in each State and the District of Columbia.\n  Ms. Rizzo earned recognition for starting a public service campaign \ncalled ``Missy the Moose Program'' to raise youth awareness of the \ndangers of cars hitting moose on Alaska's highways--a common occurrence \nin her area during the hazardous winter months. Her idea was inspired \nby a photograph of a local motel owner posing with an orphaned moose he \nhad saved after its mother was killed by a car. To launch her program, \nShaylee wrote and illustrated a children's book that told the story of \na collision from a moose calf's perspective. Wearing a moose costume, \nshe then visited elementary school classrooms as Missy the Moose, \nsharing her book with the kids and offering ideas on how to encourage \ntheir parents to watch out for Missy and her friends. With her father's \nhelp, she wrote a theme song, recorded radio announcements urging \nchildren to get their parents to slow down, and solicited local \nbusinesses to buy more air time for her announcements. Currently, she \nis trying to gain State of Alaska's approval to post Missy the Moose \nsigns in high moose-traffic areas to remind motorists to drive with \ncare.\n  Mr. Allred earned recognition for making travel-size pillows and \ndistributing them to children's hospitals across the country to provide \ncomfort to sick kids. As a toddler, he was diagnosed with a rare kidney \ndisease that resulted in hospitalizations and the need to take \nmedications that altered his appearance. In 2008, a video of Samuel \nsinging went viral on YouTube and garnered millions of views--along \nwith comments that were mostly good--but judged his appearance. He \ndecided to start a nonprofit organization with the\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\ngoal of changing lives through compassion. In 2009, Samuel, along with \nfriends and family members, made 300 pillows out of bright, cheerful \nfabric and donated them to a local children's hospital. But Samuel knew \nhe could do even more if he got the community involved, so he began \nvisiting local schools to talk about kindness and compassion. It wasn't \nlong before others were helping to craft pillows for Samuel's ``Project \nComfort.'' Elementary school students stuffed pillows, senior citizens \nstitched them closed, and middle-school students made more than 1,700 \npillows. Today, many groups in Alaska are creating pillows. Samuel \nsends the pillows to children's hospitals throughout the United States.\n  Given the challenges we face today, it is important that we encourage \nand support the kind of selfless contributions that these young \nAlaskans have made. Youth volunteers like Ms. Rizzo and Mr. Allred are \ninspiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for \na better tomorrow.\n  I thank Ms. Rizzo and Mr. Allred for their initiative in seeking to \nmake their communities better places to live, and for the positive \nimpact they have had on the lives of others. I also would like to \nsalute Allison Ostrander and Reese Qualls, young people in my State who \nwere named distinguished finalists by The Prudential Spirit of \nCommunity Awards for their outstanding volunteer service.\n  All of these young people demonstrate a level of commitment and \naccomplishment that is rarely seen today, and they deserve our sincere \nadmiration and respect. Their actions show that young Americans can, \nand do, play important roles in their communities, and that America's \ncommunity spirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future.\n  Thank you for allowing me to take a moment to recognize these great \nyoung volunteers in Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/25/senate-section/article/S813-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on February 15, 2013, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe House has agreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which \nit requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On February 12, 2013, the Government of North Korea \n     declared that it had conducted its third test of a nuclear \n     device, following its first self-declared test on October 9, \n     2006, and its second test on May 25, 2009.\n       (2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, \n     adopted on October 14, 2006, condemned the nuclear test \n     proclaimed by North Korea on October 9, 2006, in flagrant \n     disregard of its relevant resolutions, in particular Security \n     Council Resolution 1695 (2006), and demanded that North Korea \n     not conduct any further nuclear test or launch of a ballistic \n     missile; immediately retract its announcement of withdrawal \n     from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n     done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and \n     entered into force March 5, 1970 (NPT); and return to the NPT \n     and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.\n       (3) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 further \n     decided that North Korea shall suspend all activities related \n     to its ballistic missile program and in this context re-\n     establish its pre-existing commitments to a moratorium on \n     missile launching; shall abandon all nuclear weapons and \n     existing nuclear programs in a complete, verifiable, and \n     irreversible manner; shall act strictly in accordance with \n     the obligations applicable to parties under the NPT and the \n     terms and conditions of its IAEA Safeguards Agreement; shall \n     provide the IAEA transparency measures extending beyond these \n     requirements, including such access to individuals, \n     documentation, equipments and facilities as may be required \n     and deemed necessary by the IAEA; and shall abandon all other \n     existing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and its ballistic \n     missile program in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible \n     manner.\n       (4) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 also \n     required United Nations Member States to prevent--\n       (A) transfers to, and procurement from, North Korea of--\n       (i) items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology \n     listed in the resolution; and\n       (ii) other items, determined by the Security Council or the \n     1718 Committee, which could contribute to North Korea's \n     nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related, or other weapons \n     of mass destruction-related programs;\n       (B) certain military equipment or technology transfers \n     related to the prohibited items; and\n       (C) the transfer of luxury goods to North Korea.\n       (5) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 further \n     required United Nations Member States to prevent the entry \n     into and transit through their territories of individuals \n     designated by the Security Council or the 1718 Committee as \n     being responsible for North Korea's ballistic missile-\n     related, nuclear-related, or other weapons of mass \n     destruction-related programs, and the immediate freezing of \n     funds, other financial assets, and economic resources of \n     persons or entities designated by the Security Council or the \n     1718 Committee as being engaged in or\n\n[[Page S817]]\n\n     providing support for such programs, or by persons or \n     entities acting on their behalf or at their direction.\n       (6) On May 25, 2009, the Government of North Korea declared \n     that it had conducted a second test of a nuclear device.\n       (7) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874, \n     adopted on June 12, 2009--\n       (A) decided that North Korea shall abandon all nuclear \n     weapons and existing nuclear programs in a complete, \n     verifiable, and irreversible manner;\n       (B) authorized and required United Nations Member States to \n     seize and dispose of proscribed illicit North Korea items \n     related to its missile, nuclear, and WMD programs identified \n     in inspections called for by the resolution;\n       (C) banned the export to North Korea of all arms and \n     related material other than small arms and light weapons; and\n       (D) decided that Member States shall--\n       (i) prevent the provision of financial services or the \n     transfer to, through, or from their territory of any \n     financial or other assets or resources that could contribute \n     to North Korea's nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related, \n     or other WMD-related programs or activities; and\n       (ii) deny fuel or supplies to service the vessels carrying \n     them except where necessary on humanitarian grounds.\n       (8) On December 12, 2012, in flagrant defiance of past \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions, the \n     international community, and its Six-Party partners, the \n     Government of North Korea launched a three-stage, long-range \n     missile, which overflew Japanese territory near Okinawa and \n     dropped debris into the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and \n     waters adjacent to the Philippines.\n       (9) The United Nations Security Council adopted Security \n     Council Resolution 2087 on January 22, 2013, which condemned \n     North Korea's December 12, 2012, missile launch as a breach \n     of Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874, demanded that \n     North Korea ``abandon all nuclear weapons and existing \n     nuclear programs in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible \n     manner,'' and expressed the determination of the Security \n     Council ``to take significant action in the event of a \n     further DPRK launch or nuclear test''.\n       (10) the transition to the leadership of Kim Jong-Un after \n     the death of Kim Jong-Il has introduced new uncertainties, \n     yet the fundamental human rights and humanitarian conditions \n     inside North Korea remain deplorable, thousands of North \n     Koreans remain imprisoned in modern-day gulags, North Korean \n     refugees remain acutely vulnerable, and the findings in the \n     North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-333; 22 \n     U.S.C. 7801 et seq.), the North Korean Human Rights \n     Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-346), and the \n     Ambassador James R. Lilley and Congressman Stephen J. Solarz \n     North Korea Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2012 (Public \n     Law 112-172) remain substantially accurate today.\n       (11) There has been extensive military cooperation between \n     the Governments of North Korea and Iran that dates back to \n     the 1980s.\n       (12) The latest provocative and defiant action by the \n     Government of North Korea represents a direct threat to the \n     United States and to our regional allies and partners.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the test of a nuclear device by the Government of North \n     Korea on February 12, 2013, and the missile launch of \n     December 12, 2012, represent flagrant violations of the \n     sanctions regime created by United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 1695 (2006), 1718 (2006), and 1874 (2009), the \n     test of the nuclear device on February 12, 2013, is a clear, \n     deliberate, and provocative violation of United Nations \n     Security Resolution 2087 (2013), and the Government of North \n     Korea continues to defy the United Nations, its Six-Party \n     partners, and the international community;\n       (2) all Member States of the United Nations should \n     immediately implement and enforce sanctions imposed by these \n     resolutions and censure North Korea;\n       (3) the Government of North Korea should abandon and \n     dismantle its provocative ballistic missile and nuclear \n     weapons programs, cease its proliferation activities, and \n     come into immediate compliance with all United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions and its commitments under the \n     2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks;\n       (4) restrictions against the Government of North Korea, \n     including sanctions that ban the importation into the United \n     States of unlicensed North Korean products and goods, should \n     remain in effect until the Government of North Korea no \n     longer engages in activities that threaten the United States, \n     our allies and partners, and global peace and stability;\n       (5) the United States Government should seek a new round of \n     United Nations Security Council sanctions, including the \n     public identification of all North Korean and foreign banks, \n     business, and government agencies suspected of conduct that \n     violates United Nations Security Council resolutions, and \n     implementing necessary measures to ensure enforcement of such \n     sanctions;\n       (6) all United Nations Member States should--\n       (A) further strengthen efforts to prevent the transfer of \n     military and dual-use technologies to North Korea, including \n     an expansion of the list of sanctioned materials identified \n     by the United Nations Panel of Experts on North Korea \n     sanctions and the items on the Nuclear Suppliers Group lists;\n       (B) exercise enhanced vigilance including monitoring the \n     activities of their nationals, persons in their territories, \n     financial institutions, and other entities with or on behalf \n     of financial institutions in North Korea, or of those that \n     act on behalf or at the direction of financial institutions \n     in North Korea, including their branches, representatives, \n     agents, and subsidiaries abroad; and\n       (C) prevent transshipments that relate to North Korean \n     military, missile, and nuclear programs and proliferation \n     activities;\n       (7) the United States Government should explore [all \n     appropriate measures for enhanced military operations by the \n     United States Armed Forces] appropriate measures by the \n     United States Armed Forces in the Asia-Pacific region, \n     including in partnership with the armed forces of others \n     countries in the region, to safeguard the national interests, \n     security, and livelihood of the United States and its people, \n     as well as those of United States allies and partners in the \n     region; and\n       (8) the United States Government, acting through its \n     appropriate diplomatic representatives, should secure the \n     agreement of the United Nations Human Rights Council and \n     General Assembly to adopt the recommendations made in the \n     February 1, 2013, report of Marzuki Darusman, Special \n     Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea, that an inquiry mechanism should \n     be established to investigate North Korea's ``grave, \n     widespread and systematic violations of human rights,'' as \n     well as to analyze whether crimes against humanity are being \n     perpetrated in North Korea.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORT.\n\n       Not later than May 15, 2013, the Secretary of State shall \n     conduct, coordinate, and submit to Congress a comprehensive \n     report on United States policy towards North Korea based on a \n     full and complete interagency review of current policy and \n     possible alternatives, including North Korea's weapons of \n     mass destruction and missile programs and human rights \n     atrocities. The report shall include recommendations for such \n     legislative or administrative action as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate in light of the results of the review.\n\n     SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed as a declaration of \n     war or an authorization for the use of force against North \n     Korea.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I further ask that the committee-\nreported amendment be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed; and that the motions to reconsider be made and laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
