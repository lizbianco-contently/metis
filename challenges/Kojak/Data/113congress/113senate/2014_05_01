Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil 11:15 a.m., with the time equally divided and controlled. At \n11:15 a.m. there will be three rollcall votes, cloture on two U.S. \ndistrict judges from Maryland and cloture on a U.S. circuit judge for \nthe Tenth Circuit.\n  At 1:45 p.m. there will be up to four rollcall votes on confirmation \nof the U.S. district judges in Maryland and the circuit judge.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Terry Gainer\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are a number of us who have large \nfamilies. I have five children and lots of grandchildren, but the \nperson about whom I am going to speak has an even larger family than I \nhave. Terry Gainer has a huge family. He and his wife Irene have 6 \nchildren and 14 grandchildren, but that is just the beginning because \nhe has 10 siblings himself.\n  His family extends far beyond the immediate family I just talked \nabout. As the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, Terry Gainer has taken \ncare of roughly 6,500 people who work in the Senate and all the \nfacilities around here, but that is not the end of it. He is also \nsomeone who is concerned and feels responsible for the thousands and \nthousands of people who come to this building every day. They are also \na part of his family. So he has a huge family, and he has nurtured and \ntaken care of his family, from his wife Irene to the thousands of \npeople whom he has never known and never will know who come into this \nbuilding, and he has done a wonderful job.\n  Senators and staffers are oftentimes split along ideological lines, \nbut we all agree on one thing: We are utterly dependent on the Sergeant \nat Arms office, and we are aware of the wonderful job Terry Gainer has \ndone as Sergeant at Arms.\n  The daily needs of the world's greatest deliberative body are not few \nin number, and Chief Gainer has been up to this task. As the Sergeant \nat Arms, he has been responsible for the enforcement of Senate rules as \nwell as the security of the Capitol and Senate office buildings.\n  I try not to talk about this often, even though I would like to talk \nabout it more than I do. For a number of years of my life I was a \npolice officer. I was a Capitol policeman. I have my badge in my office \nacross the hall from here, and I am very proud of that. I was a Capitol \npoliceman, but today the Capitol policemen who work in this facility \nand around this great building and all the office buildings have so \nmany more responsibilities than someone who was a police officer during \nmy day.\n  Every minute of every day we have evil people trying to do harm to \nthese beautiful buildings and the people who work in them. It is the \nresponsibility of the Sergeant at Arms and the Capitol Police--for whom \nhe is responsible--to take care of us, and he has\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\ndone an admirable job. We are confident in him every day.\n  Under his leadership, the day-to-day operation of the Senate has \nnever been better, even though we have been through some difficult \ntimes with the government shutdown, sequestration, and all of those \nissues that have been very difficult, but none of this is surprising \nconsidering that Terry Gainer has been in public service for almost 50 \nyears.\n  He was a young homicide detective in Chicago. He comes from Chicago. \nHe did a lot of things as a police officer. He is a lawyer. He has been \nChief of the Capitol Police. Over the many years I have seen Chief \nGainer--that is what I call him, Chief Gainer. I don't call him Mr. \nGainer or Terry, I call him Chief because to me he will always be the \nChief of Police of the U.S. Capitol Police Force, for whom he did an \nadmirable job.\n  I check with the officers often and ask: How are things going? I \nthink that during the time he was the Chief of Police, the positive \nattitude of the police officers has been significant because of his \nexperience with the bad guys and his ability to do such a good job. \nThey felt very confident in his leadership abilities. He has been a \nwonderful Sergeant at Arms. Only one of his functions is to take care \nof the Capitol police.\n  As his time in the Senate comes to an end, Terry leaves his successor \nwith an organization that has weathered a government shutdown, as I \nmentioned, a crippling sequestration, and is adequately prepared for \nthe challenges of the future.\n  I try to be as praiseworthy as I feel is appropriate, but having done \nthat, I know I have not done justice to Terry Gainer. I will truly miss \nhim. I will miss him significantly. He is somebody we can all turn to, \nand he is very direct; whether it is the latest big problem we had with \nsome issues dealing with the Intelligence Committee and their battles \nwith the CIA, whatever it is, he has the ability to step forward and \nput out the flames.\n  I say to Terry Gainer: I am going to miss you. I have great affection \nfor you. I have great confidence in your having a wonderful future. You \nhave experience that very few people in the world have, and I wish you \nthe very best in all of your future endeavors and that of your wife \nIrene and all the kids.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Daryl Chappelle\n\n  Mr. President, not everybody knows the next individual I am about to \nacknowledge. He has a job in a small part of this great Capitol \ncomplex. He is retiring after having been a Senate employee for \napproximately 40 years. His name is Daryl Chappelle.\n  When I first came to the Senate, all rides to the office building \nwere in an old train. It was, as they still are, old, old, old. They \nwould crunch and bang as they went along the tracks. The handicapped \ncan't get on those trains. But a Republican Senator from Oklahoma who \nis now retired and I worked to change that so the train system would \nnot be the old, dilapidated trains, and now all the people coming from \nHart and Dirksen are in these beautiful enclosed trains that you can \nwheel a wheelchair in without any effort whatsoever, and that is \nwonderful.\n  There is a person there to help people who travel from the Old Senate \nOffice Building, as it was called when I was there. It is now called \nthe Russell Building. They still have this old train, and Daryl is \nalways there. He is so nice and greets everybody who comes on those \ntrains. We all recognize him when we are trying to get from here to the \nRussell Building.\n  He has operated the underground trains that run between the Capitol \noffice buildings for 41 years. He has a smile that covers his whole \nface. He has a voice that is infectious. You can hear him when he \nlaughs, and we will all miss that.\n  I join my colleagues in wishing Daryl all the best as he embarks on \nhis much needed and deserved retirement.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Terry Gainer\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I too want to comment on the great \nservice of Terry Gainer and Daryl Chappelle.\n  Our departing Sergeant at Arms, Terry Gainer, whose decade-plus \nperiod of Senate service has been the capstone to a very long and \ndistinguished career.\n  Terry is a familiar presence in the halls of the Capitol and always a \nreassuring one. Whenever you saw Terry, you always had the sense that \nthings were under control around here, even though you knew how much \nwork and preparation went into it. It is the same feeling you might \nhave being around the father of a large family or a veteran big city \ncop, and I think it is no accident that Terry is both of those as well.\n  He has the bearing of a guy with long experience who has seen it all. \nWe have all gotten the benefit of that experience over his years here, \nand that is something that just can't be bought.\n  Those of you who have watched the majority leader and I spar down \nhere on the floor in the mornings know we don't agree on much, but \npicking Terry was one decision he got just right.\n  Terry's resume is pretty well known by now. He spent nearly half a \ncentury enforcing the law at the Federal, State, and city levels in a \nnumber of very demanding, high-profile posts. He started his law \nenforcement career in Chicago during the tumultuous year of 1968, \nmaking him one of five boys in his family to serve in the Chicago \nPolice Department. That is to say nothing of his extended family. It is \na point of pride in the Gainer family that there has been a Gainer on \nthe Chicago PD for more than a century.\n  Terry volunteered to serve his country in Vietnam and served with \ndistinction. He spent several years as a homicide detective in Chicago \nbefore moving over to the State police. He later served as an official \nat the Transportation Department, and for a time he was No. 2 in the DC \nPolice Department. Somehow along the way he also got a law degree and \nhelped negotiate Chicago's first-ever labor contract with the police \nunion there.\n  He is the only person ever to serve as both the Chief of the Capitol \nPolice and the Senate Sergeant at Arms. During his tenure as the \nSenate's top law enforcement officer, he has overseen a dedicated team \nof 850 professionals. He has presided over major improvements to the \nphysical safety of the Capitol Complex and the Senate's IT \ninfrastructure here and in our State offices. He has kept us all \ninformed during emergencies.\n\n  For one night every January, he is the public face of the \ninstitution. I know Terry says he tries to get out of camera shot \nduring the State of the Union, but we won't blame a guy with 14 \ngrandkids for sneaking in a little face time on the State of the Union \nnight.\n  Terry recently admitted to having a few secret signals for the \ngrandkids--sort of like a third base coach. One time, he even got \nPresident Obama and the First Lady to pose for a photo with Flat \nStanley. It is just one of the fond memories he says he will carry with \nhim into his next chapter, and we wish him all the best.\n  We will miss his intelligence, his professionalism, and his good \nhumor. Terry's colleagues will tell us that among his many other \nqualities, he is a lot of fun to be around. We will also miss the \nwisdom and judgment he brought to the job every morning. Terry leaves a \nlegacy of excellence and a stellar example for his successors.\n  Let me add on that note that one of the most impressive aspects of \nTerry's legacy is the fact that despite the incredible demands of a \nhigh-pressure, high-profile career, he and Irene managed to raise six \nwonderful kids. I know they both share a deep and lively faith and \nwould attribute much of their success to that. But it is still \nimpressive, and we are glad the family will get to spend even more time \nwith Terry now.\n  So, Terry, thanks for your service. You are a credit to your \nprofession, your native Chicago, and to the Senate you have served so \nwell. You have every reason to be proud. Now go enjoy your retirement, \nat least for awhile.\n\n\n                       Tribute To Daryl Chappelle\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to another beloved member of the \nSenate family, Mr. Daryl Chappelle. Daryl has been here for more than \nfour decades, and this week he takes his final turn at the helm of one \nof the two subway cars that run from Russell to the Capitol.\n  Daryl came here right out of Springarn High School, over in northeast \nWashington, when he was 19 years\n\n[[Page S2573]]\n\nold, and by all accounts he has been an exemplary worker. He began his \ncareer in the night labor division of the Senate superintendent's \noffice in 1972. Since 1986, he has worked off and on as a mechanic and \ndriver for the subway service. By one estimate, he has taken 130,000 \ntrips between Russell and the Capitol.\n  But it is not the length of Daryl's tenure that I wish to honor this \nmorning, as impressive as that is. It is the spirit in which Daryl did \nhis job every day. It is literally legendary.\n  The motto of the Architect of the Capitol is to serve Congress and \nthe Supreme Court, preserve America's Capitol, and to inspire memorable \nexperiences, and I think Daryl Chappelle embodies that motto.\n  First of all, he is the happiest guy you ever met, and he has a \ngenius for lifting people's spirits. One of the stories I heard about \nDaryl this week came from a woman on my staff. She told me she met \nDaryl on her very first day here, more than a decade ago, and still \nremembers it vividly. She had just moved here from Kentucky for an \ninternship. She didn't know her way around, and she was pretty nervous, \nand it must have shown too because after giving her directions to the \noffice, Daryl not only gave her a big warm smile, he also left her with \na message that she has never forgotten. As she stepped off the train \nand headed off to her first day on the job, Daryl looked at her and \nsaid, ``Everything is going to be OK.''\n  It is a great story, because it not only captures Daryl's spirit, it \npoints to the secret of his success: Daryl is the undisputed champion \nof making the most of a brief encounter.\n  He showed us all the power of the small gesture. He reminded us that \nwhen all is said and done, what really matters is how we deal with each \nother. If you didn't happen to find yourself down by the trains this \nweek, you missed something special. People were pretty much tripping \nover each other to say goodbye to Daryl Chappelle: Senators, visitors, \ncolleagues, locals--everybody saying goodbye. It has been like a \nrolling party down there all week.\n  Over the years, through all of these trips, Daryl has had a \ntremendous impact on this place. Today we want to thank him for warming \nthis place every single day, and for helping our image around here, \nbecause Congress may not have a very high approval rating these days, \nbut nobody who ever had the pleasure of riding Daryl's train could ever \nleave Washington without feeling a little bit better about this place.\n  Now, Daryl, you may not have had any major pieces of legislation \nnamed after you during your years here; reporters may not have snapped \nphotographs of you when you walked down the hall, but at the beginning \nor the end of the day, you lifted our spirits. You brought us all back \nto Earth. It is hard to think of this place without you.\n  We wish you and Pat all the best in your retirement. I know you have \nbeen looking forward to spending more time with your bride. Thank you \nfor your service, my friend, and thank you for your wonderful example.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in the history of the United States of \nAmerica, we estimate some 500 million people have lived in this great \nNation--60 percent of them as of today. But in the history of America, \nwith 500 million people, only 1,950 men and women have been given the \nopportunity to serve in the Senate, including the Presiding Officer, \nour newest Senator, from the State of Montana. So 1,950 men and women \nwho have occupied this Chamber in the previous Senate, becoming part of \nthe history of this Nation and contributing to this great institution. \nI have been fortunate enough to have served with some of the greatest, \nand I have noted their presence, their impact, and I have noticed their \nabsence too.\n  When we take stock of the Senate and what it has done for America, \nwhat it means to America, it goes way beyond the men and women who \noccupy these desks. It includes a lot of people who make a contribution \nto this institution who may never be recognized for it, but, \nnevertheless, make this the great institution it is, serving this great \nNation. Today we honor two of those people.\n\n\n                       Tribute To Daryl Chappelle\n\n  First I wish to join in honoring Daryl Chappelle. Daryl, thank you so \nmuch for 41 years of service in the Senate. His legendary smile has \nwarmed my spirits on days when I was really down in the dumps. He \nalways had that happy smile, wishing me well. He was always making a \nperson's day a little bit better. Daryl, I want to thank you. Time and \ntime again, I am sure even on days when you weren't so up, you made a \npoint of adding to a positive feeling for everyone--not just Senators \nand staff but visitors as well. You have been a great part of our \nSenate family. I wish you the very best in your retirement. We are \ngoing to miss you on that rickety old train that runs back and forth \nbetween the Russell Building and the Capitol. I wish you the very best.\n\n\n                        Tribute To Terry Gainer\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I also come to the floor to give special \ntribute to our Sergeant at Arms, Terry Gainer, who is retiring. If one \nis not from Chicago and one doesn't know the scene very well, one may \nnot understand what I am about to say. Let me make it clear. When one \nasks where Terry Gainer is from and someone says Chicago, one would \nthen say: And?\n  He would add: The South Side.\n  And?\n  Beverly.\n  And?\n  Saint Barnabas.\n  When a person reports their parish in that section of Chicago, they \nhave really identified themselves as being part of that great city and \npart of a great American Catholic tradition--Irish Catholic tradition \nin many respects--that Terry Gainer represents.\n  I think about him today and what his life has meant, but first I \nthink of his family name. There aren't many names like the Gainer \nfamily name that carry with it so much respect in the city of Chicago. \nI think of his relatives I have worked with, the families who are \nrelated to him that I know, neighbors to staffers--the list goes on and \non of the Gainers who have made an impact on the city of Chicago and \nthe State of Illinois. Few can make the claim Terry can make in terms \nof what he has given to the city, the State of Illinois, and to our \nNation.\n  Terry Gainer, of course, is the Sergeant at Arms today and has \nannounced his retirement soon, after 7\\1/2\\ years serving in that \ncapacity, or at least serving in the Senate with the Capitol Police and \nwith the Sergeant at Arms office. He has served longer than any \nSergeant at Arms since World War II. Terry served as Sergeant at Arms \nand Doorkeeper since January of 2007. His accomplishments are so many.\n  Do not underestimate the responsibility that has been given to him \nand the men and women who work with him. This building is a target for \npeople who would bring destruction to this building and death to those \nwho visit. Sadly, we have seen graphic examples of that in recent years \npast. It has been Terry's job, both with the Capitol Police and now \nwith the Sergeant at Arms office, to keep us safe and to keep the \nbusiness of the Senate working every single day.\n  Terry had the background to achieve it. He volunteered to serve our \nNation in Vietnam. After his service, he retired as a captain in the \nNaval Reserves in the year 2000. He earned his bachelor's degree from \nSt. Benedict's College. He continued his family's proud tradition of \nlaw enforcement by serving in the Chicago Police Department for nearly \ntwo decades. As Senator McConnell mentioned earlier, over a century of \nservice by the Gainer family to the Chicago Police Department was \ncarried on by Terry. He obtained a master's of science degree and\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\nhis law degree from DePaul University. He was appointed superintendent \nof the Illinois State Police by Governor Jim Edgar and held that \nposition for 7 years. He was then called to Washington, DC, to serve as \nsecond in command at the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police \nDepartment.\n  In 2002, Terry became chief of the United States Capitol Police and \nwas instrumental in facilitating the substantial growth of that force \nin the challenging days following 9/11/2001.\n  After a brief stint in the private sector, Terry returned to public \nservice when he was appointed by Majority Leader Harry Reid to serve as \nSergeant at Arms. Harry Reid, himself a former Capitol Hill policeman, \nunderstood the responsibility and understood Terry was the right person \nfor the job.\n  As I noted earlier, during his tenure as the Sergeant at Arms, Terry \nhas done an exemplary job of balancing security and public access to \nthe Capitol and to the Senate. His steady management hand, his quick \nsmile, his constant presence in the halls of the Capitol and Senate \noffice buildings are going to be greatly missed.\n  I wish to thank Terry Gainer personally for his friendship, support, \nthe little favors he has done for me and for every Member of the Senate \nto make our lives and the lives of our family better. You have truly \nadded to this great institution, as much as any person who \nserved because you have made your mark and you have kept us safe and \nyou have kept the millions of visitors during your tenure safe as well.\n\n  That is quite an accomplishment, Terry.\n  Congratulations to you and especially to Irene, who has been patient \nthroughout it all, with her own career and her own effort, raising the \nfamily and making her mark professionally. The two of you are quite an \nexample to all of us of public service at its best.\n  Thanks, Terry, for your service.\n  And now comes the tough responsibility of following in the steps of \nTerry Gainer.\n  Majority Leader Reid has announced that Drew Willison, who is in the \nChamber here today, will be replacing Terry as the next Sergeant at \nArms and Doorkeeper--officially on Monday.\n  Drew has spent more than 5 years in two stints as the Deputy Sergeant \nat Arms, and he has learned from the best--Terry Gainer.\n  Prior to his work in the Sergeant at Arms office, Drew was a senior \nmember of the Senate Appropriations Committee staff, where we worked \ntogether. He had roles in the Energy and Water Subcommittee effort, as \nwell as the Legislative Branch Appropriations. His experience and \nknowledge of the legislative branch will serve him well in his new \ncapacity.\n  I congratulate Drew and wish him the very best of luck. Terry's \nservice as Sergeant at Arms has set the bar very high, but I know, \nDrew, you are up to the challenge.\n  Mr. President, let me end by thanking again Terry, Irene Gainer, the \nGainer family, and all who support them for unselfishly giving to this \nSenate such an extraordinary contribution--for sharing their husband, \nfather, and grandfather with our home State of Illinois and with this \ngreat Nation for so many years.\n  Terry and Irene have more than earned the right to move to the next \nchapter in their lives and to celebrate that time with their 6 children \nand 14 grandchildren.\n  I congratulate Terry on his distinguished public service career, for \nhis accomplishments as a law enforcement officer, a decorated veteran, \nand the Senate Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper. Most importantly, I \nthank Terry for his friendship.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I came to the floor primarily to talk \nabout a very serious matter; that is, our U.S. military and our \ncommitment not only to those who wear the uniform of the military--and, \nof course, I am aware of the Acting President pro tempore's long \ndistinguished service--but also the solemn obligation we have to our \nveterans once they leave active-duty status.\n  They have more than upheld their commitment--in the mountains, in the \nvalleys of Afghanistan, in the deserts of Iraq, and in postings around \nthe world, from Japan, to Korea, to Kuwait, to Israel, to Germany, and \nall across the globe. Of course, they have joined generations of men \nand women--the ``greatest generation,'' of which my dad was a member, \nthe World War II generation; and, of course, then those who fought in \nKorea, in Vietnam, and, of course, the most recent conflicts we have \nhad, which I just mentioned, in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  My strong conviction is that we owe a moral obligation, not just a \nlegal obligation, to those veterans, to keep our commitments to them \nonce they separate from military service.\n  I am sorry to say the Department of Veterans Affairs has repeatedly \nand outrageously failed to uphold its own commitment to America's Armed \nForces and our veterans.\n  The problem, the way I see it, is we have almost become desensitized \nbecause we all know as a result of the drawdown of our military after \nour exit from Iraq and now Afghanistan we are getting a large number of \npeople retiring from military service, so it is understandable there \nwould be more pressure put on the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nprocess these claims, to process these retirements, but what we have \nlearned is there are outrageous examples--for example, in Phoenix, \nwhere 40 veterans died because their names were taken off of the \nappointment system list in order to make the backlog look not as bad as \nit really was. Many of them had been put on what was called a secret \nwaiting list that was designed to conceal the unconscionably long wait \ntimes endured by up to 1,600 sick veterans.\n  So what I mean when I say I think we have become almost desensitized \nto this backlog--where more than half of the claims now made with the \nVA are backlogged, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs' own \ncriteria--it takes something like this, where 40 veterans have died \nbecause they were put on a secret waiting list in order to cook the \nbooks at the Phoenix VA, to hopefully wake us up and to get us to do \nsomething about this outrageous situation.\n  According to the investigation, high-level officials in the Phoenix \nVA knew about the secret waiting list, and they did nothing about it. \nIt is even worse than that. Not only did the Phoenix officials tolerate \nthis list, they actually defended it.\n  A former Phoenix VA doctor told CNN that the list ``was deliberately \nput in place to avoid the VA's own internal rules.'' That is why I call \nthis a case of cooking the books. To avoid accountability, to avoid \nsolving the problem, they tried to sweep the problem under the rug, and \nthat is outrageous.\n  One of the victims of the secret waiting list was a 71-year-old Navy \nveteran named Thomas Breen. In late September, Mr. Breen was rushed to \nthe\n\n[[Page S2575]]\n\nPhoenix VA hospital after he became ill. The doctors diagnosed him, \nknew he had a history of cancer, and they very clearly designated his \ncondition as ``urgent.'' That would indicate Mr. Breen should get \nanother checkup within a week of his visit to the emergency room. Yet \nMr. Breen was forced to wait and wait and wait and wait--even as he and \nhis daughter-in-law made daily phone calls to the VA asking about an \nappointment and emphasizing the urgency of his medical condition. Each \ntime they were told to wait just a little longer. Finally, a full 2 \nmonths after his initial ER visit, Mr. Breen passed away. The cause of \ndeath was stage 4 bladder cancer.\n  A week after that the VA finally called with Mr. Breen's \nappointment--after he died. By then, obviously, it was too late.\n  Stories such as Mr. Breen's should be a wake-up call to the U.S. \nSenate. They should be a wake-up call to the White House. They should \npierce our sense of moral indignation and say: When are we going to do \nsomething about this backlog? When are we going to hold people \naccountable for cooking the books so that they avoid accountability for \na backlog that we all know exists?\n  So I am suggesting again that the President needs to designate a \npoint person who will come in and deal with this on an emergency basis; \nit is that serious. The President needs to treat this seriously--not \nignore it, not sweep it under the rug--and the Senate needs to treat \nthis with the urgency it deserves as well, which is why I hope the \nmajority leader, who is the person responsible for such things, would \ndesignate or ask the committees with jurisdiction to hold emergency \nhearings to get to the bottom of this because we do not know whether \nthis just happened in Phoenix. Chances are it did not, and I will \nmention another outrageous example in a minute. We need to know if this \nis just a local matter or endemic to the whole VA disability and health \ncare system.\n  In Pittsburgh, we know there have been other problems. Six patients \nat the VA hospital died, and more than 20 others became sick, after an \noutbreak of Legionnaires' disease. As in Phoenix, patients at the \nPittsburgh facility were kept in the dark about what was going on. It \ntook ``CBS News'' doing an investigation to bring this to the light of \nday.\n  ``CBS News'' concluded:\n\n       An internal memo shows a top doctor at the hospital knew \n     that Legionella--\n\n  Which causes Legionnaires' disease--\n\n     could potentially be in the hospital's water system, and [he] \n     recommended the use of bottled water. Though staff members \n     were told to test patients for Legionnaires' disease if they \n     exhibited certain symptoms, there is no evidence to suggest \n     patients or their families were informed of management's \n     concerns about a potential outbreak.\n\n  In other words, they were kept in the dark.\n  It is scandals such as this and a rampant lack of accountability that \nhave prompted people such as Senator Marco Rubio from Florida to \nintroduce legislation that would give the VA Secretary more authority \nto fire and discipline senior officials for abuses and failures on the \njob. I think that is a smart move, and I am proud to cosponsor that \nbill. Because the lack of accountability leading to the problems I have \njust described is absolutely appalling. It should shock all of us.\n  The underlying problem, which we have known about--to which I fear \nCongress and the Federal Government have become desensitized--is there \nare literally hundreds of thousands of U.S. military veterans who are \nwaiting to have their disability, compensation, and pension claims \nprocessed and waiting more than the 125 days the VA calls a backlog.\n  According to the VA's own figures, in mid-April there were 602,000 \ncompensation and pension claims pending nationwide, and a majority of \nthem had been pending and in the backlog category.\n  For that matter, there are still 51,000 entitlement claims pending at \njust two VA regional offices, in Houston and Waco in my State. A \nmajority of those claims are backlogged too.\n  I know that Congress has taken steps to address the backlog in \nclaims. In the national defense authorization bill from last year, we \nincluded some of the provisions which authorized State-based veterans \norganizations, like those in Texas, to help the Federal Veterans' \nAdministration expedite processing of these backlogged claims. But it \nis not enough. The evidence from Pittsburgh and the evidence from \nPhoenix indicates that it is not enough. So we have to do more.\n  This is not partisan politics. This should not be treated as business \nas usual. This should be a call to action on the part of the Senate and \nthe Federal Government to live up to its obligations and its commitment \nto our Nation's veterans.\n  Just a few concluding words and thoughts about the challenges that \nface our current generation of military veterans. According to a recent \nsurvey, more than half of those who served in Afghanistan and Iraq \nstruggle with some sort of physical or mental health issues stemming \nfrom their service. Some of them are relatively minor. Some of them are \nvery serious, indeed. The serious ones have manifested themselves in \nhorrible ways. For example, one out of every two Afghan and Iraq war \nveterans says they know a fellow servicemember that has either \nattempted or committed suicide. As I said a moment ago, those who sign \nup for the U.S. military and our all-volunteer force receive a \npromise--a promise that if they serve their country, if they can do \ntheir part, their country, our country, will do our part.\n  All they are asking for is us to make good on that promise. Serving \nAmerica's veterans is one of the most important responsibilities the \nFederal Government has. The VA's failure to meet its responsibility is \nan ongoing scandal--one that I will continue drawing attention to until \nour veterans get the support they so rightfully deserve.\n  I hope my other colleagues, who I know share this commitment to our \nveterans, will come to the floor and urge the majority leader to ask \nthe committees with jurisdiction to convene emergency hearings to get \nto the bottom of this, to find out if what happened in Phoenix and \nPittsburgh are isolated events or if this a cancer that is eating away \nat our VA health care and disability system.\n  I call upon the President once again to appoint a point person to \nmake sure that we get to the bottom of this as soon as possible \nbecause, of course, this is an executive branch function--the veterans \nhealth care system. I remember when healthcare.gov was rolled out and \nthe Web site did not work the way the President expected it to. He \nappointed a point person to help make sure that all hands were on deck \nand we got to the bottom of the problem as soon as possible. I would \nthink that this scandal in the Veterans' Administration and the way our \nveterans are being treated would at least equal the same sense of \nurgency and call for the same sort of response as the failure of the \nWeb site for healthcare.gov.\n  So I hope our colleagues in the Senate can pull together to come to \nthe service of our veterans in a way that they deserve. I hope the \nPresident views this with the kind of urgency that it really deserves \nand appoints a point person who can get to the bottom of this, working \nwith Congress as quickly as possible so we can meet our obligations to \nour Nation's veterans.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before I give my intended remarks, I want \nto add my voice to others who have paid tribute to Daryl Chappelle, who \nretires today after 42 years of working in the Senate. I have only been \nhere for 3 years, but I can tell you, in the time that I have been \nhere, I look forward to running into Daryl as I make my trips back and \nforth between the Russell Senate Office Building and the Senate floor. \nThere are certain people in life who just brighten your day. Every \noccasion when I have encountered Daryl during the workday, it has just \nbeen that experience.\n\n[[Page S2576]]\n\n  I pay tribute to an individual about whom I don't know a lot \npersonally or of his background or his family. It is a sad thing about \nthe nature of today's busy world in which we don't know people--as I \ncertainly do at home and in hometowns across our country--but I will \ntell you that the opportunity to be with and experience the \nconversation and joy that Daryl adds to this place has been a real \ntreat and a wonderful experience for me.\n  I wish him and his family best wishes in his retirement and thank him \nfor his service to the Senate and to the people of our country.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Nancy Moritz\n\n  I rise to tell my colleagues about a nomination we are considering, \nand I speak in support of Justice Nancy Moritz.\n  She is currently a supreme court justice on the Kansas Supreme Court, \nand she is before us today as a nominee to sit on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n  I appreciate working with my colleague Senator Roberts and those in \nthe White House as we came together to try to find an acceptable and \nhonorable nominee, and I believe we did. I extend my appreciation to \nJustice Moritz for having agreed to answer the call to serve her \ncountry in a new capacity as a member of the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  She comes today before the Senate and again on Monday as someone who \nis highly qualified, greatly prepared, and who has the necessary \nbackground. Certainly the educational requirements are there, but the \nexperience that she has encountered in her distinguished legal career, \nboth public and private, really adds a dimension to this person and \nsomething that I would look for in a member of the tenth circuit.\n  For the past 4 years she has been a justice on the Kansas Supreme \nCourt. Prior to that she spent 15 years as an attorney in the U.S. \nattorney's office in our State in both Kansas City and Topeka. Prior to \nthat she had 6 years of experience in private practice as well.\n  Justice Moritz was raised in a small neighboring town of mine. Her \nhometown is Tipton. It is in many ways a typical small Kansas town. I \nknow folks in Tipton would tell me how exceptional they are--and I have \nseen many instances of how true that is--but I know the people of \nTipton. I have witnessed their character, their integrity, their work \nethic, their kindness, their care and genuine concern for others. That \nsense of community you attain when you grow up in a town of just a few \nhundred people is something I think has great benefit in becoming who \nwe are.\n  I, in some ways, admire the justice for that background and know what \nthat kind of experience means in molding her character as well as her \nwork ethic and how she conducts herself.\n  She also served for a period of time as a law clerk to Judge Ed \nLarson. Ed Larson was a law partner of mine, and he remains a good \nfriend. I called to visit with him about the nomination of Justice \nMoritz, and I trust his judgment. He not only was a law partner in \npractice with me--or really I was in practice with him--but he then \nwent to the court of appeals and then was elevated to the Kansas \nSupreme Court.\n  Of all the people I have met in life, and certainly many of the \nattorneys I have met in life and the judges, if you were looking for \nsomeone whose opinion and judgment you would trust, Judge Ed Larson is \ncertainly that person. He has made clear to me that Justice Moritz was \none of the very best law clerks he ever had, and he believes her to be \nhighly qualified. With his recommendation, my judgment about Justice \nMoritz was even more increased and enhanced.\n  Again, I am convinced that her background, growing up the way she \ndid, her experience with Judge Larson and his stamp of approval upon \nher character and abilities, suggests we have a great person to join \nthe tenth circuit.\n  I encourage my colleagues to review her qualifications, and I would \nhope and assume they would reach the same conclusion that I have, that \nthe Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals will be well served with this Kansan \non it. I look forward to supporting her confirmation, and I ask my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I rise in support of the nominations of George Hazel and \nTheodore Chuang to be U.S. district judges for the District of \nMaryland.\n  Let me say from the beginning that I am very proud of the manner in \nwhich Senator Mikulski, the senior Senator from Maryland, and I have \nestablished a process to review and make recommendations to the \nPresident for the vacancies in the U.S. District of Maryland.\n  We have used a process that we think works. It gets us the most \nqualified individuals, and these two today are certainly an example of \nhighly qualified individuals who want to be judges for the right \nreasons. They have a demonstrated track record of public service.\n  I particularly appreciate their commitment to pro bono. They \nunderstand that the courts need to be open to all and that we have a \nspecial responsibility as lawyers and as judges to make sure that there \nis equal access to justice. They understand the appropriate role of a \njudge in our system to be objective and to carry out the laws of this \nland.\n  George Jarrod Hazel received his B.A. cum laude in 1996 from \nMorehouse College and his J.D. in 1999 from Georgetown University Law \nCenter. He was nominated to fill the vacancy created by the taking of \nsenior status in May of 2013 by Judge Alexander Williams, Jr.\n  I might just say Judge Williams had a very distinguished record on \nthe district court.\n  Mr. Hazel began his legal career in private practice from 1999 to \n2004. He then became a government prosecutor as an assistant U.S. \nattorney in the District of Columbia from 2005 to 2008.\n  He then joined the Greenbelt, MD, U.S. attorney's office for the \nDistrict of Maryland. Finally, Mr. Hazel joined the office of the \nState's attorney for Baltimore City and now serves as the chief deputy \nState's attorney.\n  I can attest that being the chief deputy State's attorney in \nBaltimore City is a demanding position. In his present job, Mr. Hazel \nhelps to oversee 200 prosecutors and 200 support staffers, and he has \nfought tirelessly to keep our communities safe and make them safer. In \nfact, he has played a key role in achieving those objectives.\n  He has demonstrated in his entire career as a lawyer a commitment to \npublic service in each of the positions that he has held. He wants to \nserve the public, and these are the types of people I would hope we \nwould like to see in our district court.\n  Mr. Hazel has extensive Federal and State court litigation \nexperience, including civil and criminal matters, as well as jury \ntrials. He has served as a prosecutor, private attorney, and manager of \na large legal office.\n  Mr. Hazel lives in North Potomac with his wife and two children. He \nis an active member of his community. He is a leader in the \nMetropolitan Baptist Church of Largo, MD, and in Washington, DC, and \nhas served as a member, trustee, and now as a deacon.\n  In terms of his pro bono commitment, Mr. Hazel has been president of \nhis church's legal ministry, where he has assisted members of the \nchurch, including many who could not afford lawyers, in obtaining legal \nrepresentation when they are in need.\n  He also prepares meals at the church and teaches Sunday school \nclasses.\n  Mr. Chuang was nominated to fill the vacancy created by Judge Roger \nTitus when he took senior status in January of this year.\n  Judge Titus had a very distinguished record and continues to have a \nvery distinguished record in our district court.\n  Mr. Chuang received his J.D. magna cum laude in 1994 from Harvard Law \nSchool and his B.A. summa cum laude in 1991 from Harvard University. He \nbegan his legal career as a law clerk for Judge Dorothy W. Nelson in \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1994 to 1995. From \n1995 to 1998, Mr. Chuang served as a trial attorney in the Civil Rights \nDivision of the U.S. Department of Justice. From 1998 to 2004, Mr. \nChuang served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the District of \nMassachusetts. He spent 3 years in private practice from 2004 to 2007.\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\n  He served as a deputy chief investigative counsel for the U.S. House \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform from 2007 to 2009. In 2009 \nhe became the chief investigative counsel for the Committee on Energy \nand Commerce in the House of Representatives. Mr. Chuang currently \nserves as deputy chief counsel of the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity, where he has worked since 2009.\n  Like Mr. Hazel, Mr. Chuang has devoted his entire professional career \nto serving the public. He is very much interested in helping this \ncommunity and, again, he is the type of individual I hope we would all \nlike to see in our district court.\n  Mr. Chuang has extensive Federal court litigation experience, both \ncivil and criminal cases, including jury trials. He has served in all \nthree branches of government: as clerk, law clerk, congressional \ninvestigative counsel, and agency deputy general counsel. The American \nBar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave him \na ``well qualified'' rating. You can see that he has the type of \nexperience and type of sensitivity to understand the appropriate role \nof a district court judge.\n  Mr. Chuang lives in Bethesda with his wife and his two children. He \nis an energetic member of his community. In terms of his pro bono work, \nhe has served on the board of directors of the Asian Pacific American \nLegal Resource Center, a nonprofit legal services organization that \nserves low-income, limited-English proficient Asian Americans and \nimmigrants in Maryland, Washington, DC, and Virginia, and which \nprovides legal representation and referral services in cases involving \ndomestic violence, family law, immigration law, employment law, and a \nvariety of other areas.\n  Mr. Chuang also told us that from approximately 2002 to 2003, as \npresident of the Asian American Lawyers Association of Massachusetts, \nhe oversaw and promoted a project of the organization's Community \nService Committee to provide a pro bono legal workshop in Boston's \nChinatown, at which attorneys provided general information about \nimmigration law, employment law, and other areas of law that may affect \nthe lives of area residents.\n  He is committed to helping his community, and he has demonstrated \nthat during his entire professional career.\n  Mr. Chuang's parents emigrated from Taiwan to the United States \nseeking freedom and opportunity. I would note that if confirmed, Mr. \nChuang would not only be the first Asian-American Federal judge in \nMaryland but also the first Asian-American Federal judge in the Fourth \nCircuit, covering five States in the Mid-Atlantic and South.\n  President Obama nominated these two individuals in September of 2013 \nand the Judiciary Committee held their confirmation hearings in \nDecember of 2013. The Judiciary Committee then favorably reported both \nnominations in January of this year.\n  I urge the Senate to confirm these very well-qualified nominees and \nfill these important vacancies to better serve the people of Maryland.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last year, the Senate came together to pass \nmeaningful legislation that was supported by victims of violence, law \nenforcement, and those committed to working to end domestic and sexual \nabuse. That bill, the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act, had the support of all Senate Democrats and a \nmajority of Senate Republicans. It cleared the Republican House \noverwhelmingly and it was signed into law 1 year ago. In a divided \nCongress, this historic reauthorization was made possible because so \nmany victims and service providers stood together to push for a \ncomprehensive bill.\n  The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, which I was proud to \nco-author with Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho, strengthens \nprotections on campuses, where far too many students have become \nvictims of devastating violence instead of enjoying the wonderful \nexperience of learning and growth that we all wish for our children. \nOur bill, which was signed into law last year, ensures that college \nstudents are informed of the resources available to them if they are \nvictims of sexual assault or stalking, and of their school's planned \nresponse to such crimes.\n  For women like Laura Dunn, these provisions have real meaning. When \nmany skeptics called for a watered-down VAWA bill to make it easier to \npass, champions like Ms. Dunn, a courageous survivor of campus sexual \nassault, urged us to stand strong for all victims. More than 200 \nsurvivors of campus violence at 176 colleges and universities joined \nher in an open letter to Congress calling for the passage of the Leahy-\nCrapo VAWA bill. People like her made all the difference in our ability \nto ultimately pass this important legislation.\n  One year after its enactment, I am heartened that the Obama \nadministration has begun to implement the Leahy-Crapo VAWA bill and \nthat it announced a series of steps that will help colleges and \nuniversities meet new requirements contained in the law. This includes \nstronger reporting requirements and better training for university \nofficials, more coordination between campus police and local law \nenforcement, and the implementation of privacy policies to protect the \nidentity of victims. I can remember the horrific scenes I witnessed \nwhen I was a prosecutor in Vermont. I can also remember that I never \nasked a victim about their nationality, immigration status, religion, \nsexual orientation, or political affiliation. As I have said countless \ntimes, a victim is a victim is a victim. Providing a victim with the \nservices they need in a safe and private environment is common sense \nand I am glad the Obama administration is making the protections \nSenator Crapo and I fought for a reality for students across the \ncountry.\n  We cannot stop there, however, and we should be doing even more to \nprotect all victims of crime. That is why I urge my fellow Senators to \nsupport the Justice for All Reauthorization Act. This comprehensive and \nbipartisan legislation was unanimously approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in October. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act protects \nvictims of crime by providing them with the resources they need and \nenhancing protections for crime victims. It also helps to prevent and \noverturn wrongful convictions, and provides law enforcement with the \ntools and resources necessary to ensure justice for all.\n  The Justice for All Act reauthorizes the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog \nReduction Act, which has provided significant funding to reduce the \nbacklog of untested rape kits so that victims need not live in fear \nwhile rape kits languish in storage. It also strengthens the Kirk \nBloodsworth Post Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program, one of the key \nprograms created in the Innocence Protection Act.\n  Kirk Bloodsworth was a young man just out of the Marines when he was \nsentenced to death for a heinous crime that he did not commit. He was \nthe first death row inmate in the United States to be exonerated \nthrough the use of DNA evidence. There are certainly others out there \nlike Kirk Bloodsworth now, wrongly convicted, waiting for the day when \na DNA test will prove their innocence and set them free. We must never \nstop trying to improve our imperfect criminal justice system, to bring \nclosure to cases swiftly but accurately, and to correct mistakes when \nthey happen.\n  The Justice for All Act reauthorizes funding for the Paul Coverdell \nForensic Science Improvement Grant Program, which assists laboratories \nin performing the many forensic tests that are essential to solving \ncrimes and prosecuting offenders.\n  The Justice for All Reauthorization Act is a bipartisan bill that \nSenator Cornyn and I introduced nearly 1 year ago. All Senate Democrats \nsupport passage of this bill, and it is even cosponsored by the \nminority leader, Senator McConnell, but it has not passed the Senate \nbecause some Senate Republicans object. In the face of this \nobstruction, some would have us pick\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\napart pieces of the Justice for All Reauthorization Act, with the hope \nthat we can do the other pieces later. To me, to law enforcement, and \nto countless victims of crime, this is not acceptable. Just last year, \nwe showed the country it was possible to stand with all victims of \ndomestic and sexual violence when we ignored the critics in the House \nwho tried to divide us. When they told us we could only protect some \nvictims, we refused to let them pit survivors of injustice against one \nanother.\n  By remaining unified in the face of such efforts, this divided \nCongress was able to pass a historic Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act that for the first time provided key protections \nfor college students, tribal women, and members of the LGBT community. \nThis year, we should again stand by all victims of crime and do what is \nright by passing a comprehensive Justice for All Reauthorization Act. \nWe should not let the House of Representatives lessen our resolve to \nreauthorize public safety programs widely supported by crime victims \nand law enforcement.\n  I remain steadfast in my resolve to get this done. I know every \nSenate Democrat shares this resolve, and I know that law enforcement, \ncivil rights leaders, victims groups, and countless others feel the \nsame way. I hope Senate Republicans will join us to pass meaningful \nlegislation that supports all victims of crime and upholds our system \nof justice. We should stand united for all victims. I urge all \nsenators, and particularly those in the Republican Caucus, to clear the \nJustice for All Act without further delay.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/01/senate-section/article/S2578-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2578-S2579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF THEODORE CHUANG\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to talk for a few minutes on \none of the nominations we have today, the nomination of Theodore Chuang \nto be district judge for Maryland. This nomination was voted out of \ncommittee on a 10-to-8 vote. I opposed the nomination in committee, and \nI would urge my colleagues to do the same today. I can't support the \nnomination because of the central role Mr. Chuang played in the \nadministration's persistent and steadfast stonewalling of the \ncongressional investigation into the attack on our diplomatic mission \nin Benghazi on September 11, 2012. That attack resulted in the first \nmurder of a sitting U.S. Ambassador in over 30 years. Three other brave \nAmericans serving their country were killed in Benghazi as well.\n  As we all know too well, just hours after the fighting had ended, \nthis administration--in the middle of a Presidential campaign at the \ntime--rushed to blame the attack on an obscure Internet video. The \nadministration denied what was already clear: that what had happened at \nBenghazi was a premeditated terrorist attack that had nothing to do \nwith any video. The CIA's Libya station chief and other administration \nofficials immediately recognized and reported that the attack was an \nact of terror, not a spontaneous demonstration. The American people \ndemanded answers. Congress demanded answers as well. But the \nadministration has systematically stonewalled our ability to get those \nanswers. That is where this nominee's role comes into play.\n  Following the Benghazi attack, Mr. Chuang left his position at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to undertake a special detail at the \nState Department. His job at the State Department was to provide legal \nguidance and manage the Department's responses to the congressional \ninvestigation into a terrorist attack.\n  For months the State Department ignored congressional inquiries. That \nforced the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee to issue \nsubpoenas in August 2013. Mr. Chuang received those duly issued \nsubpoenas but continued the administration's policies of systematic \nstonewalling.\n  So let me be very clear. The State Department has never asserted that \nthe emails, the documents or witness interviews conducted by the \nBenghazi Accountability Review Board are protected by executive \nprivilege. The State Department has never asserted any privilege \njustifying its refusal to disclose documents responsive to these \nsubpoenas. The State Department has never provided any legal basis \nwhatsoever for its continued stonewalling of this investigation.\n  So following Mr. Chuang's nomination hearing before our Judiciary \nCommittee, I asked him several questions for the record about why the \nState Department refused to comply with its legal obligation to respond \nto the subpoenas. Mr. Chuang, who was in charge of coordinating the \nState Department's responses, couldn't come up with a legal basis. \nInstead, he cited only ``institutional concerns.''\n  That ought not be a good enough answer for what is a legitimate role \nof oversight by the Congress, trying to get answers to legitimate \nquestions. In other words, abstract ``institutional concerns'' does not \npermit the executive branch to toss a congressional subpoena into the \ngarbage.\n  Benghazi raises questions of vital national importance that to this \nvery day remain unanswered. They remain unanswered because this \nadministration refuses to honor its legal obligations to comply with \nthe congressional oversight that is being done through the \nextraordinary measure of subpoena. The American people deserve better \nand so do we. We are members of coequal branches of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  But the Benghazi scandal isn't simply going to go away. In fact, just \nthis week additional emails came to light demonstrating that the White \nHouse led a coordinated messaging effort on Benghazi from the very \nbeginning.\n  This is what one of the emails said: It was the administration's goal \n``to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video and \nnot a broader failure of policy.''\n  That quotation is from an email sent by the administration's Deputy \nNational Security Advisor on September 14, 2012--2 days after the \nattack. That email was sent even though officials on the ground in \nLibya had reported that the attack was an act of terror.\n  Some have called this email the smoking gun, proving that the \nadministration intentionally misled the American people about the \nterrorist attack, but no matter how this email is characterized, it was \nclearly responsive to congressional subpoenas and does not seem to have \nbeen produced until a government watchdog group filed a Freedom of \nInformation lawsuit seeking to compel the administration to comply.\n  So let me be clear. From what we know now, it took a Freedom of \nInformation Act request and an ensuing lawsuit to force the State \nDepartment to produce documents that were obviously related to the \nterror attack at Benghazi, and this is the case even though the House \ncommittee made multiple requests for those documents and then issued \nsubpoenas compelling their production.\n  I am sure Mr. Chuang thought he was doing his duty to zealously \nrepresent his client when he was managing the document subpoenas the \nState Department received from Congress, but his role in coordinating \nadministrative responses was plainly unsatisfactory and unacceptable \nand something that goes against the grain of an administration that on \nday two of their administration--in other words, January 21, 2009--said \nthis was going to be the most transparent administration in the history \nof the country.\n  We should demand more and expect more respect for congressional \noversight. For this reason I have decided to oppose this nomination, a \nnomination that was reported out of committee on a 10-to-8 vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nominations \nrelated to the cloture vote of Theodore Chuang and George Hazel.\n  Senator Cardin and I are recommending these two outstanding men to \nserve on the U.S. district court in Maryland. Senator Cardin and I are \nproud to nominate these men because of the outstanding qualities they \nwill bring to the Federal bench in Maryland that has had a long and \ndistinguished career of absolutely fantastic judges.\n  We have before us two Maryland judges who will be taking a different \nstatus--Judge Titus and Judge Williams. Judge Williams served in the \nSouthern District of the Maryland Federal court--and we salute those \ntwo for\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\ntheir outstanding service. On another day I will say what a great job \nthey have done.\n  Senator Cardin and I take our responsibilities for recommending to \nthe President the people of the highest caliber to serve as judges. We \nbelieve very strongly in the concept of an independent judiciary, \npeople who will bring to the bench absolute integrity, judicial \ncompetence and temperament, a commitment to the core constitutional \nprinciples that have made our country great, and also though a history \nof civic engagement in Maryland--because a judge is not how many Law \nReview articles they write but can they administer equal justice and \ncontinue to honor equal protection under the law. Mr. Chuang and Mr. \nHazel meet and exceed these standards.\n  Mr. Hazel comes with an incredible background. He served as an \nassistant U.S. attorney to the district court of Maryland. He has been \nthe southern division coordinator on tough issues such as Project \nExile, a Federal-State partnership addressing gun and violent crimes in \nPrince George's County and surrounding areas. He spent 5 years in \nprivate practice at Weil, Gotshal & Manges. He is also a man of faith, \ninvolved deeply in his church, Metropolitan Baptist Church, where he \nserves as a deacon.\n  Most recently, he has worked with the Baltimore State's attorneys \noffice. The Baltimore State's attorney's office faced a lot of \nchallenges. It faced dated technology and difficulties in maintaining \nchain of custody on evidence. He came in to work with our new State's \nattorney, which is an elected position, and he is a real reformer. So \nwhether you were a prosecutor or you were a defendant, you knew it was \ngoing to be one of the best well-organized offices in Maryland.\n  Hazel brought that kind of know-how to make sure the apparatus of \ngovernment worked because that was all part of making sure people got \nequal justice: Did we have the right guy when we were a prosecutor? Did \nwe have the right evidence? Did the prosecutor have the right tools? \nDid the public defender or their private counsel have the opportunity \nto provide the defense of them? We have been able to do that. Also, \nworking in his church he has shown he has been available to provide all \nkinds of pro bono services.\n  He is a graduate of a distinguished law school and he is a Morehouse \nman. I think when he takes the Federal bench and takes that oath, we \nare going to be proud of the service he does.\n  Then there is Mr. Chuang, the one who has been under dispute today. \nGosh, I wish the whole Senate could meet him as well as Mr. Hazel. This \nis a new generation coming into the Maryland Federal judiciary. Mr. \nChuang's parents and his own story is that of the American dream.\n  Mr. Chuang's parents came with practically nothing from Taiwan \nseeking the American dream and a better life for their family. He \nworked very hard and then went on to some of our most distinguished \nschools. He went to Harvard Law School and Harvard University. He was a \nsumma cum laude undergraduate and named by Time magazine as one of the \nhigh achievers. At Harvard, he was with the Law Review. But as I said, \nit is not how many Law Review articles one writes; it is, do they right \nwrongs in our society.\n  Yes, he has served at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; yes, \nhe has worked in government positions; yes, he has worked in private \npractice at Wilmer Cutler; yes, he has been at the Department of \nJustice; and, yes, he did provide legal counsel to the State \nDepartment. I am going to talk about that.\n  First of all, I am kind of tired of this Benghazi witch hunt stuff, \nbut I am not going to go into that. I respect my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. Congress has a right to oversight.\n  But let me make the record clear: Mr. Chuang's role during his \ntemporary assignment was as legal counsel providing legal advice and \nrepresentation to his client. His client was the State Department. \nAlthough he provided legal advice related to the House Committee on \nOversight & Government Reform, he did not have decisionmaking authority \nover whether to provide subpoenaed documents to the committee. That was \nat higher levels. If the committee had a beef with the State \nDepartment, they should have taken it up with the Secretary of the \nState, which I know they did.\n  During his 6-month detail, the State Department produced a vast \nmajority of documents and witnesses requested by the HOGR.\n  In the case of the subpoena in question--which was for internal files \nof the independent Accountability Review Board that conducted the \nBenghazi investigation--the State Department agreed to produce most of \nthe documents but has to date declined to produce memoranda of \ninterviews of State Department personnel because disclosure of those \nwitness statements may chill cooperation in future ARBs. Although State \noffered to discuss alternative means of serving the committee's \nrequest, the House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform has not \nactively engaged the State Department on this since the fall of 2013.\n  Opposition to Mr. Chuang's nomination will have no impact on whether \nthe State Department produces the documents, and he is not a State \nDepartment employee.\n  So I respect my colleagues for wanting to have cooperation. I don't \ndispute whether they have a legitimate grievance. I leave that in that \nfield and domain, but I would say Mr. Chuang's role was that of a civil \nservant, providing advice to the leadership of the State Department on \nthis matter. Then the State Department's job, at its highest level, was \nto negotiate with the House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform, \nchaired by Mr. Issa and the ranking member, our very good colleague \nCongressman Cummings of Baltimore.\n  So if we are going to vote against Chuang because the Secretary of \nState did or did not do something, I think we have other problems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask for 1 additional minute to summarize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If we continue to attack people because of the job they \ndid for which they had no decision about, we are going to have a \nchilling effect on who comes into government.\n  If these two men whom I am recommending and whom the President has \nnominated were in private practice, they could be making hundreds of \nthousands of dollars. Because these two men are duty-driven, with \noutstanding educations, backgrounds, and experience, they have chosen \npublic service. I hope the Senate chooses them to serve on the Federal \nbench. This body is going to be very proud of them the way Senator \nCardin and I are in bringing them to the floor's attention. I urge that \nwe invoke cloture.\n  I yield the floor and ask that we follow regular order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/01/senate-section/article/S2579-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, we are again voting to overcome \nRepublican filibusters of three highly qualified judicial nominees. \nRepublicans\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\ncontinue to refuse to consent to vote on much needed judges to our \nFederal Judiciary. We currently stand at 80 vacancies and have not had \nfewer than 60 vacancies since February 2009, at the beginning of \nPresident Obama's first term. For most of President Obama's tenure in \noffice, judicial vacancies have continued to hover around 80 and 90 \nbecause of Senate Republican obstruction. Nevertheless, Senate \nRepublicans continue to object to votes on these nominations. This \nincludes the three nominations that we are voting on today.\n  Nancy Moritz has been nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Tenth Circuit. Justice Moritz is currently a justice on the \nKansas Supreme Court, where she has been serving since 2011. Prior to \njoining the Kansas Supreme Court, she was an appellate judge on the \nKansas Court of Appeals from 2004 to 2011. Before becoming a judge, \nJustice Moritz spent nearly ten years as an assistant U.S. attorney in \nthe Kansas City and Topeka offices. From 1989 till 1995, she was an \nassociate at Spencer, Fane Britt & Browne, LLP in Kansas City and \nOverland Park. From 1987 to 1989, she served as a law clerk to the \nHonorable Patrick F. Kelly, U.S. District Court for the District of \nKansas. Justice Moritz has the support of her Republican home state \nsenators, Senator Roberts and Senator Moran. She was also reported from \nthe Judiciary Committee unanimously by voice vote on January 16, 2014.\n  Theodore Chuang has been nominated to serve on the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Maryland. Since 2009, Mr. Chuang has served \nin the Office of General Counsel at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. He currently serves as deputy general counsel and as counsel \non detail to the U.S. Department of State. Previously, Mr. Chuang \nserved as the chief investigative counsel for the House Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce and the deputy chief investigative counsel for the \nHouse Committee on Oversight and Government Reforms from 2007 to 2009. \nFrom 2004 to 2007, Mr. Chuang worked in private practice as a counsel \nat the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP. Prior to \nthat, Mr. Chuang served as an assistant U.S. attorney, Criminal \nDivision, for the District of Massachusetts from 1998 to 2004 and as a \ntrial attorney in the Housing and Civil Enforcement Section of the \nJustice Department from 1995 to 1998. Upon graduating from Harvard Law \nSchool, magna cum laude, Mr. Chuang served as a law clerk to Judge \nDorothy W. Nelson on the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals from 1994 \nto 1995.\n  Mr. Chuang has the support of his home State Senators, Senator \nMikulski and Senator Cardin. He was voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee on a 10-8 vote on January 16, 2014. During the committee \nvote, the ranking member urged others to vote ``No'' based on the fact \nthat Mr. Chuang has been serving on temporary detail to the State \nDepartment and has been working with the agency to assist in its \nresponse to the ongoing congressional investigation into Benghazi. The \nranking member argued that because the administration has refused to \nturn over interview notes and summaries that he would vote ``No'' on \nMr. Chuang's nomination. This appears to be a case where Mr. Chuang is \nbeing held responsible for the decisions of the administration not to \nturn over the documents when it was not his decision to make. Moreover, \nMr. Chuang has responded to the ranking member's Question for the \nRecord on this issue fully and forthrightly, and nothing in those \nresponses indicates that Mr. Chuang has conducted himself improperly in \nany way. Mr. Chuang is a superbly qualified attorney with an impeccable \nbackground, and should be supported by the entire Senate.\n  George Hazel has been nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Maryland. Since 2010, he has served as the chief deputy \nState's attorney for the office of the Maryland State's attorney for \nBaltimore City. Prior to taking this position, he was an assistant U.S. \nattorney for the district of Maryland from 2008 to 2010 and for the \nDistrict of Columbia from 2005 to 2008. From 1999 to 2004, Mr. Hazel \nalso served in private practice at the law firm Weil, Gotshal and \nManges, LLP. An experienced trial counsel, Mr. Hazel has tried \napproximately 50 cases to verdict. Mr. Hazel also has the support of \nhis home State senators, Senator Mikulski and Senator Cardin. He was \nreported from the Judiciary Committee unanimously by voice vote on \nJanuary 16, 2014.\n  All three of these nominees have the experience, judgment, and legal \nacumen to be terrific judges in our Federal courts. Let us end these \nunnecessary filibusters. I thank the majority leader for filing cloture \npetitions and I hope my fellow Senators will join me today to end these \nfilibusters so that these nominees can get working on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nnomination of Theodore David Chuang, of Maryland, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the District of Maryland, shall be brought to a \nclose?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the time until 1:45 p.m. be \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Highway Trust Fund\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the Highway Trust Fund is a vital \nresource for States to tackle much-needed transportation projects. But \nright now that trust fund is running on fumes. States from Vermont to \nCalifornia and many in between are rethinking their plans for \nconstruction because of funding uncertainty in the Highway Trust Fund. \nOne example is New Mexico. Their State officials are starting to ramp \nup construction plans for Interstate 25 in Albuquerque. That project \nhas been a high priority for city officials for a number of years. Once \nit is completed, it is going to reduce traffic and improve safety. That \nis vital for that area. But right now State officials in New Mexico \nhave said they are concerned about Federal funding for that project and \nit now might be in jeopardy.\n  That is not an isolated case. The trust fund supports transportation \nprojects across our entire country. It eases congestion for our \ncommuters and for businesses that need to move their goods efficiently \nand quickly. It funds safety initiatives and construction that improves \nour roads and bridges. It sparks job creation for American workers.\n  But the Department of Transportation now says that trust fund will \nnot be able to keep up with its payments to States as soon as this \nsummer. This crisis is right around the corner. Many States are now \nplanning for worst-case scenarios. In fact, the State of Missouri has \nstopped planning for\n\n[[Page S2582]]\n\nnew projects. In Colorado, a State official has said: Without these \nfunds, major projects probably will not be completed or ever get \nunderway.\n  Arkansas has begun planning several projects to replace old bridges \nand widen highways and repair roads, but now, their transportation \nofficials have put 10 projects on hold because of this looming crisis.\n  Construction is at its height during our summer months. So if the \nHighway Trust Fund hits a crisis in the next few months, we could \npotentially see a construction shutdown, meaning workers are going to \nbe left without paychecks.\n  That could add up to 10,000 jobs in Florida, according to the \nPresident of the Florida Transportation Builders Association. Across \nthe country, failing to shore up our Highway Trust Fund could cost more \nthan 180,000 jobs in fiscal year 2015. That is according to an analysis \nfrom the Center for American Progress.\n  In Kentucky, Governor Steve Beshear summed it up by telling \nreporters: ``We can't afford for the Highway Trust Fund to go \ninsolvent.'' States and workers are counting on us to solve this. I am \nhopeful that we can replenish the Highway Trust Fund in a bipartisan \nway. In fact, House Republican Dave Camp, who chairs the Ways and Means \nCommittee, has proposed using corporate revenue to replenish the \nHighway Trust Fund.\n  President Obama's Grow America Act also calls for corporate revenue \nto address this crisis and make important investments in our \ninfrastructure. That approach makes a lot of sense. Closing wasteful \nloopholes so we can create jobs here at home would be good for our \nworkers, good for our economy, and it would make our broken tax system \nfairer in the process. I am here today to say I am hoping that \nRepublicans will come to the table willing to close just a few \ncorporate loopholes so we can avoid an unnecessary crisis in our \nHighway Trust Fund, so that we can give our States more certainty to \nplan and we can help spark job growth in the summer.\n  But if Republicans are not willing to work with us, they are going to \nhave to explain why egregious corporate tax loopholes are more \nimportant than workers in our construction industry and more important \nthan drivers and businesses that rely every day on safe roads and \nbridges.\n  I am here to say and to warn that construction projects are at risk \nacross our country. Another example happens to be in New Hampshire, \nwhere construction crews have been working on a major project to widen \nInterstate 93. That project was designed to ease congestion and improve \nsafety. Last month the State transportation commissioner said the \nproject could be stalled and thrown off schedule if Congress does not \nresolve the Highway Trust Fund crisis. He said, ``Any hiccup in federal \nfunding could have a negative impact on the ending.''\n  For many States this looming crisis is already a reality. We have to \nact now. So let's show our States that together we will continue to \ninvest in projects that help drivers and help businesses move their \ngoods, and let's show the American people that Congress can work \ntogether to ensure vital transportation construction projects will move \nforward this summer. Let's shore up that Highway Trust Fund and avoid \nthis unnecessary and totally preventable crisis.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Campaign Finance\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nthe corrupting power of money in our national politics and the tragic \nimpact of a whole series of decisions by the Supreme Court that has \nsteadily strengthened that power.\n  Over the last 40 years a bipartisan coalition in this body and \nbipartisan coalitions in Congress have come together behind commonsense \nmeasures that actually succeeded in limiting the power of money in \npolitics. Most recently, back in 2002, a bipartisan coalition in this \nChamber led by Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold, Republican and \nDemocrat, took a few steps to effectively limit the use of so-called \n``soft money'' and to ban special interests from pouring money into \nnational elections in the month or two before Election Day.\n  As actual elected representatives, their perspective as Members of \nCongress who enacted that legislation was informed by their real \nexperience as public officials who have run and won elections and who \nhave written, fought for, and passed actual legislation.\n  Since Members of this Chamber, Members of this Congress, have seen \nand experienced the corrosive effect of money every day, Congress, in \nmy view, should be given great deference when it has been able to \ntranscend partisan division and put in place commonsense protections.\n  Yet over the past few years a bare majority on the current Supreme \nCourt has, in decision after decision, dismantled many of those \ncritical protections and shows no signs of stopping.\n  In doing so, this Court's decisions display a significant and \nstunning naivete about how our political system actually works and how \nit is continuing to change and as a result have brought us closer to a \nworld where, as a recent New Republic piece argues, ``millionaires and \nbillionaires speak loudly and the rest of us do the listening.''\n  Most recently, in a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court struck down a \nlimit that has stood since 1971, when Congress passed the Federal \nElections Campaign Act, on total campaign donations anyone may make in \nthe same election cycle.\n  Before this recent Supreme Court ruling, individuals couldn't give \nmore than $117,000 between candidates and party committees. After the \nruling, that limitation has been swept away, and there is nothing to \nstop a wealthy donor, an ultrawealthy donor, from contributing to every \nFederal race each election cycle.\n  Some here have cheered the decision as upholding the First Amendment \nand free speech, but in my view, when you are able to spread around \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to dozens and dozens of \ncandidates in a coordinated way, you are not speaking, you are coming \ndangerously close to buying.\n  For ultradonors, the reality is not just about making their voices \nheard. Under existing Supreme Court precedent under these recent \ndecisions, there is no limit on anybody's ability to spend whatever \namounts he or she wishes to conduct actual speech, to buy newspaper \nads, buy television spots, or even to make a politically motivated \nmovie.\n  The reality is it is about trying to control more and more of the \nlegislative agenda of this Congress and more and more of the direction \nof our government.\n  In McCutcheon, this recently decided case, the Supreme Court hasn't \njust enabled speech, it has made it dramatically easier for the \nwealthiest and the special interests they represent to hedge their bets \nby diversifying their political portfolio. It has more in common, \nsadly, with Wall Street investment strategies than with the free speech \nrights envisioned by our Founders at the Constitutional Convention.\n  Frankly, I think the Founders would not recognize our political \nsystem today and the increasingly harsh influence of big-money donors \nin our overall national political scene.\n  Together with the Citizens United decision of the Supreme Court of 5 \nyears ago, we see the truly dangerous implications of the decisions \nrendered. One of the boldest decisions I have ever seen--Citizens \nUnited, with another 5-4 decision--killed off nearly half of that \nbipartisan compromise bill of 2002 of McCain-Feingold by allowing \ncorporations and other special interests to anonymously fund campaign \nads in the months before an election.\n  In doing so, as Justice Stevens wrote in a dissent, the Supreme Court \n``relied largely on individual dissenting opinions. . . . blaz[ing] \nthrough our precedents [and] overruling or disavowing a body of case \nlaw.''\n  Justice Stevens noted that to do so the Court decided a question the \nparties did not present directly to it, saying:\n\n       Essentially, five justices were unhappy with the limited \n     nature of the case brought\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\n     before us, so they changed the case to give themselves an \n     opportunity to change the law.\n\n  I understand this is a dissent, but a dissent that I think should \ndraw our attention to the direction these two vital, difficult Court \ndecisions are taking this Nation.\n  Soon after the Supreme Court extended these rules to State campaign \nfinance laws as well. In combination these two decisions, McCutcheon \nand Citizens United, have brushed aside important bipartisan \nlegislation that was designed to prevent corruption of the political \nbranches and to provide Americans some level of confidence that their \nvoices, not just those of the ultrawealthy and powerful, mattered to \ntheir elected representatives. We have all seen the impact of this \ndecision, of Citizens United in particular, as commercials by groups \nnobody has ever heard of, funded by donors who can remain in the dark, \nhave flooded the airwaves of our election years ever since.\n  Earlier I mentioned that these two decisions show a stunning naivete \nabout how politics in our modern world really works. Let me be clear I \ndon't say this because the Supreme Court overturned a law that Congress \npassed. It is the Court's job to be a check on Congress to defend our \nfundamental freedoms in the face of congressional overreach or \nimprovident action. But in the McCutcheon decision, the Court \noverturned a core holding of its own previous decision in Buckley v. \nValeo, the case it purports to apply. As Justice Breyer wrote in \ndissent in McCutcheon, the Court's holding:\n\n     understates the importance of protecting the political \n     integrity of our governmental institutions. It creates a \n     loophole that . . . taken together with Citizens United . . . \n     eviscerates our Nation's campaign finance laws, leaving a \n     remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of \n     democratic legitimacy that those very laws were intended to \n     resolve.\n\n  For instance, in the Court's decisions, it consistently refers to \ntraditional political corruption as quid pro quo corruption, corruption \nof the sort where a specific contribution is made for a specific vote \nor action in arguing that campaign donations and political spending or \nspeech have shown no signs of leading to corruption. The majority \nargues that campaign giving and the ``general gratitude'' that a \ncandidate or elected official may feel is not the same thing as quid \npro quo corruption in the sense of directly buying votes or action in \nthe Congress.\n  But as Justice Breyer notes in his opinion in McCutcheon in the \ndissent, the majority's:\n\n     narrow view of corruption . . . excludes efforts to obtain \n     ``influence over access to elected officials or political \n     parties.''\n\n  Every single Member of this body and every Member of the House of \nRepresentatives knows that to be true and knows this influence to be \npernicious. Let me give an example. As many of my colleagues would \nattest, hanging over everything we do is the shadow of anonymous big-\nmoney ads getting dropped into the airwaves out of nowhere in the last \nweeks before an election, and it influences, in pervasive and \ncorruptive ways, decisions made in this body week in and week out.\n  Of course, tough opposition ads are nothing new. Robust debates in \ncampaign season go back to the very first campaigns of this Republic. \nAs politicians, we all welcome the opportunity to those who engage to \ndisagree with them. That is an important and healthy part of our \ndemocracy, and every citizen should have the right to voice their \nopposition to me or to any Member.\n  But what is a huge problem is the fact that nobody knows who is \nbehind these ads, making it easier for any wealthy individual or \ncorporation to pour an unlimited amount of money into a race behind \ncompletely false attacks. Because the donor is often in the dark, there \nis no way for the public to know who the claims are coming from or \nwhether they are credible.\n\n  That is why in this Chamber folks in my caucus, Democrats, have \nrepeatedly argued for our taking up and passing the DISCLOSE Act, which \nwould require third-party ads to say who funded them so that citizens \ncan reach their own conclusions.\n  This is an increasingly difficult problem for our country. In the \n2010 election cycle, super PACs spent more than $62 million nationally. \nThrough the 2012 cycle, outside groups spent an incredible $457 million \non House and Senate races. So far in this cycle they have already \nraised and spent more than $200 million.\n  The result is that every campaign has to do more and more fundraising \nso they have the resources to rebut the claims made in these negative \nads with concealed donors. That means more time on the phone or at \nfundraisers, traveling around the country, organizing and carrying out \nfundraising activities rather than engaging with our constituents and \ndiving into details of policy. It is even worse in the House where the \ndaily demands in their 2-year cycle are even more difficult.\n  Let me offer one brief statistic. In the average winning Senate race \nin 2012, it cost $10 million, which means the winning Senator had to \nraise $4,600 every single day over a 6-year term.\n  That is time not spent on solving the real issues facing our country. \nThat is an unbelievable amount of time dedicated to fundraising, and it \njust doesn't end, whether the term is 2 or 6 years.\n  I know I have it relatively easy, little to complain about. Compared \nto my colleagues I come from a small State. The very modest amount we \nhave to raise in a competitive race in Delaware pales in comparison to \nmuch larger States with much more expensive media markets, but it is a \nproblem for this entire body and this entire country.\n  Let me offer one last example of concretely why this matters. As we \ndebate in the Senate, the other party complains about the absence of \nopportunities to offer amendments and the lack of a robust and open \namendment process. One of the reasons we often do not take to the floor \nand vote on competitive, compelling amendments is the concern that they \nwill then become the subject of last-minute, aggressive, targeted \ncampaign ads funded by undisclosed donors. Rather than being a Chamber \nof honest, open, and free debate, the shadow of secret money turns \npolicymaking into a beacon of risk aversion. Policymaking gets \nparalyzed and this serves no one.\n  Although it is not an example of corruption in the quid pro quo sense \nthat the Supreme Court so narrowly focuses on, money does corrode the \npublic trust and steadily corrupts this system in a thousand different \nways. The irony of this all is that we badly need an honest discussion \nabout the impact of big spending and fundraising on our political \nsystem. At this point I believe we badly need fundamental changes to \nredirect the decisions and the attention of the Supreme Court.\n  Buckley v. Valeo, the 1976 decision by the Court that equated \npolitical contributions and money with speech, in my view needs to be \nrevisited. Senator Udall of New Mexico has introduced a constitutional \namendment that, in my view, restores the balance of that original law \nand decision, and it is one that I strongly support. By bending \nbackward to declare anything that corporations or the ultrawealthy wish \nto do with their money the equivalent of speech, today's Court, in my \nview, rather than strengthening speech, has weakened it for the \nmillions of Americans who cannot afford to play in this new system.\n  At a time of growing economic inequality, that concerns me more and \nmore because this new political inequality threatens the very \nfoundations of our democracy.\n  Noting the presence of two other colleagues, I would ask if I might \nhave the forbearance of two brief speeches recognizing Delawareans.\n  I appreciate the forbearance of my colleagues and would like to take \na few minutes to recognize two great Delawareans.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Harry Gravell\n\n  I wish to recognize Harry Gravell.\n  Right now in Wilmington, DE, friends will be coming to celebrate \nHarry, who is retiring from his long leadership role of the Delaware \nBuilding Trades Council after a lifetime dedicated to workers and our \nNation.\n  I first got to know him in my service on the county council in New \nCastle County, where he gave me very helpful, very insightful advice, \nand was a constant source of encouragement and support.\n  Don't get me wrong. He didn't always agree with me. He didn't always \nsupport me. With Harry you got a straight shot. You got exactly what he \nthought and nothing less. You always knew\n\n[[Page S2584]]\n\nwhere he stood even if he disagreed with you. He is transparent, he is \nhonest, and you know why he believes what he believes.\n  He is not only a great friend but a great father. We were both \nhonored in 2012 by the Delaware chapter of the American Diabetes \nAssociation as fathers of the year. Harry is the proud father of two: \nJayme and Dee, and grandfather of three: Makayla, Avery, and Lily.\n  Harry's life story is one of determination and service. He never \ngives up, especially when he puts his mind to something. From an early \nage he knew the value of hard work. For high school he went to the \nSalesianum School, a great school in our community, and worked his way \nthrough school to make sure he could afford a great education.\n  A Vietnam veteran, he served our country in wartime. Since he came \nhome, he has never stopped fighting for working families and veterans, \nand I was particularly proud to work with him in his role in the \nSprinkler Fitters Union, then on the Building Trades Council on Helmets \nto Hardhats, on offering training and real job opportunities to \nreturning veterans.\n  If you know Harry, you have seen his drive up close. You have seen \nhim fight through thick and thin for his workers, his family, and our \ncommunity.\n  But perhaps the greatest example of his sheer will was his most \nrecent fight. He suffered a stroke a few months ago. Doctors read him a \nlong list of things he was never going to do. Harry scoffed. Digging \nin, as he has his entire life, he finished his physical and occupation \ntherapy faster than doctors thought he could. He has just finished \nbuilding a house in Lewes. Everyone who knows him I believe will agree \nwith me that he deserves the years he will now get to spend on the \nbeautiful beaches of Delaware.\n\n\n                     Remembering James Wilcox Brown\n\n  Let me last briefly offer a tribute to a lifelong friend and mentor, \nJames Wilcox Brown of Newark, DE. He set sail on April 24 at the age of \n65. The gentle determination and unconditional kindness with which he \nlived his life inspired all around him, including his family, his \nfriends, and this junior Senator from Delaware.\n  Jim graduated from Salesianum School, the University of Delaware, and \nthe Washington and Lee University School of Law. He worked as legal \ncounsel for W.L. Gore & Associates for 36 years. He served as a member \nof the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps for 26 years, retiring as \ncolonel.\n  His tireless community service was broad and deeply felt. I was proud \nto be able to appoint him to the Delaware Service Academy Selection \nBoard.\n  He is survived by his wife Peggy and their four wonderful children: \nGenevieve, Hilary, William, Mary Ellen, and six grandchildren. I simply \nwanted to add my voice to so many who will deeply miss this patriot, \nthis great lawyer, this centered, thoughtful, kind man, and this \npersonal friend who helped teach me the importance of humility and of a \ncommitment to excellence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                             Arkansas Storm\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I come to the floor with a psalm and a story. The psalm I \nwant to read is one of the most famous passages in all of Scripture. In \ntimes such as this that Arkansas has been through, a lot of people go \nto Ecclesiastes or one of the gospels, but I want to read Psalms 23--\nand I will tell you why in a moment.\n\n       The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\n       He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me \n     beside the still waters.\n       He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of \n     righteousness for his name's sake.\n       Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of \n     death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and \n     thy staff they comfort me.\n       Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine \n     enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth \n     over.\n       Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of \n     my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\n  Madam President, on Sunday, April 27, 2014, at about 7:06 p.m., a \ntornado touched down right on the Saline and Pulaski County lines, just \nwest of Little Rock. It stayed on the ground for about an hour, crossed \nthe Arkansas River, crossed right near a little town called Mayflower. \nThe weather service now tells us it was an EF-4. That means it had a \nwind speed of up to 190 miles per hour--190 miles per hour. We lost 15 \nArkansans, and we will never forget them. We love them and their \nfamilies, and we will miss them. It is a great loss to each and every \nArkansan and really each and every American: Paula Blakemore of El \nPaso; Mark Bradley of Mayflower; Jamye Collins of Vilonia; Helen Greer \nof Mayflower; Jeffrey Hunter of Vilonia; Dennis Lavergne of Vilonia; \nGlenna Lavergne of Vilonia; David Mallory of Vilonia; Robert Oliver of \nMayflower; Cameron Smith of Vilonia; Tyler Smith of Vilonia; Rob Tittle \nof Paron; Rebekah Tittle of Paron; Tori Tittle of Paron; and Daniel \nWassom of Vilonia. As you can see and hear from those names, a lot of \nthese were family members and obviously members of a few communities in \nmy State.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues first because many called and reached \nout in various ways. Some covered meetings for me. In fact, Senator \nJack Reed of Rhode Island actually covered a military promotion \nceremony, which was really special for me--and for him to do--and \nspecial for everyone involved. So I thank him for that. Many of my \ncolleagues have offered to help.\n  We also had people from outside Arkansas who reached out. I know our \nGovernor fielded calls from a number of other Governors from around the \ncountry. Our emergency management people have been contacted by other \nemergency management folks.\n  Another phenomenon that has happened in our State--we neighbor \nseveral States that have gone through this before. One of those is \nMissouri, and I see my colleague from Missouri here in the Chamber \ntoday. People from Missouri came down to help. People from Oklahoma \ncame down and helped. Of course, we helped those States in their time \nof need, so it was reassuring and so appreciated that those folks, \nthose previous storm victims came to Arkansas and helped us. We really \ndo mean that, and we appreciate it very much.\n  Federal officials reached out. I was in the car with our Governor \nMike Beebe when President Obama called him. That meant a lot. They were \nable to work through some of those Federal-State issues immediately, \nright there on the phone. That was great. Of course, Secretary Jay \nJohnson called the Governor, and I talked to him actually that same \nday. He is trying to come to Arkansas in the next few days, and I hope \nhe will be able to make it. Craig Fugate, Director of FEMA, came in the \nvery next day, and we appreciate Director Fugate and the resources FEMA \nbrings and the attention to our State.\n  One of the things we recognize is that the work is just beginning. I \nsee my colleague from Louisiana, and I don't know of anyone in this \nChamber who better understands about recovering from a widespread \ndisaster.\n  I thank and acknowledge the thousands of Arkansans who made a \ndifference.\n  One of the underappreciated groups I want to mention--they probably \ndon't get enough notoriety, even though this may sound kind of silly--\nis the TV weather people. As soon as the storms were in the area, they \nbroke from their normal broadcasting and they went with wall-to-wall \ncoverage. I talked to so many folks in Mayflower, Vilonia, and other \nareas who said: Hey, we watched on TV, and we could see exactly where \nthat storm was, and that is what saved us because we knew it was \ncoming.\n  The sirens were going. I was at a dinner with some friends of mine in \nLittle Rock, and we heard the sirens, we heard the weather radio go \noff, and sure enough we turned on the television and we watched it too, \njust like everyone else.\n  The Department of Emergency Management has been off-the-charts good. \nThere is a man there named David Maxwell who unfortunately has a lot of \nexperience with this, but ADEM has been phenomenal. We have a system in \nArkansas called Code Red, and that got activated and worked very well. \nThe various elected officials--the county judges, et cetera--all came \ntogether.\n  We also, obviously, had first responders who rolled in immediately, \nand that was great. General Wofford of the Arkansas National Guard \nactivated 54 guardsmen. They showed up and did their duty. And it is so \nreassuring to the communities when they see those\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\nmen and women in uniform. First, they know they have a lot of training \nand a lot of experience, and it stabilizes things.\n  The other thing I noticed when I pulled up was that there were police \ncars and firetrucks and everything from what seemed like every \njurisdiction in Arkansas. So it was really great to see that.\n  Some of the unsung heroes in this are just everyday, ordinary \nArkansans, just everyday citizens. They came and brought their \nchainsaws. They checked their kids out of school to go help, and they \nrolled out and really streamed in to help.\n  There are really too many other folks to mention from some of the \nState agencies that are really underappreciated--the Arkansas Game and \nFish Commission; the Forestry Commission, which had people there \nclearing the way and knocking down things; the highway department; the \nutilities. As always, the utilities sprung into action. Even though \npower was down for a pretty good while--I think we had about 35,000 \ncustomers or so without power for a little while, but the utilities \npeople got that taken care of. They got their folks from other States \nto come in, as we do. Entergy is our largest single electric utility in \nthe State, and they brought people in from other States and got their \ncontractors going.\n  I noticed also the churches. The churches really are prepared for \nthis. It is part of their mission. I did notice the State Baptist \nConvention has what they call a mobile mass feeding unit. In the first \n3 days they fed 4,300 hot meals in Vilonia alone. I don't know what \nelse they were doing in other places, but it was great for the \nvolunteers who were helping and also the families there to be able to \ngo and get a hot meal. Of course, the Salvation Army and Red Cross--all \nof them really rolled out and helped.\n  Again, these two Senators who are here in the Chamber with me today \nhave been through these tragedies before. They know the insurance \nindustry rolls out and sets up temporary units. I saw lots of insurance \nfolks with clipboards and cameras and all the things they needed.\n  The wireless companies came and put up temporary towers because a lot \nof those were knocked down. There were charging stations for folks.\n\n  Walmart is the largest company based in Arkansas, and they came with \ntruckloads of water, diapers, snacks, various kinds of donations, baby \nwipes, batteries, and flashlights. Whatever people needed, it seemed as \nthough Walmart was there with a truck to offload and really help people \ndo what they needed to do.\n  Tyson Foods is another of our great Arkansas companies. They have a \nprogram they call Meals that Matter, and they do three meals a day. I \nsaw their trucks at the Mayflower school where they were set up. I saw \nthis big Tyson truck just sitting there, and I knew everybody was \nscurrying around doing other things at other trucks, and I asked: What \nis that one for? And I heard that one was just full of ice. They have \nlearned through these tragedies and other places they go that ice is in \nvery short supply, and they know that keeping things cold and giving \npeople something cool to drink is very important.\n  I could talk about this for a long time, seeing those people and \nseeing what they have gone through. I was there the next morning with \nthe Governor and the attorney general and a number of others, and it \nwas very emotional. You talk to some folks, and they are grieving for \nthe loss of their loved one or their next-door neighbor in one case. I \ntalked to a man who had lost his mother. At the same time, others are \nrejoicing to be safe and to have their lives and the lives of their \nchildren.\n  One man I talked to--I never even got his name, but I think he was \nstationed at Little Rock Air Force Base--said he looked out his front \ndoor and saw the storm bearing down on the house and there wasn't any \nway to avoid it. He grabbed his kids, threw them in the bathtub, got \nsome blankets, covered them all up--including himself--in the bathtub. \nHe said that for about 45 seconds it sounded as if they had an F-16 in \ntheir house. When it finally stopped, he took the blankets off, and at \nthat point they weren't in the bathroom anymore, they were in the \ngarage. The roof had collapsed and they couldn't get out. Before long, \nthey heard some neighbors calling for them, and they were able to dig a \ntunnel and get those three girls out and then he got out. They came out \nof it with just scratches, but it is an amazing story of perseverance.\n  There is a little hardware store in Mayflower called H True Value \nHardware, and that building was really shaken to its foundation. It is \na total wreck, but the merchandise was good. This man's entire career, \nhis entire working life is right there in that building, that local \nhardware store he is going to turn over to his daughter one day. His \ndaughter was there with her children, and they were getting their \nmerchandise out and trying to get it into some sort of storage so it \ncould be safe while they rebuild. That is a real-life matter for them, \nso we tried to help there.\n  I remember standing out by the curb in front of what used to be a \nhome. It was just a pile of rubble. At first, when you look at that, \nall you see is debris. Your eyes can't even focus on it. You don't even \nknow what you are looking at. But when you sit and take a moment and \nlook--I looked down and saw a ceiling fan motor. The blades were all \ngone, but there was a ceiling fan motor. And, gosh, right there I saw \nLegos mixed in the yard. There was an upside-down sink right there on \nthe pavement. There was a family portrait--whether it was from this \nfamily, that family, or a family from a mile away, who knows, but \nnonetheless a family portrait, just a color photo lying there in the \nmiddle of the street.\n  Another of the things I saw as I stood there looking at what used to \nbe a house--there was the front door, the doorframe, the brick, and \nsort of a stoop with the steps going up to the house, but there was no \nhouse there. All that was left was that doorframe. You think about \nthat. Think about those people, and their house is completely gone. \nThey have to rebuild.\n  I did hear a story--I didn't talk to the people, but a story was \ngoing around among some of the volunteers who were working about a \nfamily who survived and their dog survived. The way the dog survived is \nthat as the tornado was hitting their home, they actually grabbed the \ndog by the collar. He was about to fly out the window or what was left \nof the house, and not only were they holding on for dear life, but they \nheld on to the dog, and they all made it.\n  A lot of times you would go up to where a house was and it would be \njust a concrete slab. That is all there was. You just look at that and \nthink, how did anybody survive that? But they did, in most cases.\n  I went to the farm of a friend of mine, a guy named Preston \nScroggins, whom I have known a long time. He is a pillar-of-the-\ncommunity kind of person there in Vilonia. I went to his home and saw \nthat he had lost everything. He lost his home, lost all of his \nvehicles. He had a big farm shop--what we call a shop--which is a metal \nbuilding with steel girders in it. And I have never seen this before \nwith a tornado. When they built that metal building, of course they \nbuild these girders to hold it up, and then there is the siding type of \nstuff on the sides, the roofing, which is all metal. Of course the \nsteel was twisted, and that is pretty bad, and it takes a lot of force \nto twist steel like that. But what I had never seen before is that the \nfootings of the building, which were these huge concrete balls--they \ndug a hole, filled it with concrete, and stuck the steel girders in \nthem to create the footings--these balls of concrete were actually \npicked up out of the Earth by that tornado. They were actually picked \nup and set down a few feet away from the big hole in the ground. That \nis an amazing amount of force, and that is what an EF-4 does. This \ntornado didn't just knock down buildings; it obliterated them.\n  The beautiful thing about our people is that it did not obliterate \ntheir dreams. We talked to one woman who said: This was my dream house. \nBut the amazing thing was--and a new phrase has been created out of \nthis--we heard people saying over and over that they were Ark strong \nbecause people in our State are resilient. They are strong people. They \nare scrappers. And part of being strong is to pull yourself up by your \nbootstraps and dust yourself off\n\n[[Page S2586]]\n\nand go out and do more that day to improve what you have and work for \nyour family.\n  But another element of being strong is neighbor helping neighbor, and \nwe saw that in abundance in Arkansas. To sit there in your front yard \nwith no worldly possessions left--your truck looks as though it has \nbeen beaten by 20 men coming at it with hammers and beating on it, your \nhouse is in ruins and there is nothing left--and then to look at me and \nsay, ``Well, it is just stuff,'' it takes a strong person to do that. \nThat is someone who has the right perspective.\n  I saw the bravery, the selflessness, and the generosity, and now you \nknow why I am so very proud to be the Senator for these amazing people.\n  I am also proud of the Senate because it wasn't too long ago we voted \nfor disaster relief in this body. We now have money sufficient to cover \nthis and other disasters. I wish I could say this is going to be the \nlast one for the year, but everyone knows it will not be.\n  I will close with a psalm.\n\n       The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\n       He makes me to lie down in green pastures.\n\n  There are green pastures as part of this, and our people have found \nthose and will continue to be finding those as we go through this.\n\n       He leads me beside the still waters.\n\n  It is a very comforting thing, and they need to be comforted right \nnow.\n\n       He restores my soul.\n\n  One thing I looked up is the definition of ``soul.'' According to \nWebster's, it is a nonphysical aspect of a person. It is a person's \nemotional and moral nature, where the most private thoughts and \nfeelings are hidden, the complex of human attributes that manifest as \nconsciousness, thought, feeling, and will.\n\n       He restores my soul; he leads me in the paths of \n     righteousness for his name's sake.\n       Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of \n     death--\n\n  I can guarantee those people in Arkansas know they have walked \nthrough the valley of the shadow of death--\n\n       I will fear no evil; for you are with me. Your rod and your \n     staff, they comfort me.\n       You prepare a table before me in the presence of my \n     enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.\n\n  The attitude of the people in my State is, even though it has been a \ndifficult week, their cup is overflowing and those blessings continue \nto come.\n\n       Surely, your goodness and mercy will follow me all the days \n     of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord \n     forever.\n\n  Having that eternal perspective is going to get people through.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and my colleagues for all the best \nwishes and the willingness to help and offers of assistance and all \nthat makes up the Senate family.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                             Current Events\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wish to respond to my good friend from \nArkansas. Where he lives and where I live we know way more about \ntornadoes than we would like to know. Our friend from Louisiana knows \nabout tornadoes and hurricanes both.\n  We had a massive tornado in Joplin, MO, not too far away from these \ntornadoes in the last week, in fact, in Baxter Springs and Quapaw, \nalong with tornados in Arkansas and Mississippi, but that tornado was 3 \nyears ago, I believe next week, and there was massive destruction. But \nthe first responders were your neighbors. Before anybody else can get \nthere, your neighbors are there, thinking of getting that man out of \nthe garage with his three little girls and your neighbors beginning to \nhelp you collect those few things that are left--that may just be \nstuff, but it is your stuff. It is pictures and things that can't be \nreplaced, but what can't be replaced are the lives which are saved, and \nwhat can't be replaced are the lives which are lost--and people will \nlive with that strategy. No matter how resilient, that is a tragedy \nthat lasts forever. For all those families affected this week, the ones \nMr. Pryor has talked to and others have talked to--in the hometown of \ntwo of our colleagues from Mississippi, Tupelo hit by a tornado--these \nare tragic moments when communities and families and neighbors come \ntogether. That and faith, as Senator Pryor said, are what help people \nget through this.\n\n\n                    Caring for America's Heroes Act\n\n  Madam President, this is National Mental Health Awareness Month. It \njust started today.\n  Senator Stabenow and I have introduced some legislation this week, \nCaring for America's Heroes Act, that would look at what we are doing \nin the military. We are looking carefully at the military as it relates \nto what we are doing to help our veterans and to help those who serve.\n  I was at Fort Leonard Wood, in Waynessville, MO, just a few days ago, \ntalking to the hospital personnel there about mental health issues as \nthey relate to the many new inductees who come there and as to the \nfull-time force and the retirees who come there.\n  The act Senator Stabenow and I are introducing this week would treat \nmental health conditions like other health conditions for spouses, \ndependents, and for retirees who now have a limit on what can be done \nand how many hospital days they can stay for mental health that is not \nthe same limit for anything else. There is no justifiable reason for it \nnot to be the same limit. I think we are going to have good support \nfrom the Defense Department as we work to try to get this done, to just \nsimply ensure that military dependents and retirees who were covered \nunder TRICARE, for instance, are treated in the same manner for \ninpatient mental health services as they would be for any other injury \nor any other kind of health issue. Bringing those to par with others is \nimportant.\n  The National Institutes of Health estimates that one out of four \nadults in American has a behavioral health problem and if diagnosed can \nalmost always be treated. I asked the Surgeon General of the Army at a \nhearing just a few days ago if that one out of four would relate to the \nmilitary as well. Her view was as follows: Yes, we recruit from the \ngeneral population. We don't have any reason to believe those numbers \naren't reflected in our population as well.\n  So as we move forward, we need to be sure, in Mental Health Awareness \nMonth--and in a month where, as in every month, we should be always \nmindful of our veterans and retirees--that we are pursuing those \nsolutions for them as we are for the country generally. Hopefully, we \nwill be able to work with the Defense Department and get this one gap \nclosed in the very near future.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  I wish to speak about where we are on health care. I know there was \nan attempt in recent days to take a victory lap, and maybe again today, \nover the number of people to sign up.\n  I will say one more time, I don't think that is the way you can \nmeasure this. I said when the Web site wouldn't work, we can't measure \nthis by whether the Web site works because surely the Web site will \neventually work. Frankly, we shouldn't measure this by how many people \nsign up because the people who sign up don't have any other option. \nTheir option is to not sign up at all or to sign up. That is not much \nof a choice for most people. I am going to talk in a minute about a \ncouple people who decided they don't have a reasonable choice, so they \nare not signing up for anything.\n  We need to be sure this government does what is necessary to create \naccess to what has been the best health care system in the world. We \nall want people to have access to that system. The question truly is, \nAre we doing that the right way?\n  Polling clearly shows that people don't think we are doing that the \nright way. The President's numbers reflect that. The Kaiser Family \nFoundation poll shows that just 38 percent of people think the law is \nworking as intended; 57 percent say it is not working the way the White \nHouse had hoped.\n  I would think 100 percent would think it is not working the way the \nWhite House had hoped. Surely, the rollout, the signup--we can talk all \nwe want about how many people sign up. There is a debate going on right \nnow over in the House of Representatives this week about they signed \nup, but did they pay.\n  According to the House Commerce Committee, insurers tell them that \nonly two-thirds of the people who have signed up have paid. If they \ndon't pay, they are not signed up and they don't have coverage. I don't \nthink any insurance works that way.\n  That same committee's report said only 25 percent of paid enrollees \nare within the crucial age range, which is 18 to 34.\n\n[[Page S2587]]\n\n  For this to work, we have to have people who are young and healthy \nsign up as well. Why isn't that happening? The original estimate was we \nneed 40 percent. We appear to have 25 percent. What do we need to do?\n  Why is it the fact that insurance costs more relative to everybody \nelse insured for young people than it ever has before by the law? That \nwould maybe explain why young people aren't signing up. Prior to \nJanuary 1 of this year, if someone were young and healthy, they might \npay 20 percent of what the person at the other end of the spectrum was \npaying. Now they have to pay at least 33 percent. Maybe that is why \nthose people aren't signing up.\n  Of course, the workforce impact of people who have part-time jobs \nbecause full-time jobs are covered, jobs of more than 30 hours--the \nHouse recently passed the Save America Workers Act to help increase \nthese wages by saying: No, it is not a 30-hour standard. It should be a \n40-hour standard. I am a cosponsor of the Senate bill that would do \nthat same thing Senator Collins has been advocating for months now.\n  The unintended consequences in the workplace are not fair to American \nfamilies. They are not fair to American workers. We could do something \nabout one of those unintended consequences by just saying: Wait a \nminute. The 40-hour workweek that we have always said was full-time \nwork should still be the 40-hour workweek, not the new 30-hour \nworkweek.\n  The emergency contractor hired to repair the Web site said it is \ngoing to cost $121 million to repair the Web site, which is a whole lot \nmore than the $94 million already spent to create the Web site. I \nwonder what would have happened if we had taken that many millions of \ndollars and bought insurance for the people we were trying to move from \nuninsured to insured.\n  I will give about three more examples. My time is limited on the \nfloor today, and I have this down to a handful of examples of people we \nhave heard from in the last few days about families who are \ndramatically impacted. Surely, there is a good story out there to tell, \nbut there are lots of stories, and no matter what anybody says, these \nstories over and over turn out to be tragedies for families.\n  Randy and his wife from Mexico, MO, had a plan they liked, but they \nreceived a cancellation notice in October of last year. He went on to \nthe exchange but found on the exchange he would have to pay over $600 a \nmonth more in premiums and face deductibles that were $3,500 higher \nthan they had been in the past--so a $600 increase in premiums and \n$3,500 higher deductibles.\n  The cheapest plan available to Randy and his wife would have them \npaying $14,000 in premiums a year and they would have an $11,000 \ndeductible before the insurance would pay anything--$25,000.\n  Randy and his wife decided: That is not insurance at all, so we are \nnot going to have insurance. They found the best thing he could find, \nfound what was available, and decided it clearly wouldn't work. And \nthat wouldn't work for any us either. If it was going to cost $25,000 \nannually before a single thing was covered, we wouldn't think that was \ninsurance, and that was the best thing Randy from Mexico, MO, could \nfind.\n  Neal lost his job 2 years ago and decided to go back--Neal is from \nRaymore, MO. He decided to go back to school full time. He has nerve \ndamage in his back and takes several medications. His doctor prescribed \n120 pills a month, but his insurance plan will only pay for 100 pills a \nmonth.\n  Neal said not only does he have pain he didn't have before, but he \nsays: There is nothing I can do about it. He says: Nobody wants to \nhelp. The doctor says I need 120 pills a month. The insurance says they \nare not going to let me have more than 100. I think he wishes this was \nbetween him and his doctor instead of between him and his insurance \ncompany.\n  Myron from Hannibal, MO, and his family have annual premiums that \nwent from $2,200 to $6,500--a $4,300 increase. He found his doctor is \nno longer in the network. He doesn't want to have a new doctor. He \nliked his old insurance, but it was canceled, and he can't get to the \ndoctors he used to use with his new insurance.\n  Campus problems: A young healthy son on campus. His insurance was \n$550 a semester last semester. This year it is $770 a semester so he \ncan have the same insurance that in all likelihood he will not use \nbecause he is, after all, young and healthy, but the 40-percent \nincrease is an increase the law almost requires. The law went from five \ndifferent categories of people to be insured to three, and the top one \ncan't pay more than three times what the bottom pays.\n  One final story. Dennis is from Dexter, MO, near Missouri's bootheel. \nHe is an insurance broker. He says he has lots of stories he could \ntell, but the one that came to mind that he told us about this week was \npeople who had a nationwide network of doctors in a plan he used to \nsell now are transitioned to a network that is much smaller and it only \nworks in the State you reside in.\n\n  Missouri has many States that touch it. As many as eight States touch \nour State, so almost everybody in our State lives on or near a border. \nIf you live on or near the border in the exchange, you cannot go to the \ndoctor or hospital, in all likelihood, that may be 10 miles from where \nyou are because it is not in your State. When I was first told that, I \nsimply didn't believe it, and the more we checked into it the more we \nfound out that is what people were finding over and over. The policies \nthey could get did not allow them to go a reasonable distance if they \nhad to cross a border.\n  So we have work to do. I hope we can do it. I think there are ways we \ncan work together, but the real thing we have to solve is better health \ncare for families and affordable health care and health insurance for \nfamilies. It is not happening right now. I hope we move to a better \nplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I come to the floor again to urge consideration and a vote, and a \npositive vote, on my no-Washington exemption from ObamaCare proposal.\n  I think the first rule of American democracy should be that whatever \nCongress chooses to impose on America it lives by itself; whatever laws \nWashington passes, it lives by itself. That should be the rule across \nthe board, and that should certainly include health care and ObamaCare. \nBut that is not the case.\n  That is not the case at all, because there is a Washington exemption \nfrom ObamaCare. There are special-interest Washington subsidies under \nObamaCare that the average American doesn't get in any way, shape, or \nform. As it relates to health care and ObamaCare, I think the rule \nshould be simple: The baseline plan, the fallback position for all \nAmericans is what we live by. Under ObamaCare that was first during the \ndebate called the public option, but then it came to be known as the \nexchanges. That should be the plan we all live by and our staff live by \nand the White House and top members of the administration live by--no \nspecial exemption, no special deal, no special subsidy, no special \ntreatment.\n  That was the intent of an amendment, and that is actually the clear \nlanguage of an amendment that actually passed this body and passed the \nprocess and became part of ObamaCare, thanks to the leadership of \nSenator Chuck Grassley and others, and I certainly strongly supported \nthe amendment. There was a clear amendment added to ObamaCare in the \nSenate that said every Member of Congress, all of our staff, have to go \nto the so-called exchanges for our health care. The problem is on the \nway to implementing that, after passage of the bill, folks around here \nunderstood what that meant and so they watered down and amended that \nlanguage through the back door by administrative fiat in an illegal \nway.\n  They got the President and his administration to issue a special rule \nthat took all of the sting out of that amendment. That rule did two \nthings: First of all, it came up with a mechanism whereby a lot of \ncongressional staff don't even have to go to the exchanges at all; and \nsecondly, this illegal rule gave Members of Congress a special subsidy \nto go to the exchanges that no other American gets at comparable income \nlevels, no one else gets, completely unique.\n\n[[Page S2588]]\n\n  In addition, the administration, top members of the administration, \nsuch as Cabinet officials and top White House aides, have never been \nsubjected to anything like the same rule.\n  Again, I think we should come back to what almost all Americans feel \nshould be the first rule of American democracy: What is good for \nAmerica has to be good for Washington. What is imposed on America needs \nto be imposed first and foremost on Washington, with no special \nexemptions, no special subsidies, no special carve-outs, no special \ndeals, and that is what my no-Washington exemption from ObamaCare \nproposal is about. Every Member of Congress, our staff, and the White \nHouse and top administration officials should go to the exchanges for \nour health care, with no special deal, no special exemption, no special \nsubsidies.\n  I have been fighting for simply a full debate and vote on this for 6 \nmonths now, and unfortunately have been completely shut out of any \nvote. This started as soon as the administration announced its special \nillegal rule to get around this provision of ObamaCare late last year, \nand as soon as that was announced, I said: This is wrong. We need to \naddress this. We need to stop this. I proposed my clarifying language, \nand I brought up that language as an amendment on the floor as soon as \nI could. It was in September of last year on the Portman-Shaheen bill \nwhich is back on the floor now, and after a lot of back and forth, the \nmajority leader finally agreed: Fine, we will have a vote on the Vitter \namendment on this subject. In fact, Senator Reid was quoted in The Hill \non September 17 of last year: ``What I said I will do is we'll vote on \nVitter,'' meaning my no-Washington-exemption language, `` . . . as \nsenseless as that is.''\n  I appreciate that endorsement of the proposal.\n  ``I mean, we'll go ahead and do that.''\n  So he agreed to that vote on Portman-Shaheen. That was reported the \nsame day by Bloomberg on September 17:\n\n       Reid said on the Senate floor that a vote would be allowed \n     on the Vitter proposal as long as Republicans agreed to \n     consider a yet-to-be unveiled Democratic counterproposal that \n     would be offered as a side-by-side or second-degree \n     amendment.\n\n  And also that same day in CQ:\n\n       Reid said Tuesday he was willing to give Senator David \n     Vitter, R-LA, a vote on his proposal to force more government \n     workers onto health care exchanges and to pay the premiums \n     themselves . . .\n\n  In addition, at the same time the next day, September 18, and the day \nfollowing, September 19, Senators Shaheen and Portman said the same \nthing. Senator Shaheen was on the Senate floor September 18 saying: \nGreat, we will give Senator Vitter his vote. I have no problem with \nthat. Senator Portman, September 19, the same thing.\n\n       My understanding is that there has been a general agreement \n     to have a vote on the Vitter amendment. That is something I \n     have heard on the floor from leadership.\n\n  Well, as we all know, that agreement never materialized, was never \nhonored. I have never gotten that vote. It is now 6 months later, and I \nam simply asking for a full debate and a fair up-or-down vote on this \nimportant issue.\n  Look, it is a free country. People don't have to agree with me, but \nlet's have a vote. We voted yesterday on something that we have voted \nand revoted multiple times at the majority leader's insistence.\n  I am asking for one vote on this important issue that the American \npeople care about. We voted and revoted on things multiple times. I am \nasking for one clear vote on this issue. After the majority leader \nagreed to a vote on this amendment that I never got in September, a \ncouple months later when I was revisiting the issue, he said: Okay. \nWell, you can have a vote, but it has to be the only vote in this \nCongress.\n  Well, I resisted that at the time, but I will take that one vote. Can \nwe have one vote on this important issue this Congress? Can we have a \nmodicum of free expression and open debate and an open amendment \nprocess on the Senate floor? Can we have one vote on this issue that \nthe American people certainly care about? That is what I am asking. I \nam asking for the majority leader to honor his commitment. That is what \nI am pushing for. That is what I will continue to push for, which is \nwhy I am filing the amendment to the Portman-Shaheen bill. And again, I \nam filing it to this bill for one clear reason: That is the context in \nour previous consideration of Portman-Shaheen where I was told we \nagreed to having a vote on this issue. We will have the vote. I am \nsimply asking for that commitment to be honored.\n  I also care deeply about other important issues, including energy \nissues, moving forward with a very important jobs project for America, \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline; and because of that, when I saw the majority \nleader's recent proposal that we move ahead on Portman-Shaheen with \nfive energy-related votes, one of which would clearly be the Keystone \nXL Pipeline, I certainly took that very seriously. That is also an \nimportant issue and it deserves a vote. It has had votes in the past, \nbut that needs to be addressed. So as soon as I saw that--and again, \nthis is an offer by the majority leader--a hotline request that we now \nconsider the Portman-Shaheen bill and limit considerations to five \nenergy-related amendments, that would be chosen by the Republican \nleaders--as soon as I saw that hotline and that offer, I called the \nRepublican leader to make sure of two points--two points that I care \nabout quite a bit--No. 1, that one of those amendments would be a very \nsubstantive amendment on the Keystone Pipeline, not general, vague, \nsense-of-the-Senate language, but binding language that would approve, \nwithout the President's involvement, this very important jobs project; \nand No. 2, that at least one of the other amendments was an important \nmatter within the jurisdiction of the EPW Committee on which I serve as \nranking member.\n  The Republican leader absolutely agreed that was the case. Yes, \nabsolutely, once we lock in this unanimous consent request by Leader \nReid, one of those votes would absolutely be a binding proposal about \nthe Keystone Pipeline. Another would clearly be an important matter \nfrom the jurisdiction of the committee on which I serve as ranking \nmember on EPW. So those are important matters and those are significant \nvotes.\n  So I will set aside temporarily my pursuit of this no-Washington-\nexemption vote. I promise I will be back to it. I promise I will use \nevery reasonable opportunity to get that vote which was promised to me \nlast September, 6 months ago and counting; but I believe we should move \nforward with Majority Leader Reid's proposal that he made as a hotline \nrequest this morning.\n  I offer that as a unanimous consent agreement, so we can lock it down \nand move forward, and move forward with this Keystone vote, move \nforward with these other energy votes, and then move forward beyond \nthat, hopefully to a vote on the no-Washington-exemption language very \nsoon. So I make as a unanimous consent request Majority Leader Reid's \nown proposal, that there be a unanimous consent agreement on S. 2262, \nthe energy efficiency bill; that we move to its immediate \nconsideration; that the only amendments in order be five amendments to \nbe offered by the Republican leader or his designee related to energy \npolicy, with a 60-vote threshold on adoption of each amendment; and \nthat following the disposition of these amendments, the Senate will \nproceed to a vote on passage of the bill as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes in response to the Senator from Louisiana after I have \nresponded to his unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would \nonly ask for the opportunity to respond to the response to the \nunanimous consent request before the assistant majority leader \nproceeds, but I have no objection otherwise to his speaking after that \nfor 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, first, reserving the right to object, \nwhat the Senator from Louisiana has characterized as the majority \nleader's position on the pending legislation, S. 2262, has not been \nstated by the majority leader, and I suggest that the Senator from \nLouisiana speak to his leadership and work with the majority leader to \nresolve differences on amendments. I object.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reclaiming the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, let me read the exact text of the \nhotline. A hotline is a message that goes out to all Senators.\n\n       The Majority Leader in consultation with the Republican \n     Leader would like to enter into a unanimous consent agreement \n     on S. 2262, the Energy Efficiency bill. The only amendments \n     in order would be 5 amendments to be offered by the \n     Republican Leader or his designee, related to energy policy, \n     with a 60 vote threshold on adoption of each amendment. \n     Following the disposition of these amendments, the Senate \n     will proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if \n     amended.\n\n  That is clearly an expression of the majority leader's proposal in \nconsultation with the Republican leader. That is what was sent to all \nMembers of the Senate--at least on our side--after a personal \ndiscussion between the majority leader and the Republican leader.\n  Just to be crystal clear, my unanimous consent right now is that \nhotline request that has been clearly characterized as the request of \nthe majority leader in consultation with the Republican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I know the Senator from Arizona is \nwaiting to take the floor. I have waited for the Senator from Louisiana \nto finish his lengthy statement about several issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for only 5 minutes--and maybe less--\nand then I will leave and turn the floor over to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike 2 minutes to respond. I don't mean to delay the Senator from \nArizona, but I would like 2 minutes to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator from \nLouisiana's request?\n  Mr. VITTER. There is an objection, and I propose an alternative \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Illinois speak for up to 5 \nminutes followed by me for up to 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object--and I \nwill not object--but I ask unanimous consent that following the \ncompletion of what was just discussed that the Senator from South \nCarolina and I be allowed 20 minutes for time to speak.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I think there is a vote \nscheduled at 1:45 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is correct; there is \na vote scheduled at 1:45 p.m.\n  Is there objection to the request from the Senator from Louisiana?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, because my friend from Arizona has \nwaited patiently, I will turn the 5 minutes into 3 minutes.\n  The question is health insurance for Members of the Senate and their \nstaff. The Senator from Louisiana said that we should not be treated \nany differently than anyone else, and he is right. It turns out that \nMembers of the Senate and their staff go to get their health insurance \nthrough the insurance exchanges, just like 8 million other Americans, \nand we buy our health insurance not from a special little company but \nfrom the same list--in my case--of 100 different policies available to \nanyone working in the District of Columbia.\n  My wife and I chose Blue Cross Blue Shield; that was our choice. We \nare paying a monthly premium. Our employer, the Federal Government, is \ncontributing toward that premium like every other family in America \nwhere the employer makes a contribution, in this case the Federal \nGovernment, and the employee makes a contribution, in this case the \nSenator and his wife. We are being treated like everyone else.\n  Now he wants to take away the employer contribution not just for the \nMembers of the Senate but also for our staffers. All these poor hard-\nworking people want is health insurance like every other family. The \nSenator from Louisiana is going to make a statement of principle here: \nThey shouldn't get employer contribution for their health insurance. \nWhat a noble and courageous position.\n  The question is whether he is going to turn back any Federal subsidy \nfor his health insurance. I don't know if does or not. It would be a \nshow of good faith if he did.\n  I will stand here and fight for the right of Members of Congress to \nbe treated like everybody else--buying health insurance on the \nexchanges from private insurance companies from policies that are \navailable to everyone else with an employer contribution. I will fight \nfor staffers--Democrats and Republicans--to have that same right.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has held up a bill on the floor of the \nSenate all week because he wants to call that amendment. Isn't it about \ntime we get to the business of the Senate and do something? We will \nleave today and come back next week. I hope he will have some second \nthoughts about holding up the Senate for another week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I had the feeling I would need to \nrespond to whatever was said, and I was certainly right.\n  I have a couple of points to make in order to set the facts right. \nFirst of all, my proposal does mean Washington is treated like all \nother Americans with regard to ObamaCare. That is not going on now. \nMany members of our staff don't have to go to the exchange. All others \nand Members of Congress get a huge taxpayer-funded subsidy that no \nother American at the same income level gets--no other American. And \nthe Obama administration--White House officials--doesn't fall under \nthat requirement at all to go to the exchange. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, I don't take that subsidy. The assistant majority leader is a \nlittle late to the game. I made that decision months ago and announced \nit, so I do not take a subsidy.\n  No. 3, the assistant majority leader has just rejected a proposal of \nthe majority leader in consultation with the Republican leader. I don't \nknow why they can't take yes for an answer. They are complaining about \nmy holding up a bill that is not on the floor yet, and I am asking for \nunanimous consent, which they initiated, with regard to energy \namendments.\n  I will read the exact text of the hotline again.\n  The Majority Leader in consultation with the Republican Leader would \nlike to enter into a unanimous consent agreement on S. 2262, the Energy \nEfficiency bill. The only amendments in order would be 5 amendments to \nbe offered by the Republican Leader or his designee, related to energy \npolicy, with a 60 vote threshold on adoption of each amendment. \nFollowing the disposition of these amendments, the Senate will proceed \nto a vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended.\n  I don't know why we can't take yes for an answer here. I'm holding up \nthe bill? The bill is not on the Senate floor yet. I am asking for a \nunanimous consent that was a discussion and an idea of the majority \nleader in consultation with the Republican leader and now that is being \nobjected to by the same sources who proposed it. This is silly.\n  Let's get on with the important votes. Let's get on with this \nimportant Keystone vote--a binding Keystone vote--and then in the \nfuture let's get on with important ObamaCare votes, which certainly \nincludes my no-Washington-exemption proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining before the \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight and a half minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the votes Senator Graham and I be allowed 20 minutes to speak \nas if in morning business.\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/01/senate-section/article/S2590-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF THEODORE DAVID CHUANG TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND--Continued\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Benghazi\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, 19 months ago a terrible thing happened in \nBenghazi, Libya. Four brave Americans were murdered, and the issue has \nnot only not been resolved but as each of the last 19 months has \nensued, the issue of how and under what circumstances this heinous \ncrime was committed continues. The Senator from South Carolina and I, \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, and some others, have vowed we will \nnever give up on this issue until the truth is known and the people who \nperpetrated it are brought to justice.\n  We have seen another page turn in this chapter of coverup and \nobfuscation by this administration by the belated--19 months later--\nrelease of the following emails. The first one we will not pay much \nattention to. This is from Benjamin Rhodes, who is supposed to be the \npublic affairs officer for the National Security Council. In fact, he \nis obviously the propaganda organ. The goals, as he states them, are to \nunderscore these protests are rooted in an Internet video and not a \nbroader failure of policy.\n  I tell my colleagues that was not a fact. That was not a fact. There \nwas no evidence these protests were rooted in an Internet video. In \nfact, the station chief before these talking points were made up sent a \nmessage that this is not--not--a spontaneous demonstration.\n  To show that we will be resolute in bringing people who bring harm to \nAmericans to justice, and standing steadfast through these protests; to \nreinforce the President's strength and steadiness--that is all about \nthe Presidential campaign. It is not about trying to find out who \nperpetrated this heinous crime. It is not about trying to respond to \nthe people who committed these acts.\n  In fact, because of the coverup and the obfuscation and now 19-month \ndelay, not a single person who was responsible for the murder of these \nfour brave Americans has been brought to justice, as the President \npromised they would be.\n  Yesterday Mr. Carney said the release of this information had nothing \nto do with the attack on Benghazi. My friends, I have heard a lot of \nstrange things in my time, but that has to be the most bizarre \nstatement I have ever heard. This is all about a Presidential campaign. \nThis is all about an effort to convince the American people the \nPresident of the United States had everything under control.\n  The next day, on the Sunday talk shows, Susan Rice said Al Qaeda had \nbeen decimated. False; that the embassy was safe and stable and secure. \nFalse. And of course the whole issue of blaming an Internet video \nlasted on and on for a couple of weeks when it was clear the evidence \ndid not indicate that.\n  I yield to my friend from South Carolina on this issue, and then I \nwill return.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague.\n  To remind the body of what we are talking about, this email was \nreleased as a result of a lawsuit, and not voluntarily by the White \nHouse. In August of last year, the House of Representatives and the \ncommittees of jurisdiction subpoenaed all documents related to Benghazi \nand basically were stiff-armed.\n  Senators McCain, Ayotte, and I have written enough letters to destroy \na small forest to the White House with virtually nothing to show for \nit. A private organization called Judicial Watch sued under the Freedom \nof Information Act, and an independent judiciary--thank God for that--\nordered this White House to disclose this email just days ago. Knowing \nthe email was going to come out, the White House provided it to the \nCongress a few days ago.\n  What does that tell us? That tells us they did not want anyone to \nknow about this email. They talk about 25,000 documents they have \nprovided. It doesn't matter the number of documents they provided to \nthe Congress. They could have provided us with the Benghazi phone book. \nIt is the relevance of the documents and the significance of the \ndocuments. The reason they did not want anyone--me and anyone else--to \nknow about this email is because it is the smoking gun that shows that \npeople at the White House level--these are people who work at the White \nHouse for the administration--were very intent on shaping the story \nabout Benghazi away from what they knew to be the truth.\n  Here is the problem for the White House. This was 7 weeks before an \nelection. President Obama had said repeatedly: Bin Laden is dead, Al \nQaeda is on the run, the war is receding, my foreign policy is working. \nMany of us were critical of President Obama's foreign policy, \nparticularly in Libya, because after Qadhafi fell, we really did \nnothing to secure the country.\n  Senator McCain, myself, and a couple of other Senators--Rubio--went \nin 2011 to Libya. We said in an op-ed piece if we don't get rid of \nthese militias, Libya is going to become a safe haven for terrorists.\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\n  You have to understand this about the Benghazi consulate. It had been \npreviously attacked in April of 2012.\n  The British Ambassador had been attacked in June of 2012. The British \nclosed their consulate. The Red Cross closed their office because they \nhad been attacked. And we have email traffic coming from Libya to \nWashington at the State Department level saying on August 16: We cannot \nsecure the Benghazi consulate from a coordinated terrorist attack, and \nAl Qaeda flags are flying all over Benghazi.\n  What they did not want you to know is that the consulate in Benghazi \nwas very unsecure, that everyone else had left the town, and that the \nnumerous requests for security enhancements going back for months had \nbeen denied. They didn't want you to know because it would make the \nAmerican people mad that the facility was so unsecure in such a \ndangerous area and people in Washington constantly ignored requests for \nadditional security.\n  Here is what they wanted you to know:\n\n       . . . to convey that the United States is doing everything \n     we can to protect our people and facilities abroad . . .\n\n  That, to me, is the worst of the whole email because they are trying \nto convey to the American people and the families of the fallen that: \nThese things happened, but we did all we could to protect your family \nand those who served this Nation.\n  Nothing could be more untruthful about Benghazi than this statement \nthat they did everything they could to secure the facility.\n  The question as to whether this email relates to Benghazi was the \nmost offensive thing coming out of the White House in quite a while. No \none else died. There was an attack on our Embassy in Cairo with \nproperty damage.\n  What did we think Susan Rice was going to be asked about on Sunday, \n16 September? Everybody in the Nation wanted to know how our Ambassador \nand three other brave Americans died. To suggest they weren't trying to \nprepare her to talk about the deaths of 4 Americans is insulting to our \nintelligence, but the document itself tells us it was directed toward \nexplaining Benghazi.\n\n       To show that we will be resolute in bringing people who \n     harm Americans to justice . . .\n\n  That was part of what they wanted her to convey. No one else was hurt \nother than in Benghazi. So within the document itself, they are talking \nabout reinforcing the view that we will go after those who harmed \nAmericans. The only people who were harmed--the four people killed--\nwere in Benghazi. So that is just a bald-faced lie. That is insulting \nour intelligence, and it really is disrespectful to those who died in \nthe line of duty to suggest this email--which they would not give us \nwithout a court order--had nothing to do with the death of four \nAmericans.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I might add that all of the emails were supposed to be \ngiven to the Congress in return for the confirmation of Mr. Brennan as \nhead of the CIA. They didn't do that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The bottom line is the goals set out in this email are to \ntry to convince the American people 7 weeks before an election: We had \ndone everything possible to protect our people and facilities; ``to \nunderscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not \na broader failure of policy.''\n  I am here to tell you--and I dare anybody to show where I am wrong--\nthere is no evidence of a protest outside the compound that led to an \neventual attack.\n  I have talked to the man in charge of security at Benghazi--the only \nsurvivor I have been able to talk to. He told me that when the \nAmbassador went to bed shortly after 9, there was nobody outside the \ncompound. They would not have let him go to bed if there had been \nprotesters, and they would have reported a protest up the chain of \ncommand.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the next day the station chief sent a message that \nthere was ``not-slash-not spontaneous demonstration.''\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That was the 15th. So this is in real-time that people \nare reporting a coordinated terrorist attack. There was no protest. The \nvideo had nothing to do with this because there was no protest. And why \nwould they suggest that? They would be far less culpable in the eyes of \nthe American people and myself if, in fact, this was caused by a video \nwe had nothing to do with, a protest we could not see coming. The truth \nis that this was a coordinated terrorist attack that you could see \ncoming for months, and it was the result of a broader failure of \npolicy. Why didn't they want to admit that? They were 7 weeks out. It \nundercuts everything they were trying to tell the American people about \ntheir foreign policy.\n  This is the smoking gun that shows they were consciously trying to \nmanipulate the evidence to steer the story away from a coordinated \nterrorist attack of an unsecured facility and toward the land of an \nInternet video causing a protest. That, to me, is unacceptable and is \nclear as the Sun rises in the east, for those who care.\n  I will end with this and turn it back over to Senator McCain.\n  After this attack, President Obama said the following:\n\n       But everything that--every piece of information we get, as \n     we got it, we laid it out for the American people.\n\n  I am here to tell you that statement has not borne scrutiny. The \nadministration did not live up to this statement.\n  Here is another statement from Jay Carney:\n\n       I can tell you that the President believes that Ambassador \n     Rice has done an excellent job as the United States \n     Ambassador to the United Nations, and I believe that--and I \n     know that he believes that everyone here working for him has \n     been transparent in the way that we've tried to answer \n     questions about what happened in Benghazi . . .\n\n  If they were trying to be transparent about what was happening in \nBenghazi, why would they fail to provide the relevant information?\n\n       The information that we provided was based on the available \n     assessment at the time.\n\n  I am here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, they have not provided \nthe relevant information. Why? Because the relevant information \ncrumbles the story Susan Rice told on 16 September, crumbles the story \nof the President himself when weeks later he talked about a protest \ncaused by a video that never happened. The reason they haven't shared \nthis with us is because it exposes the lie of Benghazi.\n  I will end with this thought. We would not know today about an email \non 14 September setting goals for Susan Rice to meet on 16 September to \nchange the whole narrative if it were not for an independent judiciary \nand a private organization.\n\n  This White House has stiffed the Congress. Mostly, the media has been \nAWOL. But the reason we haven't stopped is because we met the families.\n  To any Member of the Congress who thinks Benghazi is a Republican \nconspiracy designed to help Lindsey Graham or anyone else get elected, \nwhy don't you go to the family members and explain to them what \nhappened. Why don't you tell the family members that the government was \nup front and honest and see if they believe you.\n  This email that came from a court requiring the White House to \ndisclose is devastating. It is devastating because it shows that 3 days \nafter the attack, their goal was not to inform the American people of \nwhat happened but to shape the story to help the President get \nreelected. I hope and pray that matters to the American people, and I \nbelieve it does. And I hope and pray our friends on the Democratic side \nwill start taking a little bit of interest.\n  I can tell you this about Senator McCain and myself: When President \nBush's policies in Iraq were crumbling, we did not have enough troops, \nand John McCain, to his credit, said that publicly and asked for the \nresignation of President Bush's Secretary of Defense because of failed \npolicy.\n  When we discovered the abuses at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib when \nit came to detainee policies, both of us said: The system failed. Don't \nbelieve it when they tell you this was a few bad apples.\n  Why did we do that? I have been a military lawyer for 31 years. It \nmeans a lot to me to adhere to the conventions we have signed up to.\n  Senator McCain--if there were ever an American hero in the Senate, it \nis he. He has lived through a country that practices torture, and he \ndid not want us to go down that road.\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\n  When we did those things, we were ``great Americans holding the \nsystem accountable and doing the country a service.'' Now, all of a \nsudden, we are ``just party hacks.''\n  I am here to say that what drove us then drives us now. When we ask \npeople to serve in faraway places with strange-sounding names and to go \nout on the tip of the spear, we owe it to them to help them, to give \nthem the best ability to survive. And if something bad happens, we owe \ntheir families the truth.\n  Just as in Iraq, they tried to shape the story in a fashion that did \nnot bear scrutiny. It wasn't a few dead-enders; it was system failure \nthat led to the collapse of Iraq. And thank God we changed tactics and \nwe overcame our problems.\n  This Benghazi story is about a foreign policy choice called the light \nfootprint that caught up with this administration. It is about an \nadministration that said no to additional security requests because \nthey didn't want to be like Bush. It is a story about an administration \nthat is too stubborn to react to facts on the ground, that kept a \nconsulate open when everybody else closed theirs, unsecured, believing \nthat ignoring the problem would solve the problem.\n  We have now found evidence of their willingness and desire to change \nthe narrative from a coordinated terrorist attack of an unsecured \nfacility--something they really couldn't control, and they did the best \nthey could 7 weeks before an election.\n  All I can say is if the shoe were on the other foot and this had been \nthe Bush administration, it would be front-page news everywhere and our \ncolleagues on the other side would be screaming. It is sad that it \nhasn't been news everywhere. It is sad that my Democratic colleagues in \nthe House in particular have disdain for trying to find out what \nhappened in Benghazi.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the fact is, I would say to my friend, the time has \nnow come for a select committee. The time has now come because these \ntalking points raise more questions than answers. It is time for a \nbipartisan, bicameral select committee to investigate the entire \nBenghazi fiasco and tragedy, and it needs to be done soon. The American \npeople and the families of those brave ones who sacrificed their lives \ndeserve nothing less.\n  My friend Senator Graham mentioned the media. I would like to say \nthanks.\n  I would like to say thanks to FOX News. I would like to say thanks to \nsome at CBS. I would like to say thanks to Charles Krauthammer and the \nhandful of people who kept this alive when the ``mainstream media'' not \nonly wanted to bury it but subjected, of course, as Senator Graham just \nmentioned, him and me to ridicule.\n  I wish to go back for a second to this email. In response to \nquestions yesterday by Mr. Carney, the White House Press spokesperson, \nif we look at this email and then look at what Mr. Carney said, it is \nan absolute falsehood. It is a total departure from reality. How does \nthe President's spokesperson tell the American people something that is \npatently false?\n  The President's spokesperson, in regard to this email that says to \nshow ``these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a \nbroader failure of policy''--what was he talking about? He says Rhodes' \nemail ``was explicitly not about Benghazi.'' Well, then what was it \nabout?\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       The fact of the matter is, there were protests in the \n     region.\n       The talking points cited protests at that facility.\n\n  They didn't. The talking points did not cite protests at that \nfacility--i.e, Benghazi.\n\n       The connection between protests and video--and the video \n     turned out not to be the case--\n\n  It turned out not to be the case because it was never the case and no \none ever believed it--\n\n     but it was based on the best information that we had.\n\n  He had no information that there was a spontaneous demonstration \nsparked by a video. That was manufactured somewhere. The American \npeople and we need to know where those talking points came from that \nSusan Rice gave.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       If you look at that document, that document that we're \n     talking about today was about the overall environment in the \n     Muslim world.\n\n  How could he say that and look at this email here? Talking about \nevents in the Muslim world?\n  And of course he goes on to say, talking about Susan Rice:\n\n       She relied on her--for her answers on Benghazi, on the \n     document prepared by the CIA, as did members of Congress.\n\n  Mr. Morell, the deputy head of the CIA at that time, said he was \nastonished to hear that there was reference made on all five Sunday \nmorning shows that there was a hateful video involved.\n  So Mr. Carney is saying things that are absolutely false. The \nAmerican people deserve better than that from the President's \nspokesperson whom they rely on for accurate information. When the \nbodies came home, and it was a moving event--I was there--the then-\nSecretary of State told members of the family and told me: We will get \nthese people who were responsible for the hateful video.\n\n  That was a number of days later when it was absolutely proven to \nanyone's satisfaction there was no hateful video, and of course we \nstill don't know what the final version of the talking points was that \nSusan Rice used on all the morning talk shows, who was the final \narbiter of it. We know now that Mr. Rhodes played a very key role in \nthat, and we need to know who gave her those talking points because \nthey are patently false. If someone gave her those talking points, then \nwhy in the world did that person manufacture out of whole cloth \ninformation that was told to the American people?\n  There are a lot of points here, and we can get into some of the \ndetails, but the fact is that this is a coverup of a situation which \nwas politically motivated in order to further the Presidential \nambitions of the President of the United States. That is what this is \nall about. That is why comments and instructions were given in this \nemail, because the narrative was: The tide of war is receding, Osama \nbin Laden is dead.\n  Secretary Susan Rice said at the time: Al Qaeda is decimated and the \nEmbassy is safe and secure. None of those facts were true. Most \nimportantly, we have five Americans who were killed. It is very clear \nthat should not have happened, would not have happened if proper \nactions had been taken.\n  Most important now or just as important now is the fact that for the \nlast 19 months this White House has been engaged in a coverup. It calls \nfor a select committee to examine all of the facts, and as always \nhappens in these kinds of scandals, the coverup is equally or sometimes \nworse than the actual action itself. The American people deserve to \nknow the truth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning business for up to \n20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here, as regular viewers of the \nC-SPAN network know, for the 65th time, every week that the Senate is \nin session, to ask my colleagues in the Senate to wake up to the \nrealities of climate change that surround us.\n  Here is what we know: We know the oceans and atmosphere are warming. \nBy the way, that is measurement, not theory. We know sea level is \nrising. Again, that is measurement, not theory. We know oceans are \nbecoming more acidic--again, a simple measurement. The potential that \nthese changes have to disrupt economic growth and to disrupt global \ncommerce is the subject of my remarks today, and it is those changes \nthat make investors and corporate executives take climate change \nseriously.\n  We may not take climate change seriously, but corporate executives \ndo. A world of shifting seasons and extreme heat hurts their bottom \nline. The world of drought-stricken farms and flooded cities, of raging \nwildfires and migrating diseases is not good for business. A\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\nrecent article from the World Bank conveys the corporate outlook this \nway:\n\n       In corporate boardrooms and the offices of CEOs, climate \n     change is a real and present danger. It threatens to disrupt \n     the water supplies and supply chains of companies as diverse \n     as Coca-Cola and ExxonMobil. Rising sea levels and more \n     intense storms put their infrastructure at risk and the costs \n     will only get worse.\n\n  Earlier this month executives from major American companies came to \nWashington for a roundtable discussion at the Bicameral Task Force on \nClimate Change, which I lead with Congressman Waxman. Each of the \ncompanies present had signed the climate declaration of the Business \nfor Innovative Climate and Energy Policy or BICEP. They see a low-\ncarbon economy as a smart way to create new jobs and stimulate economic \ngrowth. More than 750 companies, nameplate American corporations such \nas eBay, Gap, Levi's, Nike, Starbucks, and many others have signed \nBICEP's climate declaration.\n  Kevin Rabinovitch is global sustainability director at Virginia-based \ncandy company Mars, Incorporated, makers of the famous M, among \nother things. At the roundtable he told us Mars has a goal of \neliminating fossil fuel energy use and greenhouse gas emissions \ncompanywide by 2040. In fact, just yesterday Mars announced it will \nbuild a 200-megawatt wind farm in Texas that will generate enough \nenergy to power all Mars operations in the United States. I applaud \nthis exciting step for Mars and the bold vision it represents.\n  But Mr. Rabinovitch told the Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change:\n\n       . . . if other companies and governments don't adopt \n     similar science based targets, our efforts will have limited \n     effect on climate change. We cannot do it alone. This is why \n     the business community needs Congress to get off the \n     sidelines, to quit denying rudimentary science and abundant \n     evidence. Improving energy efficiency reduces climate-\n     altering carbon emissions, but it also--these businesses \n     find--reduces operating costs.\n\n  Colin Dyer, the president and CEO of Jones Lang LaSalle, \nIncorporated, the second largest publicly traded commercial real estate \nbrokerage firm in the world said:\n\n       Cost savings alone represent a compelling benefit of \n     sustainable design, construction, and management. Jones Lang \n     LaSalle put smart building management technology to work for \n     the consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble.\n\n  According to Dyer:\n\n       P earned back its initial investment in the technology in \n     three months and saw average energy cost savings of 10 \n     percent annually. The program, which is being expanded, also \n     improved building systems reliability, supported the \n     company's broader sustainability programs, and actually \n     increased employee productivity.\n\n  Smart executives also understand how much their customers care about \nthis. Rob Olson, vice president and chief financial officer of IKEA, \nsaid this:\n\n       From talking to our customers, we know that Americans are \n     increasingly concerned about climate change as they \n     experience events like Hurricane Sandy and the drought in \n     California. They want to reduce the amount of energy they use \n     in their home and they care about reducing waste and using \n     less water.\n\n  This is not a new message from America's corporate sector. Last year \nthe Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change wrote to over 300 businesses \nand organizations about carbon pollution and climate change. The \nresponse was encouraging. Coca-Cola, headquartered in Georgia, wrote:\n\n       We recognize climate change is a critical challenge facing \n     our planet, with potential impacts on biodiversity, water \n     resources, public health and agriculture. Beyond the effects \n     on the communities we serve, we view climate change as a \n     potential business risk, understanding that it could likely \n     have direct and indirect effects on our business.\n\n  Walmart, founded and headquartered in Arkansas, wrote this: ``We're \ncommitted to reducing our carbon footprint and we're working with our \nsuppliers to do the same.''\n  Here is what Walmart said in its 2009 sustainability report:\n\n       Climate change may not cause hurricanes, but warmer ocean \n     water can make them more powerful. Climate change may not \n     cause rainfall, but it can increase the frequency and \n     severity of heavy flooding. Climate change may not cause \n     droughts, but it can make droughts longer. Every company has \n     a responsibility to reduce greenhouse gases as quickly as it \n     can. Currently, we are investing in renewable energy, \n     increasing efficiency in our buildings and trucks, working \n     with suppliers to take carbon out of products and supporting \n     legislation in the U.S. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  Serious business leaders are looking for serious answers to the \nlooming economic crisis of climate change. An article last month in the \nHarvard Business Review entitled ``How to Survive Climate Change and \nStill Run a Thriving Business'' outlines recommendations for companies \nlooking to strengthen their supply chains and better understand their \nconsumers.\n  Serious business leaders are also fed up with the denial apparatus \nthat is run by the big carbon polluters. Major utilities PG, the \nPublic Service Company of New Mexico, and Exelon all quit the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce after a chamber official called for putting climate \nscience on trial similar to the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925. Large tech \ncompanies such as Apple and Yahoo also left the chamber.\n  One of the companies that came in to the Bicameral Task Force was \nNorth Carolina-based VF Corporation. You may not have heard of VF \nCorporation, but you have sure heard of their major brands. They make \nLee, Wrangler, Nautica, North Face, and many other name brands. Letitia \nWebster is their director of global corporate sustainability, and they \nhave a global perspective on climate change. Their customers around the \nworld are concerned about climate change, particularly their younger \ncustomers, and VF wants to meet those customers' expectations for good \ncitizenship. VF also needs cotton for all their clothing and they are \nworried about climate disruption to the cotton supply chain. ``Research \ntells us that continued climate change will make it more and more \ndifficult for farmers to manage cotton crops and for companies to \nmanage their supply chains.''\n  VF also provides very high performance clothing and equipment to \nhigh-performance outdoor athletes who train and compete in places where \nclimate changes are already evident. Those athletes see the same \nchanges as the 100 winter Olympic competitors from 10 countries who \nsigned a letter of warning about climate change. Letitia Webster \nmentioned in particular the Khumbu Icefall which has closed Mount \nEverest to climbers for the first time. She is not the only one.\n  John All, a climber, scientist, and professor of geography at Western \nKentucky University told the Atlantic magazine:\n\n       I am at Everest Base Camp right now and things are dire \n     because of climate change. . . . The ice is melting at \n     unprecedented rates and [that] greatly increases the risk to \n     climbers. You could say [that] climate change closed Mt. \n     Everest this year.\n\n  Tim Rippel is a climbing guide, and he blogged from Everest's base \ncamp:\n\n       As a professional member of the Canadian Avalanche \n     Association, I have my educated concerns. The mountain has \n     been deteriorating rapidly the past three years due [to] \n     global warming and the breakdown in the Khumbu Icefall is \n     dramatic.\n\n  Ms. Webster warned of the costs of inaction, saying, ``It's too \nexpensive not to take action.'' This is a North Carolina company, and I \nhope its message gets through to elected officials who represent North \nCarolina.\n  Senator Hagan has already spoken passionately about the need to act \non climate change. She gets it, but her colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle remain silent.\n  I visited North Carolina over the recess as part of a tour of the \neffects of climate change along the southeast coast. I flew out to \nwhere sea level rise is gnawing away at North Carolina's Outer Banks.\n  I visited the marine science facility at Pivers Island, where \nscientists from Duke University, the University of North Carolina, \nNorth Carolina State, East Carolina University, and of course NOAA, are \nstudying aspects of sea level rise in North Carolina and the effects of \nocean acidification on microbes that form the basis of the food web.\n  These are some of the world's leading scientists. They all know that \nthese changes are driven by carbon pollution. There is no doubt. Unless \nNorth Carolina's elected officials think that their own universities \nare part of the big hoax some of our colleagues talk about, they had \nbetter pay attention to what is happening on the North Carolina coast.\n  I met with the North Carolina Coastal Federation at their coastal \neducation center in Wilmington, NC. It\n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\nwas a bipartisan group joined together in concern over the exposure of \ntheir coastal communities to the rising seas. The ``North Carolina Sea-\nLevel Rise Assessment Report'' prepared in 2010 by the North Carolina \nCoastal Resources Commission's Science Panel on Coastal Hazards says:\n\n       The most likely scenario for 2100 AD is a rise of 0.4 \n     meters to 1.4 meters (15 inches to 55 inches) above present.\n\n  By the way, that is what they call bathtub measures. That doesn't \ntake into account what 55 inches of extra sea will do when it is heaped \nagainst the shore by a storm surge from a big tropical storm or \nhurricane.\n  I hope their congressional delegation in Congress is listening.\n  The biggest power producer in North Carolina is Charlotte-based Duke \nEnergy. Duke worked through the U.S. Climate Action Partnership for \nclimate change legislation. Duke actually pulled out of the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers because of that organization's denial of \nclimate change. Duke's then-chief executive officer Jim Rogers said:\n\n       We are not renewing our membership in the NAM because in \n     tough times, we want to invest in associations that are \n     pulling in the same direction we are.\n\n  He said that NAM, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Republicans \n``ought to roll up their sleeves and get to work on a climate bill. . . \n. '' Duke Energy might want to also consider whether North Carolina \npoliticians are pulling in the same direction.\n  This is not complicated. Load up carbon dioxide concentrations in the \natmosphere and you load up heat in the atmosphere. We have known that \nsince Abraham Lincoln was President. This is not a new discovery. Load \nup the heat, and the oceans warm up. That is not some theory either. \nYou can measure it--with thermometers. When liquid warms, it expands, \nunless my colleagues want to repeal the law of thermal expansion. As \nthe ocean expands and ice melts, up goes the sea level. It is up 6 \ninches at the tide gauge in Wilmington, NC, since 1954.\n  If my colleagues want to deny the 6-inch increase in the tide gauge \nin Wilmington, NC, let me explain to them what the North Carolina \nassessment says about how you measure sea level rise:\n\n       [Sea-level rise] can be directly measured in a \n     straightforward way. The longest record of direct measurement \n     of sea level comes from tide gauges. A tide gauge is a device \n     built to measure water level variations due to tides and \n     weather, and to eliminate effects due to waves. A tide gauge \n     can be as simple as a long ruler nailed to a post on a dock. \n     More sophisticated instruments, like those used by NOAA, are \n     usually placed in a stilling well, or a pipe, that protects a \n     float connected to a recording device from waves. As tides \n     rise and fall, the float's motion is recorded.\n\n  It is not complicated. Good luck denying that. When you fly over the \nNorth Carolina coast, you see lots of investment along the seashore. \nThere are lots of houses, lots of hotels, condominiums, restaurants--an \nentire seafront economy that the larger North Carolina economy very \nmuch depends on.\n  What are my colleagues from North Carolina going to tell them about \nclimate change: Don't worry. It is not real? Good luck with that. They \nare already measuring the sea level rise.\n  Those small businesses in North Carolina want to protect their \nstorefronts from sea level rise just as VF Corporation wants to protect \nits cotton supply from drought. These North Carolina companies get the \neconomic threat that climate change presents.\n  The frustrating thing here is that we can strengthen our economies \nand businesses by tackling the problem of climate change and sea level \nrise head-on, and we can leave things better, not worse, for the \ngenerations that will follow us--perhaps the simplest obligation that \nwe hold, and one, by the way, at which we are presently failing. But if \nwe are going to stop failing at that obligation and tackle this problem \nhead-on, we have to wake up to reality. We have to put aside, once and \nfor all, the toxic polluter-paid politics that infect Washington.\n  The denial campaign that is run by these polluters is as poisonous to \nour democracy as carbon pollution is to our atmosphere and oceans. \nAmerica is suffering as a result of Congress being tangled in a web of \nlies and surrounded by a barricade of special interests. We have to \nbreak through that. It is a matter of truth, it is a matter of honor, \nand it is a matter of being effective at these real problems.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Presiding Officer, and I note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2265\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, it is often said that foreign aid from \nAmerica is to project American power and what America believes in. \nUnfortunately, over decades, the only thing consistent about foreign \naid is that the money continues to flow regardless of the behavior of \nthe recipients. This is extraordinary, and we have seen this decade \nafter decade.\n  Studies will often show that 75 percent of foreign aid throughout \nmany continents is simply stolen, taken in graft. The Mubarak family in \nEgypt is an example.\n  The point I would like to make today is if we are going to project \nwhat America stands for, if we want our money to go to people who are \nsupporting activities that America is for, we should write that into \nthe law. We have made attempts at this in the past.\n  Several years ago Senator Leahy attached an amendment to foreign aid \nthat says that countries need to be evolving towards democracy or \nshowing an ability to go forward towards democracy. The problem is that \nevery time we have restrictions on foreign aid, they are evaded. We \nalways give an out. The President always has an out.\n  This week in Egypt, 683 people were condemned to death in one trial. \nYet your money still flows to Egypt without interruption.\n  We have another contingency that says: If a country has a military \ntakeover--if you have an election and then you have a military junta or \na military takeover of the government--our aid should end. It didn't \nhappen in Egypt when there was a military takeover.\n  The only consistency about foreign aid is that it flows to all \ncountries regardless of behavior. It is the opposite of what many of \nthe proponents say. Many of the proponents say that we do this so we \ncan modulate behavior and try to improve and make things better around \nthe world. Yet they steadfastly oppose restrictions on foreign aid.\n  I have a bill that I am going to ask--in a few minutes--for the \nSenate to unanimously approve. This is a bill that should be an easy \nlift for most Senators. This is a bill to support our ally Israel and \nto say to the Palestinian Authority that if you wish to continue to \ntake American money--and many people don't realize this, but the \nAmerican taxpayer gives hundreds of millions of dollars every year to \nthe Palestinian Authority, and we supposedly have restrictions, but \nthere is always an out. Guess what. They always get their money \nregardless of behavior.\n  What have I have been saying is, let's have some restrictions. If we \nare going to give money to the Palestinian Authority, shouldn't they \nagree to recognize the State of Israel? Shouldn't that be part of what \ngoes on with this?\n  We now have a problem--and the reason this has become a more \npertinent issue and something that has come to the forefront--because \nHamas, a terrorist group in Gaza, is now aligning them with Fatah, the \npeople who run the Palestinian Authority.\n  My question is: Are we now going to send money to a unity government? \nPart of the charter of Hamas is not only not to recognize Israel, but \nthey are actually for the destruction of Israel.\n  This is what I would ask Americans and those who will object to the \nbill--because there will be an objection to my bill: How can you object \nto something that calls for the recognition of Israel as a state? How \ncan you object to this and how can you continue to allow the flow of \nmoney to a group that calls for the destruction of Israel? They will \nsay: Well, we have contingencies for that or we will stop it if they \nbecome part of or control the West Bank.\n  When I was in Israel a year ago, I asked everybody that question. I \nmet\n\n[[Page S2596]]\n\nwith the Prime Minister of Israel, the President of Israel, the King of \nJordan, and with the leader of the West Bank, Abbas. I met with all of \nthese people and asked them: Can there be a separate peace? Can there \nbe peace with the West Bank and peace with Gaza--a separate peace?\n  They all said: No, it has to be one peace.\n  I said to the Israeli side: If they are unified, will you negotiate \nwith Hamas?\n  They said: No. They lob missiles at us. They are at war with us. They \ndon't recognize our right to exist as a state. Not only that, they \nopenly advocate for the destruction of Israel.\n  Realize that in the objection you will hear today, you will hear an \nobjection that despite arguments to the contrary we will allow money to \ngo to a unity government that will include Hamas.\n  I am simply asking that if we are going to send good money after \nbad--frankly, it is money we don't have. We have $1 trillion in debt. \nWe have bridges falling down in our own country, and your government is \nsending hundreds of millions of dollars to the Palestinian Authority--\nwhich is now going to be unified with Hamas, without restrictions or \nwith restrictions that have a hole so big you can drive a truck through \nthem. This always happens.\n  Every contingency and every limitation on foreign aid that you think \nwould be practical and reasonable always has an exception for the \nPresident to overcome. The President always does it so the only thing \nconsistent about foreign aid is that money continues to flow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we pass my bill, S. 2265, \nStand With Israel. I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on \nForeign Relations be discharged from further consideration of S. 2265 \nand the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I further ask \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object to Senator Paul's request \nto discharge S. 2265 in the committee, this legislation Senator Paul \nhas been referring to has not been considered by the committee. It was \njust introduced in the last day or so, I think.\n  As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and on behalf \nof the Republican ranking member, Senator Corker, who had to depart to \nreturn to Tennessee but otherwise would have joined me in making \nremarks, I come to the floor to express our opposition to an effort to \ncircumvent the normal legislative process and deprive the members of \nour committee of the opportunity to decide whether to take up this \nlegislation. The authorization to provide or cut U.S. assistance to the \nPalestinian Authority is clearly within the purview of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, and it should have its members decide if \nit is appropriate, and it should be fully and openly considered by the \ncommittee.\n  This bill is a blunt-force instrument that would risk the collapse of \nthe Palestinian economy in the West Bank. That is not in Israel's \ninterests and it is not in our interests either. The bill would shift \nthe burden of dealing with a failed state on its borders to Israel. \nThat is certainly not my goal, and I hope it is not the goal of Senator \nPaul either. Our goal should be to get back to a process and a \nnegotiation toward a two-state solution that will allow Israel to live \nin peace and security.\n  We need to allow the parties--and particularly Mr. Abbas--the time to \nsteer back toward a productive path to peace. To be clear, his time is \nlimited. I am in agreement with Senator Paul that President Abbas must \nultimately choose between a future that envisions two States living \nside by side in peace and security or a destructive unity pact with a \nterrorist organization whose stated objective is to make sure there is \nno two-State solution.\n  A unity government--not a unity announcement but a unity government--\nbetween Fatah and Hamas has consequences that are clear under existing \nU.S. law. If Mr. Abbas definitely opens the door to Hamas exercising \ninfluence in the Palestinian Authority, I will encourage my colleagues \nto stand with me in exercising the existing legal authority to halt \nassistance to a government that includes parties that reject Israel's \nright to exist as a Jewish state and continues to support terrorism.\n  For those reasons, I must object to the Senator's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                         Differences of Opinion\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, there has been a lot of criticism waged \nat the majority leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, for his discussion \nabout the Koch brothers. That criticism of Senator Reid is unfortunate. \nI think what Senator Reid is trying to do is educate the American \npeople about the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision and \nwhat it has done by allowing billionaire families, such as the Koch \nbrothers and Sheldon Adelson and others, to pump hundreds and hundreds \nof millions of dollars into the political process in order to elect \ncandidates in the House, in the Senate, and in the White House, who are \nworking overtime against the best interests of the middle class and \nworking families of this country and, at the same time, are working to \nprovide even more tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires and large \nprofitable corporations.\n  I think it is important, when we talk about the Koch brothers, not to \nmake this discussion personal. It is not a personal discussion. It is a \ndiscussion about what the most powerful political family in this \ncountry believes. If they are spending hundreds of millions of \ndollars--and this is a family worth $80 billion, and they may end up \nspending, in fact, billions of dollars on campaigns--what is it they \nwant? What do they believe? What do folks such as Sheldon Adelson \nbelieve, when they invite potential Republican candidates for President \nto come to Las Vegas for what has been called the Adelson primary, \nwhere he will listen to them and decide who he might support and spend \nhundreds of millions of dollars on in a Presidential campaign?\n  So I think it is important we know what the Koch brothers believe. \nHere is the best information I have. In 1980, as it turns out, David \nKoch, one of the two brothers, ran for Vice President of the United \nStates on the Libertarian Party platform. What is interesting to me is \nto what degree the platform he ran on--which in 1980 got him 1 percent \nof the vote on the Libertarian ticket--to what degree that extremist \nset of positions has now become mainstream Republican today.\n  I want to take a few minutes to quote exactly what was in that 1980 \nplatform so the American people can recognize to what degree ideas that \nat one point were considered extremist are now mainstream Republican. \nThis is what was in the 1980 Libertarian Party platform upon which \nDavid Koch ran for Vice President:\n\n       We urge the repeal of federal campaign finance laws, and \n     the immediate abolition of the despotic Federal Election \n     Commission.\n\n  What that means is the Koch brothers, and increasingly the Republican \nParty, now believe there should be no campaign finance laws, that \nCitizens United did not go far enough, and that the Koch brothers \nshould be able to spend millions of dollars by giving that money \ndirectly to individual candidates. That is what the Koch brothers said \nin 1980. That is what many Republicans believe today.\n  Let me state an exact quote from the platform:\n\n       We favor the repeal of the fraudulent, virtually bankrupt, \n     and increasingly oppressive Social Security system.\n\n  There are many Republicans today who not only want to see cuts in \nSocial Security but who ultimately want to privatize Social Security \nwho believe it is unconstitutional for the U.S. Government to be \ninvolved in retirement benefits for seniors.\n  Libertarian Party platform, 1980:\n\n       We oppose--\n\n  Listen to this one. This is really quite incredible:\n\n       We oppose all personal and corporate income taxation, \n     including capital gains taxes. We support the eventual repeal \n     of all taxation.\n\n  Repeal of all taxation? That is the government. Basically, what they \nare saying, very boldly, straightforwardly--we have to respect their \nhonesty--is they don't believe in government.\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\n  I have not heard any of my Republican colleagues say they want to \nabolish all taxation. That is not what they say and that is not what \nthey believe. But on the other hand, it is important to note that the \nRyan budget, just passed in mid-April in the House, provides a $5 \ntrillion tax break over a 10-year period, mainly by cutting the top \nindividual and corporate income tax rates significantly. In other \nwords, at a time when the wealthiest people are doing phenomenally well \nat the same time as the middle class disappears and more and more \npeople live in poverty, what my Republican colleagues believe is we \nshould give more tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\n  The Koch brothers' position in 1980 was that they support--\nLibertarian Party platform:\n\n       We support repeal of all laws which impede the ability of \n     any person to find employment, such as minimum wage laws.\n\n  What does that mean?\n  Yesterday, we had a vote on the floor of the Senate which said that a \n$7.25 an hour minimum wage is a poverty wage; that people who are \nworking 40 hours a week and are making $7.25 an hour are living in \npoverty; that they cannot bring up and raise families on those wages; \nand that if we raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, we could \nincrease the salaries of approximately 28 million Americans. On that \nvote to overcome a Republican filibuster, one Republican voted with \nmembers of the Democratic caucus, and we lost that vote.\n  What is interesting, it is not simply that almost every Republican \nvoted against raising the minimum wage; what is more significant is \nthat many Republicans believe we should abolish the concept of the \nminimum wage.\n  Many of us know Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma to be an honest and \nstraightforward guy. He tells it the way he sees it. This morning on \nthe ``Morning Joe'' television show, this is what Senator Coburn said, \nand I quote from the transcript:\n\n       I don't believe you ought to interfere in the market. If \n     there's to be a minimum wage--my theory is I don't believe \n     there ought to be a national minimum wage. That's my \n     position.\n\n  In other words, what Senator Coburn is saying today and, in fact, \nwhat many Republicans agree with him about, is we should abolish the \nconcept of the minimum wage--something the Koch brothers were talking \nabout 34 years ago.\n  What are the implications of that if we do as Senator Coburn \nsuggested and just let the market work and don't have government \ninterfere by establishing a minimum wage American workers should \nreceive? What it means, quite simply, when we let the free market work, \nis that if people are in a high unemployment area and there are many \nworkers competing for few jobs, an employer will say to a potential \nemployee: I am prepared to hire you, good news, and I am going to pay \n$4.\n  The worker says: I can't live on $4 an hour. That is a starvation \nwage.\n  The employer says: That is OK, because I have 20 other workers who \nare prepared to accept that wage.\n  That is what happens when we abolish the concept of the minimum wage.\n  Many of us--and I think the vast majority of the American people--\nhave a very different vision of where our country should go. We don't \nbelieve we should be abolishing the minimum wage. We don't believe we \nshould be cutting or privatizing Social Security or transforming \nMedicare into a voucher program or making horrendous cuts to Medicaid.\n  What, in fact, the American people want is the Federal Government to \nstart standing up for working families rather than millionaires and \nbillionaires. In poll after poll, what the American people have said is \nthey want us to invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and \ncreate millions of decent-paying jobs. That is what the American people \nwant. They do not want tax breaks for billionaires but the creation of \nmillions of jobs for rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.\n  The American people, despite what Senator Coburn and others may \nbelieve, want us to raise the minimum wage. Poll after poll suggests \nthe American people want us to raise the minimum wage to at least \n$10.10 an hour.\n  The American people do not want us to cut Social Security. In fact, \nmore and more Americans want us to expand Social Security, to make sure \nwhen elderly people reach retirement age, they can live and retire with \ndignity.\n  I think there has perhaps never been a time in the modern history of \nthis country where the political lines have been drawn as clearly as \nthey are right now. If you listen to the Koch brothers, if you read the \nRepublican Ryan budget in the House, their positions are quite clear: \nTax breaks for millionaires and billionaires and significant cuts in \nthe programs that are life and death for the middle-class and working \nfamilies of this country.\n  That is not what the American people want, and it is time we began to \nlisten to the American people. It is time we took on those people, \nthose billionaires who are spending huge amounts of money electing \ncandidates who represent their interests. And it is time we listen to \nthe working families of this country, who are struggling to survive.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my friend from Vermont, \nwho I know is in a hurry to leave the premises, as most Senators have \nalready done. Perhaps he could relax and go out and have a Coke. Bad \npun.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Roberts pertaining to the introduction of S. 2282 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to point out to my \ncolleagues that more than 300 days have passed since we in the Senate \npassed bipartisan legislation that would secure our borders, hold \nemployers accountable for hiring illegal workers, grow our economy, and \nprovide a chance for people currently here illegally to get right with \nthe law and earn legal status. But the House has failed to do anything \nto fix our broken immigration system--more than 300 days after we in \nthe Senate passed bipartisan legislation.\n  To be clear, the problem is not that there is a difference of opinion \nbetween a House bill and a Senate bill on immigration that cannot be \nreconciled. The problem is that House Republicans have completely \nabdicated their responsibility to address important issues, such as \nfixing our broken immigration system.\n  Again, the problem is not that the House has passed laws that the \nSenate disagrees with. The problem is that the House will not put any \nimmigration bills up for a vote, no matter what is in those bills. Now, \nwhy is that?\n  It is not because our immigration system is not broken. There is no \nMember of Congress who will stand and say: Our immigration system is \ngreat. Leave it alone. What is all the fuss about?\n  No one is happy with the present system. Finding a Member of Congress \nanywhere who will say we do not need to reform our broken immigration \nsystem is impossible.\n  The reason the House has done nothing on immigration is because House \nRepublicans have handed the gavel of leadership on immigration to far-\nright extremists such as Congressman Steve King.\n  Congressman King is not a mainstream Republican on this issue. You \ncannot even call him a conservative on this issue. He is an extreme \noutlier on the issue of immigration reform.\n  Every time any Republican has raised the possibility of action on \nimmigration reform in the House, Steve King is there, in his own words, \n``manning the watchtowers 24/7'' to make sure nothing can be passed to \nfix our broken immigration system.\n  When Republicans such as Eric Cantor, hardly a flaming liberal, \ntalked early in 2013 about introducing a bill called the KIDS Act which \nwould allow minors brought here through no fault of their own to earn \nlegal status if they served in the military or obtained a college \ndegree, King said, ``For every child who's a valedictorian, there's \nanother 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they've got calves the \nsize of cantaloupes because they're hauling\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\n75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.''\n  The rhetoric of Steve King is beyond the pale. I am certain that the \nmajority of Republicans in the House have their stomachs churn when \nthey see Steven King spew that kind of rhetoric. But rather than stand \nup to him, they give him the keys to the kingdom of immigration reform. \nJust look at what happened after King protested. There was no KIDS Act \nintroduced. Go look for the text of the KIDS Act on line. It does not \nexist. There is no bill. Not only was the KIDS Act never introduced, \nbut House Republicans actually voted, nearly unanimously, to resume \ndeporting minor children who had committed no crimes.\n  Another Republican, Jeff Denham, a Republican from California, who is \nalso an Air Force reservist, recently proposed to let young people who \ncame here illegally earn status by enlisting in the military. They love \nAmerica so they would enlist in the military and risk their lives for \nthis country. Here is what Denham said--paraphrasing him. He said: I \nknow many of us do not want to vote on immigration. But we can at least \ntweak the Defense authorization bill to allow young people who were \nbrought here illegally as minors through no fault of their own to serve \nin the military when they love this country and this is the only \ncountry they know.\n  To be clear, this measure is far short of comprehensive legislation \nthat is needed to fix our broken system. This slight tweak is not even \na drop of water in the Grand Canyon. Even for the small microscopic \nmeasure known as the ENLIST Act, Steve King responded, saying, ``Don't \ndo it.'' And the Republicans did not.\n  Here is what King said:\n\n       As soon as they raise their hand and say I'm unlawfully \n     present in the U.S., we are not going to take your oath into \n     the military, but we're going to take your deposition and we \n     have a bus for you to Tijuana.\n\n  What happened when King said this? He won. The ENLIST Act was \nstricken from the Defense authorization bill. So not only are \nRepublicans catering to the views of King and others on the far, far, \nextreme right on immigration by refusing to vote on any immigration \nreform, they actively promote anti-immigrant viewpoints by having \npassed a bill called the ENFORCE Act. You see, Steve King and his \nlittle group of far-right Members of Congress on immigration want to \nsue the Federal Government to require them to deport minor children, \nparents of U.S. citizens, and agricultural workers, rather than use all \nof its resources to focus on immigrants who are criminals, terrorists, \nand recent border crossers.\n  But Members of Congress, as most everyone knows, do not have standing \nto sue the Federal Government, because under our Constitution, \nCongressmen are not allowed to sue every time they disagree with a \ndecision of the executive branch. Instead of thinking it was probably a \ngood idea to focus our immigration enforcement resources on criminals, \nterrorists, and border crossers, once again Steve King said: Jump. And \nthe Republican mainstream in the House said: How high? Republicans \noverwhelmingly voted to give King and others the ability to sue the \nFederal Government every single time a decision on immigration \nenforcement is made with which they disagree.\n  There are Republican colleagues in the House who do not have the \nviews of Steve King. We know that. They can offer other excuses they \nwant for failing to do anything on immigration. For instance, they \ntried to blame the President. They say the President is to blame \nbecause he will not enforce the law. The record shows that he does \nenforce the law. In fact, many of the more liberal people, many of the \nimmigration groups, are angry with him because they think he is \nenforcing the law too much.\n  But let's say you believe he is not enforcing the law. So we have \nsaid to them: Good. Pass a bill now and say it does not take effect, \nall of the enforcement and any of the rest of it, until 2017. We will \nhave a new President. If Republicans cannot agree to pass a bill that \ngoes into effect after the President's term, then we know that mistrust \nof the President is nothing but a straw man.\n  They say they really want to pass immigration legislation in their \nheart, but they are only one Member and it is not up to them. They can \neven have their leadership blame other Republicans for not holding a \nvote. But Bill Parcells, who used to coach for both the New York Giants \nand New York Jets, was famous for saying, ``You are what your record \nshows you are.''\n  What does the record show? The record on Republican immigration \nreform is clear. Steve King, a far-right, way-out-of-the-mainstream \noutlier, does not just spew hatred, he calls the shots. They listen to \nhim. The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore \nRoosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan and George Bush, all \nof whom had much different views on immigration than Steve King, is \nfollowing Steve King on immigration.\n  Let me say, they are following Steve King over the cliff. Because not \nonly are they hurting America, but because they are so afraid to buck \nthis extremist--and he is extreme on immigration--they are going to \nmake it certain that they will lose the 2016 Presidential election, \nthat they will make sure that the Senate remains Democratic in 2016 and \nthat the House turns Democratic.\n  It is amazing. The Republican record on immigration reform is clear. \nSteve King has three wins. The rest of the Republican Party and the \nrest of America is winless. Good for him. Terrible for us. Since House \nRepublicans will not stand up to Steve King, King is in the driver's \nseat on immigration reform. As long as he sits there, things will \ncontinue to be stuck in a rut.\n  America is growing weary of Republicans talking a good game on \nimmigration while high-tech businesses cannot get the labor they need \nto grow and create American jobs. We are growing weary of all the talk \nwhile crops go unpicked because farmers cannot find labor. We are \ngrowing weary while Republicans talk and immigrants continue to come \ninto our country illegally.\n  Steve King is calling the shots of the entire House Republicans on \nimmigration. That is a shame. That is a disgrace. That is a singular \nlack of courage that we see in our dear colleagues across the way on \nthe Republican side of the aisle. King is not satisfied. He is warning \nthat his colleagues have to man the watchtowers 24/7 to make sure \nnothing happens to fix our broken immigration system.\n  Where are the people in the Republican Party in the House of \nRepresentatives with the courage to stand up to Steve King and the far \nright? They know he is wrong. We know they know he is wrong. Where are \nthe people in the Republican Party to stand up to Steve King and say: \nEnough is enough. We will not let our party or our country be hijacked \nby extremists whose xenophobia causes them to prefer maintaining our \nbroken immigration system over achieving a tough, fair, and practical \nlong-term solution.\n  If Republicans continue to kowtow to Steve King and the hard right on \nimmigration, they will consign themselves to being the minority party \nfor more than a decade or they can show some courage and say the Steve \nKings in the world can say whatever they want, but they have no place \nin the modern Republican Party. They can move their party into the \nlight by passing a bill that secures borders, holds employers \naccountable, grows our economy, reduces our debt, and heals broken \nfamilies. The choice is theirs.\n  Speaker Boehner has occasionally said he wants to pass reform. Where \nare the rank-and-file Republicans who know Steve King is wrong to \nencourage Speaker Boehner? Where are they? I hope that for our sakes, \nthe majority of Republicans in the House Republican caucus make the \nright choice.\n  But I will tell them this: For the country, no matter what choice \nthey make, the ultimate outcome is undeniable. Immigration reform will \npass this year with bipartisan support and a bipartisan imprint or it \nwill pass in future years with only Democratic support and Democratic \nimprints, because Democrats will control the Congress and the White \nHouse. The right thing will ultimately be done. But hopefully Winston \nChurchill will not be right in saying that it will only be done after \neverything else is tried.\n  Republicans in the House, stand up to Steve King. You know he is \nwrong. You know you cringe when he says\n\n[[Page S2599]]\n\nwhat he says. Do not let him dictate policy.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. The Republican-led filibuster of the minimum wage bill--\nwhich would raise the Federal minimum wage from $7.75 per hour to \n$10.10 per hour--means that an estimated 27.8 million Americans, \nincluding 91,000 Rhode Islanders, will not get a raise. It also means, \naccording to estimates from the Economic Policy Institute, that our \neconomy will miss out on a GDP boost of $22 billion by 2016, which \nwould have supported over 84,000 additional full-time jobs.\n  Those 27.8 million workers who would have received a raise would have \nspent it at local businesses, helping their local communities and \nspurring economic growth. Typically, minimum wage workers are those \nwho, when they receive an increase in their paychecks, go out and buy \nthings that are necessary. They are the ones who really provide the \nkind of local stimulus we need to grow the economy.\n  The Federal minimum wage has not been increased since 2009. Today an \nindividual who works 40 hours per week 52 weeks a year at the Federal \nminimum wage earns $15,080 per year, and that is nearly $5,000 below \nthe Federal poverty level for a family of three and almost $9,000 below \nthe poverty level for a family of four. That means we have hard-working \nAmericans putting in full-time work every week for the entire year and \nyet still living in poverty. That is not fair to these families who are \njust looking for a fair shot.\n  People who work hard for a living shouldn't have to live in poverty. \nThat was not the case in the sixties when the minimum wage was such \nthat it would lift you out of poverty, and that is what we have to do \ntoday.\n  When Congress last passed legislation to raise the minimum wage in \n2007, it was a bipartisan undertaking, and 44 Republican Senators \njoined Democrats to send President Bush a bill that raised the minimum \nwage to its current level. That bipartisan effort should be emulated \ntoday in this Senate. In fact, one could argue that the needs are more \npressing; that American workers have fallen further behind; and that \nthe same logic that compelled President Bush to sign this bill and a \nbipartisan Congress to send it to him is even more compelling today.\n  Our constituents sent us here to work together to grow the economy \nand create jobs. It is disappointing that this bill to provide millions \nof hard-working Americans a raise--a raise they deserve through their \nown efforts--has been filibustered.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side would find a way to work with \nus on this issue and come together to strengthen our economic recovery. \nI was particularly gratified, working with my colleagues on emergency \nunemployment insurance, that we did get bipartisan support to pass \nsensible and fiscally responsible legislation. Unfortunately, now it is \nin the House and it is not moving there. I hope it does.\n  But we have to do more of that, focus on what will actually help \nAmericans individually and collectively move and grow our economy. We \nhave worked together on emergency unemployment insurance and other \nissues, such as immigration reform. We can work together on this issue, \nand we must.\n  Again, I am at this point very disappointed that same bipartisan \neffort has not been translated into action by the House of \nRepresentatives when it comes to restoring emergency unemployment \ninsurance. Speaker Boehner could call up our bill, which is fully paid \nfor and which will affect, at this point, about 2.6 million Americans--\nand their families, so it is many more Americans who will benefit--and \nunder the rules of the House could quickly have a vote within probably \n24 hours. I am convinced and so is my colleague Senator Heller of \nNevada, who is my chief cosponsor, that bill would pass in the House \ntoday on a bipartisan basis. We have had Republican Representatives who \nhave written to the Speaker and said: Bring it up for a vote. That \nwould help. It would help not only 2.6 million Americans--and that \ngrows each day--but it would also help our economy.\n  So, again, in a similar vein, we need bipartisan action on raising \nthe minimum wage in the Senate, emulating the bipartisan action we took \nwith respect to emergency unemployment insurance, and then we need that \nsame bipartisanship in the House of Representatives to move these \nmeasures to the President for his signature.\n  Raising the minimum wage and restoring jobless benefits are the right \nthings to do for the American people and for the American economy. I \nhope these policies, which traditionally have enjoyed strong bipartisan \nsupport, will eventually prevail in both the Senate and the House and \nbe signed into law by the President of the United States.\n  Once again, I think it is important to emphasize that the last time \nwe raised the minimum wage, it was a bipartisan effort signed by a \nRepublican President. This is not an issue or should not be an issue of \npolitical ideology or political posturing. This should be an issue of \nwhat helps the American worker make his or her way through a very \ndifficult economy. Viewed in that logic, it is clear to me that we \nshould pass this legislation, not filibuster it, and that the House \nshould pass quickly the emergency unemployment insurance compensation \nbill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN.

Madam President, I wish to tell the story of a 57-year-\nold man from Boyertown, PA. His name is Dean Angstadt.\n  Dean is a self-employed, self-sufficient logger. He is the kind of \nguy, similar to a lot of Americans out there, who has sort of grown up \nto believe he could do everything for himself; that he didn't need a \nlot of help from people around him in order to make a living, in order \nto provide for his family, in order to keep himself healthy.\n  He has been uninsured since 2009, and he had some particular thoughts \nabout the Affordable Care Act. He knew he didn't want anything to do \nwith ObamaCare.\n  In 2011 Dean had a pacemaker and a defibrillator implanted to help \nhis ailing heart pump more efficiently. Not long after he got these two \nimplants, the 6-foot, 285-pound guy was back out in the woods, but last \nsummer his health worsened again. It was taking him about 10 minutes \njust to catch his breath after he felled a tree, and by the fall he was \nwinded just traveling the 50 feet between his house and his truck. He \nsaid:\n\n       I knew that I was really sick. I figured the doctors were \n     going to have to operate, so I tried to work as long as I \n     could to save money for the surgery. But it got to the point \n     where I couldn't work.\n\n  So he called his friend Bob who is a 55-year-old retired firefighter \nand nurse, and talked about the fact that he was having trouble. Bob \nsaid: Why don't you check out the Affordable Care Act? But every time \nhe made that suggestion, Dean refused. Dean said:\n\n       We argued about it for months. I didn't trust this \n     ObamaCare. One of the big reasons is it sounded too good to \n     be true.\n\n  January came, and Dean's health continued to get worse. His doctor \nmade it clear he urgently needed valve replacement surgery, and he was \nfacing a choice: He either had to find a way to get health care or he \nwas going to die. That was his choice, find a way to pay for health \ncare or perish.\n  Luckily, his friend Bob finally convinced Dean to come over and at \nleast\n\n[[Page S2600]]\n\ntake a look at the Affordable Care plans available to Dean. So he came \nover to his house, and in less than an hour the two of them had \nfinished the application. One day later Dean signed up for the Highmark \nBlue Cross Silver PPO plan and paid his first monthly premium of \n$26.11.\n\n       All of a sudden, I'm getting notification from Highmark, \n     and I got my card, and it was actually all legitimate. I \n     could have done backflips if I were in better shape.\n\n  His plan kicked in on March 1, just in time to get the surgery he \ncouldn't have afforded otherwise, that he couldn't have put off any \nlonger. On March 31, after his surgery, he said without that surgery:\n\n       I probably would have ended up falling over dead. Not only \n     did it save my life, it's going to give me a better quality \n     of life.\n       For me, this isn't about politics. I'm trying to help other \n     people who are like me, stubborn and bullheaded, who refused \n     to even look. From my own experience, the ACA is everything \n     it's supposed to be and, in fact, better than it's made out \n     to be.\n\n  Dean's story is one of 8 million stories that can be told all across \nthe country. Eight million people have enrolled in private health care \nplans under the Affordable Care Act. Why? Because there is a simple \npremise embedded at the foundation of the Affordable Care Act; that is, \nthat you shouldn't get sick--in Dean's case, you shouldn't face death--\nsimply because you don't have the money to afford surgery.\n  Dean was working. Dean was a logger, a salt-of-the-Earth kind of guy \nwho was playing by the rules, obeying the law, had a job, but he just \ndidn't have the money to afford that expensive surgery. He gets to live \nand he gets access to health care because of the Affordable Care Act--\nnot because of a government handout but because of our collective \ndecision to give Dean a discount on private health care, 1 of 8 million \npeople all across the country.\n  That is just the number of people who have been insured on these \nprivate exchanges. Three million young people under the age of 26 have \nbeen able to stay on their parents' plans because the Affordable Care \nAct allows for that to occur. New numbers this week suggest more than \n4.8 million people have enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP plans between \nOctober 2013 and March of 2014. Another approximately 1 million \nindividuals gained coverage through an early expansion of Medicaid that \nhappened in States before January 1, 2014.\n  Put that all together: Eight million people on exchanges, 3 million \nyoung people covered through their parents' plan, 5.8 million people on \nMedicaid. That is 16 million, 17 million people in this country who \nhave health care who didn't have it before.\n  In my State the numbers are even more remarkable. We had a goal of \nsigning up about 100,000 people, and we went out there and did \neverything we could to get the word out about the Affordable Care Act. \nWe didn't sign up 100,000 people; we signed up 200,000 people. To be \nexact, we signed up 208,301 people in Connecticut. On the last day \nalone, on March 31, 5,900 people signed up in Connecticut. Connecticut \nis a small State. We only have a handful of 1 million people who live \nin our entire State, and we increased those who have insurance by \n200,000 in a State of only a few million. That is probably why--the \nfact that in States such as Connecticut 200,000 people now have \ninsurance, 15 million-plus across the country have insurance--the \npolling is starting to fundamentally change. A Washington Post poll \nfrom a few weeks ago showed that for the first time a majority of \nAmericans support the Affordable Care Act. A new poll in battleground \ncongressional districts shows that 52 percent of respondents want to \nimplement and fix the Affordable Care Act, which is about 10 percent \nmore than those people who want to repeal and replace the bill. That 52 \npercent number has increased beyond what the poll showed last December. \nThe 42 percent number of those who want to repeal and replace is much \nless than the number from last December. People are starting to figure \nout that all the Republican spin and rhetoric about the Affordable Care \nAct is just that, spin and rhetoric, and the reality is that 15 million \npeople have access to health care. The stories such as Dean's can be \nmultiplied all over the country in every corner of this great Nation.\n\n  But here is the even better news: We are not only enrolling more \npeople but we are saving money. We are enrolling people and saving \nmoney. Medicare spending growth is down. Medicare per capita spending \nis growing at historically low rates. In April, for the fifth straight \nyear, CBO reduced its projections for Medicare spending over the next \n10 years. This time they reduced it by another $106 billion.\n  This is what we always said was the problem with the American health \ncare system. We always said we don't insure enough people. We still \nleave 30 million people without access to health care and we spend \ntwice as much money as our other competitor first-world nations--less \npeople insured, much greater cost. We all came down to the floor, the \nSenate and the House, and said the Affordable Care Act will tackle both \nproblems, and now a few months into the full implementation of the law \nthat is exactly what is happening.\n  It is actually costing less than we thought. The projections are that \nthe Affordable Care Act is going to reduce the deficit by $1.7 trillion \nover the next two decades. Let me say that again. The Affordable Care \nAct will reduce the deficit by $1.7 trillion, meaning if you repeal the \nAffordable Care Act, as so many still want to do--as the House has \ntried to do 50 different times--you would increase the deficit by $1.7 \ntrillion and the overall cost of the program is 15 percent less than \nwhat the initial projections were.\n  Insurers are starting to weigh in as well. The second biggest U.S. \nhealth insurer, WellPoint, increased its profit forecast after the ACA \nenrollment numbers boosted their quarterly results. Their chief \nexecutive officer said:\n\n       The risk pool and the product selection seem to be coming \n     in the manner that we hoped it would. It's very encouraging \n     right now.\n\n  UnitedHealthcare, which had a pretty small footprint in these \nexchanges, has now changed its bias to increase the participation in \nexchanges in 2015 because it said it saw a positive response from \nconsumers who enrolled in the plans they did offer in limited States in \ngreater than expected numbers. Fifteen million people, including eight \nmillion people on private insurance plans, enrolled, saving money for \ntaxpayers and for insurance companies. That is the real story of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Let me finish by sharing with you a couple more stories from \nConnecticut, and I am going to share them through the eyes of the \nenrollers because enrollers and assisters are the heroes of these last \nseveral months.\n  There was an embarrassing rollout of the Affordable Care Act in the \nfall of last year, a Web site that should have been working on day one \nthat wasn't. But the fact is that thousands of people all across this \ncountry working in community health centers and emergency rooms, at \nnonprofits, decided to make this thing work in red States and in blue \nStates and went out and enrolled in record numbers, shattering \nexpectations for people on affordable health care. I had a few of these \nassisters together in Connecticut. They started telling me stories and \nI will finish with two of them.\n  Michael, who is an assister in Danielson, CT, tells this story, and \nhe said: I recall a husband and wife who came into our health center \nand didn't have health insurance mainly because they indicated their \nemployer's insurance plan was way too expensive. As I went along asking \nquestions during the application the husband mostly complained about \nObamaCare. He kept saying our government is making it so no one can \nafford insurance and that he and his wife heard that insurance plans \nwere still too high, even after going through the exchange. After \ncompleting the application and showing them the plans that were \noffered, they were totally surprised by the minimal cost of the \npremiums as well as the deductible rates. I also helped them understand \nhow certain plans were structured and what services the deductible \napplied to. They left that day choosing a plan that was right for them. \nNeedless to say, they went home from our meeting feeling more confident \nabout their choice, more educated about health insurance and less \nresentful of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Sean, who is an assister from Norwich, tells this story: I met one \nmiddle-aged man. He hadn't had insurance for over 5 years because all \nthe plans were so high and unaffordable and he was\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\nover the income for the State Medicaid insurance program. He had a few \nprescriptions and had to pay out-of-pocket around $150 to $200 every \nmonth. We successfully completed an ACA application and selected an \nAnthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan with tax credits. The plan's \nmonthly premium was only a fraction of what he would have paid every \nmonth for prescriptions and medical care, and the prescription drug \ncopay was only about $10. This man was ecstatic, and he said he would \nhave to go home to figure out a way to spend all of the money that he \nwould save every month with his new plan.\n  There are stories similar to his and Dean's all over the country, 8 \nmillion of them just when it comes to the people who have signed up for \nprivate health care, but for the rest of us who have health care, the \nnews is good as well: $1.7 trillion off of the deficit, a program that \nis costing 15 percent less than we had expected, an overall Medicare \ninflation rate for taxpayers that is coming down, and for many of us \nthe ability to sleep a little bit better at night because we know that \nthe most affluent, most powerful country in the world has committed \nitself to the idea that somebody like Dean--a logger, going out and \nworking the land--doesn't have to die simply because he doesn't have \nthe money to pay for surgery. In so many ways the Affordable Care Act \nis working.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Campaign Spending\n\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, there is an ominous tide rising in this \ncountry. It is not water. It is not oil. It is not any kind of \nsubstance. It is dollars. It is cash. It is a tide of dark money that \nis flowing in and threatens to dominate our political system.\n  Yesterday we had a very interesting hearing in the Rules Committee on \nthe subject of disclosure and the rise of outside money in campaigns. \nWe have developed a kind of parallel universe of campaign financing, \nwhere the candidates, you and I and other Members of this body, work \nhard to raise money from supporters so we can fund our campaigns. By \nthe way, all of that money that is raised has to be under certain \nlimits. There are limitations. There are disclosure requirements. If \nyou get a contribution, it has to be disclosed who paid it and what do \nthey do for a living and what is their address. All of that is public.\n  Yet on the other side is this parallel universe, as I mentioned, \nwhere a multimillionaire can come into your State or my State or \nanybody's State and put in an enormous amount of money, essentially \nunregulated and often totally anonymous. I think this is a danger to \nour country. I started the hearing off yesterday by saying I fear for \nmy country. I fear for our democracy.\n  There are several basic points I wish to make. This isn't an \nevolutionary change. This isn't, OK, we are spending a few more dollars \nthis year than we did last year and it is a little more of the same and \nit is no big deal. This is what is happening: This is nonparty outside \nspending starting back in the early nineties, and we see what happened \nin 2012. Now we don't have the numbers in 2012. Of course, 2012 was a \nPresidential year. What we see is it started to go up, the Presidential \nyear in 2004, and then down. It goes up in 2008 in the Presidential \nyear, down--but not so much--and then way up in 2012, and this gives \nthe context of what is happening. This isn't evolutionary change; this \nis revolutionary change. This is a fundamental change.\n  I asked one of our witnesses yesterday at the hearing: Is this a very \nsignificant, great change that is going on? He said: Senator, it is an \nexplosion.\n  It is an explosion. Here is what it looks like. This is nonparty \nspending, cycle to date, and the day was the day before yesterday. In \nother words, it is the outside party spending, the so-called \nindependent expenditures comparing apples to apples as of April 29 of \neach year.\n  So here again, 2004 Presidential year, then it drops way down in 2006 \nmidterms, again jumps up in 2008, down in 2010, big jump for 2012. But \nlook where we are as of this date in 2014. Look at the comparison \nbetween this and the last midterm year. It is almost 10 times as much. \nThis is a threat that is growing and it is going to overwhelm us.\n  Some of my colleagues have said we are bound for a scandal. Indeed, \nthat is what has driven campaign finance reform throughout our history. \nThe first major campaign finance reform was in 1907. It resulted from \nthe Presidential campaigns in the late 1890s and the turn of the \ncentury, where Mark Hanna, a political operative, called the major \ncorporations of America and said: You will give us this--and that is \nhow the money was raised for those campaigns. We then passed the first \ncampaign finance law under the leadership of Teddy Roosevelt in 1907 \nbecause he saw a scandal coming.\n  So this is nonparty outside spending. This is both disclosed and \nundisclosed, but look at this. This is spending by nondisclosure \ngroups, cycle to date. Look where we are. This is the money that nobody \nknows where it comes from. If we start back in here, 2012, this is a \nPresidential year to date and here we are in 2014. It is an explosion, \nand nobody knows where that money is coming from. It is secret money.\n  What we have is the development of organizations and institutions \nengaged in what I call identity laundering. I am not going to attempt \nto explain this chart, but this is a chart that traces in 2012 one set \nof funds. It is about $400 million from three large organizations that \ngo through all of these different entities and the whole purpose is to \nkeep the names of the donors secret. So the public doesn't know who is \ntrying to influence their vote. This isn't insignificant money. Fifty \nmillion dollars this line represents to something called the American \nFuture Fund. They create these entities--and there is also the \nwonderful nomenclature here--there are even entities entitled \n``undesignated'' or ``disregarded''--and the whole purpose of this is \nto hide the identity of the people who are supporting it.\n  I don't think that is consistent with the First Amendment. It is not \nconsistent with our political traditions. It is not consistent with the \nwhole idea of conveying information. If somebody wants to come and buy \nads in Pennsylvania or North Dakota or New York or California, that is \nfine. They have a right to do that, at least under the current Supreme \nCourt rulings, but they also ought to tell us who they are. That is \npart of the information the voters should have in assessing the \nvalidity of the message that is being delivered to them.\n  In Maine you cannot go to a town meeting with a bag over your head. \nIf you are going to make a speech, if you are going to take your \nposition on an issue, you tell who you are, and people can assess the \nvalidity of your views based upon in part who they know you are, what \nyour interest is, what your stake is in this process, and we are \ndenying the people of America the opportunity to know that.\n  It is important to realize in this whole area of campaign finance, \nwhich is unbelievably complicated, that the Supreme Court has \nsignificantly narrowed our ability in Congress or in the States to \nregulate campaign finance. They have essentially said that money is \nspeech and that it can't be limited--at least in the aggregate, that is \nthe McCutcheon decision. Under the Citizens United decision, the \ncorporations are also people and have a right to free speech and can \nspend as much money as they want.\n\n  When you go back and read those key opinions--Citizens United and \nMcCutcheon, which was just decided about a month ago--the Supreme Court \nsaid: We are going to strike down these limitations because they are \nlimitations on free speech, but the basic reason we feel comfortable \ndoing so is because the public still has disclosure and they will know \nwho is talking, and that is our bulwark against abuse and corrosion of \nour system.\n  The problem with that reasoning is the bulwark doesn't exist, and \nclever campaign operatives have created this elaborate system which is \ndesigned to disguise who the contributors are, and that is the problem \nwith our system.\n  The problem right now is that one party may think they are advantaged \nby the current system, but 2 years from now that advantage could \ndisappear. Indeed, data we received just before our hearing indicates \nthat 2 years ago 88 percent of the outside money was conservative. \nIndeed, this year--so far in 2012--it is closer to being balanced. It\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\nis 60-40 conservative over more liberal messages. I submit that once it \ngets to be 50-50, everybody on both sides of the aisle will say that \nmaybe we need to do something about it. I am suggesting we do something \nabout it sooner rather than later.\n  The Supreme Court has invited us to do something about disclosure. I \nthink it is the tool we know we have. There is discussion about a \nconstitutional amendment, which is fine, and I am a supporter. That is \na long-term solution. That could take 4, 5, 6 years, assuming the \nsupport could be achieved in the Congress and in the States. In the \nmeantime, disclosure is something we could do next week, and it is \nsomething we should do. We owe it to the American people to allow them \nto know who it is that is trying to influence their vote.\n  Occasionally, there is an argument that people who make these kinds \nof contributions will be subjected to some kind of intimidation--crank \nphone calls, threats, and those kinds of things. Well, Justice Scalia--\nthe Supreme Court Justice whom I used to know in law school--recently \nsaid: ``Requiring people to stand up in public for their political acts \nfosters civic courage, without which democracy is doomed.''\n  If people are willing to spend millions of dollars attacking someone \nelse's character, integrity, and career, they ought to at least be \nwilling to stand up and say: Here am I. I am making these statements.\n  They should not be allowed to hide behind something created by an \narmy of accountants and lawyers to disguise their identity. I think \nthis is something--and based upon the hearing we had yesterday and the \nwork we did in preparing for it--we really need to attend to.\n  When I first got into this subject last year, I thought it was bad. \nWell, what I have learned over the last several months is that it is a \nlot worse than I thought. It is happening fast. It is a tidal wave, and \nit is going to engulf our system. Why do we care? Because it is \ncorrosive and it undermines the confidence citizens have in us as their \npolitical leaders.\n  In the 1970s and 1980s, people had a perception that money was \ncorrupting around here, even if it wasn't. But, boy, when we start to \nhave unidentified, outside dark money and nobody knows where it is \ncoming from, what could be more calculating to undermine public \nconfidence in their leadership than a system like that? It is \ncorrosive. It undermines the trust of our people. It is wrong, and I \nthink it is something we should attend to. It is something we can do. \nWe know we can do it constitutionally. We had an 8-to-1 majority vote. \nMcCutcheon and Citizens United invited us to do this. I think we should \nbe able to find a bipartisan solution to this subject because it will \nbenefit this whole country, and I think it will be a great benefit to \nthe institution of democracy itself. This is not what the Framers \nenvisioned, and we have it within our power to do something about it so \nwe can improve this situation and the flow of information--including \nthe source of that information--to the people of America.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                                UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time on the floor as the \nChair of the U.S. Helsinki Commission. The Helsinki Commission is the \noperating arm of the U.S. participation in the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, the OSCE. It has been in the press \nrecently because of the circumstances in Ukraine, which is what I am \ngoing to talk about.\n  First, I will remind my colleagues that the United States, along with \nall the countries of Europe and Canada, formed the commission on \nsecurity and cooperation in Europe in 1975. It was founded on the \nprinciple that in order to have a stable country, you need to deal not \njust with the direct security needs--the military needs--of a country \nand not just with its economic and environmental agenda, but you also \nneed to deal with its human rights and its good governance, and all \nthree of these are related.\n  Commitments were made by all the signatories to the OSCE about \nrespecting the jurisdictions of the member states and dealing with the \nrights of your neighbors and dealing with the rights of your own \ncitizens. The Soviet Union was a member of the OSCE, and now all of the \ncountries of the former Soviet Union are members, including Russia and \nthe countries of central Asia.\n  I am increasingly alarmed at the deterioration of the situation in \nEastern UKraine, particularly in the Donetsk region, where Moscow-\ncontrolled pro-Russian separatists have seized 19 buildings and 14 \ncities and towns.\n  Late last week seven members of the German-led OSCE Vienna Document \ninspection team, charged with observing unusual military activities, \nalong with five of their Ukrainian escorts, were kidnapped by pro-\nRussian militants. One observer has been freed, and the rest continue \nto be held hostage. Russia, an OSCE member, has not lifted a finger to \nsecure their release. There is no doubt in my mind that if Mr. Putin \ngave the word, this hostage situation would cease to exist.\n  This hostage-taking of unarmed international monitors must continue \nto be condemned in the strongest possible terms, and everything \npossible must be done to secure their release.\n  In addition to the OSCE observers, 40 people--journalists, activists, \npolice officers, and politicians--are reportedly being held captive in \nmakeshift jails in Slovyansk.\n  Meanwhile, the violence in Eastern Ukraine continues. On Monday, \nseveral thousand peaceful protesters marching in favor of Ukraine's \nunity were attacked by pro-Russian thugs wielding clubs and whips, \nresulting in 15 seriously injured. That same day, Gennady Kernes, the \nmayor of Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, was shot, underwent \nemergency surgery, and remains in serious condition. He is now in \nIsrael for further medical treatment.\n  Furthermore, I am deeply dismayed at other flagrant violations of \nhuman rights by pro-Russian militants in Eastern Ukraine and in \nRussia's annexed Crimea. These include attacks and threats against \nminority groups, particularly Jews and Roma as well as Crimean Tatars \nand ethnic Ukrainians in Crimea. Supporters of a united Ukraine have \nbeen targeted as well, including a local politician and university \nstudent whose tortured bodies were found dumped in a river near \nSlovyansk.\n  The joint statement on Ukraine signed in Geneva on April 17 by the \nEU, the United States, Russia, and Ukraine calls on all sides to lay \ndown their arms, vacate buildings, and begin the process of dialogue \nand de-escalation. That was signed just 2 weeks ago. That agreement \nprovided a basis for de-escalation. Yet, over the course of the last \ndays and weeks, we have not seen the Russians follow through on urging \nseparatists to stand down in Eastern Ukraine. What have we seen? Kyiv, \non the one hand, is taking concrete steps and making good-faith efforts \nto live up to the Geneva agreement, including vacating buildings and \noffering dialogue. Russia has done nothing. Instead of working to de-\nescalate the conflict, it is doing the opposite--fueling escalation. \nRussia continues to violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity \nof Ukraine and flagrantly flaunts its commitments under the Geneva \nagreement.\n  The Geneva agreement also calls upon the parties to refrain from any \nviolence, intimidation, or provocative actions and condemns and rejects \nall expressions of extremism, racism, religious intolerance, including \nanti-Semitism. Clearly, both the spirit and the letter of this \nagreement have been breached by Russia.\n  In recent days we have seen troubling manifestations against ethnic \nand religious minority communities. The distribution of flyers in \nDonetsk calling for Jews to register their religion and property is a \nchilling reminder of an especially dark period in European history. \nWhile the perpetrators of this onerous action have not been determined, \none thing is clear: Moscow, which controls the pro-Russian separatists \nin Eastern Ukraine, is using anti-Semitism as an ingredient in its \nanti-Ukrainian campaign. Perhaps even worse, among the Russian special \nforces and agitators operating in Ukraine are members of the neo-Nazi \nand other anti-Semitic groups.\n  Jewish communities in parts of Eastern Ukraine are not the only ones \nthat have reason to be worried. In\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\nSlovyansk, armed separatists have invaded Romani homes and beaten and \nrobbed men, women, and children. Ukrainian speakers--including \nUkrainian-speaking journalists--have reportedly experienced \nintimidation in the largely Russian-speaking Donetsk area.\n  At the same time in Crimea, which Russia forcibly annexed, Crimean \nTatars continue to be threatened with deportation and attacked for \nspeaking their own language in their ancestral homeland. Moreover, the \nlongtime leader of the Crimean Tatar community and former Soviet \npolitical prisoner Mustafa Dzhemilev has been banned from returning to \nCrimea.\n  It is important to underscore that Crimea is the ancestral home of \nthe Crimean Tatars, who in 1944 were forcibly and brutally evicted by \nStalin to central Asia and only allowed to return to their home in the \nearly 1990s.\n  Additionally, the separatist Crimean authorities have gone after the \nUkrainian community, announcing that Ukrainian literature and history \nwill no longer be offered in Crimean schools.\n  These attacks and threats underscore the importance of the OSCE \nSpecial Monitoring Mission and other OSCE institutions in Ukraine in \nassessing the situation on the ground and helping to de-escalate \ntensions. They need to be permitted to operate unhindered--and most \ncertainly not held hostage--in Eastern Ukraine and to be allowed access \ninto Crimea, which Russia continues to block.\n  The actions against pro-Ukrainian activists and minorities are the \ndirect result of Russia's unfounded and illegal aggression against \nUkraine--first in Crimea and then in Eastern Ukraine. There is no doubt \nas to who pulls the strings. The Kremlin has been relentlessly \nflaunting their Geneva promises and has done nothing to rein in the \nmilitants they control. Mr. Putin needs to get Russian soldiers and \nother assorted military and intelligence operatives out of Ukraine.\n  We must not forget Crimea. We must never recognize Russia's forcible, \nillegal annexation of the Ukrainian territory, which violates every \nsingle one of the 10 core OSCE Helsinki principles. We must build on \nthe punitive measures already undertaken against the Russian and \nUkrainian individuals who so blatantly violated the international \nagreements in the Ukrainian and Crimean Constitutions. Violations of \nanother nation's territorial integrity and sovereignty must not be \ntolerated. Russia's flagrant land grab of Crimea has set a horrible \nprecedent for those countries harboring illegal territorial ambitions \naround the globe.\n\n  I welcome the President's stepping up of economic sanctions on seven \nRussian officials, including members of President Putin's inner circle \nand 17 companies linked to Mr. Putin. I also welcome the State \nDepartment and Commerce Department tightening policy to deny export \nlicense applications for any high-technology items that could \ncontribute to Russia's military capabilities. I am confident Russia \nwill feel the impact of these sanctions. These, along with the further \ntargeted sanctions announced by the EU earlier this week, will only \ncontinue to have a growing impact.\n  Nevertheless, if the situation in eastern Ukraine continues to \ndeteriorate, or even should the status quo persist, the United States \nneeds to ratchet up these sanctions, and soon, including several \nsectoral sanctions against Russia's industries such as banking, mining, \nenergy, and defense.\n  Of equal importance, we need to remain steadfast in helping Ukraine \nbecome a stronger democratic state and foster its political and \neconomic stability. The millions of men, women, and children who \ndemonstrated for months for human rights and human dignity spoke loudly \nand clearly, expressing the wishes of the vast majority of the \nUkrainian citizens. The interim government has been working hard under \nexceedingly difficult circumstances to move Ukraine further on the path \nof economic and political reforms. We and our international partners \nneed to keep making this progress our focal point. Ukraine needs a lot \nof help after the devastation wreaked on their economy by the \nincredibly corrupt and dysfunctional Yanukovych regime.\n  Ukraine has so many pressing needs. Among the most important are \nstabilizing the economy and preparing for the most important May 25 \nPresidential elections. Others include judicial reform, reform of the \npolice and military, seeking justice and rehabilitation for the victims \nof the violence, including those suffering now at the hands of the pro-\nRussian militants, helping internally displaced people who are fleeing \nCrimea, and working to recover the billions in assets stolen by the \nprevious regime.\n  I am pleased Ukraine's civil society, including Western-educated \nyoung people, is firmly committed to the rule of law and democracy and \nis playing a critical role in helping the Ukrainian Government work \ntoward these ends. NGOs and think tanks have worked with the Parliament \nto pass a law on the independence of public broadcasting, a bill on \npublic procurement, and one on how judges are appointed--all critical \nin fighting the scourge of corruption.\n  The United States is providing concrete assistance through a U.S. \ncrisis support package for Ukraine, which includes support for the \nintegrity of the May elections and constitutional reform, substantial \neconomic assistance, energy security technical expertise, help to \nrecover proceeds of corruptions stolen by the former regime, and other \nanticorruption assistance, and fostering greater people-to-people \ncontacts. We need to be willing to provide more resources to the \nUkrainians as they actively work to fulfill their aspirations.\n  Ultimately, these choices will lead to a more secure, democratic, and \npeaceful world, and that is something that reflects both American \ninterests and American values.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I want to thank Dr. Glenn Poshard for his \nyears of public service to Illinois.\n  Today, Dr. Poshard will be stepping down as president of Southern \nIllinois University, a position he has held with honor and distinction \nfor more than 7 years. Under his leadership, Southern Illinois \nUniversity has been able to keep tuition costs low and the university's \nfinances sound, despite financial problems that have plagued the State.\n  Dr. Poshard has dedicated his life to working for the people of \nsouthern Illinois. In 1984, he was appointed to the Illinois State \nSenate until the people of the 22nd Congressional District sent him to \nthe United States House of Representatives in 1989. I was fortunate to \nserve with Dr. Poshard for 8 years in the House of Representatives, \nwhere he was a strong proponent of campaign finance reform. Due to his \ncommitment to reform, he limited individual donations to his \ngubernatorial campaign in 1998 and refused to accept contributions from \npolitical action committees.\n  Following his tenure in Congress, Dr. Poshard and his wife, Jo, \nfounded the Poshard Foundation for Abused Children. For the last 14 \nyears, the Poshard Foundation has worked to help abused, abandoned, and \nneglected children in southern Illinois.\n  After a 40 year affiliation with Southern Illinois University, Dr. \nPoshard is leaving his alma mater in good shape. He retires as the \nsecond longest-serving president in the history of the Southern \nIllinois University system, an experience he calls ``the greatest honor \nof my life.''\n  I congratulate Glenn on his outstanding career and thank him for his \ndedicated service to the people of Illinois. I wish him and his family \nall the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/01/senate-section/article/S2604-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2604-S2605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AFGHANISTAN AND UKRAINE SECURITY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I just returned from a trip to Afghanistan \nand Ukraine where I reviewed the security situation in each country as \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  In each country, I met with military leaders and with civilian \nleaders and representatives of civilian society. The overwhelming \nimpression I came away with is that American leadership remains \ncritical, that others who are struggling for democracy and freedom see \nus as an essential friend and ally, and support for those who share \nthose values must remain a cornerstone of our foreign policy and as \nessential to our own security.\n  In Afghanistan, I met with senior leaders of both our military and \nthe Afghan military, including General Dunford, the commander of U.S. \nand coalition forces, and Afghan Minister of Defense Mohammedi. They \nreported that the transition of security responsibility to the \nAfghanistan National Security Forces--ANSF--has gone even better than \nwe had hoped, with no significant loss of security in the country \ndespite the withdrawal of tens of thousands of American and coalition \ntroops. U.S. and Afghan leaders alike expressed satisfaction with the \nability of the newly built and much larger ANSF to successfully protect \nthe Afghan people, to defeat Taliban forces in combat, and to secure a \nseries of major public events, culminating in the April 5 Afghan \npresidential election.\n  Our military commanders emphasized that while these gains reflect the \ngrowing confidence of the Afghan security forces in their ability to \nprovide security to the Afghan people, the challenge ahead is to put in \nplace the final pieces needed to make the progress of the last decade \nsustainable. This includes logistics, maintenance, airlift, and \nbuilding the institutions of the Afghan Army and police. Fundamental to \nany long-term effort on our part in Afghanistan will be the signing of \nthe Bilateral Security Agreement as soon as possible with a new Afghan \npresident. While President Karzai remains unreliable and his rhetoric \noffensive, all the major Afghan presidential candidates, including the \ntwo winners of the first round, support what we have done so far and \nlook forward to signing the BSA promptly if elected.\n  In addition to meeting with the three leading presidential \ncandidates, I met with Afghan government officials and with several \ngroups of representatives of Afghan civil society. The Afghans I met \nwith came from different backgrounds and spoke with different voices, \nbut they shared a common message of pride in the achievement of their \ncountry as it has rebuilt and recovered from the devastation of decades \nof civil war and Taliban rule. They pointed to the revival of \nAfghanistan's education and health systems, the dramatic improvement in \nthe role of women in the country, and the new life that the last 10 \nyears have brought to the country's economy.\n  They also spoke of their frustration with the exceedingly negative \npicture of events in Afghanistan depicted in the U.S. press. A leading \nnational paper writes about a ``deepening resentment'' of the American \npresence and a ``growing alienation'' between Afghanistan and the \nUnited States. But the Afghans I met and large majorities of Afghans, \naccording to public opinion polls, are grateful for the sacrifices we \nhave made on their behalf and are convinced they can continue to \ntransform their country with our continued support. Their polls show \nthat 64 percent of the Afgan people believe there has been significant \nprogress in security. U.S. polls show the opposite, the product of an \nunbalanced, negative view in our media.\n  The Afghans I met spoke with pride of the election they held on April \n5, in which 7 million Afghans braved threats and violence to get to the \npolls, voting at a higher rate than we achieve in our own elections. \nAccording to preliminary counts, more than 35 percent of the voters \nwere women. This record vote was the culmination of a campaign in which \nthe leading candidates held huge rallies, attended by tens of thousands \nof Afghans all over the country--including in areas that much of our \npress reports are controlled by the Taliban. All of the security for \nthese events, and for the vote itself, was provided by Afghan forces. \nAnd every Afghan I spoke with said that he--or she--feels more secure \ntoday than a few years ago, in part because Afghan forces are providing \nsecurity in Afghan cities and towns.\n  Although the vote was divided among a number of candidates and a run-\noff between Dr. Abdullah and Dr. Ghani will occur, Afghans say the act \nof voting itself sent a message that Afghans reject the Taliban and \nwhat it stands for. Our intelligence sources indicate that the Taliban \nleadership is concerned by its inability to disrupt the election and \nprevent Afghans from getting to the polls.\n  So, far from what we may read in much of our press, the Afghan people \nconveyed to me their optimism regarding their country's significant \nprogress, their desire for democracy, and their gratitude for the \nassistance of the United States over the past decade.\n  In Ukraine, I met with Acting President Turchinov, Prime Minister \nYatsenyuk, Defense Minister Koval, National Security and Defense \nCouncil Head Parubiy, and numerous other government officials, \nactivists, and participants in the political process. Ukrainians faced \ndown the heavily-armed security forces of a corrupt, repressive regime \non the Maidan--their Independence Square--while they themselves armed \nwith little more than rocks, tires, and sandbags. Now they face an even \ngreater challenge in the form of tens of thousands of Russian troops \nmassed on their borders. Already, the Russians have annexed Crimea and \nRussian Special Operations forces have organized sympathizers to occupy \nbuildings in a number of Eastern Ukrainian cities and towns in an \neffort to disrupt and destabilize the government, make an election on \nMay 25 difficult to organize, and establish a basis for Russian \noccupation or a Russian-oriented breakaway State.\n  In the face of these challenges, the Ukrainians I met expressed \ngratitude for the solidarity and support our country has shown through \nthe dark days of the Yanukovich regime and into the challenges they \nface today. They expressed their support for our values and their \nstrong desire to be a part of the democratic West, rather than the \nauthoritarian sphere of Putin's Russia and its allies. And they asked \nfor our support in their effort to stabilize their country, fend off \nthe Russian challenge, and hold free and fair elections as scheduled.\n\n[[Page S2605]]\n\n  The Ukrainian people earned our support when they put their lives on \nthe line at the Maidan and turned to face the Russian threat with both \ntoughness and restraint. We should stand with the Ukrainian government \nand the Ukrainian people because they share our democratic values, and \nbecause Russia's effort to dismember their country through the threat \nof force, if allowed to succeed, could undermine decades of stability \nand a peaceful, democratic, and united Europe.\n  Ukrainians understand there will not be American ``boots on the \nground'' in their country. But there are a number of important steps we \ncan take to support the Ukrainians in their struggle.\n  First, we must expedite the aid we have already promised them--\nincluding both financial assistance and nonlethal military equipment--\nto make sure it arrives as quickly as possible.\n  Second, we should provide additional support, including body armor \nand fuel, that the Ukrainians need to protect themselves. We should \nprovide the Ukrainians with firearms and ammunition if they need them--\nbut it appears that at this point they do not.\n  Third, we should make more robust use of the powers established in \nExecutive order 13661, which authorizes sanctions against the Russian \nfinancial, energy, metals, mining, engineering, and defense sectors, to \nensure that the Putin regime pays a heavy price for its illegal \nactions. President Obama's action to sanction more wealthy individuals \nin Putin's circle, as well as businesses they own, is a wise one, but \nwe can do more.\n  Fourth, we should ensure that Russian banks are subject to the \nsignificant tax penalties imposed on noncompliant banks by the Foreign \nAccount Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, the antitax evasion law set to \ntake effect in July. Russian banks and financial institutions that fail \nto register with the Internal Revenue Service and obtain the required \nidentification number by July 1 of this year will be noncompliant with \nFATCA and become subject to a 30-percent withholding tax on any U.S. \ninvestment earnings. We should not negotiate with either Russia or \ncertain Russian banks on measures to provide relief from FATCA's \nsanctions until Russia honors its diplomatic commitments and takes \nsteps to diffuse tensions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, including by \nwithdrawing Russian troops from the border region.\n  Finally, we should use the existing authorities to take on Russia's \nmanipulation of energy prices and supplies which it has used to coerce \nnot only Ukraine but also many of its neighbors. To be most effective, \nthese actions should be taken in close coordination with our friends \nand allies in Europe, many of whom are directly affected by Russia's \nabuses and threatened by its actions. We must take concrete steps \ntoward substituting energy from other sources for the countries that \nwould be impacted by a reduction of Russian energy. We must actively \nbecome involved in energy development, diversification, and \nconservation, even if it means paying higher prices for fuel, to break \nRussia's iron grip on this market, and to prevent future acts of \nattempted political extortion by Russia from being effective.\n  The people of Ukraine are proud of their fight for freedom at the \nMaidan, as are the people of Afghanistan of the courage they showed, \nwhen they voted in record numbers to reject the Taliban in their April \n5 election. Both countries are struggling for values that we, as a \nNation, have always shared. They both deserve our support, and we \nshould continue to give it to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/01/senate-section/article/S2605-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2605-S2606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my \ndisappointment over yesterday's vote to increase the Federal minimum \nwage. It is vitally important that working families receive a long-\noverdue pay increase, but once again the Senate failed to move forward \non a crucial piece of legislation.\n  At $7.25 per hour, today's Federal minimum wage fails to provide a \nliving wage for many Americans. Working a standard 40-hour week, 52 \nweeks a year, with no time off and no sick days, the minimum wage pays \njust over $15,000 a year.\n  In many parts of the country, including California, that salary is \nnowhere near enough for an individual to subsist, let alone a family.\n  It is difficult to fathom how a single mother working a minimum wage \njob--or jobs--can survive. These are the Americans who would benefit \nfrom this bill.\n  To get a better idea of what the standard 40-hour-a-week worker must \nearn to meet basic necessities, I had my staff look at the cost-of-\nliving in various California cities.\n  In San Francisco, a single adult with no children would need to earn \nover $12 an hour to meet basic necessities.\n  In Los Angeles, they would need to make over $11 dollars an hour. The \nsame goes for San Diego. That amount only increases for families.\n  By one measure, a single mother with two children living in San \nFrancisco would have to earn almost $30 an hour just to meet basic \nnecessities.\n  I would add that we aren't debating an exorbitant increase. Moving \nfrom $7.25 to $10.10 would still leave many low-income working families \nwell short of a living wage. But it is a start, and it would benefit \nmillions of low-income working Americans.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed minimum \nwage increase would increase incomes for 16.5 million low-wage workers; \n97 percent of the low-wage working population would benefit from this \nincrease; 900,000 low-wage workers would move above the poverty line; \nand the increase in the federal minimum wage could reduce demands on \nother Federal assistance programs.\n  A lot of attention has been given to CBO's estimate that increasing \nthe minimum wage would lead to 500,000 job losses for low wage workers. \nIt is important to note that CBO's estimate is the median in a wide \nrange of estimates on the employment effects of increases in the \nminimum wage.\n  When you study the report, you find that most estimates of job losses \nrelated to increases in the minimum wage are clustered around zero, \nwhich means that most studies have found that increasing the minimum \nwage has a negligible effect on employment.\n  This isn't to say businesses won't have to make some adjustments. \nSome will have to raise prices, some might see slightly reduced \nprofits, and some might slow hiring or choose to reduce their \nworkforce.\n  But the effects will not be devastating, as opponents of the minimum \nwage increase suggest. In fact, cities and States throughout the \ncountry are natural experiments for the effects of a minimum wage \nincrease on jobs.\n  The minimum wage in San Francisco is currently $10.79 per hour. Far \nfrom an economic catastrophe, San Francisco is enjoying a sustained \nperiod of economic growth and employment. San Jose, which has a similar \nminimum wage, also has a robust labor market.\n  Bloomberg has also researched the effects of minimum wage increases \non employment and found that employment effects are negligible and, in \ngeneral, States that have recently raised the minimum wage are actually \ncreating more jobs than those that haven't.\n  Washington State increased its minimum wage in 1998 and tied the wage \nto increases in inflation. The minimum wage is currently the highest in \nthe country.\n  Since that time, annual job growth in Washington has outpaced the \nrest of the country, and the service industry has added thousands of \njobs. There are many other examples of localities that exceed the \nFederal minimum wage and continue to experience sustained job growth.\n  It is clear to me that businesses are capable of adjusting for an \nincrease in the minimum wage in a way that will allow them to thrive.\n  And a minimum wage increase would not only alleviate some of the \nburdens and obstacles facing the low wage work force, it would also put \nmore than $30 billion in the pockets of workers struggling to get by, \nthose most in need of a pay raise.\n  According to many economists, that additional income could spur local \neconomies, more than offsetting any negative effects from a minimum \nwage increase.\n  In a time of nearly unprecedented income inequality--during which the \nwealthy have actually made even more money--it is vitally important \nthat Congress enacts laws to allow all\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\nAmericans to benefit from economic advancement.\n  Increasing the minimum wage is certainly not the only option. \nCongress should be looking elsewhere to do even more to ensure that \nchildren born into low income families aren't locked into a life of \npoverty. But increasing the minimum wage would be a step toward that \ngoal. It would also serve as an indication that Congress appreciates \nthe daunting challenges posed by income inequality and is willing to \nconfront them.\n  Mr. President, I fully support an increase in the minimum wage and I \nhope that we can come together to find a way to reconsider the minimum \nwage bill and move it forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/01/senate-section/article/S2606-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FORD ADMINISTRATION'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this year marks the 40th anniversary of \nGerald R. Ford taking the oath of office and becoming the 38th \nPresident of the United States. The Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand \nRapids, MI will be commemorating this significant anniversary \nthroughout 2014 by highlighting the impact of his service to our \ncountry.\n  Gerald Ford took the oath of office on August 9, 1974, in the \naftermath of the Watergate scandal, the Vietnam war, and President \nNixon's resignation, a very tumultuous time in our Nation's history. He \nreflected this when he stated:\n\n       I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances . \n     . . . This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and \n     hurts our hearts.\n\n  Although he was born in Omaha, NE, his family made Grand Rapids, MI, \ntheir home very soon after his birth. After high school, he attended \nthe University of Michigan and played football for the Wolverines, \nearning the designation of Most Valuable Player. Choosing to attend law \nschool instead of pursuing a professional football career, he completed \nhis law degree at Yale University and then returned to Michigan, where \nhe started a law practice.\n  After serving with the U.S. Navy during World War II, he returned to \nhis home State where he became a partner in a Grand Rapids law firm and \ninvolved in the political scene. His experiences in the war led him to \nreject his previously isolationist leanings and adopt an outlook of \ninternationalism. As a result, at the age of 35, he challenged the \nisolationist incumbent for Michigan's Fifth Congressional District in \nCongress and won.\n  He served his district, our State, and the Nation honorably. He was \nreelected 12 times, each with more than 60 percent of the vote. As a \nnew Congressman, he quickly established a reputation for personal \nintegrity, hard work, and the ability to deal effectively with both \nRepublicans and Democrats, qualities that would define his entire \npolitical career. During his time in Congress, he was appointed to the \nAppropriations Committee and rose to prominence on the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee. He was well respected by his colleagues \nand was a leader in the Republican Party, serving as the minority \nleader for 8 years.\n  After the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew, Ford was \nnominated by President Nixon and confirmed by Congress to fill the \nvacancy. Less than a year later, Nixon resigned and Ford became \nPresident, making him the first President who was not elected to either \nthe Presidency or Vice Presidency.\n  As President, Gerald Ford was confronted with the challenges of \ndealing with inflation, reviving a depressed economy, solving chronic \nenergy shortages, and trying to ensure world peace. He described \nhimself as a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in \nforeign affairs, and a conservative in fiscal policy. Respected for his \nintegrity and openness, he worked to restore our country's trust and \nconfidence in the Presidency.\n  One of his first acts as President was to pardon Richard Nixon before \ncriminal charges were brought against him. Despite strong negative \npublic reaction and political backlash, Ford maintained that this was \nthe right thing to do for the good of the country, and history has \nborne this out. When the new President, Jimmy Carter, took the oath of \noffice, President Carter summed up the sentiment expressed by many \nabout Ford's Presidency by saying, ``For myself and for our Nation, I \nwant to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.''\n  Gerald Ford and his wife Betty continued to be active in the \npolitical process after leaving office. We are proud that Gerald Ford \nwas from Michigan and an important part of the Ford legacy lives on \nthrough the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library in Ann Arbor, MI, and \nthe Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing our 38th President \nand his outstanding contributions to our country on the 40th \nanniversary of his Presidency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/01/senate-section/article/S2606-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2606-S2607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         PLYMOUTH COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Plymouth County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Plymouth County worth over $11 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $1 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memories of working together have to include \nworking with community leaders on the renovation of the American Legion \nbuilding in LeMars. The funding allowed for a new glass block window \nand improvements to the existing front door to meet code on the first \nfloor and the replacement of windows, repainting, and new signage on \nthe second floor.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics; It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans.\n  Main Street Iowa helps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing \nfunds to revitalize downtown business districts. This program has \nallowed towns like LeMars to use that money to leverage other \ninvestments to jump-start change and renewal. I am so pleased that \nPlymouth County has earned $30,000 through this program. These grants \nbuild much more than buildings; they build up the spirit and morale of \npeople in our small towns and local communities.\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Western Iowa, we have worked together to grow the economy \nby making targeted investments in important economic development \nprojects including improved roads and bridges, modernized sewer and \nwater systems, and better housing options for residents of Plymouth \nCounty. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in \nPlymouth County, I have fought for\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\nfunding for Head Start, school construction, and dialysis center \nprojects worth more than $1 million, helping to create jobs and expand \neconomic opportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants--for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Plymouth County has received $462,349 in Harkin Grants.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Plymouth County has received more than $3.4 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Plymouth \nCounty's fire departments have received over $325,229 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nPlymouth County, both those with and without disabilities, and they \nmake us proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Plymouth County, during my time in Congress.

Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. It has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Lyon County to build a legacy of a stronger local economy, \nbetter schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, safer \ncommunity.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Lyon County worth over $1.2 million \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought hard to support, which have provided more than $6.2 million to \nthe local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be our shared \ncommitment to school construction and modernization. Iowa students \ncannot learn in buildings that are falling apart. Working together with \nState and local communities, this funding has ensured Iowa students are \nlearning in schools that are safe and modern. It was an investment in \nIowa communities and its kids, and I look forward to learning about the \nrenovations made possible in Lyon County.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin Grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Lyon County has received $1,197,251 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Lyon County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $34,181.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Lyon County has received more than $299,000 from \na variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Lyon County's \nfire departments have received over $397,392 for firefighter safety and \noperations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\nrange of initiatives to improve the health of individuals and families \nnot only at the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, \nand workplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to \nclinical preventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, \nsafe places to engage in physical activity, and information to make \nhealthy decisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not \nonly save lives, they will also save money for generations to come \nthanks to the prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for \na whopping 75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that \nLyon County has recognized this important issue by securing $63,750 for \nwellness grants.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nLyon County, both those with and without disabilities. They make us \nproud to be a part of a community and country that respects the worth \nand civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Lyon County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Lyon \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. Of course, this \nwork is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I have no \nintention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, richer Iowa. \nI will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity to serve the \npeople of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/01/senate-section/article/S2608-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING BULLET TOOLS\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, thousands of American businesses \nstem from simple ideas that are born in the living rooms, backyards, \nand garages of ambitious entrepreneurs. From humble beginnings, \nbusinesses mature to reach new customers and broader regions. I wish to \nrecognize Bullet Tools, a small family owned business from my home \nState of Idaho, whose originality and hard work grew into a global \nsuccess in a distinctive market.\n  In 1998, Bullet Tools started as a family operated assembly line in \nDalen and Mary Gunn's double-wide mobile home in Hayden, ID. The words, \n``It can't be done,'' fueled Mr. Gunn's determination to work through \nany obstacle. Seeking to advance the construction industry, Mr. Gunn \ndiscovered an enhanced method of installing flooring without the \nchallenges associated with electricity, dust and constantly moving in \nand out of buildings.\n  Today, Bullet Tools is recognized as a world leading expert in fixed-\nblade cutting tools for the construction industry. The company has \nearned a worldwide reputation and serves an international market with \nunique custom installation needs. Fifty percent of its sales are \nexported to markets abroad, including Australia, Canada, Germany, \nJapan, Russia and the United Kingdom with an expectation for further \ngrowth in other international markets.\n  Bullet Tools has grown more than 300 percent over the past 5 years. \nIn 2012, Dalen and Mary Gunn's son-in-law, Ben Toews, became president \nof the company. Mr. Toews' business expertise has allowed Bullet Tools \nto streamline its product lines and build upon existing manufacturing \nrelationships, while Mr. Gunn continues to focus his energy on \nresearching and developing new products. Today, Bullet Tools boosts \nover 70 products that may be found both in store and online at Home \nDepot and other retail distributors across the globe.\n  Last week, I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Gunn and Mr. Toews \nat their facility in Hayden, ID, with my colleague on the Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Committee, chair Maria Cantwell. I was \nimpressed by the company's strong commitment to its 25 employees and \nthe greater Idaho community. Because of the team's dedication and the \nbusiness's achievements, it is not surprising that the company has \nreceived various awards and endorsements. For example, Bullet Tools was \nselected as the recipient of the U.S. Small Business Administration's \n2009 Northwest Small Business Administration Exporter of the Year \nAward, the 2010 Green Products Award by Building Products Magazine, the \n2013 Pro Tool Innovation Award, and the Gold Hammer Award from \nCarpenter Magazine. In 2013, Ben Toews was individually recognized as \none of North Idaho Business Journal's 30 Under 40 for his ongoing \ncommitment to excellence as an executive setting the pace for \noutstanding achievement through his integrity and character.\n  Today, the Gunn's original mobile home continues to welcome visitors \nto the Bullet Tools' corporate office and manufacturing location, \nreminding us that with hard work and dedication, the American dream may \nbe achieved in our own backyard. I congratulate the Gunn family and \neveryone at Bullet Tools on their continued prosperity, strong work \nethic, and outstanding reputation for excellence. Bullet Tools \nepitomizes the finest characteristics of American innovation and is a \ntribute to both Idaho and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/01/senate-section/article/S2608-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO STEPHANIE GRUBA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline; read the first \ntime.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, today I filed an updated bill to approve \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline project. That bill is at the desk. What this \nlegislation does is it approves the project congressionally, which is \nauthorized under the Constitution of the United States. Section 8 of \narticle 1 of our Constitution expressly gives Congress the authority to \nregulate commerce with foreign nations. That is the determination we \nare looking for here from the President on this pipeline project. The \ndecision is simply: Is the project in the national interest or is it \nnot?\n  The President and his administration have been considering this \nproject, and\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\nthis decision--is it in the national interest or not--for more than 5 \nyears. We are now in the sixth year. It was our expectation the process \nwould be completed on or about the first week in May. The final \nenvironmental impact statement came out at the end of January and, as \nthe prior environmental impact statements had determined, this \nenvironmental impact statement said there is no significant \nenvironmental impact caused by the project. This is a study done over \nyears by this administration's Department of State. For the fourth time \nthe report came out with no significant environmental impact created by \nthis project. So as I say, it was the expectation of this Senate and \nreally of Americans across the country that sometime in May the \nPresident would make a decision because all along he said he was \nfollowing the process, and once the process was completed he would make \na decision. A little over a week ago, on the afternoon of Good Friday--\na time that I believe was selected in order to minimize the news \ncoverage--the President or the administration made the announcement \nthey would now delay this project indefinitely--indefinitely. Not a \nstatement of: We are just going to follow the process, which is what \nhad been said before. Even though the President, in a meeting with me \nand our conference, came out and said we would have a decision before \nthe end of 2013. That is what he told us. That didn't happen because \nthen he changed it to: We are going to follow the process. Now it is \nnot even going to follow the process. He is just going to delay a \ndecision indefinitely.\n  The rationale for that is that there is litigation in Nebraska as to \nwhether the public service commission in the State of Nebraska has the \nright to determine the route of the pipeline through Nebraska or \nwhether in fact the legislature does.\n  Some time ago, right at the beginning of 2012, we had passed \nlegislation in this body, which I sponsored, that required the \nPresident to make a decision on the project within 90 days. We passed \nthat bill and, in fact, he then made a decision to decline the project \nbased on the route in Nebraska. So Nebraska went through the work of \nrerouting the pipeline in the State, and that new route was approved by \nthe legislature and it was approved by the Governor. But opponents of \nthe project decided to sue on the basis that, no, the PSC should make a \ndecision as to the route in Nebraska.\n  So be it. That can be adjudicated in Nebraska, as can any other issue \nthat somebody may choose to file a lawsuit over. But that really has \nnothing to do with the decision the President needs to make. The \ndecision the President needs to make is a very simple decision: Is this \npipeline project in the interest of the United States or is it not? \nThis is after his State Department has said there is no significant \nenvironmental impact created by the project not once, not twice, but \nfour times. So it is a simple decision.\n  It is a decision of whether we should have more energy that we \nproduce in our country and that is produced in Canada, our closest \nfriend and ally, or whether we should keep getting energy from the \nMiddle East. It is a decision about whether we should have more jobs. \nThe State Department says 42,000 jobs are created in constructing the \npipeline. It is a decision about economic activity. This creates \neconomic activity, with hundreds of millions in tax revenue to help \nreduce the deficit and debt without spending one penny of Federal \nmoney.\n  That is the decision before the President. But he refuses to make it. \nSo it is long past time--long past time, as we are now in year 6--for \nthis body to step forward and make the decision. As I said just a \nminute ago, we have the authority to make the decision. Section 8 of \narticle 1 of the Constitution of the United States gives Congress the \nauthority to regulate commerce with foreign nations. So we need to make \nthe decision. The time is long past when we can continue to wait.\n  How can we continue to wait when the President says it will be an \nindefinite time period before he will even consider making a decision?\n  So the bill we have put forward is a very simple, straightforward \nbill. As a matter of fact, I am going to take a couple minutes and read \nit because it is three pages. It is an updated bill to a bill I \nprovided on a bipartisan basis earlier. We had 27 cosponsors of the \nearlier legislation. We now have 56 Republicans and Democrats on this \nbill, and we are working very hard to get 60 so there is no procedural \nway to stop this legislation, but I will take just a minute and read it \nbecause it is self-explanatory, it is simple, it is straightforward, \nand it is common sense.\n\n       A bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       SECTION 1. KEYSTONE XL APPROVAL.\n       IN GENERAL. TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. may \n     construct, connect, operate, and maintain the pipeline and \n     cross-border facilities described in the application filed on \n     May 4, 2012, by TransCanada Corporation to the Department of \n     State (including any subsequent revision to the pipeline \n     route within the State of Nebraska required or authorized by \n     the State of Nebraska).\n\n  So we have expressly put language in there to address the litigation. \nThe litigation the President is concerned about we expressly address in \nthe bill.\n\n       (b) ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT.--The Final Supplemental \n     Environmental Impact Statement issued by Secretary of State \n     in January 2014, regarding the pipeline referred to in \n     subsection (a), and the environmental analysis, consultation, \n     and review described in that document (including appendices) \n     shall be considered to fully satisfy--\n       (1) all requirements of the National Environmental Policy \n     Act of 1969 . . .\n       and\n       (2) any other provision of law that requires Federal agency \n     consultation or review (including the consultation or review \n     required under section 7(a) of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 . . . with respect to the pipeline and facilities \n     referred to in subsection (a).\n       (c) PERMITS.--Any Federal permit or authorization issued \n     before the date of enactment of this Act for the pipeline and \n     cross-border facilities referred to in subsection (a) shall \n     remain in effect.\n       (d) FEDERAL JUDICIAL REVIEW.--Any legal challenge to a \n     Federal agency action regarding the pipeline and cross-border \n     facilities described in subsection (a), and the related \n     facilities in the United States, that are approved by this \n     Act, and any permit, right-of-way, or other action taken to \n     construct or complete the project pursuant to Federal law, \n     shall only be subject to judicial review on direct appeal to \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit.\n       (e) PRIVATE PROPERTY SAVINGS CLAUSE.--Nothing in this Act \n     alters any Federal, State, or local process or condition in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act that is necessary \n     to secure access from an owner of private property to \n     construct the pipeline and cross-border facilities described \n     in subsection (a).\n\n  That is it. It is that simple. It is that simple.\n  So our President has been deliberating on this now for 6 years, and \nthat is the decision. Are we going to produce energy in this country, \nare we going to work with Canada to get our energy, are we going to \ncreate jobs, are we going to generate economic activity or are we going \nto continue to rely on oil from the Middle East?\n  It is not as though there is no precedent to do it. Look at this \nchart. The red line is the Keystone Pipeline. I don't know how many \npeople realize it, but we have already built the Keystone Pipeline--not \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline for which we are seeking approval but the \nKeystone Pipeline. The project under consideration is a sister project \nto one that has already been built. It brings oil from Canada into the \nUnited States. That is the Keystone project. It has been permitted and \nbuilt. It is in operation now.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline, the sister project, brings oil from Canada \ninto the United States; then North Dakota and Montana put light sweet \nBakken and crude oil in it as well, and that oil goes to our \nrefineries. Does it seem like a complicated decision, a difficult \ndecision? Does it seem like something that requires 6 years of study?\n  The point is this body can approve it. That is what this is all \nabout. We have 56 Senators--56 Senators, Republicans and Democrats--\nsaying: Give us a vote. Give us a vote. Let this Senate do its job. \nLet's approve this project. It is a very straightforward decision.\n  Is this decision going to be made for special interest groups? Is \nthis decision going to be blocked? Are we not going to get a vote \nbecause special interest groups are opposed to something the American \npeople want? In the most recent poll, 70 percent of Americans want it \nbuilt. What does it take?\n  One of the arguments I heard is: It is a pipeline. It has to be \nstudied for 6\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\nyears because it is so complicated and difficult.\n  There are the pipelines we have in this country. We have millions of \nmiles of pipeline, but it is so difficult to figure out whether we \nshould build one more that produces energy and jobs for our country? A \nlot of these pipelines are old and we have millions of miles of \npipelines all over this country. We can't decide whether we should \nbuild one more that is state-of-the-art?\n  What are we saying to our friends and neighbors in Canada? They very \nmuch want this project. They feel they have dealt with our country in \ngood faith. What are we saying to Canada?\n  Some might say, if the pipeline isn't built, then that energy will \nnot be produced from the oil sands area in Canada.\n  Really? Is that right? Then what is this pipeline moving? Oil from \nthe oil sands in Canada. What is moving on our railroads all over this \ncountry?\n  If we don't build this pipeline, that oil is either going to China--\nand then we end up continuing to get our oil from the Middle East--or \nit is going to move by rail. If it moves by rail, that is 1,400 tanker \ncars a day on our railroads, 14-unit trains of 100 cars a day on our \nrailroads. Does that seem like a better way to move it than a state-of-\nthe-art pipeline? That is the decision.\n  I could put the decision in front of anybody in this country and I \ndon't think it would take them 6 years to decide and I don't think it \nshould take our President not only 6 years to decide, but now he said \nindefinitely--an indefinite delay.\n  It is time to vote on this important issue. I wish to thank the \nSenators who have stepped up and supported this legislation--certainly \nSenator Landrieu, who will be down here to talk about it in a minute, \nand Senator Heitkamp, my fellow Senator in North Dakota, and many \nothers on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats.\n  It is not a partisan issue. It is an issue of whether we are going to \nmake this decision for the people of this country and build an energy \nfuture for this country--energy security for this country--where we \nproduce more energy in North America between the United States and \nCanada than we consume so we don't have to rely on energy from the \nMiddle East or from Venezuela or other countries that may not share our \nbeliefs, our views, and our interests. That is the decision or is this \ngoing to be a decision for special interest groups?\n  If the President refuses to make that decision, we in this body have \na responsibility to do it, and we put forward a bill to approve it.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their hard work on this bill, and I \nask others to join us. Let's make this decision, and let's make it for \nthe American people.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am going to speak very briefly this \nafternoon about a very timely and important subject. My colleague and \npartner, Senator Hoeven, came to the floor earlier--I was unable to \ncome at that time--to speak about a bill for which he has actually \nprovided extraordinary leadership.\n  I wish to thank the Presiding Officer, and Senator Hoeven for his \nleadership as well, to try to help bring to the floor of the Senate a \nvote to help construct the Keystone Pipeline. It is an issue a group of \nus have been working on now for quite some time. I wish to thank the \nPresiding Officer again. I wish to also thank the other Democratic \nleaders who have been so supportive and helpful to us in this effort: \nSenator Pryor from Arkansas, Senator McCaskill from Missouri, Senator \nTester from Montana, who agreed to cosponsor the bill, Senator Warner \nfrom Virginia, Senator Hagan, Senator Begich, Senator Manchin, Senator \nDonnelly, and Senator Walsh. I really want to thank them and other \ncolleagues who have decided they may not want to cosponsor the bill \nthat will be introduced later tonight, but they very well may vote for \nit, and I appreciate it.\n  I know this has been a very contentious issue for many, because \npeople have very strong feelings about this particular pipeline called \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. Some of us who support it have a little \ntrouble understanding why it is such a big deal, but I appreciate there \nare strong feelings on the other side of this issue. For those of us \nfrom States such as Louisiana and Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, \nparticularly, that are affected by this pipeline, it is clear that the \ntechnology--and we should be proud of it--is extraordinary, it is \nexploding and, in some ways, unprecedented and unexpected. The \ntechnology is creating a real opportunity for America and for North \nAmerica. That opportunity is for us to produce more oil and gas. The \nopportunity is to continue to maintain coal supplies that are clean and \nappropriate for the environment--or advanced coal technologies, I \nshould say--and provide the kind of energy, including as well \nalternative energies that are emerging, such as wind and solar, and \nmaintaining our nuclear and strategic advantage as part of our electric \ngrid. It provides a real opportunity for us to go from a major country \nthat was scrambling to plan where our energy was going to come from and \nreally concerned about it--paying very high prices sometimes at the \npump and through our electric grid--to now a country that gets to \nactually say, My gosh, look at the resources we have right here in \nAmerica and the resources we potentially have with our partners and our \nallies. One of the strongest allies we have in the world is Canada, and \nan emerging ally--emerging in its relationship with us--is Mexico: The \nNorth American continent. I think there is so much potential for \nCanada, the United States, and Mexico--and others share my view--to \nbecome completely not only energy independent but an energy powerhouse \nfor the world--a world in which the North American continent, at least, \nwants to promote freedom, democracy, and human rights. Senator Cardin \nwas just on the floor talking about how important that issue is for our \nNation and world. He has given literally his life as an expert on human \nrights around the world and is leading the Helsinki Commission. He was \njust talking with us about the importance of this and what is happening \nin Ukraine and in Russia and in Europe recently.\n\n  So the issue of freedom and private enterprise and opportunity and \neducation and energy self-sufficiency are goals we treasure and it is \npossible for the rest of the world and our allies around the world.\n  But what signal does it send if America is not willing to do its part \nwhen it comes to production right here in America and transporting oil \nand natural gas and other emerging fuels--alternative fuels, \nalternative sources of electricity--when we are not doing our very \nbest?\n  I know it is contentious, but I come to the floor to talk about this \nissue. Senator Hoeven gave an excellent defense of why the Keystone \nPipeline is important. But I want to underscore that in terms of jobs \nand the economy. I want to underscore the process. Because there are a \nlot of Democrats and others in my caucus--friends and colleagues--who \nhave said: Well, has the process been complete? Has the process been \nthorough?\n  I want to review for the record a couple of very interesting aspects. \nBefore I start, I want to point out, again, this, shown on this map I \nhave in the Chamber, is the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  There is already a ``Keystone Pipeline'' that has been constructed \nand has been operating for quite some time. This is an existing \npipeline that is operating from Canada down to the refineries in Texas \ntechnically, but very close to the Louisiana border. We are very proud \nof our industry in Texas and Louisiana--the refining capacity we have, \nthe ability to generate resources this country and the world need. \nHopefully, if we can open exports appropriately--which is happening, as \nwe speak. Permits are being issued. The jobs that are created here, the \nopportunity for creating jobs in every one of our 50 States, including \nHawaii and Alaska, and in our territories and in our first nations, as \nthey are called, in our tribal territories, is almost without peer in \nthe last several decades.\n  But this XL Pipeline is an alternative route, and it has been debated \nfor quite some time. There have been these permits I am going to talk \nabout in a minute that have been reviewed and will put that into the \nRecord because there is some concern: Have we really reviewed what we \nneed to do? Have the environmental studies been met?\n  So into the Record I want to put: On April 16, 2010, the Department \nof State\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\nissued its Draft Environmental Impact Statement. It opened a 45-day \ncomment period, which extended for additional days.\n  Then, a year later, on April 15, 2011, the Department of State issued \na Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement and opened another \n45-day comment period. At that time, there were 280,000 comments that \nwere received. Those comments were read, responded to, and absorbed \ninto the process.\n  On August 26 of that year--2011--the Department of State issued its \nFinal Environmental Impact Statement and opened an additional 90-day \nreview period. The agency continued to accept public comments.\n  Then, on March 1, 2013, the U.S. State Department issued its \nSupplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Keystone XL \nPresidential Permit application, which includes the proposed new route \nthrough Nebraska because there were some questions earlier in the \nprocess whether it should go through Nebraska.\n  Let me say, as strongly as I support the Keystone Pipeline, I also \nsupport States--whether it is Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Nebraska, or \nNorth Dakota--to make determinations according to their own laws and \ntheir own constitutions about the takings of private property, which is \nsometimes required for projects such as this. Those processes cannot be \nshortchanged and they cannot be ignored.\n  One of the court cases right now in Nebraska is because--the courts \nhave ruled this--the Governor there overstepped his bounds and he, \naccording to the court in Nebraska, took actions that were contrary to \nthe law in Nebraska and the constitution.\n  So these laws I am not dismissive of--the rules and regulations. \nNebraska still has some issues that have to be resolved. But the rest \nof the pipeline to the south here has already been constructed. This \npart is being worked on. There are other parts of the pipeline that can \nbe started while Nebraska finishes its very legitimate decisions \nbetween its courts, its public service commission, and its legislature \nabout the issues in Nebraska--which, let me say, the landowners have \nvalid concerns, and the courts have ruled so.\n  But, nevertheless, on January 31, 2014--this year--the State \nDepartment issued its Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement \nfor the permit application, confirming that the project is safe and \nwill have limited environmental impacts. The report reflects that \nTransCanada has agreed to incorporate 59 special safety conditions \nrecommended by the pipeline safety commission.\n  So to my colleagues who say: Have we given ample time to review, I \nwould say the answer is clearly yes. Is it time to build the pipeline? \nYes. And should we get about a vote on the Senate floor to express \nstrong support for a piece of America's infrastructure--North American \ninfrastructure that is critical to the future growth of our economy and \nto the promise of opportunity, economic opportunity for our citizens? I \nthink the answer to that is yes.\n  This group of Democrats--of which the Presiding Officer, Senator \nWarner from Virginia, is a part--has been working on this now for \nseveral years.\n  One other point I would like to make: the comparison here of other \npretty well-known and very large public works projects or private \ndevelopments--some of them are public and some of them are private--\nthat have been constructed.\n  The Hoover Dam--very well known--took 5 years to complete, from 1931 \nto 1936. From planning, design, to completion--5 years.\n  The Pentagon took 2 years to complete, from 1941 to 1943.\n  The Space Shuttle Discovery took 4 years to complete, from 1979 to \n1983.\n  The Ambassador Bridge between the United States and Canada--3 years \nto complete. Design, build, and complete--from 1927 to 1929.\n  The Theodore Roosevelt--4 years to complete, from 1968 to 1972.\n  America and Canada: Together we have been building major projects for \nmany years--complicated, tough projects that require tremendous \ncooperation between agencies, and dealing with environmental protection \nrules and regulations, and meeting citizens' concerns.\n  This is not anything new. We have been doing this in America for a \nlong time. It is time to stop studying and stop waiting and start \nbuilding this Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  Now, again, the legislation we have introduced today--Senator Hoeven, \nSenator Landrieu, and 10 other Democrats, and several other \nRepublicans--to build this pipeline would simply say it is time to stop \nstudying; start building. With all due respect, the process is \ncomplete. We just acknowledged the process is done.\n  We also acknowledge there is still an outstanding issue in Nebraska. \nNothing in this bill will affect the court decisions, the timeframe in \nNebraska. But what it will send is a signal that this other section can \nstart to be built and constructed. And then, of course, Nebraska will \ntake--we do not know. It could be 6 months, it could be a year. We do \nnot know when that process will finally be resolved.\n  But we can start now. It is going to take several years for this to \nbe completed. If we wait another year, it is pushing this even further \nback for no good reason.\n  Let me mention a third argument.\n  I think some people are under the mistaken impression that this is \nmaybe the first time we have built infrastructure with Canada. Nothing \ncould be farther from the truth. There are 100 cross-border permits \nthat have already been approved for oil and natural gas and electric \ntransmission facilities crossing the U.S.-Mexico or the U.S.-Canadian \nborder. Of these 100 are 21 oil pipelines crossing the border.\n  So this is such a basic, important point of building infrastructure \nbetween Canada, America, and Mexico that some of us who support these \nkinds of things fairly routinely are having difficulty understanding \nwhy 5 years and five permits and five reviews is not satisfactory to \nbuild something that has been basically built multiple times before.\n  Some people may say: Oh, but the difference is, this is connecting \nthe oil sands. The oil sands in Canada are a very important resource, \nnot just for Canada but for the United States. I am glad these oil \nsands are here as opposed to in Venezuela or I am glad the oil sands \nare here as opposed to in Cuba. I am glad the oil sands are here as \nopposed to in the middle of Russia with everything else they have.\n  I am happy Canada has resources. I am happy. They are a friend and a \nneighbor and close to us. I am also really impressed with Canada's \nenvironmental standards, which are, by my calculations--not in depth, \nbut just a broad review, after speaking to so many industry and \ngovernment leaders there--very rigorous. I do not think there is anyone \nin this Chamber who would counter that.\n  It is well known and understood that Canada has very high standards. \nThey understand, accept climate change. They believe carbon is \naffecting the climate in a negative way. They believe they can reduce \nthe amount of carbon coming out. They are sensitive to that. But they \nknow what we know--that the world is going to need oil and gas for \ndecades to come. It is not going to stop in 5 years or 10 years. We \nneed oil and gas for decades. Why not use our own? Why not use the oil \nand gas from Canada, America, and Mexico--creating jobs right here at \nhome, instead of importing it from places around the world that we do \nnot even get along with or places around the world that do not share \nour values or places around the world that can use the price of oil or \ngas to hurt our economy. Why don't we take charge of our own economy?\n  So when some people complain about the oil sands in Canada, I am, \nfrankly, glad they are there. I am glad we can tap into them with \nextraordinary new, cleaner technologies to have oil and gas and energy \nfor this country that has a very bright future.\n  So with the reviews--five over 5 years--hundreds of thousands of \ncomments from business, industry, citizens, environmental groups that \nhave been taken into consideration, the Department of State has issued \nits final review, and that final review said it is safer and more \nenvironmentally in tune with our environmental rules and regulations to \ntransport this oil through a pipeline than through rail or highway.\n  For those of us who live in places that do a lot of production, we \nalways\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\nsay we are proud of the industry, and we are--the industry makes \nmistakes, and when they mess up, they have to clean up--but I also have \nto say, I am very conscious, as most Americans are, of the traffic on \nour highways, of the backups on our rail system. I hear complaints from \nbusinesses, manufacturers: We cannot get our products fast enough.\n  So here we have a chance to move a commodity under the ground, safely \nthrough a pipe, but know if we do not build this pipeline, it is going \nto move by rail or truck, which congests our highways, congests our \nrail lines, and causes even more impact on our environment.\n  I think the record is clear. I think the arguments are in. I think \nthere is no question that this is right for the environment, right for \nthe country, and clearly in the interests of the United States. This \nwill benefit not just the gulf coast where the refineries are, but it \nis going to create jobs throughout our entire country. Suppliers to \nthis project exist everywhere.\n  There is a terrific map that I have shown before where suppliers from \nall over the country are providing either labor or support for the \nconstruction of this pipeline and much other similar infrastructure in \nthe Nation.\n  We already have 2.9 million miles of pipeline in America. This piece \nwe are speaking about today is 1,000 miles. We already have 2.9 million \nmiles of pipe. Yes, some of it needs to be upgraded. Yes, not every \ninch of it is safe. We are working on that. But this is probably going \nto be the safest pipeline ever built in the history of America. It has \nbeen reviewed so many times. I cannot wait to look at the details of \nwhat has been required. I am positive that it is going to be the safest \npipeline ever built. It has taken 5 years to get it.\n  So that is what our bill does. I am going to end with again thanking \nthe Democrats who have joined with me to support the Keystone XL \nPipeline. I thank the caucus for at least the opportunity. Hopefully, \nwe will introduce this bill tonight. Hopefully, we can get a vote on \nthis bill. Let me say that the vote will be in connection with the \nenergy efficiency bill that will also be brought to the floor. The \nreason, as chair of the energy committee, I think that is so important \nis that while neither one represents a comprehensive energy plan for \nthe country, which I hope to develop with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle--I just stepped into this position in the last month--\nthese are two important energy-related pieces that need resolution.\n  The energy efficiency bill has now been worked on by Senator Shaheen \nand Senator Portman--bipartisan--for 5 years, almost as long as the \nKeystone Pipeline has been under consideration by the administration. \nWe have had an energy efficiency bill worked on by Republicans and \nDemocrats that will create thousands of private sector jobs.\n  It is supported by the Business Roundtable, the Real Estate \nRoundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, labor leaders all over our \ncountry, building owners, and retail establishments. The energy \nefficiency bill is a terrific piece of legislation. Again, it came out \nof our committee 18 to 3. There are very few things that have come out \nof the energy committee that are that impactful. There are little bills \nthat come out that really do not mean much to anybody. They may come \nout unanimously. It means a lot to the person who is sponsoring it, but \nit does not have national impact. This has national and international \nimpact--all positive.\n  Senator Shaheen has been a champion of trying to bring this bill to \nthe floor. We have been rebuffed and rebuffed and rebuffed by the \nRepublican side for no reason because some of them are wanting to \ndebate health care and some of them want to debate Iran sanctions. I \nsaid: Let's just talk about energy. It is important for the country to \nfocus at least a few hours of the Senate's attention on energy.\n  America is focused on it. They want it to be affordable. They want it \nto be as clean as possible. They do not want to have to buy it from \ncountries they do not share values with and do not appreciate. They \nwant less imports to America, more domestic production of alternatives \nand oil and gas. So let's get about that business.\n  So efficiency is basically doing a lot more--a lot more with a lot \nless--saving taxpayers and saving huge sums of money. The example that \neveryone is becoming more familiar with is the Empire State Building in \nNew York, an extraordinary private sector effort to take one of our \nmost iconic buildings that we all know and which many millions of \nAmericans have actually visited, and to take an old building that was \nconstructed in the 1930s, retooling it with private money--not public \ngrants, private money--and saving the building owners and the tenants \nof that building millions and millions of dollars as an example of what \ncan be done in commercial buildings throughout this country.\n  That needs to be unleashed with the legislation of Jeanne Shaheen--\nthat power, that promise, to do more of that is going to be unleashed \nby this bill that Senator Portman and Senator Shaheen have carefully \nput together and Senator Wyden also when he was chair, with Senator \nMurkowski's help, and they got it out of the committee.\n  I committed when I stepped into the leadership of the committee to \nbuild on their good work and to do my very best to get that bill to the \nfloor. We have an energy bill with Keystone. I thought the two of them, \nworking together, Republicans and Democrats, we could get a good \ncompromise by working on both of them at the same time. We are capable \nof doing it. They are clearly broadly supported. It will help create \njobs in America.\n  We will begin with two important steps--not the only ones. There is \nmore that can be done. People come to me and say: Senator, we should do \nthis, we should do that. Yes, we can work on coal. We can work on \npropane. We had a hearing on propane today. We can work on additional \nrail for the country. We can work on pipeline safety. We can work on \nalternative fuels. We can work on strengthening our relationship with \nIsrael and China. We can work on new kinds of automobiles.\n  But that is for another day. We cannot do all of it at one time. But \nwhat we can do is what is before us. We can do what is before us. We \ncan do what is clearly timely. The energy efficiency bill, for 5 years, \nhas been waiting for action by this Senate. The House has already \npassed an energy efficiency bill.\n  The pipeline has been waiting 5 years and has been reviewed five \ntimes. It is time to move forward on both and create the kinds of jobs \nfor America that we need--high-paying, middle-class jobs--and to begin \nto help build America and North America as the energy powerhouse that \nit can be, doing it together. We can recognize the transport of oil and \ngas, and the production is important, but also alternative and focusing \non efficiency and conservation, and many of our Democrats are very \nproud of the work in that area.\n  I am sorry to keep the Senate. I think I might be the last speaker of \nthe evening. But I thank the leadership for providing the time, and \nagain, I want to thank Senator Hoeven for his leadership.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Toomey, \n        Mr. Johanns, Mr. Thune, Mr. Rubio, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. \n        Isakson):\n  S. 2282. A bill to prohibit the provision of performance awards to \nemployees of the Internal Revenue Service who owe back taxes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this is a speech--these are some \nremarks--that I really should not have to make, but late this \nafternoon, I rise to discuss more amazing actions from our Nation's tax \ncollector. This is, unfortunately, an agency that is fast becoming the \ngang that cannot shoot straight--the folks who brought us the partisan \nsuppression of free speech, who piled onto that with proposed rules to \nshut down political action by groups with which they disagree or do not \nfavor, and the same team that shares confidential taxpayer information \nwith their allies outside of government. Obviously, I am talking about \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  Here is a great deal: Break the law you are required to enforce and \nget a cash bonus and free time off.\n  What on Earth is this all about?\n  Well, last week, the Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration issued a report, which I have here, on the Internal \nRevenue Service bonuses that were awarded to\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\npersonnel who have violated the tax laws or who have been subject to \nserious infractions of employee policy.\n  This is a lot like hiring someone to work for you, and then they \nsteel money from you or acted in ways that are very inappropriate. \nWould you give them a bonus? I do not think most businesspeople would \ndo that. According to the inspector general, close to $3 million was \nawarded to staff with violations on their records, with about half of \nthat amount going to people who had violated the Tax Code.\n  Other personnel at the IRS received cash bonuses or other awards \ndespite being cited for--listen to this--drug use, making violent \nthreats, fraudulently claiming unemployment benefits and misusing \ngovernment credit cards. Still they got bonuses--up to $3 million.\n  In fact, the report indicates that close to 70 percent of IRS \npersonnel receive some sort of performance award--70 percent of the \nIRS. That is rather remarkable when you think about the sorts of \nproblems your average taxpayer has in getting help from that particular \nagency.\n  This is flatly outrageous--if not appalling or atrocious--and cannot \nbe tolerated. It also makes me wonder what you have to do to be \ndisqualified from an award.\n  More disturbing, these awards, even for people breaking the law, are \nperfectly acceptable under current IRS and government-wide guidelines. \nLet me repeat that. These awards, even for people breaking the law, are \nperfectly acceptable under current IRS and government-wide guidelines.\n  Indeed, the IG report makes it clear that under the terms of the \ncollective bargaining agreement with the main union for IRS employees, \nthese awards are appropriate and cannot be taken away because of such \nviolations.\n  The distribution of these awards at a time when the IRS is under \nscrutiny for its actions concerning the political activity of \nconservative groups, when its performance of basic taxpayer service \nfunctions has drastically worsened, and when it is calling for \nadditional funding, calls into question the agency's commitment to fair \nenforcement of our tax laws.\n  The IG report recognized that these awards--while not technically \nprohibited--appear to be in conflict with the IRS's charge of \n``ensuring integrity of the system of tax administration.'' Well, no \nkidding. Thank goodness for the inspector general.\n  That is what we call an understatement--maybe the understatement of \nthe year.\n  This is another fox in the henhouse story. Not only is the fox in the \nhenhouse, but he is now being rewarded for eating the chickens.\n  These performance awards are just plain wrong and should not go to \nanyone who breaks the law, particularly the laws which the agency \nenforces.\n  These bonus awards weaken public confidence in the Nation's tax \nenforcement agency and are a sign that the agency has indeed run off \nthe rails.\n  The inspector general report recommended that the IRS create a new \npolicy to take disciplinary actions into account when awarding bonuses.\n  It seems to me we need to do more than set up a new policy or \nguideline. We need something more concrete and more immediate. That is \nwhy today I am joining with my friends--Senators Enzi, Cornyn, Rubio, \nToomey, Thune, Johanns, Isakson, and Leader McConnell--to introduce the \nNo Bonuses for Delinquent IRS Employees Act--a bill that really should \nbe unnecessary. I thank my colleagues for joining me and, more \nespecially, Senator Enzi, who has done a great deal of work on this and \nhelped expose this from the first.\n  Our bill is pretty simple. It will prohibit the IRS from providing \nany performance award to any IRS employee who owes an outstanding \nFederal tax debt for failing to pay their taxes.\n  Nobody likes to be audited. Nobody likes to get that phone call from \nthe IRS. Nobody likes to see the taxman at the door. And then if the \ntaxman says: I am sorry, you owe X for a violation of Y, and you find \nout this individual got a performance bonus even though he or she fails \nto meet the tax obligations they face, that is rather incredible.\n  Given what we know about recent IRS actions--and the growing \ndiscontent with the agency I hear from Kansans every day--continuing to \naward personnel bonuses to employees who have outstanding tax \nliabilities or have violated the tax laws is beyond comprehension and \noutrageous and should be stopped.\n  This is not a partisan issue. It is just plain common sense. The IRS \nshould not be in the business of awarding bonuses to its agents who are \nunable or unwilling to abide by the tax laws they are directed to \nuphold--simple as that.\n  So I call upon all my colleagues to support the No Bonuses for \nDelinquent IRS Employees Act and will ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  In closing, I would like to point out this issue has been well-\ndocumented in a 26-page report by the inspector general. I thank the \ninspector general for the work he has done. Right on the first page it \nsays: ``The Awards Program Complied With Federal Regulations, but Some \nEmployees With Tax and Conduct Issues Received Awards.'' Most IRS \nemployees complied with Federal regulations, but some employees with \ntax and conduct issues still received awards. That is an oxymoron.\n  Then, if you skip to the back, there are some recommendations. The \nrecommendation is for corrective action. This is what it says:\n\n       The IRS Human Capital Officer--Daniel Riordan is the IRS \n     Human Capital Officer--will conduct a feasibility study. But \n     they do not have to take action right away. They just want to \n     discuss the feasibility of a study--by June 30 of this year--\n     just a couple months away--for the implementation of a policy \n     requiring management to consider a policy change.\n\n  It does not say just to do it; it says just consider whether conduct \nissues resulting in disciplinary actions should be made part of the \nperformance evaluation, especially the nonpayment of taxes owed to the \nFederal government, prior to awarding performance and discretionary \nawards.\n  Daniel Riordan has received marching orders from the Inspector \nGeneral to conduct a feasibility study by June 30, to determine whether \nthe IRS should even consider whether disciplinary actions, including \nthe nonpayment of taxes owed to the Federal Government, should be part \nof the evaluation as to whether an employee should be eligible for a \nperformance award.\n  We really do not need this legislation. We have introduced it to \nforce action. The inspector general says: Let's have action. On 26 \npages, he says: Let's have action.\n  So to Daniel Riordan, I have the following advice--before we get 60 \npeople on this and pass a bill, why don't you just go ahead and do it. \nDo not conduct a feasibility study. We have all the evidence right \nhere. If you would just change the current policy, it would remove yet \nanother problem, another unfortunate asterisk when we think of the IRS.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for cosponsoring this legislation and \nagain ask for its immediate consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/01/senate-section/article/S2620-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2620-S2621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 432--RECOGNIZING THE EFFORTS OF THE NATIONAL PARK \n SERVICE AND OTHERS IN RESTORING AND REPAIRING THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:\n\n                              S.

Res. 433\n\n       Whereas, on the night of April 14, 2014, as many as 234 \n     female students, most of them between 16 and 18 years old, \n     were abducted by armed militants from the Government Girls \n     Secondary School, a boarding school located in the \n     northeastern province of Borno in the Federal Republic of \n     Nigeria;\n       Whereas the militants burned down several buildings before \n     opening fire on soldiers and police who were guarding the \n     school and forcing the students into trucks;\n       Whereas, according to local officials in Borno state, about \n     43 students were able to flee their captors, and the rest \n     remain missing;\n       Whereas all public secondary schools in Borno state were \n     closed in March 2014 because of increasing attacks in the \n     past year that have killed hundreds of students, but the \n     young women at the Government Girls Secondary School were \n     recalled to take their final exams;\n       Whereas the group popularly known as ``Boko Haram'', which \n     loosely translates from the Hausa language to ``Western \n     education is sin'', is known to oppose the education of \n     girls, has kidnapped girls in the past to use as cooks and \n     sex slaves, and is thought to be responsible for the April \n     14th kidnapping in Borno state;\n       Whereas there are reports that the abducted girls have been \n     sold as brides to Islamist militants for the equivalent of \n     $12 each;\n       Whereas Boko Haram has targeted schools, mosques, churches, \n     villages, and agricultural centers, as well as government \n     facilities, in an armed campaign to create an Islamic state \n     in northern Nigeria, prompting the president of Nigeria to \n     declare a state of emergency in three of the country's \n     northeastern states in May 2013;\n       Whereas, according to the Brookings Institution, Boko Haram \n     burned down or destroyed 50 schools and killed approximately \n     30 teachers in Nigeria in 2013, leaving tens of thousands of \n     children unable to attend school;\n       Whereas, on April 14, 2014, hours before the kidnapping in \n     Borno state, Boko Haram bombed a bus station in Abuja, \n     Nigeria, killing at least 75 people and wounding over 100, \n     making it the deadliest attack ever in Nigeria's capital;\n       Whereas Amnesty International estimates that more than \n     1,500 people have been killed in attacks by Boko Haram or \n     reprisals by Nigerian security forces this year alone, and \n     the Council on Foreign Relations estimates that almost 4,000 \n     people have been killed in Boko Haram attacks since 2011;\n       Whereas the Department of State designated Boko Haram as a \n     Foreign Terrorist Organization in November 2013, recognizing \n     the threat posed by the group's large-scale and \n     indiscriminate attacks against women and children;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations, girls' education \n     is a major challenge in Nigeria;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations Children's \n     Emergency Fund (UNICEF), some 4,700,000 children of primary \n     school age are still not in school in Nigeria, with \n     attendance rates lowest in the north;\n       Whereas a study conducted by the United Nations \n     Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) \n     found that school children in Nigeria, particularly those in \n     the northern provinces, are at a disadvantage in their \n     education, with 37 percent of primary-age girls in the rural \n     northeast not attending school, and 30 percent of boys not \n     attending school;\n       Whereas, according to the World Economic Forum's Global \n     Gender Gap Index, Nigeria is ranked 106 out of 136 countries \n     based on women's economic participation, educational \n     attainment, and political empowerment;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations, women held only \n     6.7 percent of the seats in Nigeria's parliament in 2013;\n       Whereas the advancement of women around the world is a \n     foreign policy priority for the United States;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Agency for \n     International Development, ``Broader, more equitable access \n     to education encourages political participation, enhances \n     governance, strengthens civil society, and promotes \n     transparency and accountability.'';\n       Whereas a 100-country study by the World Bank shows that \n     increasing the share of women with a secondary education by 1 \n     percent boosts annual per capita income growth by 0.3 \n     percentage points;\n       Whereas, according to UNICEF, adolescent girls that attend \n     school are less likely to be married as children, ``are less \n     vulnerable to disease including HIV and AIDS, and acquire \n     information and skills that lead to increased earning power. \n     Evidence shows that the return to a year of secondary \n     education for girls correlates to a 25 percent increase in \n     wages later in life.'';\n       Whereas, according to the World Bank, ``The benefits of \n     women's education go beyond higher productivity for 50 \n     percent of the population. More educated women also tend to \n     be healthier, participate more in the formal labor market, \n     earn more income,. . . and provide better health care and \n     education to their children, all of which eventually improve \n     the well-being of all individuals and lift households out of \n     poverty. These benefits also transmit across generations, as \n     well as to their communities at large.''; and\n       Whereas women and girls must be allowed to go to school \n     without fear of violence and unjust treatment so that they \n     can take their rightful place as equal citizens of and \n     contributors to the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its strong support for the people of Nigeria, \n     especially the parents and families of the girls abducted by \n     Boko Haram in Borno state, and calls for the immediate, safe \n     return of the girls;\n       (2) condemns Boko Haram for its violent attacks on civilian \n     targets, including schools, mosques, churches, villages, and \n     agricultural centers in Nigeria;\n       (3) encourages the Government of Nigeria to strengthen \n     efforts to protect the ability of children to obtain an \n     education and to hold those who conduct such violent attacks \n     accountable;\n       (4) encourages efforts by the United States Government to \n     support the capacity of the Government of Nigeria to provide \n     security for schools and to hold terrorist organizations, \n     such as Boko Haram, accountable;\n       (5) urges timely civilian assistance from the United States \n     and allied African nations in rescuing and reintegrating the \n     abducted girls;\n       (6) recognizes that every individual, regardless of gender, \n     should have the opportunity to pursue an education without \n     fear of discrimination;\n       (7) reaffirms its commitment to ending discrimination and \n     violence against women and girls, to ensuring the safety and \n     welfare of women and girls, and to pursuing policies that \n     guarantee the basic human rights of women and girls \n     worldwide;\n       (8) recognizes that the empowerment of women is \n     inextricably linked to the potential of countries to generate \n     economic growth, sustainable democracy, and inclusive \n     security; and\n       (9) encourages the Department of State, the United States \n     Agency for International Development, and the Department of \n     Defense to continue their support for initiatives that \n     positively impact the ability of women and girls to fully \n     access their human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/01/senate-section/article/S2621-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2621-S2622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.
