Mr. President, I thank the leader for the introduction \nand I am very pleased to introduce today the Reverend Raphael Warnock, \nthe senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. He is a gifted \nauthor, a gifted and prolific preacher, and a great citizen of the \ngreat State of Georgia and the great city of Atlanta.\n  Following in the traditions of the King family and the preachers of \nEbenezer Baptist Church, he is the fifth pastor in the history of \nEbenezer to carry out the mission of Ebenezer with great humility and \ngreat ability and great love, and is a great pastor in our eyes. I am \npleased to welcome him to the U.S. Senate, and I know we will all be \nblessed in his presence today.\n  I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n            46th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1968\n\n  Mr. REID. Tomorrow marks the 46th anniversary of the signing into law \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1968, better known as the Fair Housing Act. \nThis landmark legislation took a stand against\n\n[[Page S2334]]\n\nhousing discrimination and gave American families a fair shot at \nfinding housing that was suitable to their needs. It is fitting we \nrecognize this anniversary now, especially in light of the equality \nlegislation we have been trying to pass here in the Senate recently.\n\n\n                          The Economic Ladder\n\n  One of the first well-known billionaires we heard a lot of talk about \non the planet was the outspoken oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. He once \nquipped: ``Money is like manure. You have to spread it around or it \nsmells.''\n  Well, Charles and David Koch have certainly spread the money around, \nbut it still stinks. It stinks because of what they do with their \nmoney. The Kochs are singlehandedly funding an attack on this Nation's \nmiddle class, instead of concerning themselves with narrowing the gap \nbetween the rich and the poor.\n  Remember, in America today the rich are getting richer, the poor are \ngetting poorer, and the middle class is getting squeezed. The Koch \nbrothers have a lot to do with that. They are pumping hundreds of \nmillions of dollars into rightwing organizations. And I didn't make a \nmistake when I said hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  Instead of giving Americans a fighting chance to prosperity, the two \nrichest brothers in the world are focused on getting Republicans \nelected. These Koch-funded organizations and politicians advocate only \nfor what makes the Koch brothers richer. The two richest brothers in \nthe world want to be richer, and it comes at the expense of the average \nAmerican.\n  The Kochs are the classic example of two men at the top of the ladder \nwho would pull that ladder up to make sure no one else can join them. \nThat is exactly what the Koch brothers are trying to do to middle-class \nfamilies. The only difference, of course, is that Charles and David \nnever even scaled the ladder in the first place. They were born at the \ntop rung. But somehow the Kochs have fooled themselves into thinking \nthey rose to the top by their own merits. They didn't.\n  More importantly, the Koch brothers have decided that they want their \ninherited wealth, this company now they have at the top--they want to \nmake sure this ladder that should be reachable for everyone is \nunreachable. They are determined to make that ladder totally \nunreachable for others. These billionaires do this by rigging the \nsystem even more in their favor, making sure the Kochs' interests are \nbeing represented at all costs.\n  As has been reported--and not by me--the Koch brothers have what some \njournalists are calling secret banks. Organizations serve as middlemen \nto fund ultraconservative scare campaigns. Through these secret banks, \nsuch as Freedom Partners and others, the multibillionaire Koch brothers \npump money into radical institutions and all these rightwing \norganizations ultimately come to the same conclusion: America's best \nbet for economic prosperity is to help the Koch brothers get richer.\n  So what do these groups do with the funds they receive from their \nbillionaire benefactors? Groups such as Americans for Prosperity--try \nthat one on for size, the Americans for Prosperity--lie to the American \npeople about ObamaCare, hoping families will not sign up for affordable \nhealth care.\n  Extreme organizations such as Independent Women's Forum tell women \nequal pay for equal work is not necessary because they say wage \ndisparity is a myth.\n  The Koch-backed Manhattan Institute is another one of their shell \norganizations that tries to convince the country that out-of-work \nAmerican families don't need unemployment benefits. Why? Because they \nare out of work because they are lazy.\n  And, of course, the Heritage Foundation uses Koch dollars to say \nraising the minimum wage is bad for business and will kill the economy.\n  It is clear that the Kochs are using these puppet organizations in \ntheir proxy war on the middle class. But Charles and David aren't just \nusing radical rightwing groups to keep average Americans from scaling \nthe rungs. They are using Republicans. They are spreading their money \naround helping Republicans get elected.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican Congress has shown itself to be in \nlockstep with the Koch brothers' radical agenda. The Republicans \ncontinue to push repeal of the Affordable Care Act. I watched the \nspeech on the House floor yesterday, where one House Member indicated \nthat he tried almost 60 times to repeal the bill--almost 60 times.\n  What did Albert Einstein say? The definition of insanity is when \nsomeone tries to do something over and over again and they get the same \nresult. They are insane. That is Albert Einstein, not me.\n  They are doing this regardless of the fact that even the Koch \nbrothers; that is, their business, Koch Industries, benefited from \nObamaCare.\n  Remember that ladder. The Kochs already got what they needed from \nhealth care reform. They don't want other people to do the same. They \nhave benefited from ObamaCare. I laid that out a few days ago on the \nSenate floor.\n  Senate Republicans have blocked the equal pay amendment three times--\nthree separate Congresses. They won't even let us discuss it. All but \nhalf of Republican Senators voted against the extension of benefits for \nthe long-term unemployed, and turned their back on their own \nconstituents.\n  As for the minimum wage, my Republican colleagues have given no \nindication to help struggling families with the minimum wage.\n  The Kochs' wealth is being used to squeeze the middle class very \nmuch. As long as Charles and David Koch are at the top looking down, \nwho cares about the little people at the bottom, in their estimation.\n  It is shameful that Koch money has made its way into our Nation's \nCapitol, our news, and our homes. It is frustrating that as Senate \nDemocrats look across the aisle, we don't see many willing partners in \ndefending middle-class families in Nevada and across the Nation. But we \nare not going to be intimidated by these Koch surrogates in the media \nor here in this very Chamber. We will continue to fight even harder to \nprotect Americans from the greedy grasp of these billionaire oil barons \nand the wrath of their radical minions. Senate Democrats will continue \nto pull that ladder out from the Koch brothers' fingers so every \nAmerican has a fair shot at climbing to the top.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              Job Creation\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For days now Republicans have been coming to the floor \nto ask the Democratic majority to work with us on jobs. This is the \nissue Americans say they care the most about. So it is hard to see why \nSenate Democrats seem so allergic to various jobs ideas we have been \nproposing, not to mention dozens of job-creating bills already passed \nby the House.\n  Look, our constituents want us to work together to rebuild the middle \nclass, to help create opportunities for the families struggling out \nthere just to pay the bills. In recent days we have given our \nDemocratic colleagues ample opportunity to do that. We have offered one \ninnovative proposal after another, proposals that haven't had much of a \nproblem attracting bipartisan support in the past, ideas such as \nreducing the tax burden on small businesses, freeing them to grow, to \nhire, to innovate, ideas such as approving the Keystone Pipeline, which \nwould create thousands of jobs right away; ideas such as repealing the \nmedical device tax which even Democrats acknowledge is killing jobs--\nalthough they haven't acted to fix it yet--and ideas such as \neliminating ObamaCare's 30-hour workweek mandate, a rule that cuts \npeople's hours against their will, that disproportionately affects \nwomen and is forcing too many Americans to look for extra work to get \nby.\n  But we go even further than just tackling the causes of joblessness. \nOur ideas go beyond just helping Americans secure jobs with a steady \npaycheck and the hope of a better future. Because we have also put \nforward legislation that offers Americans more choices and greater \nflexibility in the workforce. This is something a lot of our \nconstituents are asking for, and we are responding to those concerns.\n\n  One bill we have proposed would let working moms and dads take more \ntime off to strike a better work-life balance. Another bill would \nprohibit\n\n[[Page S2335]]\n\nunion bosses from denying pay increases to an employee who works harder \nthan her coworkers.\n  These are the kinds of practical, commonsense proposals our \nconstituents sent us here to actually pass. These are the things that \nwould make jobs more plentiful and life a lot easier for men and women \nacross our country. For some reason Senate Democrats are blocking all \nof these ideas from getting a vote. Maybe it is because they are so \nsingle-mindedly focused on an election that is still 7 months away.\n  I mean, they have already conceded that their ``agenda'' for the rest \nof the year was drafted by campaign staffers. It is a stunning \nadmission. It explains their near-total lack of interest in practical \nsolutions to the everyday concerns of our constituents. It also \nexplains why the only jobs that Senate Democrats seem to be interested \nin these days are their own.\n  This is a big problem. Not only does it reinforce the widespread \nbelief that Democrats are not serious about jobs, it also reinforces a \ngrowing impression that Democrats are simply out of their depth when it \ncomes to our economy. Think about it: Washington Democrats are well \ninto their sixth year of trying to get the economy back on track--6 \nyears.\n  Yet for many in the middle class things only seem to have gotten \nworse. Average household income has fallen by nearly $3,600. The number \nof Americans actually working in the labor force has dropped to its \nlowest level since the Carter era. Millions are looking for work and \ncan't find it, and the new rules and regulations just keep on coming. \nThey have tried all their usual liberal solutions--higher taxes, \n``stimulus,'' and more regulations. They have tried all the standard \nstuff and it has not worked. Doing more of it won't work either.\n  This may be difficult for Washington Democrats to hear, but it is \ntime they switched from their failed ideological approach. It is time \nfor them to shelve their political games and work with us to pass \npractical legislation for a change--legislation that can finally rescue \nthe middle class from so many years of economic failure.\n  I have laid out a number of commonsense proposals already. There is \nmore we can do if Democrats are willing to reach across the aisle and \nhelp deliver for the American people. My constituents expect us to do \nthat. I am sure theirs do too. Honestly, there is no reason not to do \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10:30 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray pertaining to the introduction of S. 2243 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nMichelle Friedland to the Ninth Circuit.\n  This nomination was approved in the Judiciary Committee on a strong \nbipartisan vote of 14 to 3, including support from four Republican \nmembers: Ranking Member Grassley, and Senators Hatch, Graham, and \nFlake. She has earned the American Bar Association's highest rating of \n``well qualified.''\n  If she is confirmed, which I very much hope she is, it would mark the \nfirst time ever that the Ninth Circuit, the busiest circuit in the \ncountry by some measures, has its full complement of 29 active circuit \njudges.\n  Michelle Friedland earned her bachelor's degree, with honors and \ndistinction, from Stanford University in 1994. She was Phi Beta Kappa, \nand became a Fulbright Scholar from 1995 to 1996, studying at Oxford.\n  She earned her law degree from Stanford Law School in 2000, where she \nwas second in her class, graduated with distinction, and inducted into \nthe Order of the Coif.\n  She then had two prestigious clerkships. The first was with Judge \nDavid Tatel on the DC Circuit.\n  She then clerked for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who \nattended Ms. Friedland's confirmation hearing this past November.\n  Although I could not attend that hearing, it said a great deal that \nJustice O'Connor, the first woman on the Supreme Court and a voice of \ngreat moderation and pragmatism on the Court, came to the Judiciary \nCommittee and demonstrated her support in person for this nominee.\n  Ms. Friedland then served as a lecturer at Stanford Law School from \n2002 to 2004 and subsequently joined the law firm Munger Tolles & \nOlsen, where she is now a partner.\n  She has represented major clients, including Berkshire Hathaway, \nBoeing, Abbott Laboratories, the University of California, and Solvay \nPharmaceuticals. She has worked on issues including criminal defense, \nclass action defense, tax, patent, copyright, and antitrust.\n  She has also done pro bono work, devoting time, for example, to the \nSilicon Valley Campaign for Legal Services and Equality California.\n  She has won the President's Pro Bono Service Award and the Wiley W. \nManuel Award for Pro Bono Legal Services, both from the State Bar of \nCalifornia.\n  She also has broad support in the legal community. One letter came \nfrom 27 individuals who clerked on the Supreme Court--including for \nJustices Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas--when Ms. Friedland clerked for \nJustice O'Connor. They said that Friedland is ``respectful of \ncolleagues, fair-minded to attorneys and litigants, and sharp as a \ntack.''\n  A second letter is from Kathryn Haun, who previously served in the \nJustice Department under Attorney General Mukasey and in the National \nSecurity Division. Today she is a Federal prosecutor in Northern \nCalifornia.\n  Ms. Haun has known Michelle Friedland since they were classmates in \nthe same small section at Stanford Law School. Ms. Haun's letter says:\n\n       I clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, am a \n     member of the Federalist Society, and have always been a \n     registered Republican. Notwithstanding our political \n     differences, I believe [Michelle Friedland] would make an \n     outstanding federal appellate judge if confirmed. This is \n     because Michelle has a deep respect for legal precedent above \n     seeking a particular result in a given case.\n\n  A third letter is from the general counsel of Cisco, Edison \nInternational, Google, Facebook, Rambus, and other companies. It speaks \nvery highly of this nominee, and says, quote: ``All parties appearing \nbefore her, from individual litigants to small businesses to the \nnation's largest corporations, would be confident that she will adjudge \ntheir cases fairly and in accordance with the law.''\n  The Ninth Circuit is also the busiest circuit. It has over 1,470 \npending appeals per panel. This is two and a half times the average of \nthe other circuits.\n  It comes as no surprise, then, that it takes much longer to resolve \nan appeal in the Ninth Circuit than in the other circuits. \nSpecifically, the Ninth Circuit takes 13.3 months to resolve an appeal. \nThis is down from 17.4 months in 2011, but it is still 55 percent \ngreater than the average in the other circuits.\n  Thus, it is very important for businesses, individuals, and others in \nall States in the Ninth Circuit that nominees to this court are \npromptly taken up and confirmed.\n  I will conclude by remarking upon what I see as a real opportunity \nfor the Senate in the coming months.\n  When I was first elected to the Senate in 1992, it was called by some \nthe Year of the Woman. Senator Boxer and I were both elected that year, \nas were Senator Murray and former Senator Carol Moseley Braun.\n  Yet after we were all sworn in, there were still only six women in \nthe Senate. I became the first woman ever to sit on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, after some very divisive hearings for\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, in which the lack of women on the Judiciary \nCommittee became an issue.\n  At the time, the Federal courts were mainly the province of men \nappointed by the two most recent Presidents.\n  About 92 percent of President Reagan's confirmed judicial nominees \nwere men. That number fell under President George H.W. Bush, but only \nto 81 percent. Overall, only 12.6 percent of active Federal judges were \nwomen when I was sworn in to the Senate.\n  Although women have been close to half of all law students for \ndecades, even today only 53 of 164 active circuit judges--or 32 \npercent--are women.\n  Right now, there are female nominees for the Third, Ninth, Tenth, and \nEleventh Circuits pending in the Senate--a total of six nominees, with \nfour simply waiting for a floor vote. To put these numbers in \nperspective, there were only 6 women confirmed to the circuit courts \nduring all 8 years of the Reagan administration.\n  If all six of these pending nominees are confirmed, the number of \nactive female circuit judges would grow by over 11 percent. That is a \nbig deal, and it is a real opportunity to increase significantly the \nnumber of women on the circuit courts.\n  Michelle Friedland is well qualified, she has bipartisan support, and \nher confirmation would give the Ninth Circuit--the busiest circuit--a \nfull complement of 29 judges for the first time. I urge my colleagues \nto support her.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we are again voting to overcome a \nRepublican filibuster of a highly qualified nominee for a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the busiest circuit court in the country. For what \nis already the third time this year, the majority leader has had to \nfile cloture on one of President Obama's circuit court nominees in \norder to move the nomination forward. In stark contrast, the Senate \nconfirmed 18 of President Bush's circuit nominees within a week of \nbeing reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Michelle Friedland, nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Ninth Circuit, is an exceptionally talented attorney, and has \nan exemplary record of service in the top echelons of the legal \nprofession. She clerked on the United States Supreme Court for Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor from 2001 to 2002 and on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit for Judge David Tatel from 2000 to \n2001. Ms. Friedland earned her B.S. with honors and distinction from \nStanford University in 1995. She studied at Oxford University from 1995 \nto 1996 as a Fulbright Scholar and went on to earn her J.D. with \ndistinction from Stanford Law School in 2000.\n  For over a decade, Ms. Friedland has worked in private practice at \nMunger, Tolles & Olson LLP, where she was named partner in 2010. She \nhas taught as an adjunct professor at the University of Virginia School \nLaw and as a Lecturer in Law at the Stanford Law School. Ms. Friedland \nhas experience in both the trial court and appellate levels, including \nthe United States Supreme Court. She manages an active pro bono \npractice and frequently represents the University of California in \nconstitutional litigation. She received the President's Pro Bono \nService Award in 2013 from the State Bar of California, and the LGBT \nAward from the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California in \n2009. The American Bar Association unanimously awarded her their \nhighest rating of ``well qualified.''\n  It comes as no surprise to me that Michelle Friedland's nomination \nhas received significant support. Kathryn Haun, Assistant United States \nAttorney and Former Counsel to then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey, \nwrote to the Committee to express her support, saying ``Michelle and I \nfall at opposite ends of the political spectrum . . . Notwithstanding \nour political differences, I believe she would make an outstanding \nfederal appellate judge . . . Michelle has a deep respect for legal \nprecedent above seeking a particular result in a given case. She has a \nbalance and a willingness to listen to all arguments before formulating \na position on a particular issue. She displays, above all else, \nintellectual honesty and personal modesty that suit her exceptionally \nwell for a federal appellate judgeship.''\n  Eugene Volokh, Professor of Law, at the UCLA School of Law, expressed \nhis strong support for Ms. Friedland to the Committee, writing \n``Michelle is a brilliant and extremely accomplished lawyer, who will \nmake a superb judge. . . [She] has impressed not just those on her side \nof the political aisle, but conservatives as . . . well.''\n  General Counsel from multiple fortune 500 companies including Google, \nCisco, and Facebook echo their support of Michelle Friedland, noting \nthat ``Her career has been marked by energy, integrity, and legal \nexcellence. She has represented a broad spectrum of clients in both the \nprivate and public sectors . . . The careful, unbiased approach she \nwould bring to the types of issues that arise before the Ninth Circuit \nare critical to our nation's values and to its economic health.''\n  In their letter of support, 22 former Supreme Court Law Clerks to \nJustice O'Connor write, ``We have differing political views and \ndiffering careers, but we can all agree that Michelle would be an \nexcellent federal appellate judge. We have . . . enjoyed her warm \ncollegiality, her honesty and fairness, and her dedication to law above \nideology. Michelle would be a tremendous addition to the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, and we urge you to confirm her nomination.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of letters of support be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  If confirmed, Michelle Friedland would increase the gender diversity \non the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. She would be the seventeenth \nfemale judge to ever sit on the Circuit. In comparison, 83 men have \nbeen appointed to the Ninth Circuit over the course of its history. Her \nconfirmation would bring the percentage of active female judges sitting \non the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to nearly 38 percent. Her \nconfirmation would also mark the first time, since the 29th judgeship \nwas added in 2007, that it has had a full complement of active judges \ndespite having the highest number of appeals filed, the highest pending \nappeals per panel and the highest pending appeals per active judge of \nany Circuit in the country.\n  Yet here we are, again voting to overcome a Republican filibuster of \nan exceptionally talented nominee to a court that desperately needs to \nbe operating at full strength.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Letters received in connection with Michelle Friedland\n\n       July 26, 2013--Six Supreme Court Co-Clerks\n       August 26, 2013--Eugene Volokh, Professor of Law at the \n     UCLA School of Law and conservative legal commentator\n       August 26, 2013--Five fellow partners at Munger, Tolles, & \n     Olson LLP\n       September 4, 2013--Brian Fitzpatrick, Professor of Law at \n     Vanderbilt Law School\n       September 9, 2013--Anup Malani, Professor of Law and \n     Medicine at the University of Chicago\n       September 9, 2013--Edward Morrison, Professor of Law at the \n     University of Chicago and Former Law Clerk to Justice Scalia\n       September 12, 2013--Kathryn Haun, Assistant United States \n     Attorney and Former Counsel to Former Attorney General \n     Michael Mukasey\n       September 23, 2013--General Counsels from multiple American \n     companies including Google, Cisco, and Facebook\n       October 2, 2013--27 Supreme Court Co-Clerks\n       October 24, 2013--28 Former Law Students and Current \n     Attorneys\n       November 4, 2013--22 former Supreme Court Law Clerks to \n     Justice O'Connor\n       April 9, 2014--Nancy Duff Campbell and Marcia Greenberger, \n     Co-Presidents of the National Women's Law Center\n       April 9, 2014--Wade Henderson, President and CEO, and Nancy \n     Zirkin, Executive Vice President, Leadership Conference on \n     Civil and Human Rights\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2336-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2336-S2337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

FRIEDLAND TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n                     FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT--Resumed\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                          A Shared Commitment\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I start by making an obvious point that \nevery Member of the Senate is dedicated to helping law enforcement \nofficials get dangerous criminals off the street and deliver justice to \nvictims of sexual assault, every one of us.\n  As we mark National Crime Victims' Rights Week and National Sexual \nAssault Awareness Month, let's all keep that shared commitment in mind.\n  Ten years ago I was proud to join with my colleagues and President \nBush to enact the Justice for All Act, which has made it easier for \nAmerica's law enforcement agencies to protect the innocent, to identify \nthe guilty, and to bring peace of mind to the victims of violent crime. \nJustice for All dramatically increased the resources available to test \nDNA samples from crime scenes, to improve our DNA-testing capabilities \nand to reduce the rape kit backlog which had become a national scandal.\n  The backlog was--and remains--a national scandal of the highest \norder, but we are beginning to make some progress. In the city of \nHouston, for example, a backlog that once reached 6,600 untested rape \nkits--one of the largest in the country--is now in the process of being \ncompletely eliminated thanks in part to the support provided from the \nJustice for All Act.\n  Just to refresh the memories of my colleagues and for those who might \nbe listening, these rape kits consist of forensic evidence collected at \ncrime scenes that will help by testing the DNA to identify the \nperpetrator and, in the process, potentially exonerate people who have \nbeen falsely accused. The DNA tests are that good and that effective. \nWhat is extraordinary about DNA testing in the field of sexual assault \nis that sexual assault offenders rarely commit that crime once. They \nare typically serial offenders. In other words, they keep at it until \nthey are caught. As we have learned from law enforcement officials, \nwhen there is not an adult victim available, these offenders are \nopportunistic and they will attack children, the most vulnerable among \nus. So this is enormously powerful evidence that is available to law \nenforcement to exonerate the falsely accused, to make sure the guilty \nare identified with scientific precision, and to take serial offenders \noff the street so they can't commit other acts of violence.\n  Last year I joined with the senior Senator from Vermont, the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, to introduce bipartisan legislation that \nwould reauthorize the Justice for All Act and continue these beginning \nsteps of progress. If it were up to me, we would have passed that bill \na long time ago. If it were up to me, I would prefer to reauthorize the \nentire Justice for All Act right now--today. It has been hugely \nsuccessful, and it commands strong support across party lines and \nacross the country.\n  That said, it doesn't appear we are going to be able to do that \ntoday, but we do have an opportunity to take immediate action on two of \nthe law's most critical components. Indeed, they could and should be \nreauthorized right now--today. I am referring, of course, to the Debbie \nSmith Act and the Sexual Assault Forensic Exam Program, both of which \nhave been invaluable tools in our efforts to eliminate the rape kit \nbacklog and to improve public safety.\n  Earlier this week our House colleagues passed a bill reauthorizing \nthose provisions, and the Senate now has an opportunity to take up that \nmore narrow House bill to reauthorize the Debbie Smith Act and the \nSexual Assault Forensic Exam Program, even if we can't do the Justice \nfor All Act today. I am hoping that colleagues here in the Chamber, and \nanyone who might be listening to my voice, will join us in this effort \nto do what we can do today to reauthorize the Debbie Smith Act and the \nSexual Assault Forensic Exam Program and then, when it is possible for \nthe Senate to act, to pass the Justice for All Act, the larger piece of \nlegislation.\n  As I said, I would prefer to reauthorize the entire Justice for All \nAct, and I know there are many of our colleagues who share that \nsentiment with me. But regardless of whatever minor disagreements \nMembers may have, we should immediately--today--reauthorize the Debbie \nSmith Act and the Sexual Assault Forensic Exam Program.\n  Again refreshing the memories of some of my colleagues, and others \nwho may not be familiar with it, the Debbie Smith Act was named after \nDebbie Smith who has dedicated her life to making sure Congress keeps \nfocused on this rape kit backlog problem and scandal. She is one of the \nbiggest cheerleaders for this law that now bears her name. This is also \nthe name for the portion of the law that allocates funds to the \nDepartment of Justice to use for grant programs to forensic \nlaboratories, police departments, and other law enforcement agencies \naround the country that may not have the money or the expertise or the \nwherewithal to be able to test these rape kit backlogs.\n  It is not just my position that these two provisions the House has \npassed should be taken up and passed by the Senate and then catch up in \ndue course with the entire Justice for All Act. It is also the position \nof the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, the National Center for \nVictims of Crime, and, of course, Debbie Smith herself,\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\nand I am confident many of my colleagues have heard from her.\n  All of those folks support the provisions of the bigger bill. But if \nwe can't do that today, they support the Senate's passing the \nprovisions that have passed the House as soon as possible. We now have \nan opportunity today to do something to support countless victims of \nsexual assault during National Sexual Assault Awareness Month and \nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week. All of these groups and \nindividuals support the immediate reauthorization of the Debbie Smith \nAct.\n  I am proud to stand here with the heroic people who have dedicated \ntheir lives to helping address this backlog scandal of untested rape \nkits, and even more proud to stand with those who are willing--and \nspending their time and treasure--to help folks who need to heal, who \nneed justice, and who are asking for our support. In all my years of \npublic service, Debbie Smith is among the most inspiring people I have \never had the privilege of meeting. I sincerely hope my colleagues will \nkeep her in mind and others like her as we move forward with this \nlegislation.\n  Earlier this week, Debbie reminded me that the rape kit backlog is \nnot just about numbers and DNA samples and scientific testing. It is \nabout people, it is about justice, and it is about recovery. As she so \neloquently put it:\n\n       These aren't rape kits that need to be tested. These are \n     lives that need to be given back to their owners. These are \n     fragments of lives that have been torn apart.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will remember those words as they contemplate \nhow we should move forward on the House provisions that have been \npassed, as well as the larger Justice for All Act, both of which I \nsupport. By reauthorizing the Debbie Smith Act--and later, in due \ncourse, whenever we can do it, the larger Justice for All Act--Members \nof Congress can continue doing our part to help people like Debbie \nSmith heal wounds, repair lives, and make our country a safer place.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Michelle T. \nFriedland, of California, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nNinth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wish to share with my colleagues some recent \ndevelopments that I believe are important on the immigration front. My \noffice did a report and an analysis recently that pointed out that this \nadministration, unlike what had been done historically, has been \ncounting border apprehensions as ICE deportations from the United \nStates. Classically, before that ICE officers--the Immigration Customs \nEnforcement officers--apprehended people inside the border and did \nremoval proceedings and that was what was counted. So they have used \nthose numbers to create the impression that a great deal more removals \nare occurring than actually are. That is not good. The administration \nshould not be doing that, and it has created confusion. It is just one \nmore example of this administration's willingness, unfortunately, to \nmisrepresent and twist numbers to advance an agenda they believe ought \nto be advanced.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. We believe in immigration, but we \nbelieve in a lawful system of immigration. Most Americans believe the \nlawlessness should end and we should have a system that creates a \nmechanism by which people apply and they are admitted based on a fair \nevaluation of the people most likely to be prosperous in America and do \nwell and contribute to the Nation and should be given priority--and we \nare just not doing that.\n  So the administration contends and says openly that we will not \ndeport people, except those who commit serious crimes, which apparently \ndoes not include DUI's. The crimes almost always have to be a felony, \nit appears, in order for people to be deported, according to the \nadministration. We will ignore the law for that company down the street \nin a high unemployment area which has five employees working illegally. \nThey would not be removed. They will be allowed to stay and continue to \nwork unlawfully, while Americans who cannot get a job are drawing \nunemployment insurance and other subsidies. This is happening all over \nAmerica.\n  So getting to this fundamental point: Government is not being \noperated in ways that it should, conducted by a President who is \ncharged to see that the laws of the United States are faithfully \nexecuted. He has issued prosecutorial removal policies that go beyond \ncreating a mechanism to enforce the law but in fact wipe out the law, \neliminate the law.\n  There has never been a requirement in the law that if someone is in \nthe country illegally, they can stay as long as they don't get \nconvicted of some other felony unrelated to an immigration violation. \nIndeed, under the policy as it is being executed, if an individual has \nfalse documents, which is a felony for an American citizen, that \ndoesn't count as a deportable crime. It is only drug dealing or a crime \nof violence or robbery under the policies that we are carrying out.\n  They say they are faithfully executing that policy in part, deporting \nthe individuals who are convicted of serious crimes. A study came out \nfrom CIS, Center for Immigration Studies, that found 1 in 3 criminal \nalien encounters last year resulted in a release. They are being \nreleased, in one form or another, and are remaining in the country.\n  We have so much going on that is very troubling to me. Former ICE \nDirector John Sandweg said recently:\n\n       If you are a run-of-the-mill immigrant here illegally, your \n     odds of getting deported are close to zero--it's just highly \n     unlikely to happen.\n\n  Now that is the truth. I was a Federal prosecutor. I know how the \nsystem works and I have worked with ICE officers and Border Patrol \nofficers and prosecuted their cases. This is what the reality is, and \nit is not right. It should not be.\n  When we have the Vice President of the United States saying recently \nhe considers the 11 million people here illegally as citizens anyway, \nwhat message does that send, colleagues, to an individual who would \nlike to come to America permanently but has a visa to work so many \nmonths or be a student for so many months and the visa is over? What \ndoes the statement of the Vice President mean to him? It means he \ndoesn't have to go home. All he has to do is just stay in the country. \nIf he is in the interior and not caught at the border and came in by \nairplane, flew into Philadelphia or Denver, he gets to stay. As long as \nhe doesn't get convicted of a felony, nobody is ever going to bother \nhim. So this is an open border.\n  If they get past the border, get into the interior, go to St. Louis, \ngo to Salt Lake City, go to Little Rock, Arkansas, then they can stay. \nThat cannot be the policy of the United States of America. It cannot be \nthe policy of a nation that expects its laws to be respected that if \nsomeone can get past the border or they can get a visa into the country \nand overstay, nobody will have any intention of removing them or \nenforcing the agreement they made or enforcing the law. I feel strongly \nabout this issue.\n  People are unaware of how this is happening. I see in addition to the \nfanciful claims about who is being deported or removed, this was on the \nfront page of the Washington Times today. Steven Dinan says the \nprojections of the Washington Times show that Federal agents are `` . . \n. on pace this year to remove the fewest number of immigrants of \nPresident Obama's tenure.''\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       That slower pace contrasts with the President's argument \n     that he is enforcing the laws to the fullest extent possible \n     by targeting criminals and recent border crossers.\n\n  The article goes on to say that the ICE officers are fully funded to \nremove at least 400,000 people, and at this rate they will be well \nbelow that figure. Why? Because it is the policy not to enforce the \nlaw. This is what is going on in this country.\n\n[[Page S2339]]\n\n  On the same page there is the headline of an article that ``Sheriffs \nwarn of violence from Mexican cartels deep into interior of U.S.''\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Outmanned and outgunned, local law enforcement officers are \n     alarmed by the drug and human trafficking, prostitution, \n     kidnapping and money laundering that Mexican drug cartels \n     are conducting in the U.S. far from the border.\n\n  Not just at the border but away from the border. It goes on:\n\n       U.S. sheriffs say that securing the border is a growing \n     concern to law enforcement agencies throughout the country, \n     not just near the U.S.-Mexico boundary.\n       ``If we fail to secure our borders, then every sheriff in \n     America will become a border sheriff,'' said Sam Paige, \n     sheriff of Rockingham County, NC. ``We're only a two-day \n     drive from the border and have already seen the death and \n     violence that illegal crossings brings into our community.''\n\n  Other sheriffs joined in expressing that similar concern.\n  We are not where we need to be. Since the President took office, \ninterior removals have been cut nearly in half. They have dropped by 44 \npercent. More than half of the ICE removals since 2009 are the border \napprehensions, where they just caught them at the border and sent them \nback. These are not interior deportations as the statistics used to be \nfocused on. Two-thirds of all ICE removals last year were border \napprehensions. So--I said ``half'' earlier--it is two-thirds of the \nnumbers that they are counting as deportations and removal are border \ndeportations that weren't previously counted as such.\n  Ninty-four percent of the people removed last year--get this--were \neither apprehended at the border, which is not attributable to \napprehension, or were convicted of a crime while in the United States.\n  Do you hear that, colleagues? Ninety-four percent of the people who \nwere removed were either people captured at the border or committing a \nserious crime, and even those who commit serious crimes are not \ndeported. Most of the rest were repeat violators or fugitives.\n  So 99.9 percent of the 12 million illegal immigrants and visa \noverstays, without known crimes on their record, including those \nfleeing from authority, did not face removal last year. So if someone \nwas here as a visa overstay or an illegal entrant inside the country \nand did not commit a crime, 99 percent of that--99.92 percent of the 12 \nmillion here were not involved or no action was taken to remove them. \nIt just goes to show our law enforcement system is in a state of \ncollapse. It is a deliberate plan by the President of the United \nStates, and it is wrong. People need to be aware of it and need to \nstand up to it and I think the American people are beginning to do so.\n  This administration has effectively declared that anyone in the world \nwho illegally gains access to the interior of the United States through \na border, through an airport, through a seaport, is free to illegally \nremain in the United States, free to claim certain tax benefits, free \nto work and take jobs that unemployed Americans need. This deprives \nmillions of Americans of their jobs, wages and represents a dramatic, \nbreathtaking nullification of Federal law.\n  This law enforcement collapse is evident everywhere--872,000 aliens \nhave been ordered removed but haven't left. So we order people removed. \nThey get released on bail or get released in order to remove themselves \nor show up for removal. How many are showing up? Not many. It is called \na catch and release, as has been referred to.\n  There are 872,000--almost 1 million--who at one time or another have \nbeen ordered removed but haven't left, and 68,000 potentially \ndeportable aliens deemed criminal by type were released by immigration \nofficials last year. These were people who were charged with crimes and \nstill didn't leave.\n  The chief of the Border Patrol--this is the guy who runs the border \neffort with his team--predicted a tenfold increase in the presence of \nillegal youth crossing the border between 2011 and 2014. They have been \ntold: Come on down, nothing is going to happen, and it has created more \npeople coming, this lack of enforcement.\n  The Los Angeles Times reports that the number of asylum claims at the \nborders have increased sevenfold since 2009. Well, the administration \ndeveloped a policy of stopping everything. All someone has to do is \nsay, I am claiming asylum, and the whole process stops. Time goes by. \nOften the individuals who claim asylum are released on bail and then \nthey don't leave. We don't know where they go. This is in effect a \npostmodern view of challenging the very idea that we are a nation-state \nwith real borders. Attorney General Holder and Cecilia Munoz, who is \nthe President's Assistant and Director of the Domestic Policy Council, \nwho used to be with La Raza, described amnesty as a civil right. If you \ncome into the country illegally, the Attorney General of the United \nStates declares that these individuals have a civil right to amnesty. \nHow can this possibly be? This is the chief law enforcement officer in \nAmerica?\n\n  Vice President Biden recently said:\n\n       You know, eleven million people live in the shadows. I \n     believe they're already American citizens . . . eleven \n     million undocumented aliens are already Americans.\n\n  Goodness. The Vice President of the United States would make such a \nstatement. It is stunning beyond belief. Apparently, if somebody is \nsupposed to get on an airplane to leave this country because their visa \nis up and then they read the Vice President's statement, they could \njust say: Well, I will just stay. Why should I go back? I would rather \nstay now. I kind of like this place. If I go back, I will have to wait \nin line. I will have to compete within the system like everybody else \nwho comes lawfully. Since I am here, I am not going to leave.\n  Is it any wonder we have more people staying, as the border patrol \nchief said?\n  President Obama made a series of nominations--Mr. Jeh Johnson, the \nhead of Homeland Security, a lawyer at the Department of Defense and a \npolitical campaigner. He heads the Department of Homeland Security, \nwhich is a huge department. He can be counted on to know one thing: He \nis very close to the President, and he is to carry out the President's \nwishes. He doesn't know anything else about running a big, major law \nenforcement operation such as this. Mr. Perez, the former Assistant \nAttorney General at the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, \nwas very active with the pro-amnesty group in Maryland before this. Mr. \nRodriguez, who has been nominated to be the Director of USCIS--they \nwere installed not to be good and smart law enforcement officers but to \neffectuate the President's agenda. You want to know the truth? That is \nthe truth. They were put in there to carry out the agenda, not to carry \nout law enforcement.\n  The morale at Homeland Security is the lowest of any major entity in \nthe U.S. Government. They have actually sued supervisors because they \nare being blocked from enforcing the law as they have taken oath to do.\n  I see my colleagues are here, and I will yield the floor. First, I \nwill conclude by saying that I hope my colleagues will look at this. \nThese facts are not disputed. This is not acceptable. It cannot be that \nthe U.S. Government would carry on its business in this way. It is \ndangerous not only on immigration law but any other law that might come \nup in the future.\n  Presidents cannot, Attorneys General cannot, and Homeland Security \npeople cannot fail to enforce plain law without creating serious damage \nto the great American constitutional legal system that has protected us \nand produced our prosperity.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                                 Amtrak\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I would like to start this afternoon by \nthanking Chairman Murray for her tireless work on the Budget \nCommittee--on which I serve--to develop and pass a bipartisan budget, a \nbudget that sets us on a path to return to regular order.\n  Senator Murray has also been a tireless advocate for transportation \nand infrastructure programs, and as chair of the Transportation, \nHousing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee--on which I also serve--she fought tirelessly \nto include adequate funding for Amtrak back in the fiscal year 2014 \nomnibus and moving forward.\n  The topic I would like to take up today is the role of Amtrak in our \ncountry and our communities and its appropriate role as a central piece \nof\n\n[[Page S2340]]\n\nFederal transportation policy going forward.\n  Senator Murray has been a terrific advocate for investing across a \nwide range of transportation modalities. As a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, I look forward to working with her and our \nleading full committee chair Senator Mikulski to make sure we are \nsuccessful in fighting ardently and steadfastly for Amtrak this year \nand into the future.\n  I come to talk on the floor today about the importance of our \nnational passenger rail system--Amtrak--because this is not just about \ngetting people from point A to point B. Investing in Amtrak also means \ncreating jobs, making our whole economy more dynamic, and making \nAmerica more competitive.\n  Amtrak is performing better and better each and every year. As the \nPresiding Officer knows all too well, ridership over the last decade \nhas steadily increased. In fact, 10 of the last 11 years have seen \nrecord numbers, and last year we broke through 31.6 million riders on \nAmtrak. The trains are more and more crowded, but they are arriving \nmore and more frequently on time and the quality of the train sets and \nthe quality of the service provided by the conductors and the other \nfolks who work for Amtrak has steadily increased.\n  As the value proposition of Amtrak has increased, so has ridership. \nRecord ticket sales and other revenues have made this possible. Today \nAmtrak covers nearly 89 percent of the cost of operating their trains, \nwhich is by far the best of any passenger rail operation in the United \nStates. They are, in fact, on track to cover 90 percent, through \nrevenues, of their total operating costs in 2014. Because of this \nsuccess, since 2002 Amtrak has decreased its debt by more than half.\n  My home State of Delaware and the Presiding Officer's home State of \nNew Jersey are part of one of the oldest and most critical sections of \nour national passenger rail system, the so-called Northeast corridor, \nwhich goes from Boston to Washington. If it were its own separate \neconomy, the Northeast corridor would produce $3 trillion a year--21 \npercent of our Nation's total economic output--which would make it the \nfifth largest economy in the world if it were on its own. But it is \nnot. It is an integrated part of our Nation, and its passenger rail \ninfrastructure is an integrated part of our national commitment to \nefficient and effective transportation.\n  In this region in particular, Amtrak is not a luxury; it is a \nfundamental and critical part of our economy and moving our community \nand our people forward. If Amtrak service were cut off in the region \nfor just a day, it would cost our economy $13 million. One-third of all \nthe jobs in the Northeast corridor--or 7 million jobs--are within 5 \nmiles of a station.\n  Amtrak's impact on my home State of Delaware is particularly large \nbecause Amtrak employs over 1,000 men and women in the State of \nDelaware. Many of them work at two maintenance facilities--Wilmington \nand Bear--where they repair everything from train seats to the heavy \ntrucks to the cars themselves. I have had a chance to visit them on a \nnumber of occasions. It is incredible to see the work ethic and \ncapabilities of the men and women of Amtrak. These shops have been \nthere for a long time. They have worked hard to modernize, to be \nrelevant, and to contribute to the strengthening bottom line of Amtrak \noverall.\n  I would like to mention ``Irish'' John, who is a good friend of mine \nand has been a leader for the sheet metal workers for a long time. \nSheet metal workers with Amtrak were one of the unions that worked with \nmanagement to find ways to significantly save costs on overhaul work on \nAcela train sets, which resulted in Amtrak choosing not to farm out \ntheir service work and instead do a $125 million job to overhaul 20 \nAcela sets in-house. This is union labor, and this helps support good \nmiddle-wage jobs. This helps support good middle-class families and \nmiddle-class communities in Delaware and our region. This particular \nwork on this Acela overhaul will last more than 3\\1/2\\ years and \nsustain dozens of jobs at our Bear repair facility.\n  My friend Bill, who is with the IBEW Amtrak union, is another friend \nwho has helped me understand the critical role of the employment Amtrak \nprovides to our whole region--not just to Delaware, not just to the \nPhiladelphia area, but to the whole Northeast corridor.\n  When we talk about investing in Amtrak, we are not only investing in \nnew options for commuters and businesses, we are talking about \ninvesting in our communities and in workers who will build and maintain \nthe next generation of American rail. As I said, these are great, high-\nskilled jobs. By investing in Amtrak's present and giving them a \npredictable future, we will preserve and continue these important \nskills and these important workers and their families in our \ncommunities.\n  Amtrak's benefits go beyond just the immediate skilled workers and \ntheir families and the communities that benefit from them.\n  In Delaware, the services Amtrak provides help to keep and draw in \nnew businesses through a ripple effect in our whole economy. Last week \nthere was an announcement of a new company that is spinning off out of \nSallie Mae that will be locating its headquarters and 120 jobs in \nWilmington. They have chosen a site specifically because it is walking \ndistance from our Amtrak station--from the Joseph R. Biden Amtrak \nStation in Wilmington, DE.\n  In Newark, the University of Delaware is building a new campus called \nthe Science, Technology and Advanced Research--STAR--Campus, which will \nbuild partnerships between several important entities, such as the \nThomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia and the Aberdeen Proving \nGround in Maryland. What makes that partnership possible is the \nbackbone of the Northeast corridor--the connection between these \ndifferent cities that has made all of us stronger and better because of \npassenger rail.\n  I hope from these few examples it is clear that passenger rail is \nalso a critical component of economic development. Passenger rail tends \nto link downtown urban areas and tends to be absolutely central to \nanchoring their revitalization, as the Presiding Officer knows so well.\n  Passenger rail is also critical not just in the Northeast corridor \nbut in communities across the country that rely on it to connect with \nother communities and our country's major economic centers.\n  State-supported services have become a major source of ridership \ngrowth for Amtrak as well, with that ridership nearly doubling between \n1998 and 2013.\n  Long-distance ridership across the great heartland of our country has \nalso grown by roughly 20 percent without the introduction of any new \nservices, frequencies, or equipment. In fiscal year 2013, long-distance \nridership reached its highest point in 20 years.\n  However, we are at the proverbial crossroads--or I suppose I should \nsay crossing--now because ridership is soaring, Amtrak is more popular \nthan ever before, and demand will continue to grow, but we are not \nkeeping up with the investment in infrastructure that we need to \nsustain this growth into the future.\n  For instance, right now there is nearly $6 billion in outdated, \ndelayed investments that need to be made just in the Northeast corridor \nto bring it to what is called a state of good repair. I will focus on a \nfew of the critical infrastructure needs in the Northeast corridor, but \nthere are also needs across the country.\n  Baltimore is a city I traveled through this morning on my way to this \nCapitol on the Amtrak train. In Baltimore, Senator Mikulski's home \nState, the B tunnels have stayed open since 1873. Although they have \nundergone periodic repairs, none of them were built to be permanent. We \ncan't be competitive if we continue to rely on tunnels that have been \naround since roughly the time of our own Civil War. We need to invest \nin modernizing this infrastructure.\n  Between the Presiding Officer's home State of New Jersey and the \ngreat State of New York, preliminary planning is underway on the \nGateway Tunnel, which is a critical tunnel that will ease the \nbottleneck under the Hudson that causes delays throughout the whole \nregion, limits the options of travelers, and ends up costing the \neconomy more in the short and long run. We need to invest in our \ninfrastructure.\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n\n  In Delaware, we have a bottleneck around our most popular station, \nthe Joseph R. Biden Station in Wilmington. The rail lines north and \nsouth of that station slim from three lines to two, restricting service \nand preventing the addition of new rail service. Thanks in part to a \nFederal high-speed rail grant, construction will soon be underway to \nadd a third track to alleviate this critical chokepoint, the main one \njust south of the station. Without new investment, that chokepoint will \ncontinue north of the station.\n  And that is not to mention the hundreds of bridges and tunnels and \nother connection points--including the overhead centenary lines--that \nrequire repair and replacement on the Northeast corridor alone. We need \nto invest in our infrastructure not just in the Northeast corridor but \nacross this whole country. We do spend a lot of time here on this \nfloor, as we should, talking about our Nation's fiscal deficit and \ndebt, but we should also focus on our physical deficit and debt--the \ndelayed repair of critical pieces of infrastructure that we rely on for \nour economy and for our communities but that we are not focused on.\n  If we invest in our infrastructure today, it will employ people in \nrepairing it and lay the groundwork for improvement of our economy over \nthe long term. I recognize the reality that while the budget picture \nhas improved, it is not yet as good as it should be. We are still \nfacing real fiscal challenges.\n  I ride between Wilmington and Washington nearly every day on Amtrak, \nand our workers are responsible for repairing and retrofitting a lot of \nthe trains on which I ride. I am impressed with their skill and the \ncaliber of their repair work. As a rider and our State Senator, I see \nhow critical Amtrak is to our economy, our communities, and to our \ncountry as a whole. I hope that is clear to the rest of the Members of \nthis Chamber.\n  I hope that anyone watching who has appreciated the value of Amtrak's \nconnecting power that links this country together from east to west and \nnorth to south will communicate with their Senator and convey the \nimportance of strong and sustained investment in the Northeast \ncorridor, yes, but across the whole reach of our country. Only by \nstrengthening Amtrak and ensuring the vibrancy of the entire Nation's \nsystem of passenger rail can we really ensure that American rail will \nbe there for years and generations to come.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today, as I have \nrepeatedly since the health care law has been passed, with concerns I \nhave and to share some information with the Senate because of my \nconcerns that in order to help some people who did not have insurance, \nI am afraid we have hurt many people who did have insurance, did have \ncare they liked. The President continued to focus on coverage, and I \nhave more concerns, as a doctor, about people actually getting care, \ngetting health care, the care they need from a doctor they choose at \nlower costs.\n  So I come to the floor today to talk about a new story out this \nmorning, actually in the Huffington Post, called ``How Obamacare Leaves \nSome Patients Without Doctors.''\n  I recall how the President had said: If you like your policy, you can \nkeep your policy. He said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your \ndoctor. Yet we are hearing stories from all around the country of \npeople who have found that not to be true.\n  I have heard the majority leader come to the floor and say in a \nstatement that so many stories are lies, they are made up. But I will \ntell you that this morning, in this publication, there is a lengthy \nstory of several patients in California who have had pain, problems, \nmedical concerns, signed up for insurance, and, as a result, have found \nout they have insurance, they have coverage, but they cannot find care.\n  So I would like to share with the Senate today a story, and it has \nsome of the concerns I raised during the debate and the discussion of \nthe health care law. But the Speaker of the House at the time, Nancy \nPelosi, from California--the State where this happened--said: First you \nhave to pass it before you get to find out what is in it. Well, now \npeople all across the country are finding out what is in it, and they \nare finding out they are terribly disappointed and they feel they have \nbeen sold a bill of goods and they are getting stuck with a bill, and \nthey are finding out it is not very good for them.\n  The report in this morning's Huffington Post starts out:\n\n       In January, a doctor told [Ms.] Friedlander, who was \n     suffering from excruciating lower back pain, that she needed \n     surgery to remove part of a severely herniated disc.\n\n  Well, she had Blue Shield insurance, as they report, through Covered \nCalifornia, which is California's version of ObamaCare, and she planned \nto use that coverage to pay for the operation. It makes sense.\n  This is what happened. It says:\n\n       But when she started to call surgeons covered by Blue \n     Shield, she ran into a roadblock. Surgeons who were covered \n     by her insurance--\n\n  amazingly--\n\n     operated out of hospitals no longer covered by her insurance. \n     . . .\n\n  So if the surgeon was covered, the hospital was not or, vice versa, \nshe could find a hospital that would cover her surgery but could not \nfind a surgeon who was covered by her insurance that was on the staff \nof that hospital.\n  It says:\n\n       [Ms.] Friedlander spent days on the phone, hours on hold, \n     making dozens of calls across Southern California, trying to \n     match a surgeon with a hospital that would both be covered. \n     In total, she reached out to 20 [different] surgeons and five \n     [different] hospitals.\n       ``No one could help me. Some expressed sympathy,'' \n     Friedlander, 40, told The Huffington Post in an email. ``They \n     told me, `I'm so sorry--it's all just so new. You're a victim \n     of the changes. No one knows what they're doing.' ''\n\n  So what we have here is a victim of the Obama health care legislation \nbecause first we had to pass it before we get to find out what is in \nit.\n\n       Unable to match a hospital and a surgeon that were both \n     covered, [Ms.] Friedlander started haggling between doctors \n     for a cash price for the surgery. She chose a surgeon who \n     wasn't covered by her insurance but who operated in a \n     hospital that was covered.\n\n  Because she could not, with her insurance, get both the hospital and \nthe doctor.\n\n       She expects her insurance to pay the hospital bill, but she \n     had to pay her surgeon's bill herself.\n\n  All out of her own pocket.\n  The article goes on to report:\n\n       . . . nationwide, about 70 percent of Obamacare plans--\n\n  About 70 percent of the plans purchased on the Obama health care \nlaw--\n\n     offer fewer hospitals and doctors than employer-sponsored \n     group plans or pre-ACA individual market plans, according to \n     a study by consulting firm KcKinsey & Company released in \n     December. This narrowed number of doctors and hospitals is \n     what [Ms.] Friedlander encountered when trying to match a \n     surgeon and hospital that would both be covered.\n\n  What we are hearing today is that about 70 percent of ObamaCare plans \noffer fewer hospitals, fewer doctors, in spite of the President's \npromise to the American people that if you like your doctor, you can \nkeep your doctor; if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\n  Now, Covered California says they are aware of the problem. A \nspokesman for the group--a senior medical adviser with the ObamaCare \nplan in California--says:\n\n       We understand that some people are having trouble getting \n     access to the doctors and hospitals they need. And we're \n     working very hard to fix [that] as fast as we can.\n\n  Well, perhaps if people had actually read the law, understood what \nwas in it, they would have seen this coming.\n  The President said your insurance premiums would drop. He said \nfamilies would save $2,500 a family. But the article says:\n\n       To make up for ACA costs and keep premiums low, Blue Shield \n     asked its doctors\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\n     and hospitals to accept payments from the insurer at rates \n     [well] reduced--\n\n  Reduced from what they normally got--\n\n     reduced [by] up to 30 percent.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Not surprisingly, some doctors and hospitals rejected Blue \n     Shield's reduced payment rates and decided not to re-sign \n     contracts with the insurer. At least three major Los Angeles \n     hospitals previously covered by Blue Shield--\n\n  And, Madam President, I will tell you, these are first-class \nhospitals, these are highly thought-of hospitals, hospitals with \nincredibly good reputations.\n\n       . . . three major Los Angeles hospitals previously covered \n     by Blue Shield--UCLA--\n\n  The University of California-Los Angeles--\n\n       Cedars Sinai and Good Samaritan--have opted out of the \n     insurer's new network. . . .\n       According to [the communications manager from Blue Shield], \n     Blue Shield of California now has about 40 percent fewer \n     physicians and 25 percent fewer hospitals in its network than \n     last year.\n\n  You listen to what is happening, and they talk about the significant \ngaps occurring in California.\n  These are the concerns I hear about when I go home to Wyoming every \nweekend. These are the concerns I heard about this past weekend in \nCasper, in Douglas, in Riverton, in Thermopolis, and in Newcastle \ntraveling around the State. People are not able to keep their \ninsurance. They are not able to keep their doctors. It is happening all \nacross the country, and we see this story out of California today.\n  The interesting part of the issue with California is that--the \narticle goes on and they talk to an insurance agent in Sacramento who \nsays: `` . . . people who already had insurance''--`` . . . people who \nalready had insurance''--``especially healthy, young people, may be \npaying more under Covered California''--``may be paying more''; not \nwhat the President promised--``for fewer hospitals and doctors.''\n  That is not what the intent of the health care law was but it is what \nthe health care law has delivered.\n  This is what is happening to real people, real families, all across \nthe country. The majority leader says: false, made up, whole cloth. But \nI will tell you, these stories will continue to occur.\n  It is interesting, in today's article in the Huffington Post it says:\n\n       And when signing up for a plan, it's difficult to determine \n     which doctors and hospitals are still covered.\n\n  They are talking about California now. The article says, quoting an \ninsurance agent in California:\n\n       ``You can sign up on Covered California and think you're \n     totally fine, only to find out later that you're totally \n     hosed''. . . .\n\n  This man, David Fear, goes on to say:\n\n       Specialist doctors, such as surgeons, ob-gyns and \n     urologists, declined Blue Cross and Blue Shield's lower \n     payments most frequently. Fear estimates that about two-\n     thirds of Blue Cross and Blue Shield's specialists have opted \n     out of the networks.\n\n  It is not just that one patient whom I talked about. There is, like \nMs. Friedlander, Ruth Iorio, a 35-year-old new mother from Los Angeles. \nShe is struggling to find the care she needs in Blue Shield's smaller \nnetwork.\n\n       She signed up for Blue Shield through Covered California in \n     November because the Covered California website listed her \n     hospital--\n\n  The Web site, the President's Web site, the Covered California Web \nsite--\n\n     listed her hospital, UCLA, as accepting Blue Shield. . . .\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       However, after Iorio gave birth in December, she was told \n     that her ob-gyn at UCLA was not covered by her insurance. So \n     she paid out of pocket.\n       Iorio has not been able to find a urologist for her son or \n     an ob-gyn who is both covered by her insurance and practicing \n     in a hospital that is covered.\n\n  The President said: You can keep your hospital, you can keep your \ndoctor, you can keep your plan.\n\n       She's called over a dozen doctors who are covered by her \n     insurance, and each has told her that if she or her son needs \n     an operation in the hospitals the doctor contracts with, it \n     won't be covered.\n\n  So even if they get a doctor who is under their plan, they cannot go \nto a hospital to get actually a procedure done.\n  As this lady says:\n\n       ``My insurance is pretty useless. And I'm not fussy about \n     what doctor I see,'' Iorio said. ``I don't know what to do. I \n     may just drop it for myself and keep my son on it. It's \n     really depressing.''\n\n  It is really depressing what the President and the Democrats have \nforced down the throat of the American people with this health care \nlaw.\n  The article continues:\n\n       Before joining Covered California, Iorio had an individual \n     Blue Shield plan that was cheaper than what she now pays and \n     that gave her wider access to doctors and hospitals.\n\n  Cheaper, wider access. Exactly what the President had promised her is \nexactly what this woman has lost because of the health care law.\n  She goes on and says:\n\n       ``I'm paying $500 a month and every doctor I'm calling is \n     saying, `No, I can't see you,' '' she said. ``I feel like a \n     second-class citizen.''\n\n  Is that what the President's health care law is all about: making \npeople feel like second-class citizens, hearing from folks when they \ncall and ask for help that, sorry, you are just a victim of the Obama \nhealth care law--a nation of more and more victims? It does seem, as \nyou look around the country, for those who have been helped, we should \nnot have had to hurt this many people because of a law the American \npeople said ``we do not want'' and was forced, on single-party lines, \ndown the throats of the American people.\n  This law is bad for patients. We have seen that today. It continues \nto be bad for providers--the nurses, the doctors, who take care of \nthose patients--and it is terrible for taxpayers. Tax rates will \ncontinue to go up. Taxes are continuing to go up as a result of the \nhealth care law and the expenses related to it. It has failed \nrepeatedly in dealing with the needs of the American people, who knew \nwhat they wanted in the first place, which was they wanted the care \nthey need from a doctor they choose at lower costs. Instead, they got \nthis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n   Thomasina Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of S. \n1074, the Thomasina Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal \nRecognition Act of 2013. This is a bill granting Federal recognition to \nsix Indian tribes. The bill has recently been reported out of the \nSenate Committee on Indian Affairs, and I want to thank Chairman \nTester, the former chairwoman, Senator Cantwell, and all members of the \nCommittee for this action.\n  These six Indian tribes--the Chickahominy, Chickahominy Eastern \nDivision, Upper Mattaponi, Rappahannock, Monacan, and Nansemond--are \namong the best known tribes in American history, but they have never \nreceived Federal recognition. Madam President, 566 tribes have received \nFederal recognition--the vast majority by congressional action--but \nthese tribes have not been recognized.\n  The story of these tribes and why they have never been recognized is \nwhy I take the floor.\n  It is an amazing story but it is also a deeply tragic story. But the \ntragedy can be redeemed if Congress acts to correct a gross historical \ninjustice that has deprived these tribes of their rightful place. This \nis about a full accounting of our past, but it is also about a fair and \ntruthful recognition of living people who have maintained their own \ntribal identity, customs, and traditions against unbelievable odds for \nhundreds of years.\n  The English settlers who arrived at Jamestown in 1607 established a \nsettlement on an island, on land that was already under the control of \nthe Powhatan Indians. The Powhatan Indians were a confederation of \nnumerous Eastern Algonquian Indian tribes who had organized in the \nChesapeake region.\n  The interaction among these Powhatan Indians and these six tribes \nthat were part of this Powhatan Confederacy and the English is known to \nvirtually every American. The original settlement of England in the \nUnited States was on the verge of failure numerous times and had to be \nrescued by a commoner who was part of that group, John Smith.\n  Only John Smith could keep this little settlement alive. Early after \nthe arrival of the English, John Smith was captured by the Powhatan \nIndians and was on the verge of being executed by\n\n[[Page S2343]]\n\nChief Powhatan because they were unsure about what they thought of \nthese English settlers. In this wonderful story, as he was about to be \nexecuted, Pocahontas, the daughter of Chief Powhatan, saved his life. \nBy saving his life, that act paved the way for the survival of this \nvery struggling colony. That colony then grew into English-speaking \nAmerica, as we know, with the arrival of later groups of English at \nPlymouth Rock and thereafter.\n  That act by Pocahontas is known to virtually all Americans. Over the \ncourse of the next few decades, they went back and forth in the \nrelationship between these tribes and the English colonists and then \nbetween these tribes and African slaves. The first Africans who came to \nthe new world also came to Jamestown Island in 1619.\n  But after Pocahontas' act, it was generally a peaceful relationship. \nThere were some times of hostility, but in treaties in the 1640s and \nthen again in a final treaty in 1677, the Treaty of the Middle \nPlantation, the Powhatan Confederacy and these six tribes basically \nsaid to their English colonist neighbors: We want to live in peace with \nyou.\n  Pocahontas got married to John Rolfe, an English tobacco planter. \nThat was a seminal event in early Virginia colonial history. So by the \n1680s, 75 years after the settlement of Jamestown Island, the Powhatan \nConfederation was no more. But these Virginia Indians continued to live \nand maintain their tribal identity, but they lived in complete peace \nwith the settlers that were their neighbors. The Treaty of Middle \nPlantation was signed 100 hundred years before the Declaration of \nIndependence. That peace that was made between the Indians and the \nsettlers paved the way for modern Virginia and modern English-speaking \nAmerica. It has been continuous since 1677--the peace of these tribes. \nThe relations between Virginians and the tribes have been strong. They \nhave endured significant adversity. Their numbers of population have \ndwindled from 25,000 down to about 3,000 or 4,000 enrolled tribal \nmembers today. They converted to the religion of the English settlers, \nChristianity. They fought as American patriots in every war this \ncountry has been in, from the Revolutionary War to the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. They faced discrimination as Indians, often kept out of \nschools in Virginia because of the color of their skin, because they \nwere not deemed to be ``Caucasian'' by State leaders at the time.\n  But the relationship is a peaceful one, and these tribes still exist. \nTwo tribes in Virginia have small reservations, and the other tribes \nown land in common. They have tribal churches, tribal cemeteries, and \ncommunity centers where they still gather. There is a wonderful \ntradition if you are the Governor of Virginia. On the day before \nThanksgiving Day every year, the Virginia tribes come to the Governor's \nmansion and they present to the Governor deer, turkey, fish, and gifts \nas a tribute to the peaceful relationship between these tribes and the \nCommonwealth of Virginia since 1677. It was a beautiful aspect of my \ntime as Governor. It was something we looked forward to every year. The \nmembers of these tribes look forward to it as well. Tribal members who \nhave moved all across the country and all across the world come home \nfor a homecoming, and it begins at the Virginia Governor's mansion.\n  Now I get to the injustice. The interactions between these Indians \nand the first English settlers is known to everybody--that story about \nPocahontas and John Smith, and then Pocahontas' wedding to John Rolfe \nand her moving to England and dying there. You can go to Pocahontas' \ngrave at Gravesend, which is where the Thames River dumps into the sea. \nShe died coming back to Virginia. The English tend her grave with \nreverence at a small Episcopal church in that seaside community.\n  This is the most archetypal story of the interaction between European \nsettlers and the Indians who were our native inhabitants. But despite \nthe importance of this interaction, despite the fact that the tribes \nhave lived and maintained their existence intact since before the \nsettlers arrived here, the tribes have never been recognized along with \nthe 566 tribes who have.\n  Why? Why have they never been recognized? Well, unbelievably, the \nfirst reason they have not been recognized is: They made peace too \nsoon. They made peace with the English. If they had waited until 1780 \nand made peace with the Americans, that treaty, a treaty with the \nAmericans, would have been the basis immediately for Federal \nrecognition. But they became peaceful too soon with their European \nneighbors.\n  Tribal recognition often begins with a treaty. But the treaties are \ntreaties with the American government. All historians acknowledge that \nthe treaties of 1646 and 1677 happened. There are copies of the \ntreaties. The originals are still maintained. All acknowledge that \nthese treaties and the Indians' decision to live in peace with their \nneighbors was a precondition for the modern Virginia. If there had not \nbeen peace, our history may well have been very different.\n  I will tell you something else. These treaties are recognized by a \ngovernment, the English government. When our tribes, which have never \nbeen recognized by the United States go to visit England, they are \ngiven a royal welcome and treated as the sovereign people they are by \nthe government with which they made a treaty in 1646 and 1677. So that \nwas the first ``mistake'' that was made: These tribes made peace too \nquickly.\n\n  There is a second mistake that is in some ways even more difficult to \nacknowledge. Many of these tribes live in six counties in Virginia. \nFive of the county courthouses where all their birth, death, and \nmarriage records were stored were burnt during the Civil War. But there \nwere still some records that existed--some.\n  But in a bizarre bit of our 20th century history, Virginia passed a \nlaw, the Racial Integrity Act, in the 1920s. Under a misguided and \nbizarre notion of ``racial purity,'' the eugenics movement, State \nofficials determined that you were either white or you were colored. \nThere was no such thing as an Indian. The leader of the State Bureau of \nVital Statistics, a man named Walter Plecker--this is well documented--\nsadly held the position of head of the Bureau of Vital Statistics from \n1924 to 1967, 41 years.\n  Remaining records such as they were in that 41-year period, he \nundertook what is known in Virginia as the ``paper genocide.'' He \nsystematically went into every remaining record he could find and \nrecharacterized anybody who had claimed a descent and a tribal \nconnection as an Indian to ``colored.'' Records were destroyed or \naltered in a very significant way.\n  Both of these reasons have made tribal recognition through the BIA \nprocess--the Bureau of Indian Affairs--very difficult. Of the 566 \ntribes that have been recognized, only about one-fifth have gone \nthrough the administrative process. That process usually requires heavy \ndocumentation.\n  But the treaty was with the wrong government, and the birth, death, \nand marriage records were destroyed because of a racist State policy \nand the burning of courthouses during the Civil War. These six tribes \nshould be rewarded, not punished, for making peace with their neighbors \nin the 1640s and 1670s, and they should not be held back because of a \nhorribly misguided State policy that stripped them of the means to \neasily demonstrate by paper what all historians acknowledge to exist--\nthe continuous history of these tribes.\n  We started, in Virginia, to correct this in the 1980s. In 1983, \nVirginia began a process of State recognition of all of these tribes. \nThe six tribes have all been recognized by the State in the 1980s. All \ntribes that are part of this bill are now recognized by Virginia.\n  A full effort to finally receive Federal recognition began in 1999, \nsupported overwhelmingly by all Virginians, including the current \nentire Virginia congressional delegation, Democratic and Republican, \nHouse and Senate, and all 10 living Virginia Governors. Recognition \nbills have passed out of the House for these tribes twice. In the 112th \nCongress, a bill passed out of the House and then came to the Senate, \nand it passed out of the Senate committee, only to die because of \ninaction on the Senate floor.\n  It is my deep hope that the 113th Congress will finally see the \nrealization of this long-held dream. We should pass this bill because \nit is right. These tribes exist. They still live in Virginia\n\n[[Page S2344]]\n\nand uphold their tribal traditions. They deserve to have their \nexistence acknowledged just like the hundreds of other tribes in this \ncountry.\n  But there is a final reason why recognition has a very immediate \nimportance to these Virginia tribes. If you walked 3 blocks from here \ndown the Mall, you arrive at the National Museum of the American \nIndian. It is part of the Smithsonian, America's National Museum. The \nSmithsonian is every bit as much a part of our American Government as \nCongress is.\n  It is a marvelous museum. It tells the story of our Indian tribes and \ntheir amazing history of adversity and triumph. The Smithsonian \ncurators recognize what Congress has failed to do. Go to the second \nfloor. There is a permanent exhibit on the second floor of the museum. \nThe title of the exhibit is, ``Return to a Native Place: Algonquian \nPeoples of Chesapeake.'' That permanent exhibit in the museum, with the \nplastic dioramas, highlights the Powhatan tribes that are the subject \nof this bill.\n  Here is how the museum describes the permanent exhibit dedicated to \nthese tribes:\n\n       Thru photos, maps, ceremonial and everyday objects, this \n     display provides an overview of the history of the Native \n     Peoples of the Chesapeake region from the 1600's to the \n     present day.\n\n  So we do recognize these tribes--in a museum. We acknowledge that \nthey are not just a part of history, but in the words of the museum \ndisplay description, that the people continue to maintain their tribal \nidentity to the present day. But while we recognize the tribes in the \nmuseum three blocks from the Capitol, we will not, we have not, and we \ndo not yet recognize these tribes in law.\n  Finally, the failure to recognize these tribes in law has an unusual \nand very tragic consequence. It also deals with the Smithsonian. There \nis another department in the Smithsonian that is far out of the prying \neyes of tourists on the mall. It is the warehouse of the Smithsonian \nwhere they hold remains of archaeological exhibits. They hold all kinds \nof remains and all kinds of artifacts from archaeological exhibits from \nall over the United States and all over the world.\n  One set of remains that the Smithsonian is holding is the bones of \nabout 1,400 Virginia Indians that were disturbed and unburied during \nthe course of archaeological expeditions in Virginia.\n  The tribes that we are talking about today, the bones of their \nancestors are held in a warehouse by the Smithsonian. For years, these \ntribes have gone respectfully to the Smithsonian, and they have asked \nthem: Please return to us the bones of our ancestors. We want to bury \nthe bones of our ancestors in accord with our tribal customs. We want \nto rebury the bones of our ancestors in accord with the customs of \nChristianity, which we embraced under the tutelage of the English \nsettlers. But the Smithsonian will not return these bones to the \ntribes. It seems like such a reasonable request. It seems so \nreasonable, but the Smithsonian will not return the bones of these \ntribes for one reason: They are not federally recognized. The law \ngoverning the antiquities and objects held by the Smithsonian leads the \nSmithsonian to conclude that they can't give these bones back for \nreburial unless the tribes are federally recognized.\n\n  Our great national museum recognizes the tribes in a great display \nbehind plastic glass and talks about these tribes, but at the same time \nwe recognize them for one purpose, we will not hand the bones back to \nthese folks in a manner they deserve.\n  To conclude, it is long past time that these tribes receive the \ntribal recognition that hundreds of other tribes have received. It is \nlong past time that these tribes be accorded the same respect in \nAmerica--for which they fought since the Revolutionary War--that they \nreceive in England when they go visit. It is long past time that the \nbones of these Powhatan ancestors be returned to Virginia so that they \ncan be buried by their families in the only land they ever knew as \nhome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Rwanda and Syria\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Today we commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Rwandan \ngenocide. This week, again and again, I will rise to remind my \ncolleagues and fellow citizens of the humanity we share and appeal to \ntheir conscience about the mass atrocities the Assad regime is \nperpetrating in Syria.\n  This past Sunday the world joined Rwanda in marking 20 years since \nthe beginning of the genocide that claimed the lives of more than \n800,000 innocent men, women, and children. As we reflect on our \nfailures to stop the genocide there, I can't help but think of the \nlessons we learned from Rwanda and those we didn't.\n  President Obama stated in his remarks on Sunday that the Rwandan \ngenocide was ``neither an accident nor unavoidable. . . . The genocide \nwe remember today--and the world's failure to respond more quickly--\nreminds us that we always have a choice. In the face of hatred, we must \nremember the humanity we share. In the face of cruelty, we must choose \ncompassion. In the face of intolerance and suffering, we must never be \nindifferent.'' I couldn't agree more with the President of the United \nStates.\n  The United States, along with the international community, failed to \ntake the necessary action to prevent a tragedy in Rwanda. We chose to \nignore the death of hundreds of thousands of people, and in so doing we \nforsook our humanity. And now we are dangerously close to doing the \nsame in Syria.\n  While I would like to believe that ``never again'' means something in \nthis context, I look around the world today, and I am haunted by the \nfact that we simply haven't learned the fundamental lesson from Rwanda \nthat preventing the slaughter of innocents means taking hard political \naction.\n  Nowhere is this truer than in Syria, where President Bashar Assad's \nregime continues its brutal assault against the Syrian people with \nincreasing ferocity. The slaughter of innocent men, women, and children \nis being carried out by Syria's national army and loyal paramilitaries \nas a result of state policy, and the terror continues to escalate every \nday that Assad's crimes go unpunished.\n  The regime has accelerated attacks against civilians by \nindiscriminately dropping barbaric barrel bombs on mosques, schools, \nand bakeries, systematically detaining, torturing, and killing \nthousands of people--including hundreds of children--and starving \nentire neighborhoods to death. It was over 5 months ago that Secretary \nJohn Kerry wrote that ``the world must act quickly'' to stop a ``war of \nstarvation'' being waged by Assad's regime against ``huge portions of \nthe population.'' Yet the world did nothing, and hundreds have died of \nstarvation--thousands--in those 5 months.\n  Eventually the international community responded by passing \nresolution 2139 through the U.N. Security Council, which ordered the \nregime to promptly allow unhindered humanitarian access and threatened \nfurther consequences for noncompliance. This was 2 months ago, and yet \nagain the world did nothing to back the resolution. In fact, the U.N. \nhumanitarian coordinator, Valerie Amos, reports that the war of \nstarvation has worsened since its passing. The number of Syrians cut \noff from aid since January has grown by over 1 million people. The \nSyrian Government continues to prevent supplies of food from entering \nopposition-held areas, in direct contravention of the U.N. resolution, \nand it is using U.S.-provided humanitarian aid as leverage in its war \nagainst the people. Meanwhile, Iran sends 30,000 tons of food supplies \nto Assad's regime. While children starve throughout Syria, the \ngovernment is at least well fed.\n  Although 800,000 people have not been slaughtered in mere months, as \nwas the case in Rwanda, over the course of 3 years of conflict in \nSyria, we have witnessed 9 million people forced from their homes, with \n2.5 million refugees escaping the violence in neighboring countries, \nand an estimated 150,000 people dead, with casualties escalating daily.\n  Regardless of the scale or scope, one fact is clear: The world is \nwatching genocide in slow motion, but it seems that regardless of how \nmany innocent men, women, and children die in Syria,\n\n[[Page S2345]]\n\nthe world's conscience will not be tipped.\n  What is happening in Syria should be an affront to our conscience, \nand it should be a call to action. Each day the media floods our \nnewspapers and television screens with some gruesome and horrific \nevidence of Assad's war crimes. We cannot claim ignorance as we have in \nthe past. Yet we do nothing. It is as if watching all the suffering and \nsimply feeling bad about it has become an adequate moral response. \nConventional wisdom tells us that this is because the American public \nis war-weary. We are scarred by our experience in Afghanistan and Iraq \nand thus unwilling to get involved in another conflict in the Middle \nEast.\n  This sentiment is reinforced by the President, who prides himself on \nhaving opposed the war on Iraq and getting America out of the region as \nquickly as possible regardless of the ramifications. He has emphasized \nthe need to ``contain'' the conflict in Syria, calling it a ``civil \nwar'' and neglecting the dangerous spillover effects we are already \nwitnessing, including the destabilization of all of Syria's neighbors \nand the growth of an Al Qaeda safe haven in eastern Syria and western \nIraq.\n  Following the President's lead, the American public has largely \napplauded his restraint and opposed greater U.S. involvement in Syria. \nBut in so doing we have again failed the legacy of Rwanda.\n  Stopping the slaughter in Syria will require difficult political \naction, but it is not only profoundly in our national interest to act \nbut also our moral obligation to do so. In his remarks on Sunday, \nPresident Obama said that we should be reminded of ``our obligations to \nour fellow man.'' As President, he is the one who should be showing to \nthe American people why it is so vital to our national interest to \ncarry out our moral obligations to our fellow man.\n  Our policy should be determined by the realities of the moment, not \nby today's isolationism dictated by the past. The wars in Afghanistan \nand Iraq have nothing to do with how we carry out our responsibilities \ntoday. Let there be no mistake; we have a responsibility to stop \ngenocide when we see it happening, as in Syria. ``Never again'' should \nmean something whether or not we are paralyzed by war-weariness.\n  Of course we would all like to see the slaughter of Syria's innocent \nmen, women, and children be stopped by diplomacy and through nonviolent \nmeans. We all want an end to the violence. We all want to believe that \na political solution is possible. But there are only two ways to end \nthe violence. One is for all parties to put down their weapons--\nsomething President Bashar Assad and his Iranian partners are clearly \nunwilling to do, as they believe a military solution is possible. So \nthat leaves us with only one other option: to neutralize the party \ndedicated to the slaughter of innocents and force them to put down \ntheir guns. There are options to achieve this goal that fall far short \nof putting boots on the ground. We do not need to concede and allow \ngenocide to continue or to go to war to prevent it. There are steps in \nbetween that the United States, along with our international partners, \ncan take to stand by our international commitments and guarantees of \nprotection.\n  President Assad has already shown that U.N. resolutions mean nothing \nto him and that he has no intention of negotiating his departure \nthrough the Geneva process. It is clear that military pressure is the \nonly lever that will convince Assad that a political solution is in his \nfavor. We must be ready to prove to Assad that not achieving a \ndiplomatic solution will cost his regime dearly, and there are \nmeaningful actions we can take to help in Syria that will not require \nus to rerun the war in Iraq. It is not a question of options or \ncapabilities, it is a question of will.\n  There is a famous quote that states, ``All tyranny needs to gain a \nfoothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent.'' As we sit \nback and place our hopes on negotiations and meaningless guarantees of \nprotection, we watch as hundreds of innocent men, women, and children \nare brutally slaughtered every day; reinvigorated Al Qaeda affiliates \noperate with more freedom than ever before; terrorist groups loyal to \nIran proliferate and threaten our allies; and the region descends into \nchaos and turmoil that will inevitably reverberate in the United States \nof America. This is the price we will pay for choosing to remain \ndisengaged, and the consequences to U.S. national interests will be \nfelt.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two articles. \nOne is a Reuters story entitled ``Assad says fighting largely over by \nend of year,'' a statement by a former Russian Prime Minister with a \nquote:\n\n       Assad's strength now lies in the fact that, unlike \n     Yanukovich, he has practically no internal enemies. He has a \n     consolidated, cleansed team.\n\n  The second is ``Hezbollah confident in Assad, West resigned to Syria \nstalemate.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From Reuters, Apr. 7, 2014]\n\n  Assad `Says Fighting Largely Over By End of Year'--Former Russian PM\n\n                          (By Steve Gutterman)\n\n     Moscow.--President Bashar al-Assad has forecast that much of \n     the fighting in the Syrian civil war will be over by the end \n     of the year, a former Russian prime minister was quoted on \n     Monday as saying.\n       ``This is what he told me: `This year the active phase of \n     military action in Syria will be ended. After that we will \n     have to shift to what we have been doing all the time--\n     fighting terrorists','' Itar-Tass news agency quoted Sergei \n     Stepashin as saying.\n       Stepashin, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and \n     former head of Russia's FSB security service, portrayed Assad \n     as secure, in control and in ``excellent athletic shape'' \n     after a meeting in Damascus last week.\n       `` `Tell Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin) that I am not \n     Yanukovich, I'm not going anywhere','' Stepashin quoted Assad \n     as saying during their meeting, state-run news agency RIA \n     reported.\n       Yanukovich fled to Russia in February after he was pushed \n     from power by protests that followed his decision to spurn \n     closer ties with the European Union and turn to Moscow. \n     Russian leaders have criticised him for losing control of his \n     country.\n       Stepashin suggested Assad faced no such threat and was \n     likely to win a presidential election this year.\n       ``There is not a shadow of a doubt that he knows what he's \n     doing,'' RIA quoted Stepashin as saying.\n       ``Assad's strength now lies in the fact that, unlike \n     Yanukovich, he has practically no internal enemies. He has a \n     consolidated, cleansed team.\n       ``Moreover, his relatives are not bargaining and stealing \n     from the cash register but are fighting,'' he said, appearing \n     to draw a contrast with Yanukovich and his family.\n\n\n                          ``FIGHTING SPIRIT''\n\n       Stepashin, who served as prime minister in 1999 under \n     President Boris Yeltsin and now heads a charitable \n     organisation called the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society, \n     added that ``the fighting spirit of the Syrian army is \n     extremely high''.\n       Russia has been Assad's most powerful supporter during the \n     three-year-old conflict that activists say has killed more \n     than 150,000 people in Syria, blocking Western and Arab \n     efforts to drive him from power.\n       Russia and the United States organised peace talks that \n     began in January between Assad's government and its foes. But \n     no agreement was reached and a resumption appears unlikely \n     soon, in part because of high tension between Russia and the \n     West over Ukraine.\n       Russian officials say Moscow is not trying to prop up Assad \n     and but that his exit from power cannot be a precondition for \n     a political solution. Their assessments of his future have \n     varied with the fortunes of his military.\n       Assad has lost control of large swathes of northern and \n     eastern Syria to Islamist rebels and foreign jihadis. But his \n     forces, backed by militant group Hezbollah and other allies, \n     have driven rebels back from around Damascus and secured most \n     of central Syria.\n       The head of Hezbollah said in an interview published on \n     Monday Assad no longer faced a threat of being overthrown, \n     and would stand for re-election this year.\n       Stepashin predicted Assad would win.\n       ``The majority of the Syrian population will vote for \n     him,'' Itar-Tass quoted him as saying.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From Reuters, Apr. 9, 2014]\n\n     Hezbollah Confident in Assad, West Resigned to Syria Stalemate\n\n                  (By Samia Nakhoul and Laila Bassam)\n\n       Beirut.--Bashar al-Assad's Lebanese ally Hezbollah said his \n     Western foes must now accept he will go on ruling Syria after \n     fighting rebels to a standstill--a ``reality'' to which his \n     foreign enemies seem increasingly resigned.\n       Echoing recent bullish talk coming out of Damascus, Sheikh \n     Naim Qassem, deputy leader of the Iranian-backed Shi'ite \n     militia which is supporting Assad in combat, told Reuters \n     that the president retained popular support among many of \n     Syria's diverse religious communities and would shortly be \n     re-elected.\n       ``There is a practical Syrian reality that the West should \n     deal with--not with its wishes and dreams, which proved to be \n     false,''\n\n[[Page S2346]]\n\n     Qassem said during a meeting with Reuters journalists at a \n     Hezbollah office in the group's southern Beirut stronghold.\n       He said the United States and its Western allies were in \n     disarray and lacked a coherent policy on Syria--reflecting \n     the quandary that Western officials acknowledge they face \n     since the pro-democracy protests they supported in 2011 \n     became a war that has drawn al Qaeda and other militants to \n     the rebel cause.\n       Syria's fractious opposition--made up of guerrillas inside \n     the country and a largely impotent political coalition in \n     exile--had, he said, proved incapable of providing an \n     alternative to four decades of rule by Assad and his late \n     father before him.\n       ``This is why the option is clear. Either to have an \n     understanding with Assad, to reach a result, or to keep the \n     crisis open with President Assad having the upper hand in \n     running the country,'' said the bearded and turbaned cleric.\n       Qassem's comments follow an account from another Assad \n     ally, Russian former prime minister Sergei Stepashin, who \n     said after meeting him last week that the Syrian leader felt \n     secure and expected heavy fighting to end this year.\n       Officials said this week that preparations would begin this \n     month for the presidential election--a move that seems to \n     reflect a degree of optimism in the capital and which may \n     well end with Assad claiming a popular mandate that he would \n     use to resist U.N.-backed efforts to negotiate a transition \n     of power.\n       Hezbollah chief Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah also said this week \n     that Assad is no longer at risk and that military gains mean \n     the danger of Syria fragmenting was also receding.\n\n\n                          WESTERN RESIGNATION\n\n       It is a view of Assad that--quietly--seems to be gaining \n     ground in Western capitals. Calling it bad news for Syrians, \n     the French foreign ministry said this week: ``Maybe he will \n     be the sole survivor of this policy of mass crimes''.\n       France, which last year was preparing to join U.S. military \n     action that was eventually aborted, now rules out force and \n     called the stalled talks on ``transition'' the ``only \n     plan''--a view U.S. officials say is shared in Washington, \n     notably among military chiefs who see Assad as preferable to \n     sectarian chaos.\n       While rebels do not admit defeat, leaders like Badr Jamous \n     of the Syrian National Coalition accept that without foreign \n     intervention ``this stalemate will go on''. A U.S. official, \n     asked about a deadlock that would leave Assad in control of \n     much of Syria, conceded: ``This has become a drawn-out \n     conflict.''\n       Assad, 48, has weathered an armed insurgency which started \n     with protests in 2011 and descended into a civil war that has \n     sucked in regional powers, including Shi'ite Iran and \n     Hezbollah who back the Alawite president and Sunni states \n     like Saudi Arabia and Qatar behind the rebels.\n       With Russia blocking a U.N. mandate, and voters showing no \n     appetite for war after losses in Afghanistan and Iraq, \n     Western governments have held back from the kind of military \n     engagement that could have toppled the well-armed Syrian \n     leader.\n       More than 150,000 people have been killed in three years, \n     as Assad has lost the oil-producing and agricultural east and \n     much of the north, including parts of Syria's largest city, \n     Aleppo.\n       But he did not suffer the fate of other autocrats in the \n     Arab Spring, whether the presidents of Tunisia, Egypt and \n     Yemen or Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan leader toppled and \n     killed by rebels who rode into Tripoli under cover of Western \n     air power.\n       Instead, he has clawed back control near Damascus, where a \n     year ago rebels hoped for a decisive assault, and the center \n     of the country which links the capital to the coastal \n     stronghold of Assad's Alawite minority. His troops, backed by \n     Hezbollah fighters, took another key town on Wednesday.\n       Though as much as half the country is being fought over, \n     Assad could hope to hold at least a roughly southwestern \n     half, including most of the built-up heartlands near the \n     coast, and more than half of the prewar population of 23 \n     million.\n       This leaves Western powers reflecting on a perceived loss \n     of influence in the Middle East. Many now see a new strategy \n     of ``containing'' Assad--and the fallout from a bitter war \n     that has created millions of refugees and legions of hardened \n     guerrillas.\n       ``The U.S. has a stated policy of regime change, but it has \n     never devoted the resources to effect that change,'' said \n     Andrew Exum, a former U.S. official who worked on Middle East \n     issues at the Pentagon. ``The de facto U.S. strategy of \n     containment is very well suited for what is likely to be a \n     very long war.''\n\n\n                      ``STALEMATE WILL CONTINUE''\n\n       Qassem said the United States, which backed away from \n     military action in September after blaming Assad for gassing \n     civilians, was hamstrung by fears over the dominance in rebel \n     ranks of al Qaeda's Syrian branch, the Nusra Front, and \n     another group, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant \n     (ISIL).\n       ``America is in a state of confusion. On the one hand it \n     does not want the regime to stay and on the other it cannot \n     control the opposition which is represented by ISIL and \n     Nusra,'' he said.\n       ``This is why the latest American position was to leave the \n     situation in Syria in a state of attrition.''\n       President Barack Obama said last month that the United \n     States had reached ``limits'' after the wars in Afghanistan \n     and Iraq and questioned whether years of military engagement \n     in Syria would produce a better outcome there.\n       Qassem said: ``I expect that the stalemate will continue in \n     the Syrian crisis because of the lack of an international and \n     regional decision to facilitate a political solution.''\n       U.N.-mediated talks at Geneva failed in February to bridge \n     a gulf between Assad's government and opponents who insist \n     that Assad must make way for a government of national unity.\n       Western and regional powers who support the Syrian \n     opposition say it would be a ``parody of democracy'' to hold \n     an election in the midst of a conflict which has displaced \n     more than 9 million people and divided the country across \n     frontlines.\n       Syria's electoral law effectively rules out participation \n     by opponents who have fled the country in fear of Assad's \n     police--candidates must have lived in Syria continuously for \n     10 years.\n       ``My conviction is that Assad will run and will win because \n     he has popular support in Syria from all the sects--Sunnis \n     and secularists,'' Qassem said. ``I believe the election will \n     take place on its due date and Assad will run and win \n     decisively.''\n       Fear of hardline Islamists has undermined support for some \n     rebels even among the 75 percent Sunni majority, and \n     bolstered support for Assad among his fellow Alawites, and \n     Christians.\n       Qassem said it was too soon to speak of Hezbollah pulling \n     out of Syria, despite an increase in Sunni-Shi'ite tensions \n     within Lebanon caused by the intervention across the border \n     of a movement that is Lebanon's most accomplished military \n     force and also holds cabinet seats in the government in \n     Beirut.\n       ``Until now we consider our presence in Syria necessary and \n     fundamental,'' Qassem said.\n       ``But when circumstances change, this will be a military \n     and political matter that requires a new assessment.\n       ``But if the situation stays as is and the circumstances \n     are similar, we will remain where we should be''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I won't include it in the Record, but there is an \ninteresting article that states, ``Syria's Assad secure, will seek re-\nelection: Hezbollah leader.''\n  To show, I think, the very incredible naivety, there is an article in \nthe Washington Post by Secretary Kerry entitled ``Kerry: US strike in \nSyria wouldn't be devastating.''\n  The Secretary of State says:\n\n       ``It would not have had a devastating impact by which he \n     had to recalculate, because it wasn't going to last that \n     long,'' Kerry told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \n     ``Here we were going to have one or two days to degrade and \n     send a message. . . . We came up with a better solution.''\n\n  We came up with a better solution. The President of the United States \nsaid that if Bashar Assad crossed a red line and used chemical weapons, \nwe would act. He announced we would act. All our allies knew we were \ngoing to act. Then he took a walk with his national security adviser \nand said he was going to go to Congress. Meanwhile, Senator Kerry, in a \nbizarre, incredible act, issued a statement that any attack on Syria \nwould be ``incredibly small.'' It is remarkable.\n  Finally, our conscience should be shot, but it is not. We get kind of \nimmune to day after day after day of these various reports of the \nslaughter that is going on.\n  Look at the situation in Syria 3 years ago and look at it today: \n150,000 dead, millions displaced; entry of jihadist fighters from all \nover the world who continue brutal bombing with barrel bombs which will \nslaughter innocent men, women, and children; and our Secretary of State \nsays: Well, it wouldn't have been much if we would have struck them \nanyway.\n  This is a shameful chapter in American history, I say to my \ncolleagues. Historians in future generations will judge us very \nharshly, and future generations and younger generations may have to pay \nthe price for our inaction and our neglect of our basic human values.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1596\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank my good friend Senator Pat Toomey from my \nneighboring State of Pennsylvania--I am from West Virginia--for working \nwith me on this vital issue to make sure our kids remain safe in every \nsingle school across this country.\n  I am a father of three, a grandfather of eight, and there is nothing \nmore important to me than protecting my children and grandchildren. The \nbill Senator Toomey and I are working on is\n\n[[Page S2347]]\n\ncommon sense. Our bill makes sure all employees who work with our \nstudents pass a background check to make sure they have no criminal \nrecords or an abusive history. That includes everyone from principals, \nteachers, secretaries, cafeteria workers and janitors--anyone who has \ncontact with our schoolkids. This is a real problem that demands our \nattention and demands it now.\n  Since January 1, 130 teachers across America have been arrested for \nsexual misconduct. At this rate that is more than one teacher per day \nwho will sexually assault a student. As a parent, as a grandparent, and \nas a representative of the great State of West Virginia, inaction is \nsimply unacceptable.\n  There are more than 4 million teachers and school staff employed by \nour public school districts throughout the United States, and there are \nmillions of additional workers who have direct access to students, \nincluding bus drivers, cafeteria workers and janitors. Yet there is \nno--I repeat, there is no--national background check policy in place \nfor people who work directly with our kids every day. Even worse, not \nall States require checks of child abuse and neglect registries or sex \noffender registry checks.\n  A recent report by the Government Accountability Office found that \nfive States--five States--don't even require background checks at all \nfor applicants seeking employment in our school systems. In addition, \nnot all States use both Federal and State sources of criminal data, \nsuch as a State law enforcement database or the FBI's interstate \nidentification index.\n  Our bill would simply require mandatory background checks of a State \ncriminal registry, the State child abuse and neglect registries, an FBI \nfingerprint check, and a check of the National Sex Offender Registry \nfor existing and prospective employees.\n  Every child deserves to have at least one place where they feel safe \nand that harm cannot enter their life. For many of our kids these days \nthat place is at school--not always in the home. This is truly a \ncommonsense bill that aims to help protect our kids from sexual \nassault, predators, or any individuals who inappropriately behave in \nour schools.\n  This is a piece of legislation that is long overdue. It is not an \nunfunded mandate. I know some people will say that, and the reason I am \nsaying it is not an unfunded mandate is because the people who want the \nemployment have to pay. They have to pay for the background check if \nthey want in the system.\n  I know there is a section in this legislation that says if a person \nhas been an offender they have to be rehabilitated for 5 years--be \nclean, have a clean record for 5 years--before they can get in the \nsystem. I think that is common sense.\n  I would like for all my colleagues, if they would, to please consider \nthis piece of legislation. Again, I appreciate the hard work of my \ncolleague Senator Pat Toomey, and at this time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia, \nSenator Manchin, for his terrific efforts on this legislation. I also \nwant to thank our other cosponsors, Senators McConnell and Inhofe, for \ntheir support as well.\n  The tragic story that inspired this bill has a connection to my State \nof Pennsylvania and Senator Manchin's State of West Virginia, so it \nmade it kind of a natural for us to work together on this. It is a \nterrible story indeed, and I want to summarize it because it goes to \nthe heart of why I am here this morning.\n  The story begins in Delaware County, PA, where one of the \nschoolteachers was found to have molested several boys and raped one. \nProsecutors decided there was not enough evidence to actually press \ncharges, but the school knew what had happened. So they dismissed the \nteacher for this outrageous behavior. But shockingly, and somewhat \ndisturbingly, the school also helped this teacher get a new job so they \ncould pass him along and let him become someone else's problem. It \nhappened the new job was in West Virginia. The Pennsylvania school even \nwent so far as to send a letter of recommendation for this monster to \nget that job in West Virginia, which he did get. He became a teacher, \nthen a school principal, and while there he raped and murdered a 12-\nyear-old boy named Jeremy Bell in West Virginia.\n  Justice finally caught up with that teacher, and he is now in jail, \nserving a life sentence for that murder. For Jeremy Bell, \nunfortunately, justice came way too late. But Jeremy Bell's father \ndecided he would not rest until he had done everything he possibly \ncould to minimize the chance that any other child or parent would ever \nexperience a similar tragedy. Roy Bell is Jeremy's dad. He worked with \nCongress to create protections for children to ensure they would not be \nvictimized at school, and the House of Representatives responded.\n  In October of last year, the House unanimously passed the Protecting \nStudents Against Sexual and Violent Predators Act. Unfortunately, there \ntoo, in a way, it was a few days too late. Jeremy Bell's dad passed \naway 3 days before the vote. But it passed the House, and it passed, as \nI said, unanimously in the House. Now we are here in the Senate with a \nchance to pass the same bill so it can become law.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill I introduced with Senator \nManchin. It is a bill that has other cosponsors. I know there are some \nfolks who say: Well, let's wait, we need more time. I say we have had \nenough waiting. We have waited too long. Let me explain why we \nshouldn't wait another day.\n  I will start with two numbers. The first number is 130. Senator \nManchin mentioned this number. Since January 1 of this year, 130 \nteachers have been arrested across America for sexual misconduct with \nchildren. That is more than one teacher every day. And these are the \nones who have been caught. How many more are happening?\n  The stories are absolutely heartbreaking: A teacher's aide who \nundressed and sexually assaulted a mentally disabled boy in his care; a \nchild whose abuse began at age 10 and only ended when at age 17 she \nfound herself pregnant with the teacher's child; the 16-year-old raped \nby her instructor in a classroom closet; one teacher after another \ncaught with images of child pornography; a special education \nkindergarten girl forced to go shirtless in class.\n  These things are unbelievable. But every day we delay, we delay \nrooting out one of these predators.\n  The other number I want to share is the number 73. According to the \nGAO--the Government Accountability Office--the average pedophile \nmolests 73 children over the course of a lifetime. These predators are \nvery devious. They are clever and they are smart. What they do is go \nwhere the potential victims are. And where are there potential victims \nfor a pedophile? What better place than a school. So they do in fact go \nto schools, and from school to school and school district to school \ndistrict. Every day we delay, we increase the risk a predator is moving \non to the next of his 73 victims.\n  So what can we do? Here is what our bill does. Our bill, the \nProtecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act, is an \nimportant first step. It would require mandatory background checks for \nexisting and prospective employees and then require the checks be \nperiodically repeated, the timing of which would be left to the \ndiscretion of the States. There are five States that do not require \nchecks at all.\n  The bill would also check to make sure all employees or contractors \nwho have unsupervised contact with children would be subject to this \nbackground check--not just teachers but coaches, schoolbus drivers, \nanyone who has unsupervised contact with the kids. There are 12 States \nthat don't require that now.\n  The bill requires a more thorough background check. For instance, in \nPennsylvania, there is a background check requirement. But if you have \nlived in the State for more than 2 years, it does not require a \nbackground check on the Federal criminal database, and yet we know \nthese people move across State lines.\n  A fourth and important piece is that our bill forbids what has sadly \ndeveloped its own name--passing the trash. This idea, this practice, \nunfortunately, of actually recommending the predator to another job in \nanother school or another State so as to get rid of the problem and let \nhim become someone else's\n\n[[Page S2348]]\n\nis so disturbing it is hard to imagine anyone would do this, but we \nknow it happens. We know it happens. And a given State doesn't have the \npower to prevent some school district in another State from doing \nexactly this, as happened in the case of Jeremy Bell.\n  There is a list of folks who under our legislation a school would \nsimply not be able to hire: anyone ever convicted of any violent or \nsexual crime against a child. I think that makes a lot of sense. There \nare certain felonies that would also preclude a person from ever being \nhired: homicide, child abuse or neglect, rape or sexual assault, and a \nfew others. In addition, a person who was convicted in the last 5 years \nof a felony physical assault or battery or a felony drug-related \noffense would create a 5-year prohibition against hiring such a person.\n  The enforcement mechanism we have is withholding Federal funds, which \nwould be the inducement for the States to adopt these requirements.\n  Let me stress that this bill has broad support. I mentioned before \nthis passed the House unanimously. There was not a single objection in \nthe House. It has bipartisan support here in the Senate. Various child \nadvocacy groups are fully in support: the National Children's Alliance, \nthe Children's Defense Fund, and the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children. Prosecutors and prosecutor associations--the \nAssociation of Prosecuting Attorneys and the Pennsylvania District \nAttorneys Association--both fully endorse this legislation. Teachers \ngroups: the American Federation of Teachers and the Pennsylvania School \nBoards Association.\n  I forget how many former teachers in the House--I think 19 or so--all \nvoted for this bill. I am willing to venture the overwhelming majority \nof the American people would support this effort to keep our kids as \nsafe as we can.\n  I would also stress there is nothing radical about these proposals. \nIn the Senate we just passed a very similar background check \nrequirement in the child care development block grant legislation, \nwhere we insist on almost identical background checks for employees of \ndaycares. That makes perfect sense to me. It is a good step. It is very \nlikely to help protect children in our daycares. But why in the world \nwould we protect the kids in daycare and not provide comparable \nprotection for kids who have gone on to later grades?\n  This is a bipartisan commonsense bill that has passed the House \nunanimously. This is our opportunity to pass it in the Senate and send \nit to the President for his signature. I believe it is a moral \nimperative we do this to protect these kids. It didn't come soon enough \nfor Jeremy Bell. And sadly, every day we learn there are more victims. \nBut now is the time we can act.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 1596 and the Senate proceed \nto its immediate consideration. I further ask unanimous consent that \nthe bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I certainly favor the goals of this \nlegislation. The Senator will remember we passed a childcare bill that \nincluded many of the same background check provisions for childcare \nemployees. Those provisions were negotiated between Democrats and \nRepublicans on our committee to address issues that were raised about \nthe implementation of any federally prescribed background checks for \nchildcare settings.\n  We would like to undertake a similar process in the K-12 context to \nensure any concerns raised by either side be addressed. That is what \nthe committee process is for.\n  What the Senator from Pennsylvania is asking for in this bill will \nhave an impact on nearly every public school in the country and every \nemployee, not just teachers--not just teachers--who might have any \nunsupervised access to children. So that requires us to do some due \ndiligence.\n  I don't want anyone to misunderstand me. I am willing to work with \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and others on this legislation, but I do \nbelieve we need to take a closer look at it, talking with relevant \nstakeholders--States, school districts, employees--about the bill and \nsome perhaps unintended consequences of it. We were able to do that in \nthe childcare bill, and I believe we can achieve similar success with \nthe legislation of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I am ready and \nwilling to engage with the Senator, his staff, and his office in that \nprocess.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I support the Senator from Iowa and \nhis request that this bill go to the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee.\n  In the Republican Conference, we talk a lot about the importance of \ntaking legislation through committee so it can be amended and \nconsidered through the regular order. This is certainly important \nlegislation. All of us would agree on that.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from West Virginia \ndeserve a lot of credit for bringing this terrible story to our \nattention and proposing we address it. And I think we should. But the \nappropriate way to do that here, is to take it to the committee of \njurisdiction to be considered in a markup, amended, and see if anyone \nhas a better idea.\n  My second reason for hoping this bill goes to the HELP committee is \nthat I have my own idea. I think this bill poses an important question \nto the Senate about whether we want to constitute ourselves as a \nnational school board. That is, in fact, what we would be doing if we \npassed it into law.\n  In our country there are 100,000 public elementary and secondary \nschools. They all have a principal who is in charge of the employees in \nthat school.\n  This bill is about determining what kind of criminal background check \nthose school employees should have. What is the principal supposed to \ndo? Doesn't the principal have any responsibility for this? Can the \nprincipal just say that this is the job of the United States Senate, so \nI don't have to worry about that?\n  There are 14,000 local school boards across West Virginia, Tennessee, \nIowa, Pennsylvania, and all of our other States. What is the \nresponsibility of these local school boards when it comes to \ndetermining the qualifications of their teachers or the health and \nsafety of their students? Do the members of the local school board say: \nWe don't have to worry about those questions too much because the U.S. \nSenate will determine for us what the qualifications for teaching will \nbe or how we will keep students healthy and safe in our local public \nschools?\n  There are 50 Governors of our states. I used to be one of them, as \nwas the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I got pretty tired of \npeople flying to Washington, D.C. thinking that they were the only ones \nwho had any sense of responsibility for the public school students in \nTennessee. In fact, I felt like the more Washington, D.C. intruded into \nTennessee by making decisions that we should be making for ourselves, \nthe less responsible we felt for those decisions and the less effective \nwe were at doing our jobs.\n  I remember in the early 1990s there was a piece of legislation which \nwhizzed through the Senate and the House just like this piece of \nlegislation has been doing. It was called the Gun-Free School Zones \nAct, and it came after a particularly terrible shooting at a school. We \nstill have those shootings today, and it wrenches our heart every time \nthey happen.\n  So, after the shooting, the U.S. Congress said: We will fix it. The \nSupreme Court ruled it unconstitutional because it exceeded the \nauthority of Congress under the commerce clause--that in effect it \nwasn't Washington's job; it was the job of the states and local \ncommunities to determine the issue of gun possession around schools.\n  I submit that the safety of our schools is the job of the parents of \nthose schools, of the principal in that school, of the community which \nsupports that school, of the local school board, of the supporting \norganizations, and of the governor and the legislature of the state. If \nthey can pretend they can kick that responsibility up to Washington, I \nthink that is wrong. I do\n\n[[Page S2349]]\n\nnot think that is within our constitutional framework in the United \nStates. Those responsibilities belong locally.\n  The Senator from Iowa and I have a terrific relationship and \nideological differences on many occasions. I spent the morning debating \nwith him about whether his proposal for early childhood education would \nin effect create a national school board.\n  He basically made the same argument that is being made here. He said: \nIf we are going to give states money from Washington for early \nchildhood education, we have a responsibility to define how that money \nis spent, including the parameters for what the teachers' salaries \nshould be.\n  So if we can define what criminal background checks ought to be for \nschool employees in Maryville, TN, public schools, we can define what \nthe teachers' salaries ought to be in the Maryville, TN, public \nschools. If we can decide what the safety measures in the school ought \nto be, we can decide what the maximum size of classes ought to be. We \ncan decide what the length of the school day ought to be and what kind \nof vision and health screenings we ought to provide. Those decisions \nare important for children as well. Whether the children are fed \nproperly is important as well. Are we going to kick those decisions \nupstairs to the U.S. Senate and say: You set the rules for that.\n  Physical activity programs. The distinguished Senator from Iowa has \nbeen a champion for more physical activity his whole career here. He \nwould like to set that as a goal from Washington. I think that is the \njob of a local community.\n  Professional development for school staff. If we make decisions about \ncriminal background checks for staff, we can make decisions about their \nprofessional development as well.\n  How about academic standards and curriculum? In the State of \nTennessee and in many other States there has been a near rebellion over \nthe so-called Common Core State Standards. The important issue is about \nhow we raise standards for children who need to learn more to succeed. \nBut the problem is that Washington got involved with the standards, and \npeople in our State and many other States don't like national school \nboards and Washington-control of public schools.\n  So I think we should stop and think about this. I would prefer to see \nthe federal government in Washington act as an enabler of States and \nlocal school boards rather than a mandator.\n  I would like to see us take this terrific focus the Senators from \nPennsylvania and West Virginia have put on the importance of criminal \nbackground checks and the safety of our children by making it easier \nfor States and local school boards to search a State criminal registry, \na State-based child abuse and neglect registry, a fingerprint-based FBI \ncriminal history, a search of the national sex offender registry.\n\n  Forty-six States already require all public school employees to go \nthrough some form of a background check. Are we to say we know better \nthan they do? If so, what does that say about our entire structure of \npublic education and whether we should just tell the 14,000 local \nschool boards in the U.S. to disband. We don't need you to make \ndecisions about the safety of the schools in your district. We will do \nit in Washington. We don't need you to make decisions about academic \nstandards and curriculum. We will do that here?\n  I think we in Congress should be enablers, not mandators. I think we \nshould take this powerful focus the two Senators have put on criminal \nbackground checks for school employees, take it to the HELP committee, \nand put a spotlight on making it easier and more important for all \n100,000 principals, all 14,000 local school boards, all 50 State \nGovernors to do it, help parents to be aroused, and put the spotlight \nwhere the spotlight ought to be.\n  If they want a gun-free school zone, put the spotlight on the school \nand the community around it. If they want a safe school, put the \nspotlight on the school and the community around it. If they want to \nhave a criminal background check system to keep predators out of \nschools, put the spotlight on the principal, the school board, and the \ncommunity around it. That is the way to effectively do it. That is the \nway to respect our federalist system of government and our \nconstitutional framework. That is the way to avoid creating a national \nschool board.\n  So I look forward to working with the Senator from Iowa, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, and the Senator from Pennsylvania. This is an \nimportant issue. I would like to see it become law. But I would like \nfor our government in Washington to be more of an enabler of local \nschool boards and school principals than a mandator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, needless to say, I am extremely \ndisappointed that we find ourselves here at this impasse with nothing \naccomplished, and who knows how long it will take to get something \naccomplished.\n  I will point out that the Senate, I think just last week, voted for \nnearly identical background check language in the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act. We voted for this. This is the language \nvetted by this committee.\n  If it is vital to keep kids safe at a daycare--which I think it is--\nwhy isn't it just as vital to keep kids or their older siblings safe \nfor the rest of the day? I don't think we need to go through the \ncommittee to answer that question. We have waited long enough.\n  This is the 16th background check bill which has been introduced in \nthe House or the Senate since 2009, and here we have nothing on the \nSenate floor. The committees had 5 years to act. The committees had 5 \nmonths when they could have taken up this bill at any time, marked it \nup, and moved it through the process, but they didn't do this.\n  As far as using the committee process, I am generally a fan of going \nthrough the committee. But let's not pretend that is how we normally \noperate around here. There are 27 bills so far in this Congress which \nhave received floor consideration without going through a committee at \nall--7 under the jurisdiction of this committee. Last Congress there \nwere 42 bills which received floor votes without going through \ncommittee.\n  Let's be candid. In just the last week or so, and looking forward \nanother week or two, we have more legislation under the jurisdiction of \nthis committee. Whether it is paycheck fairness or a minimum wage bill, \nthose are under the jurisdiction of this committee. They are going to \nbe brought to the floor without having gone through the committee.\n  By the way, those are bills we know are going nowhere. Those are \npolitical statement bills. So is it more important to get bills that \nare political statements to the Senate floor than it is legislation \nwhich could actually be signed to protect kids from violent predators? \nThis seems to me to be a very misordering of priorities.\n  I say to my colleague, for whom I have a great deal of respect and \nwith whom I generally find myself in agreement, on this issue I happen \nto disagree with the senior Senator from Tennessee. In my view, this is \nnot a mandate on the States.\n  If a State chooses not to develop the background checks we have put \ninto this bill, then we would withhold the ESEA funding, which is 3.5 \npercent of total funding. That is not insignificant. But it leaves it \nup to the State to decide. We think kids ought to be safe in schools. \nIf they disagree about the background checks, OK, then they don't have \nto take this funding. The Supreme Court, by the way, has agreed that \nthis does not represent coercion. It does not amount to coercion when \nit is on this scale.\n  The second point I would make in this regard is part of this \nlegislation absolutely requires Federal legislation. As I mentioned \nbriefly in my comments earlier, this all originated from a case where a \nschool in one State sent a letter of recommendation to a school in \nanother State for one of these monsters to be hired. Frankly, I don't \nknow how the school in the State where this person ended up could have \nprevented that from happening. But Federal legislation can prevent \nthat, and I think it should.\n  So I am deeply disappointed we are not able to move to this today. I \nhope we will be able to soon.\n  I think my colleague from West Virginia had a point he wished to \nmake, so I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2350]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I first thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Toomey. I also thank the Senator from Tennessee, \nfor whom I also have the greatest regard for his knowledge and \ncommitment to our children and education, to which he has dedicated his \nlife, and also the Senator from Iowa. This is very serious and very \npersonal to both of us. Our States have been affected. But every State \nhas been affected.\n  I am not in favor of a national school board in any way, shape or \nform. I strongly believe in the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution and \nStates rights. But I believe that certain standards have to be set, and \nwe have done that before as far as on a national level.\n  There are five problems we have always talked about, and those five \nproblems apply to every child in America--not just every child in West \nVirginia, Pennsylvania, Tennessee or Iowa but in America.\n  The first is every child should have a loving, caring adult in their \nlife. Those are not always the biological parents or family. It could \nbe you. It could be somebody next door. It could be an extended family \nmember.\n  Every child should have a safe place in their life. Unfortunately, as \nhas been said, it is not always the home. It might be the school.\n  Every child should have a healthy start. Nutrition--for many children \nacross America, their breakfast, lunch, and nutrition comes from the \nschool.\n  Every child should be taught to have a livable skill. Again, that is \nin the school. We depend upon that.\n  And the fifth thing--which is the hardest to teach--is that every \nchild should grow to be a loving, caring adult, and be able to give \nback. That is set by us. We set the standards for that. A child will \nemulate what they see. If they love it and respect it, they will do it.\n  For us to say we don't believe raising to a Federal standard the \nwell-being and safety of every child in a school system--guaranteeing \nthat the person who is going to be teaching them, nurturing them, \ntaking them to school, and feeding them has a clean background check \nand is not a child molester--is the least we can do. That is all we are \nasking for in this bill. I hope that it would get the attention it \nneeds. Again, I am also very disappointed that we cannot move it \nforward, and I know that precedent has been set and has been \narticulated by the Senator from Pennsylvania. But I would hope that \nboth the ranking member and the chairman of the HELP Committee would \nmaybe reconsider and take another look at it.\n\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am willing to support holding a hearing on the bill, \nmoving it rapidly through the HELP committee, and moving it back to the \nSenate floor. I will make my argument in committee or on the floor, and \nI may win or I may lose. But I have thought about the gun-free school \nzones act for more than 20 years, and I thought about it from the point \nof view of a parent and of a Governor.\n  The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has conservative \nRepublicans on one side and liberal Democrats on the other. I spend \nmost of my days on the committee trying to argue my Democratic friends \nout of their good ideas that they want to impose on every local school \ndistrict in America. There is a moral imperative to have high academic \nstandards for children. There is a moral imperative to have physical \neducation for children. There is a moral imperative to have breakfast \nfor children. There is a moral imperative to help disabled children. \nThere is a moral imperative to do all these things. We all feel that. \nBut just because we in Washington contribute 10 percent of the money \nspent on elementary and secondary education doesn't mean we should \nsubstitute our judgment for that of the local school board and the \nprincipal who is accountable to that community for the safety of each \nchild in their school. We ought to think about that before we start \nassuming these responsibilities because if we pass this bill into law, \nleave people to think that we solved the problem, and another problem \nhappens, then who is going to be held accountable? The local principal? \nThe local school board? The Governor? No. Maybe the Senate will be held \naccountable because we took it upon ourselves to say to the parents: We \nhave kept your child safe.\n  We should enable parents. We should enable schools. We should enable \nlocal school districts to create safe and effective schools with high \nstandards. We should give parents choices of schools with effective \nteachers, but we shouldn't mandate it or define it from Washington. \nThat is my argument, which I would like to be considered when we think \nabout the extent to which we ought to say to a local school board or \nprincipal: We are going to define for you what a criminal background \ncheck should consist of for the people you hire in your schools.\n  I pledge to work on it as rapidly as Senator Harkin can move it \nthrough the committee. I will make my argument, and we will come to a \nconclusion.\n  I appreciate the Senators from Pennsylvania and West Virginia putting \na focus on such an important issue, and I look forward to a speedy \nconclusion to the debate and a passage of an appropriate bill on an \nimportant issue. I just hope it enables instead of mandates.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n               Commemorating the Boston Marathon Tragedy\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, 1 year ago I rose to speak in this \nChamber. I rose with a heart heavy with mourning and yet filled with \ngratitude because 1 year ago cowards set off bombs at our beloved \nBoston Marathon, trying to terrorize our city, but Boston responded \nwith courage and community.\n  Today I rise with a heart filled with the spirit of healing and \nrestoration to commemorate the anniversary of the Boston Marathon \nbombing and celebrate the strength and character of the people of \nBoston.\n  One year ago terror knocked on Boston's door. It was not just the \nmomentary terror of smoke and sound but the terror of uncertainty and \nspeculation, the terror of siege and lockdown. Such terrors can break a \npeople's spirit. They seek to do no less. But Boston was fearless.\n  Our first responders, our protectors and investigators, our heroes, \nour citizen heroes, our families, our friends, and our neighbors--we \ndid not waiver. In that moment when all the world had its eyes upon us, \nwe responded with a cry of defiance, not of fear.\n  Scripture says: ``Be brave, be strong. Let all that you do be done \nwith love.'' In the last year we have seen what bravery and strength \nand love can do.\n  Friends and family, classmates and teachers have come together to \nkeep alive the memories of Krystle Campbell, Lu Lingzi, Martin \nRichards, and Sean Collier, and to celebrate their lives and to promise \nthey will live on in our hearts.\n  Investigators and prosecutors have pursued justice, impartial and \nfair but with righteous conviction and an unwavering sense of purpose.\n  Healers and neighbors, friends and family have restored life and \nenergy to those who thought it lost and in doing so have felt their own \nspirits lift.\n  Inventors and doctors have returned a ballroom dancer to the dance \nfloor and helped children run and play, focused not on what they have \nlost but on what they can do next.\n  Families have rejoiced with graduations and birthdays, weddings and \nchildren, with the sweetest and most hopeful moments of life.\n  In the last year we have found that when we are united as one \ncommunity, bravery and strength and love can heal the body and restore \nthe spirit.\n  One hundred years after the original Patriots' Day of 1775, an orator \ncelebrating the anniversary of the first battles of the Revolutionary \nWar told the people of Massachusetts that ``our common liberty is \nconsecrated by a common sorrow.'' From time to time, as a community and \nas a country we are reminded of this wisdom, through the awful grace of \nGod. Our common tragedies and sufferings unite us as one people, and \nthat unity brings with it strength and courage and ultimately renews \nour commitment to liberty.\n\n[[Page S2351]]\n\n  Now, with the strength of One Boston still with us, we look ahead to \njustice that has yet to be served, to healing that remains to be done, \nto a future of achievements, of celebrations, and of memories.\n  May God bless those we have lost. May He inspire those who survived \nto carry forward. May He keep our community united in bravery and \nstrength and love. And may He always watch over the people of Boston, \nof Massachusetts, and of the United States of America.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  There was a new announcement today from the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services that 7.5 million people have signed up for private \nhealth care through the exchanges by virtue of the Affordable Care Act. \nThe initial estimates from CBO last fall were that in the best case \nabout 6 million people were going to sign up. We have blown through \nthat enrollment expectation, and still, on this floor and in committee \nhearings as recently as this morning, Republicans continue to criticize \nand critique this law with blistering attacks--not because they have \ndata on their side, not because they have evidence on their side, but \nbecause their entire electoral strategy for the fall depends on an \nassault on the Affordable Care Act.\n  The problem is that increasingly day by day, as more information \ncomes out about the life-changing, life-altering success of this law, \nthere simply is not the evidence to back up the claim from the \nRepublicans that the Affordable Care Act isn't working. In fact, the \nreason why a new Washington Post poll shows that for the first time \nmore Americans support the Affordable Care Act rather than oppose it is \nbecause they know the Affordable Care Act is working. Yet my good \nfriend Representative Paul Ryan says that despite 7 million people \nsigning up for the law, ``the architecture of this law is so \nfundamentally flawed that I think it is going to collapse under its own \nweight.''\n  One of our own colleagues said, ``I don't think the 7 million \nenrollment figure means anything. They are cooking the books on this.''\n  Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer says that the 7.1 million \nenrollment figure was a ``phony number'' and that all the changes and \ndelays must mean the majority of the law is already on its way out.\n  Well, that is the story Republicans are telling here in Washington, \nbut our constituents in Democratic States and Republican States are \ntelling a very different story.\n  I would like to talk about the numbers for a second because data can \nbe pretty tricky when it gets in the way of your political argument. As \none of our former colleagues from New York said--and I am \nparaphrasing--we are all entitled to our own opinions, but we are not \nentitled to our own facts.\n  Here we are. This is the percentage of uninsured in the United States \nby quarter. We start in 2008, which is essentially the beginning of the \nrecession, and, as would be expected over the course of the recession, \nthe number of uninsured rises from 14.5 percent to a peak of 18 \npercent. But guess what happens when it hits the peak. The Affordable \nCare Act goes into operation. The Affordable Care Act begins to be \nimplemented, and in a very short period of time from the beginning of \nenrollment until the end of the first period of enrollment being March \n31, the number goes from 18 percent uninsured to 15.6 uninsured. That \nis a remarkable decrease over a very short period of time that can only \nbe explained by the fact that 7 million people now have access to \nprivate health care insurance, another 3 million people have access to \nMedicaid, and another 3 million people on top of that have access to \ninsurance on their parents' plans.\n  When we look at what has happened to young people over a similar \nperiod of time, we can see the same dynamic playing out. This is the \nrate of uninsured of 18- to 25-year-olds in this country. Here, they \nare at 28 percent. I mean, how on Earth, in the most affluent, most \npowerful country in the world, did we ever allow for more than one-\nquarter of our young people to be uninsured? But we were at 28.4 \npercent, and when the Affordable Care Act was passed and the first \nprovision went into effect, it allowed people who were under 26 to stay \non their parents' plans.\n  Look. The number starts to move downward. It is a pretty consistent \ndownward slope, moving from 28 to about 24. Then the ACA plans start, \nand then the number--just as in the uninsured data for the population \nat large--drops again from 24 down to 21. It was 28 percent at the \npassage of the law, and it is 21.7 percent today.\n  Other studies show the same. This is survey data from Gallup, which \nis generally the gold standard on tracking the rate of uninsured in the \ncountry. But we also have a RAND study that was done. This is a very \nwell-known consulting study which said that from the period of \nSeptember of last year until mid-March, 9.3 million people who were \nuninsured became insured.\n  So when Republicans say this data doesn't really tell you the true \nstory because these are all people just shifting from one plan to \nanother, that is not true. The RAND study tells us that 9.3 million \npeople who were uninsured became insured. The RAND study also says that \n7.2 million people got access to employer-based insurance who didn't \nhave it previously. And that data doesn't even include the surge of \nenrollment at the end of March. The RAND study only brings us up to \nabout mid-March.\n  So this is the real story. This is what the numbers and the data tell \nus: that people are getting access to insurance for the first time \never. The Affordable Care Act isn't just shifting people from one \ninsurance plan to another insurance plan; it is actually having a \nremarkable effect on the number of insured in this country.\n  I am not suggesting this trend line is going to continue along that \naxis, but, boy, if the next couple of years looks anything like the \nfirst 6 months of Affordable Care Act plans being available to people, \nwe are going to see a revolution in this country in terms of the number \nof people who are outside our health care system. Yet this week was the \n52nd, 53rd, 54th vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the House of \nRepresentatives. The Presiding Officer and I sat through probably 40 of \nthose votes and there is another one today.\n  A budget presented, again, by Representative Paul Ryan would take \naway insurance from 7 million people who now have it, take away \nMedicaid coverage from 3 million more people who have it, would repeal \na law that has provided $9 billion in savings for seniors when they are \nin the doughnut hole. And $9 billion is a big number and hard to \ncomprehend. By the way, his bill would return that $9 billion to the \ndrug industry because that is where it came from. It didn't shift money \nfrom one set of taxpayers to another set of taxpayers. The way we \nclosed the doughnut hole was asking the drug industry to put up some \nmoney in order to help seniors.\n  The irony of all ironies is that the Ryan budget--while repealing all \nof the provisions that have provided insurance to over 10 million \npeople and discounted health care for millions more--would keep in \nplace the $716 billion in Medicare savings that Republicans and outside \ngroups have hammered Democrats for supporting over the course of the \nlast 5 years.\n  Over and over we have been told we are killing Medicare Advantage by \nasking Medicare Advantage to run their insurance plans for the same \ncosts that Medicare charges. Yet despite all of the rhetoric, the \nRepublican budget in the House would keep in place all of the Medicare \ncuts they have been running against outside of this building.\n  What our constituents know is that despite bumps in the road, the \nAffordable Care Act works. Anytime you reorder one-sixth of the \nAmerican economy, you are going to have problems and you are going to \nhave people who are going to be unhappy. The reality is that for \ndecades we had the most expensive health care system in the\n\n[[Page S2352]]\n\nworld, times two, compared to any other industrialized nation, and we \nwere getting results that didn't measure up to the amount of money we \nwere spending. We had 30 million people who were uninsured, rates of \ninfant immortality and infections that were way above countries \nspending half as much as we did. We had to make a change. That there \nwere 54 votes in the House of Representatives to repeal the bill, and \nnot a single effort to replace it, tells you that it has been Democrats \nwho have been willing to step to the plate and do the tough reform \nnecessary to try to make changes that were 100 years overdue. The \nnumbers don't lie in the end.\n  I get it that Republicans think they can win an election by \ncontinuing to hammer away at the Affordable Care Act, but there are \n7\\1/2\\ million people who now have private health care. There are 3 \nmillion people who now have access to Medicaid. There are 3 million \nmore young adults who can stay on their parents' plans. RAND and Gallup \ntell us that the number of people without insurance in this country is \nabsolutely plummeting by the day. All of that is evidence that despite \nthe best intentions from our Republicans to undermine the law the ACA \nworks.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Emergency Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, it has been 103 days since emergency \nunemployment insurance expired and 3 days since the Senate sent a \nbipartisan agreement to the House which would restore these benefits \nfor up to 2.7 million Americans. These benefits are fully paid for and \nwould lift the entire economy. That is why the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that failing to renew the \nbenefits for a full year would cost the economy 200,000 jobs. We \nrecognize our bill is a partial restoration, not a full year. The \nrestoration we proposed will increase jobs in the economy as attested \nby the CBO.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that the House has no intent to take up the \nSenate-passed agreement to restore these benefits before they leave \ntown for 2 weeks.\n  That is right if the House fails to pass what the Senate has passed \non a bipartisan vote--and this was a bipartisan, fiscally responsible \nmeasure--the Speaker, who says he wants job creation, will be rejecting \na portion of those 200,000 new jobs projected by the Congressional \nBudget Office, which is headed by his own appointee.\n  Contrary to the criticism that our proposal does not create jobs and \ndoesn't do anything with jobs, it does. More importantly, it restores \nbenefits to people who are desperately looking for work in a very \ndifficult economy, and who need these benefits to keep searching for \nwork as well as supporting their families.\n  In my view, the failure to act is not defensible. Restoring these \nbenefits is the right thing to do for job seekers and the smart thing \nto do for our economy. The very modest $300-a-week average benefit, \nwhich our bill restores, helps workers stay afloat and cover the \nnecessities as they search for a job. That modest benefit gets pumped \nback into the economy at the local supermarket or gas station. It is \njust commonsense. People will get this--I hope--benefit, and they will \ngo right along and take care of the daily needs of life. They are not \nin a position to stash it away--most of them--and they are not in a \nposition to do anything else but to try to stay afloat through very \ndifficult financial circumstances.\n  Unemployment remains stubbornly high in my State, and across the \nUnited States. The March employment report, while positive, showed we \nstill have much more to do to strengthen our economic \nrecovery, especially for the 10.5 million Americans looking for work, \nincluding 3.7 million of the long-term unemployed. Again, this benefit \nwe propose is particularly directed at these long-term unemployed \nAmericans.\n\n  That is why this is a critical effort in our attempts to strengthen \nour economy--restoring these benefits. We have never let these benefits \nlapse when the long-term unemployment rate is higher than 1.3 percent--\nand today it is nearly twice that at roughly 2.6 percent. We have acted \non a bipartisan basis, on a fiscally responsible basis, on a basis that \nrecognizes not only the needs of families but the need to help further \ngrow our economy. Now it is time for the House to act that way--\nresponsibly fiscally and responsibly to our neighbors and our \nconstituents, on a bipartisan basis, to get this bill done quickly and \nget it to the President.\n  It is my hope the House of Representatives stops blocking this. This \nis fully paid for. It is fiscally responsible. It is a bipartisan \neffort. It is what every one of our constituents says we should be \ndoing more of--responsible, thoughtful, bipartisan legislation. We have \ndone our part in the Senate and now it is up to the House. I hope they \nmove quickly--this week indeed--to get this relief to millions of \nAmericans.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to take a look back at the \nevolution of our Federal budget over the past few years, as we moved \nfrom deficits and debt not seen since the years surrounding World War \nII to our current budget predicament, which still involves deficits and \ndebt that are far too high.\n  The Federal deficit in fiscal year 2009 was nearly 10 percent of our \neconomy. This was due partly to efforts to battle the financial crisis \nand partly to ineffective and reckless spending measures like the so-\ncalled stimulus.\n  Since then, the deficit has fallen. From the rhetoric of the \nadministration and its allies here in Congress, you would think that \ndeficit reduction has been accomplished almost exclusively through \nspending cuts. Indeed, in an effort to demonstrate his reasonableness \nin calling for even more tax hikes, President Obama often touts the \n``tough spending cuts'' that have taken place under his administration.\n  Of course, after spending ballooned in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 to \nalmost a quarter of the size of our entire economy, it eventually had \nto be curtailed. With a recovering economy, along with tax hikes \nengineered by the administration and its allies in Congress, deficits \nhave admittedly come down.\n  Unfortunately, however, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice has told us, the deficit reprieve will be short lived. The CBO \ntells us clearly that after 2015, the deficit will rise again and, as a \nconsequence, the Federal debt remains on an unsustainable path.\n  As the CBO and every credible budget analyst has made clear, our \nfiscal path is unsustainable because our entitlements are \nunsustainable--that means Social Security, that means Medicare and \nMedicaid, and that means the Affordable Care Act.\n  We know those programs cannot be sustained on their current \ntrajectories. Yet the administration and its allies refuse to do \nanything about it.\n  The Senate Democratic budget left entitlements virtually untouched. \nThe President's budget offers little in the way of structural \nentitlement reforms necessary to put these programs on sound fiscal \nfooting. In fact, with his latest budget, President Obama has even \nretreated on reforms that he has offered in the past.\n  But let's look back on how our budget has evolved over the last few \nyears. If you listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle and \ntheir supporters, the Federal Government has significantly scaled back \non spending which, they say, is responsible for almost all the changes \nin the Federal deficit since the outsized deficits in fiscal years 2009 \nand 2010.\n  We hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle about how \nthey have ``slashed'' spending. We hear about ``austerity,'' as though \nit is something inherently evil.\n\n[[Page S2353]]\n\n  For example, in June of 2013, the leftwing Center for American \nProgress said that ``we have enacted about $2.5 trillion in deficit \nreduction with about three-quarters coming from spending cuts.''\n  In March of this year, Vice President Biden's former aide Jared \nBernstein wrote in the New York Times that we have generated $2.5 \ntrillion in deficit savings, with 77 percent coming from spending cuts.\n  In February of this year, the Senate Budget Committee chairman wrote \nto her Senate Democratic colleagues that since August 2010, we have had \n``$3.3 trillion in deficit reduction put in place over the last few \nyears'' with 77 percent claimed as coming from spending reductions.\n  Depending on who you listen to, deficits have been reduced by $2.5 \ntrillion or $3.3 trillion or maybe more. No matter the number, the \nclaimed reduction stemming from spending cuts usually ends up at around \n75 percent or more. That would mean that deficit reduction has been \naccomplished by a 3-to-1 or higher ratio of spending cuts to tax highs. \nOf course, all of those deficit reduction and spending reduction claims \nrepresent promises for the future.\n  They are measured relative to some artificial so-called budget \nbaseline or yardstick, which can pretty much be anything that you want \nit to be. Pick one yardstick and you get one result. Pick a different \nyardstick and you get a different result. But it has been recorded that \nin fiscal year 2009, the Federal deficit was more than $1.4 trillion or \nalmost 10 percent of GDP at the time.\n  Also on the books is that in fiscal year 2013, our most recently \nclosed fiscal year, the deficit was around $680 billion or just over 4 \npercent of GDP at that time. Therefore, deficit reduction we have seen \nbetween fiscal years 2009 and 2013, which is a 4-year period, has been \nabout $735 billion. That is not $2.5 trillion. That is not $3.3 \ntrillion.\n  The larger deficit reduction numbers are derived almost entirely from \nfuture promises to reduce spending, promises that we are pretty darn \nsure are never going to be kept, based upon all of the past history of \nthis country and the Democratic Party, by the way.\n  Once again, in terms of real actual deficit reduction, the number \ncomes in at roughly $735 billion. Keep in mind all the rhetoric about \ndeficit reduction consisting of 3-to-1 spending reductions to tax \nhikes. Well, if that is what we would have enacted, we would imagine \nthose ratios would have been at least somehow reflected in the deficit \nreduction realized over the past 4 years or so.\n  If not, then, let's be clear that they are only promises to reduce \nspending, promises that the current and future Congresses can undo with \nthe stroke of a pen. If past experience is the norm, you can count on \nit. You can count on undoing those promises. I have been in the \nSenate--this is my 38th year. I have heard countless promises to rein \nin spending in the future. The fraction of those promises that have \nended up being kept is very small.\n  Promises notwithstanding, let's go back over the past 4 fiscal years \nand see what has happened. As I said, from fiscal year 2009 to 2013, \nthe deficit has gone down by $735 billion. No one disputes this, \ncertainly not my friends on the other side of the aisle, who have used \nthis number as justification for turning their spending engine back to \nfull throttle.\n  Given all that they said about spending cuts having been responsible, \non a 3-to-1 basis for deficit reduction, the question becomes: Is 75 \npercent of the deficit reduction we have seen over the last 4 years \nattributable to spending cuts or austerity? The answer is not even \nclose. The $736 billion of deficit reduction has been accomplished with \n$670 billion of increased revenues, and only $65 billion of spending \nreductions, which on a basis of around $3.5 trillion of annual spending \nis a reduction of below 2 percent.\n  I will say that again. The $735 billion of deficit reduction from \nfiscal year 2009 to 2013 has been accomplished by and large through \nhigher tax revenue. Specifically, more than 91 percent of the deficit \nreduction has stemmed from higher taxes, and less than 9 percent from \nreductions in spending.\n  Less than 9 percent of deficit reduction stems from spending cuts is \na far cry from the 75 percent or more that my friends on the other side \nof the aisle claim. Those claims are based on promises of future \nspending reductions and budget projections. Yes, those claims are based \non carefully crafted budget baselines or yardsticks that my friends \ncreatively construct. All of this is future, which we all know will \nnever come to pass.\n  But if we had enacted budgetary changes aimed at reducing deficits \nthat involved anything near a 3-to-1 ratio of spending cuts to tax \nincreases, then you would think it would have at least started to slow \nup over the past 4 fiscal years. As I said, however, it is not even \nclose. Of course, some of the revenue increases have reflected the \neconomy recovering from the recession to its current state, which by \nthe way remains sluggish.\n  But the 2013 numbers begin to reflect recent tax hikes, engineered by \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle. Moving forward, we can \nexpect even more revenue to be extracted from economy from tax hikes, \nincluding the higher tax rates that were passed last year in the fiscal \ncliff deal, along with the myriad of taxes included as part of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  We have already seen in fiscal year 2014 through February Federal tax \nrevenues hitting a record high for the first 5 months of the fiscal \nyear relative to a similar period of any past fiscal year. Yet, even as \nthe revenue gushes in, my friends on the other side of the aisle want \nto double down with even more tax hikes. Let's not think for a minute \nthat their demand for higher taxes has anything to do with reining in \nthe deficit or reducing our debts.\n\n  Instead, the proposals from Democrats are for even more spending, \nmore redistribution, and an even more bigger government. The \nPresident's recent budget is exhibit No. 1. Of course, you will not \nhear it being called ``inefficient and wasteful government spending.'' \nNo, you will hear about investments. You will not hear the term \n``redistribution.'' No, you will hear about the wonderfully egalitarian \ngoal of fairness, as judged by the norms of Democrats.\n  You will not hear about big government controlling an outsized and \nincreasing share of economic activity in our country. No, you will hear \nabout how virtually every private sector company in virtually every \nsector of the economy acts abusively or out of greed, without regard \nfor others, in search of tax loopholes to exploit to the detriment of \nthe middle class.\n  Once again, it is clear from the budget data already in the books \nover the past 4 fiscal years that the vast majority of deficit \nreduction, more than 91 percent of it, has come from increased revenue \nextracted from the private sector. Less than 9 percent has come from \nany kind of spending restraint. Those are facts. Those are the numbers \non the books. Those data do not depend on CBO projections. They do not \ndepend on picking a baseline. They do not rely on budget assumptions.\n  What these numbers tell us is that virtually none of the so-called \nausterity or slashed spending that my friends on the other side of the \naisle have pretended to endure have occurred in the real world.\n  As we continue to hear from my friends on the other side of the aisle \nabout how our budget challenge has faded away, and about the trillions \nand trillions of deficit reduction that has been accomplished through \nspending cuts, let's keep in mind our recent track record. That record \nis clear.\n  I will say it again just to make sure the point is not lost on \nanyone.\n  The spending restraint we have seen since the outside spending sprees \nin fiscal years 2009 and 2010 has been minor. The vast majority of \ndeficit reduction we have seen to date, more than 91 percent of it has \nresulted from increased revenue. The past 4 fiscal years have shown no \nevidence of the ongoing promises of 3-to-1 spending cuts to tax hikes.\n  We do not need to increase taxes yet again. We have already done \nthat. We do not need to declare deficit and debt victory and turn the \nspeeding spigots back on to maximum flow. Our fiscal challenge remains \nwhere it has been for some time now. We have unsustainable growth in \nour entitlement spending and we need to discuss and enact structural \nreforms to our entitlement programs in order to put them and our fiscal \nposition on a more sustainable course.\n\n[[Page S2354]]\n\n  Democrats, of course, have other ideas. For instance, take a look at \npage 33 of the President's budget. The document discusses the future \nunsustainable deficits and debt and alludes to a large tax increase \nthat is undefined. Here is what it says, ``Even with reforms to \nMedicare and other entitlements and tough choices . . . we will need \nadditional revenue to maintain our commitments to seniors.''\n  As I said, my friends on the other side never tire of asking for more \nmoney from our American people--never tire of it. For example, both the \nPresident's budget and the budget proposed by Senate Democrats last \nyear envisioned revenue increases of over $1 trillion. That apparently \nis their answer to the entitlement question--not reforms, not \nstructural changes, but ``additional revenues.''\n  If you are going to try to fix our entitlement problems entirely on \nthe revenue side of the ledger, it is going to take far more revenue \nthan what my friends on the other side of the aisle have previously \nproposed. If that is the route they want to go, they should at least be \nhonest with the American people about where the revenue will come from \nand who will be paying for it. The American people deserve to know. I \nthink it is about time our friends on the other side explained it to \nthem. Do not count on that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Cuba\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, we heard news a week or so ago that the \nU.S. Government, through the Agency for International Development, was \nconducting a program in Cuba titled ZunZuneo.\n  It was an attempt to set up a kind of alternative twitter account, \nand the intent was certainly noble--to increase access of ordinary \nCubans to information that would help and assist them.\n  I have no issue with programs such as this. I think overall they are \ngood. The more we can have people have Internet access and meaningful \ncontent is good, but I and many others do have an issue with the Agency \nfor International Development--USAID--undertaking this program.\n  USAID's mission is to help with humanitarian needs and to promote \ndemocratic development around the world. It need not, should not, \nengage in covert--or in their case they are saying it wasn't covert, \nthey are calling it discreet. Either way, it casts suspicion on other \nactivities that USAID is undertaking around the world.\n  USAID is in some very tough places around the world--delivering \nsupplies into South Sudan, for example. We work with the people in \nSyria--not within the country but just outside the country. We work in \nmany dangerous parts of the world, and the last thing we need is \nsuspicion cast on USAID where people think it is an arm of the CIA. It \njust shouldn't be done. I think USAID does great work around the world \nand shouldn't involve itself with work of this type.\n  With regard to Cuba itself, as I said, I think our goal should be to \nmake sure that Cubans are better informed, that we have increased \ncontact, and that we have more American influence there.\n  That could be most easily forwarded by simply allowing Americans to \ntravel to Cuba. It is the only country in the world where we have a \npolicy that you have to get a specific license--where only certain \nclasses of people are allowed to go there. That simply makes no sense \nat all.\n  If our goal is to make sure that Cuban people are aware of what is \ngoing on in the world, that they get real information outside of the \ngovernment sources--the government in Cuba denies Cuban people the \nability to get good, meaningful information--we ought to be all about \nmaking sure they have access to that, but the best way to do that is \nsimply allowing Americans to travel there. We do that with other \nrepressive regimes around the world.\n  It has been said--I think Freedom House has Iran as the only \ngovernment that is more restrictive, more authoritarian, and more \nrepressive than the Cuban regime. Yet we allow Americans to travel to \nIran. In Iran, the Iranian Government may restrict who may come in--as \nwill the Cuban Government, I am sure, once we lift our travel ban \nthere. But that ought to be their province. I have often said if \nsomeone is going to limit my travel, it should be a Communist \ngovernment, not my government.\n  As we review this program and as we talk about it in the coming \nweeks--we had a hearing this morning with the head of USAID testifying \nabout it--I hope we simply keep in mind the best way to help the Cuban \npeople to have access to information and to have contact with \nAmericans, to be subject to American influence, freedom, and economic \nopportunity, is to allow Americans to travel freely there. That would \ndo more than any program we could install, any program administered by \nUSAID, the State Department, the CIA or anybody else--just allow \nAmericans to travel to Cuba.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FLAKE. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will make a statement in the nature of a question since \nwe discussed this this morning. We had a lengthy discussion in the \nForeign Relations Committee about this twitter project, whatever it \nwas, and whether it was wise--and I think it was the consensus of our \ncommittee--that if it opens up Cuban people to other ideas and more \ninformation, it is a positive thing.\n  You and I discussed afterward the fact that there are other things we \ncan do. I think you just alluded specifically to them on the floor, and \nI wanted to associate myself with your thinking on this and hope that \nafter some 50-years-plus, some fresh thinking on our foreign policy in \nterms of Cuba may lead to what we ultimately want, and that is giving \nthe Cuban people an opportunity to be part of a real democracy and have \nreal freedoms. Isn't that right?\n  Mr. FLAKE. It is. I thank the Senator.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n\n                              Quorum Call\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll and the following \nSenators entered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n                           [Quorum No. 1 Ex.]\n\n     Carper\n     Durbin\n     Flake\n     Hirono\n     Reid\n     Tester\n     Walsh\n     Warren\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to instruct the Sergeant at Arms to \nrequest the presence of absent Senators, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) \nand the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), \nthe Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. \nHoeven), the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Burr), and the Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Blunt).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A quorum is present.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. We are here this afternoon because Republicans are holding \nthe confirmation of two important nominations. Earlier today the Senate \nvoted to invoke cloture on Michelle Friedland to the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. So the only question is, when will she be made a \nFederal judge in the Ninth Circuit.\n  There are some who say that 30 hours should run. They can speak for \nthemselves why they insist on doing so. There is no question it is not \nto debate the nomination. It is just to do nothing, to stand around \nhere and do nothing.\n  Few, if any, Senators have come to the floor to express any reason to \noppose this good woman. She was nominated 9 months ago by President \nObama. So it is time to confirm this well-qualified nominee. Enough \nstalling has taken place.\n  She graduated second in her class at Stanford University Law School. \nShe clerked for Sandra Day O'Connor in the Supreme Court. She has been \na partner in a prominent law firm.\n  The Ninth Circuit is the busiest circuit in the entire country. The \nSenate confirmed 18 of President Bush's circuit court nominees within a \nweek of being reported out of committee. This woman, as I already \nindicated, was 13 months ago. We have 30 other judicial nominees \npending on the calendar. We have 85 vacancies on the Federal courts. \nThere is no reason to delay this nomination.\n  There is no reason to delay the nomination of David Weil to lead the \nWage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor. He is a Boston \nUniversity professor, a Harvard University researcher.\n  I am sure it is a little difficult for people watching this to \nunderstand why Republicans are demanding that we waste time, because \nthat is all it is. But I guess the American people have become \naccustomed to wasting time. That is what they have tried to do for 5 \nyears. We have wasted time because of issues such as this. The staff \nhas to be here. We have wasted so much time that we could be working on \nimportant issues.\n  The Republicans have come to the floor saying: We want amendments. \nThe reason we don't deal with that kind of stuff is because we spend so \nmuch time on this. We have wasted thousands of hours during the 5 \nyears, and that is very unfortunate. The Republicans are stalling so \nmuch.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time until 4:00 today be equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form; that at 4:00 p.m. all \npostcloture time be yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote, with \nno intervening action or debate, on Calendar No. 574; further, \nfollowing disposition of the nomination, the Senate proceed to vote on \ncloture for Executive Calendar No. 623; if cloture is invoked, all \npostcloture time will be yielded back and the Senate will proceed to \nvote on confirmation of the nomination; that if confirmed, the motion \nto reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nthe nomination; that any statements related to the nomination be \nprinted in the Record, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, and I would offer an \nalternative; but before I do that, I wish to say to my colleagues in \nthe U.S. Senate that, first of all, there is controversy about this \nnominee. Let's make that clear. And second, the majority leader said \nmaybe the people of this country don't really understand what is going \non.\n  They understand what is going on. We are working under the rules that \nthe majority changed by ignoring the rules of the U.S. Senate in \nNovember. So as the majority leader knows, we have not yielded back \npostcloture time on judicial nominations since the so-called nuclear \noption was triggered last November.\n  We have followed the rules of the U.S. Senate for regular order on \nall judges before the Senate in the last 5 months, just exactly the way \nthe rules were changed in November. So there is 30 hours of postcloture \ndebate on this nomination.\n  Therefore, I would ask the consent request be modified so that the \nvote on confirmation would occur at 5:30 p.m., Monday, April 28, when \nwe return from the April recess. This would allow the Senate to process \nthe pending cloture nomination on the wage and hour nominee this \nafternoon and set that confirmation vote also for Monday, when we \nreturn on April 28. That is the alternative I offer to the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. I reserve my right to object.\n  Madam President, obviously this is not a dissertation on logic, \nbecause if it were, why in the world would we want to waste 30 hours \ndoing nothing? And that is what we are doing, 30 hours.\n  I know my friend from Iowa has been on the Judiciary Committee a long \ntime. I appreciate all he has done, but it is apparent the only reason \nthe Senator from Iowa expresses delay is for delay itself, no other \nreason.\n  Now, I may have missed it. There could have been someone talking \nabout what a bad person she is or why she is not qualified, but I must \nhave missed that. I heard little, if any, opposition. In fact, I have \nheard none for this nominee. I have heard only obstruction for \nobstruction's sake, delay for delay's sake.\n  This has been going on for 5 years. It appears that the Senator \nwishes his caucus to be the caucus that ``just says no,'' and that is \nwhat they did here.\n  So, Madam President, I object to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, but \nto remind everybody, when the majority leader says that nothing is \nbeing done on judges, we have confirmed 233 judges and only disapproved \nthe 2; so don't ever try to sell the American people on the idea that \nthe Senate is not doing its work on getting judges approved.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. As I indicated, this is something without logic. We have \nhad a lot of judges approved after wasting hundreds of hours of time \ndoing nothing. We have judges reported out of the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously, led by our good friend, the senior Senator from Vermont, \nthe chairman of the Committee, who does such an admirable job. They \nwere reported out unanimously, and they stall--the Republicans stall, \ndelay, obstruct, and then we have a vote here and it passes very \neasily. Their only purpose for the delaying is for delay's sake. They \nare obstructing this as they have obstructed everything over the last 5 \nyears.\n  I know people complain about the rule change that was made. Where \nwould we be in this country without having changed that rule?\n  I got a letter today from Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, outlining \nnine important people in the Department of Defense who need to be \nconfirmed. Most of the positions have been without anybody there for \nmore than a\n\n[[Page S2356]]\n\nyear. We have numerous ambassadors to important countries around the \nworld, and they are not being confirmed because they are being stalled. \nWhy? Why could we not have these people go do their work? They have \nbeen nominated. Countries all over the world are without ambassadors \nfrom the United States. Where would we be if we had not changed that \nrule?\n  Now we are slogging through these nominations. It is kind of slow \nbecause of the inordinate amount of time that we are caused to eat up. \nBut the longer my friend from Iowa talks, the more reason there is that \nmaybe we should have changed the rules more than we did.\n  So, unless something changes, we will have a vote tomorrow at 5:00 \np.m. We will have three votes here tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. on Friday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think it is important to put all of this in context. \nMy good friend, the majority leader, broke his word last year when he \nsaid we had settled the issue of what the rules were going to be for \nthe Senate for this Congress. He then broke the Senate rules in order \nto change the Senate rules, setting a very unfortunate precedent, and \ncontinues to abuse the Senate rules by using the device called filling \nthe tree to prevent Members of the Senate, from his party and from our \nparty, from even offering alternatives.\n  Despite this heavyhanded behavior, he expects the minority to simply \nexpedite consideration of, in the case of the matter we are discussing, \na lifetime appointment. As Senator Grassley has pointed out, we are \nsimply exercising our rights under the rules of the Senate. I might say \nmany of these nominees would have been confirmed last December had we \nnot experienced this event perpetrated by the majority in a heavyhanded \nattempt to alter the balance, to change the nature of the Senate with a \nsimple majority. It was an unfortunate decision, but those kinds of \ndecisions have consequences. And all we have done here is exercise, as \nSenator Grassley pointed out, the rights that Senators have under the \nrules of the Senate. If the majority leader doesn't like the way the \nSenate is working, I would recommend that he change his behavior.\n  You know, we don't have a rules problem. We have a behavior problem.\n  We have had a couple of examples of trying to edge back to normal \nhere, where we brought up a bill that was actually open for amendments, \nand amendments were processed from Members on both sides. But it seems \nof late we are back to the old Senate. All we are about is scoring \npartisan points and denying Members the opportunity to offer \namendments.\n  I think most Members on both sides of the aisle came here to be \nSenators, which involves having your committee work taken seriously and \nhaving the opportunity to offer amendments taken seriously. This body--\nwhen it was at its peak and operating the way it should under Members \nof majorities of both parties--has been a more civil place in which \nrights were respected.\n  The Senator from Iowa--the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee--is pointing out that we are simply exercising our rights \nunder the rules of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I am a patient man. At least I try to be. For my friend to \ncome here and have the audacity to talk about my breaking my word--the \ntrouble with that statement is that the whole Senate is here to see \nwhat happened.\n  He said something and I said something. What he said was that we are \nnot going to have all of these filibusters on motions to proceed.\n  For the viewing audience, we wasted so much time just trying to get \non a bill. It is not that easy. You have to file something in the \nSenate, and then you have to wait a day to get on the bill. If they \nobject--and they object hundreds of times--it takes 2 days to get on \nthe bill. Then we vote, wait 30 hours, and then we are only on the \nbill. To get off the bill, we have to go through that process all over \nagain, and we have done that hundreds of times.\n  There have been more filibusters on President Obama's judicial \nnominations than in the entire history of the country for other \nPresidents. We have been a country for a long time--roughly 240 years. \nThere have been more filibusters for President Obama in the course of 5 \nyears than for the previous 235 years.\n  I went to New York and had the good fortune to watch a wonderful \nplay--``All the Way''--about LBJ. That good man--during the time he was \nmajority leader for 6 years--had to overcome one filibuster.\n  As the majority leader in the Senate--because of the performance we \nhave had over here--I had to overcome over 500 filibusters. This is for \nthe country. It is not for me. We have been stymied on everything we \nhave tried to do--everything.\n  We know--it is public record now--that 3 days after Obama was elected \nthe first time, a meeting was held here in Washington, and it has been \nwritten up all over the place. Karl Rove called the meeting with \nothers. They made the decision that their goal was to make sure this \nman never got reelected. To the credit of the Republican leader, he \nsaid: Our goal is to make sure he is never reelected.\n  Well, Obama surprised everybody--except us--and was overwhelmingly \nelected by the American people.\n  They also said in that same meeting: The way we are going to stop him \nfrom being reelected is to object to everything, and that is what they \nhave done. It is unprecedented in the history of our great Republic.\n  I have been here a while. I know how people used to work together, \nbut you can't work together if one side says no to everything. Once in \na while we have had the good fortune to be able to piece together some \nwork with the Republicans. It is getting harder and harder to do, but \nwe have been able to get it done a few times.\n  They have wasted the time of the American people. If there is an \nobjection to this woman, then come to the floor and talk about what is \nwrong with her. She attended one of the finest law schools in America. \nA battle goes on every year, whether it is Harvard, Yale or Stanford, \nand they flip back and forth. It doesn't matter. She is a very fine \nacademic. She clerked for one of the finest Supreme Court justices we \nhave had in the history of the country--by the way, a Republican.\n  What is wrong with her? What do we gain by holding this up? The \ncountry gains nothing. As I have indicated, we have about 140 \nnominations that are being held up over here. My friend, the Republican \nleader, said: Hey, listen, we would have approved them all in December \nanyway. Please. Who in the world thinks that there is a bit of \ncreditability to that?\n  I say to everybody that I am sorry. In 25 hours, I guess, we can come \nhere to vote on these people. All we need is a majority, and that is \nthe way it is. I am so sorry for the inconvenience to everyone, but the \nRepublicans know that for them it is pretty easy. They can just walk \nout of here. They don't have to be here, but we do because it is our \nburden to run the country. They can walk away and take their little \ntrips and go home. We are not going to be able to do that. We have to \nvote and approve these two people.\n  We have a very good judge we need to approve. We have somebody for \nthe Wage and Hour Division at the Department of Labor. That job has \nbeen vacant for a long, long time.\n  Again, I am sorry for the inconvenience to Members, but we have an \nobligation. We have been elected to be Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I have just a couple of brief \nobservations that are relevant to the point. No. 1, we have approved \nmore judges at this point for President Obama than President Bush had \napproved at the same time in his Presidency.\n  No. 2, the majority leader has a curious definition of filibuster. \nThe reason the majority leader has had difficulty getting onto bills is \nbecause as soon as we get on bills, there are no amendments allowed. \nOnce you get past the motion to proceed--I would say to the people who \nmay be listening and are not as deeply steeped in Senate rules--there \nis a 2-step process. You vote to get on a bill, and then you are on the \nbill.\n  What happens is that once we get on the bill, the majority leader has \nmade\n\n[[Page S2357]]\n\nit impossible for Members of his party or ours to offer amendments more \noften than the last six leaders combined. In other words, he gets to \ndecide whether anybody's amendments are considered--either on his side \nor our side. That is what has degraded the Senate. That is what has \nturned the Senate into looking more like the House. In fact, I am told \nof late that the House has voted on more amendments than the Senate. \nThe assistant majority leader used to say--and he was quite right at \nthe time--if you want to have a chance to vote, come to the Senate; \nthat is what the Senate is about. That is not what it has been about in \nrecent times.\n\n  All that is really required to get the Senate back to normal is for \nthe one Member of the Senate who has the right of prior recognition and \nthe right to set the agenda to open the Senate and let Members of both \nparties offer amendments.\n  When we used to be in the majority, I would tell our Members that the \nprice of being in the majority is you have to give the minority their \nvotes. It is an unpleasant experience for us, but that is the way the \nSenate operates, and that is the way you move a bill to completion.\n  There were a couple of times this year when it looked like we were \ngoing to get back to normal. I still hope it is not too late for that. \nIt would be in the best interests of the institution and the best \ninterest of both the majority and minority to begin to restore the \ninstitution to the way it used to operate.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I believe I have the floor.\n  Do I have the floor?\n  Mr. REID. I have the floor. The Senator yielded the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader had not yet yielded the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, if the Senator would yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the majority leader said that there is \nurgent work the Senate needs to turn to, which is why we ought to amend \nthe ordinary rules of the Senate which call for a 30-hour postcloture \nperiod.\n  I ask the distinguished Republican leader if he is aware of any \nurgent work that the majority leader has planned for us to turn to that \nwould be a reason to expedite this particular nomination?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am sure the majority leader will announce at some \npoint what we are going to do next, but I am not quite sure what that \nis at this particular point.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for another \nquestion, I ask the distinguished Republican leader if he is aware--and \nI am confident he is--that the majority leader and other leaders of his \nparty had a press conference last week, I believe it was, announcing \ntheir agenda from this point through the election in November, which \ninvolved issues such as the vote we had yesterday, the vote on the \nincrease in the minimum wage, the vote on extending long-term \nunemployment, and the like. I believe there was a quote in the \narticle--if the Senator will remember like I do--that basically said: \nWe are not interested in legislating. We are just basically interested \nin posturing and politics to help distract the American people from the \nunpopularity of this President's policies and this party's policies.\n  Does the Senator remember something to that effect?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I do. The Senator from Texas is entirely correct. \nThere was a rather candid admission at a press conference that the \nwhole agenda was basically crafted by the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign Committee and that getting an outcome was sort of irrelevant. \nIt was mainly about scoring political points for the fall election here \non the floor of the Senate.\n  If that is one of the urgent items the majority leader has in mind \nthat would somehow be prevented if we had a vote on this judge on the \nMonday after the recess, it is perplexing to reach the conclusion that \nthis is a matter of great urgency for the American people if there is \nno interest whatsoever in getting an outcome.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have heard my friend the Republican \nleader come to the floor often and say: Why don't we work on Fridays? \nMost people work on Fridays. I want to make sure I am right, but I have \nnot seen or heard a single Republican come to the floor and say a \nsingle word about the nominee of the Ninth Circuit--positive or \nnegative. They have not said a single word.\n  A lot of words are being thrown about here--posturing. I wonder if \nsomebody who is a long-term unemployed worker, someone who has been out \nof work a long time--I will give a profile of someone. Not everybody \nfits this description. Let's take the example of somebody who is 55 \nyears old and was laid off because of the recession and can't find a \njob because he or she is overqualified, overeducated--lots of different \nissues as to why they can't find work.\n  We decided that it was important that they get an unemployment \nbenefit extension. About 2 million people agree with that for sure \nbecause they are the ones who lost those benefits. I don't think that \nis posturing. We voted on that, and it passed here. I think we had to \nhave five cloture votes to get there. But because of some very strong-\nwilled Republicans, we were able to do that, and I admire those five \nwho joined with us. They didn't want to do it by name. They said \nsomething we did yesterday. That something that we did yesterday said \nthat if a woman works the same job that a man works, that woman should \nbe paid the same as a man.\n  Is that posturing? I don't think so. My daughter doesn't think so and \nmy granddaughters don't think so. They think it is pretty fair. More \nthan half of the people who are going to college now are women. Over \nhalf of the people in medical school and law school are women. \nShouldn't they be paid the same as men? Is that posturing? I don't \nthink so.\n  Again, there is diversion and distraction from the issue at hand. \nThey wanted to offer amendments, and one was a 350-page amendment that \ncovered everything. In fact, I said it even included the kitchen sink. \nThey are not serious about this. They only want to move from what we \nare trying to do.\n  Do we have anything urgent to do when we get back? If we didn't have \nto go through all of this nonsense--and that is what it is--we would be \nvoting today on minimum wage. That vote would help 1 million people get \nout of poverty and 26 million people would get a raise.\n  Why did we pick the number of $10.10 an hour? Because that gets \npeople out of poverty. It is really important that we understand that \nthis is part of the mantra of the program that Karl Rove and others \ndecided they would do 5 years or more ago, and that is to oppose \neverything that President Obama has done.\n  You cannot talk about what went on before because never in the \nhistory of our great Republic have we had a party--a minority party--\ndetermined to do nothing in the hope that it will get them the majority \nin November. We will find out if their noble experiment works; that is, \noppose everything and people will like us a lot. I don't think that is \ngoing to work. We are here to do the work of the American people. Is it \nright that we have more than 100 people who are being held up for no \nreason other than they want to make sure that if we have somebody who \nis going to be a circuit court judge, we have to file cloture--that is \n2 days--and then we have 30 hours, and then we have--simply moving to a \npiece of legislation, we waste a week getting to it because of their \nobstruction and delay. So it is unfortunate.\n\n  My friends talk about all the great things they have done. I will \ntell my colleagues the great things they have done. I can give lots of \nexamples. We tried to do a highway bill--a highway bill--which is \nimportant for this country. We have a deficit in infrastructure of $3 \ntrillion. It wasn't much better a couple of years ago. So we brought \nthat bill to the floor, and we had this great amendment process. They \nwanted to debate amendments. What did they do? They wanted to stop \nwomen from getting contraceptives. That held up things for a month--a \nmonth--before they finally got some sense and withdrew that.\n  The Republicans made a decision a little more than 5 years ago to \noppose\n\n[[Page S2358]]\n\neverything President Obama wanted or tried to do, and they have stuck \nwith that. It has not been good for the country, and we have situations \njust like we have here.\n  (Mr. SCHATZ assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the majority leader says there is \nimportant work for the Senate to do, and I can think of one urgent \nthing we could do today if the majority leader would consent.\n  The House has passed the reauthorization of the Debbie Smith Act.\n  To remind colleagues, this is money Congress appropriated to the \nDepartment of Justice for grants to local law enforcement agencies and \nforensic labs to test unprocessed rape kits. This is a national \nscandal, the number of unprocessed rape kits which have prevented law \nenforcement from identifying a serial perpetrator of sexual assault, \nmany sometimes not just involving adults but also children.\n  The House has passed the reauthorization of that bill. All it takes \nis for the majority leader and the Senate to consent to take up that \nbill today and pass it to get it to the President's desk.\n  I think that, perhaps, is the most important and most urgent thing we \ncould be doing right now. So I ask the majority leader if he would \nconsent to taking up that bill and passing it in the Senate right now.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the committee, of which I am almost certain \nmy friend is a member--the Judiciary Committee; is that right?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I am on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. REID. He is also a former supreme court justice of Texas.\n  They have reported the bill out of the Judiciary Committee, and my \nfriend was part of that reporting situation. Part of what they reported \nout has the Debbie Smith language in it, but it has more stuff in it \nthan just that. So I would be happy to take a look at that. We can talk \nto the chair of the committee and the ranking member, who is on the \nfloor here today, and if they would be willing to separate this stuff \nhere and have it rather than what was reported out of the committee--\nthey can take a look at this. Senator Leahy was on the floor. He is not \nhere now, but I would be happy to take a look at that.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I may ask one more question of the \nmajority leader, one final question.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, I didn't hear that.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the majority leader yield for one last question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. But before doing that, I have just been informed that \nthis bill that was reported out of the committee on which the senior \nSenator from Texas serves--we have cleared it on our side. If they want \nto clear it today, we will get this out today. All they have to do is \nclear it on their side. We have cleared it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I could ask the majority leader through \nthe Chair, there is the Justice for All Act which, as the leader points \nout, includes things other than the Debbie Smith Act, which has not \ncleared the Senate, which, if it did clear the Senate, would include \nthe Debbie Smith Act. That would be a positive development.\n  There is a separate bill--if the Justice for All Act is not cleared, \nthere is a separate bill which would reauthorize the Debbie Smith Act \nwhich has passed the House. So we could take up just the Debbie Smith \nreauthorization that the House has passed and get that done today, \nwhich I would urge the majority leader to consider, if we can't clear \nthe larger bill, the Justice For All Act. But, frankly, I would be \nhappy with either one. But if we could just do the Debbie Smith Act \ntoday, I think we could call that great progress and a great win for \njustice and for some of these people who have been waiting too long for \nthe law enforcement community to be able to identify the perpetrators \nand get these folks off the street.\n  Mr. REID. The bill that 55 Senators have cleared over here is a bill \nto protect crime victims' rights, to eliminate the substantial backlog \nof DNA samples collected from crime scenes and convicted offenders, to \nimprove and expand the DNA testing capacity of Federal, State, and \nlocal crime laboratories, to increase research and development of new \nDNA testing technologies, to develop new training programs regarding \nthe collection and use of DNA evidence, to provide postconviction \ntesting of DNA evidence to exonerate the innocent, to improve the \nperformance of counsel in State capital cases, and for other purposes. \nWe will pass that right now. We are happy to do it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I may respond to the majority leader, \nthe bill he is referring to is the Justice for All Act, which I \nsupport. But there has been some reason why that bill has not come to \nthe floor and received floor time. I am worried that if we wait to pass \nthat, we will delay the passage of the Debbie Smith Act, which is a \ncomponent of that act, which we could take up, having passed the House, \nand we could take that up today and then deal with the Justice for All \nAct in due course.\n  So I ask the majority leader if he would grant unanimous consent to \ntake up and pass the House-passed reauthorization of the Debbie Smith \nAct, and I ask unanimous consent to that effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. This is what we deal with here. We have a piece of \nlegislation that has been reported out of the committee. It has been \ncleared by the Democrats here in the Senate, and the Republicans are \nnow saying: Well, we like that, but we don't want to do it that way; \nlet's do it some other way.\n  The point is the committee met and reviewed the House legislation and \ndecided they wanted to do more than what the House did. I think we \nshould go forward with what the committee says.\n  I hear my friend the Republican leader and other Republican Senators \nsay: Let's have the committees do their work.\n  They have done their work. We approved their work. We are ready to \npass this right now, which includes the Debbie Smith language but does \na lot more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I asked the distinguished ranking member \nof the Judiciary Committee to remind me what the challenge is with the \nJustice for All Act. We have a Member on our side who is unfortunately \nnot here today because of medical concerns who has concerns about that \nbill, so we cannot pass that bill by unanimous consent over that \nSenator's objection. What we can pass is the Debbie Smith Act, which is \na piece of this. There is no objection to that, that I know of. Then we \ncould get this rape kit issue addressed today, while we take up the \nconcerns of the absent Senator, who is necessarily not here because of \nmedical issues, when he returns and when the Senate returns.\n  So I would reiterate my unanimous consent request that the Senate \ntake up and pass by unanimous consent the House-passed Debbie Smith \nAct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, more \ndiversion and delay. The Judiciary Committee took what the House did, \nreviewed it, and said: We can do better.\n  It is here on the floor right now. Now they are saying: Even though \nthe Judiciary Committee did it--and we are being told all the time to \nlet the committees do their work--we don't like what they did. Let them \ndo something else.\n  The Debbie Smith Act is important, but the Justice for All Act is a \nlot better than that. Why don't we approve that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the majority leader thinks this is a zero \nsum game. This could be a win-win. Debbie Smith, whom I have met and I \ndaresay virtually every Member of this body knows, is a passionate \nadvocate for this cause, hence the naming of this statute, this law, on \nher behalf. She recognized that these unprocessed rape kits are a \nnational scandal and that people like her who had been victims of \nsexual assault needed help from the Federal Government to help provide \nfunds to local law enforcement agencies to test and process these kits \nso as\n\n[[Page S2359]]\n\nto identify the perpetrators and get them off the street.\n  So what Debbie Smith has asked me and I daresay the majority leader \nand all of us to do is to take up this piece of the bill. We can do \nthat, and I think we will have done a good thing today. If we can't \ntake up the Justice for All Act because of other concerns people have--\nthis shouldn't be a zero sum game. We could pass the Debbie Smith Act \ntoday, and then we could take up the Justice for All Act when we return \nfollowing the recess. It doesn't have to be a zero sum game.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. This has been cleared on this side for more than 2 weeks--\nmore than 2 weeks. This is what is going on in the Senate. The \nRepublicans basically oppose everything. That is what they decided they \nwere going to do, and they do it. And they come back and say: We \nreported this out of the committee.\n  I read what is in it. It is a very good piece of legislation. But \nthey said: We don't like that. Let's forget about the committee process \nand do something with what the House did.\n  We have a committee structure here that I have tried to follow. I \nadmire the work done by Senator Leahy. He led this piece of legislation \nout of his committee. I accept it and I approve it, as do all other 54 \nDemocratic Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2359-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2359-S2362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DIGITAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2013\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 994) to expand the Federal Funding \n     Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to increase \n     accountability and transparency in Federal spending, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported substitute amendment be withdrawn; the Carper \nsubstitute amendment, which is at the desk, be considered; the Carper \namendment at the desk be agreed to; the Carper substitute, as amended, \nbe agreed to; and the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after the last exchange, I would point out \nthat the Senate now has acted on a very important piece of legislation \nthat has been 2 years in the works, that actually does reflect the \nability for us to come together in a bipartisan consensus. So I rise \ntoday to discuss the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act--or \nDATA Act--an important bill that makes sure taxpayers and policymakers \ncan track every dollar the Federal Government spends.\n  It is pretty unbelievable that in this day and age, we don't have an \neasily accessible Web site for tracking every Federal tax dollar. \nBelieve it or not, we do not. Instead, we have an incomplete and \nthoroughly confusing structure of financial reporting which most people \ncan't understand.\n  I have served in business. I have served as Governor of the \nCommonwealth of Virginia. So I have done business accounting and State \ngovernment accounting. There is nothing like Federal Government \naccounting and the lack of standards and transparency.\n  Our taxpayers deserve to know where their money goes, and it is our \nobligation to share that information in a clear and direct way. Today, \nSenator Portman and I, originally, along with Senator Coburn and \nSenator Carper, rise--and now that the Senate has acted, we are \nactually taking a giant step to correct that problem and to make sure \ntaxpayers actually get the transparency they deserve.\n  Since the Federal Government spends more than $3.7 trillion each \nyear, with more than $1 trillion in awards, accurately tracking these \nfunds in a consistent way can definitely be a big job. But the data \ncollected by the budget shops, the accountants, the procurement \nofficers, the grant makers should be combined and reconciled and then \npresented in a relevant, user-friendly, and transparent way. The \nvarious systems should be able to work together based on consistent \nfinancial standards so that policymakers and the public can track the \nfull cycle of Federal spending. In a word, the public should be able to \n``Wikipedia'' where and how the Federal Government spends its money, \nand quite honestly, that is what the DATA Act will do.\n\n  The DATA Act will make four important improvements that I want to \nquickly highlight.\n  First, it creates transparency for all Federal funds. The DATA Act \nwill expand the current site of usaspending.gov to include spending \ndata for all Federal funds by appropriation, Federal agency, program, \nfunction, as well as maintain the current reporting for Federal awards \nlike contracts, grants, and loans.\n  Second--and this is a giant step forward; we are not going to get all \nthe way there--we are starting down this path of setting government-\nwide financial data standards. We closely monitored the efforts to \nincrease transparency for the Recovery Act funds a few years back, and \none reason--even for folks who did not like the Recovery Act--that \noversight was successful is because they had consistent standards for \nreporting the data. Our taxpayers were able to see where the funds and \nprojects were located in their communities.\n  So the DATA Act requires the Department of the Treasury to establish \ngovernment-wide financial data standards for Federal agencies so that \nevery term reported is consistent across the Federal Government. This \nshould clearly improve the quality of data.\n  Too often we see an item appear in one area as a grant and in another \narea as an expenditure. Trying to sort through what's what is virtually \nimpossible. This part of the DATA Act will help clear that up.\n  Third, so we do not simply layer on additional reporting requirements \nwithout greater accountability, it actually reduces recipient reporting \nrequirements. The DATA Act requires OMB to review the established \nreporting requirements for contracts, grants, and loans to reduce \ncompliance costs based on these new financial data standards.\n  I have long been concerned--and I know many of my colleagues on both \nside of the aisle--about the compliance costs for recipients of Federal \nfunds. Too often a grantee has to report not once or twice but \nsometimes up to a half dozen times the exact same information. We have \nseen this in Virginia with many of our universities, such as UVA, where \nthey actually have to report multiple times the same information to \nmultiple agencies.\n  If all this redundancy were streamlined, recipients such as the \nUniversity of Virginia or the University of Tennessee could actually \ndirect more money to programs and less to administrative costs.\n  Fourth, it improves data quality. Under the DATA Act, the inspectors \ngeneral at each agency will be required\n\n[[Page S2362]]\n\nto provide a report every 2 years on the quality and accuracy of the \nfinancial data provided to usaspending.gov. The GAO will create a \ngovernment-wide report on data quality and accuracy. Too often the data \nthat is reported at this point does not meet appropriate standards.\n  We must have a reliable system in place to track Federal funds and \ncompare spending across Federal agencies to get the best value for \ntaxpayers and reduce duplication.\n  In fact, in the GAO's annual report on duplication released this \nweek, it highlighted the need for better data and specifically called \nout the limitations. GAO described a ``lack of reliable budget and \nperformance information and a comprehensive list of federal programs'' \nas one of the biggest challenges in addressing duplication.\n  I know many of the Members, when I started talking about data \nstandards and better accountability, headed for the exists. I recognize \nthis is not a topic that necessarily excites folks. But I see my \ncolleague, the Senator from Tennessee, on the floor--a former Governor, \nas was I. If we are going to get better value for our taxpayers, we \nhave to start with good data, we have to start with a better ability to \nmonitor that data and follow it.\n  In a world where people can Google all kinds of information, we ought \nto be able to follow the money in terms of where our taxpayer dollars \nhead. We ought to make sure the recipients of those taxpayer grants can \nreport that information in a single, consistent, and clear way. \nPolicymakers and taxpayers should be able to assess the value of the \ndollars we invest in these programs.\n  This has been a long and winding path. As a relatively new Member of \nthe Senate--and I hear some of the debates about some of the old days \nin the Senate--I am not sure I was here in the old days. But this is a \ncase where, after a 2-year period, working with Members of the House--\nChairman Issa and Ranking Member Cummings in the House--and working in \nthe Senate with Senator Carper and Senator Coburn--Senator Coburn who \nis out today for health reasons--and my colleague who joined with me in \npushing this bill from day one, Senator Portman--who, if time allows, \nwill get back from a speech to add his comments as well--I would like \nto thank these Members.\n  I would also like to thank all of the Senate cosponsors for their \nsupport of the DATA Act, including members of our Budget Committee, the \nGovernment Performance Task Force that I chair.\n  I would like to thank in particular Senators Coons, Whitehouse, \nAyotte, Johnson, and our Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, and my \nstaff, Amy Edwards, and all the others who have been relentless on \nworking this through with other committees and the administration to \nmake sure we got this bill done.\n  So while we may not have resolved all the issues of the day, today \nthe Senate acted in a unanimous, bipartisan way to actually provide \nbetter value for taxpayers, more transparency, and less bureaucracy. I \nwould say for a Thursday afternoon--with all the other discussion going \non--work well done.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2362-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2362-S2371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF MICHELLE T.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from North Carolina and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy \nfor 20 minutes, and following that the Senator from Iowa be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Student Athletes\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina and I \nwere both involved in intercollegiate athletics. He was a scholarship \nathlete at Wake Forest University and I was a nonscholarship track \nperson at Vanderbilt University several years before that.\n  We are here today to make a few comments on the recent ruling by a \nregional director of the National Labor Relations Board that defines \nstudent athletes as employees of the university. It affects only \nprivate universities for now--not the University of Tennessee. But it \nwould affect Wake Forest, where the Senator from North Carolina was an \noutstanding football player, and it would affect Vanderbilt, where I \nattended.\n  I guess our message to the NCAA and intercollegiate athletes is: We \nhope they will understand the opinion of one regional director of the \nNational Labor Relations Board is not the opinion of the entire Federal \nGovernment. That is the message I would like to deliver.\n  I would refer back--and then I will go to the Senator from North \nCarolina--to 25 years ago, when I was the president of the University \nof Tennessee, and I was asked to serve on the Knight Commission on \nIntercollegiate Athletics. It was headed by the president of North \nCarolina, Bill Friday, and the head of Notre Dame, Father Hesburgh--a \npretty distinguished group of individuals from around the country--to \ntake a look at intercollegiate athletics.\n  The major conclusion they came to was that presidents need to assert \nmore institutional control over athletics. But here is something that \nthis group of university presidents and others emphasized. They said:\n\n       We reject the argument that the only realistic solution to \n     the problem [of intercollegiate athletics]--\n\n  And there have always been some--\n\n     is to drop the student-athlete concept, put athletes on the \n     payroll, and reduce or even eliminate their responsibilities \n     as students.\n       Such a scheme has nothing to do with education, the purpose \n     for which colleges and universities exist. Scholarship \n     athletes are already paid in the most meaningful way \n     possible: with a free education. The idea of intercollegiate \n     athletics is that the teams represent their institutions as \n     true members of the student body, not as hired hands. Surely \n     American higher education has the ability to devise a better \n     solution to the problems of intercollegiate athletics than \n     making professionals out of the players, which is no solution \n     at all but rather an unacceptable surrender to despair.\n\n  This was the Knight Commission 25 years ago.\n  I would ask the Senator from North Carolina, does he not think that \nwhile there may be some issues with intercollegiate athletics--and we \ncould talk about what some of those are--that unionization of \nintercollegiate athletics is not the solution to the problem?\n  Mr. BURR. Let me say to my good friend, the Senator from Tennessee--\nwho not only was a walk-on track member at Vanderbilt, but was the \npresident of the University of Tennessee, the Governor of Tennessee, \nthe Secretary of Education, and now is a Senator--his credentials allow \nhim to say whatever he wants to on this issue with a degree of \nknowledge.\n  It was Teddy Roosevelt who identified the challenge of college \nfootball, and through his attempt to get Harvard and Yale and a couple \nof other universities to address the risk, the NCAA was created.\n  The amazing thing to Senator Alexander and myself is that we have \nthis governing body today that by all practical observations has done a \ngreat job of regulating college sports. It is the reason we have \nfabulous playoffs. It is the reason we have integrity in the \nscholarship system. But, more importantly, it is the reason we have \ntop-quality athletes who go into these schools, where less than 1 \npercent become pros. Ninety-nine percent of them are reliant on a great \neducation for a fabulous outcome in life. To do anything that changes \nthe balance of what they have been able to create is ludicrous and I \nthink what troubles me, and I think it troubles Senator Alexander.\n  These are not some misguided college football players. This is the \nUnited Steelworkers. Let me say that again because I do not think \npeople understand it. This is the United Steelworkers who have put up \nthe money so that these players from Northwestern would go to the NLRB \nand say: We want to unionize at Northwestern University. Well, on the \nface of it, it creates a great inequity between public and private \nschools, where we have a governing body that tries to make this process \nas equitable as it can.\n  But let me make this point: If you want to drive the rest of the \nschools out of major sports, then do this. Only 10 percent of our \nNation's athletic programs make money. That means 90 percent of them \nlose in the athletic department. But for the quality of life of\n\n[[Page S2363]]\n\nall students, not just athletes, they continue and their alumni \ncontinue to subsidize it.\n  I agree with my good friend from Tennessee. This would be a huge \nmistake, and it is time for those players at Northwestern to think \nabout more than those individuals who have fronted them the money to \nbring this case.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The question should be obvious: What does a student at Wake Forest or \nVanderbilt or--and we are using the private universities, again, \nbecause those are the only ones affected by this decision for now--but \nif you are at Vanderbilt University, according to the vice chancellor, \nthe total scholarship could be nearly $60,000. That is the value each \nyear of your athletic scholarship. Times four--so you are up to one-\nquarter of a million dollars.\n  The College Board says--roughly estimates--that a college degree adds \n$1 million to your earnings during a lifetime.\n  So the idea that student athletes do not get anything in return for \ntheir playing a sport is financially wrong. And just speaking as one \nindividual who had the privilege to participate for 2 years as a \nstudent athlete without getting anything--I had scholarships, but they \nwere not athletic scholarships--the discipline, the memories, the \ncompetition, the chance to be in the Southeastern Conference \nTournament--that is very important to me. It was then, just as \nathletics always is. It is a rare privilege to participate in \nintercollegiate athletics.\n  The presidents have looked at the problems of intercollegiate \nathletics. And there are some. But people forget--and I know the \nSenator from North Carolina is aware of this. But let's say you are at \nVanderbilt and you have a $58,000 scholarship--tuition, room and board \nbut your total costs are over $60,000 and let's say you come from a \npoor family that has no money and you are put in the embarrassing \nposition of not having walking-around money, money to go out and get a \nhamburger, or whatever you want to do.\n  Forty percent of student athletes in America also have a Pell grant \nsimilar to 40 percent of all students in America have a Pell grant, and \nthe Pell grant can be, on average, $3,600. So that is $300 a month that \ncould be added.\n  Now, perhaps there are other issues that ought to be addressed. But I \nwonder if the Senator from North Carolina would speak more about one \nthing he talked about. I imagine Florida State, the University of \nTennessee, Stanford, maybe Wake Forest--they will all be fine with a \nmore expensive athletic program. But what is going to happen to the \nsmaller schools? What is going to happen to the minor sports? What is \ngoing to happen to the title IX women's sports if for some reason a \nunion forces universities to have a much more expensive athletic \nprogram for a few sports?\n  Mr. BURR. Well, let me say to my good friend from Tennessee, I will \nquote the words of Wake Forest President Nathan Hatch, a former provost \nat Notre Dame, in an editorial he wrote in the Wall Street Journal just \nthis week.\n  He says:\n\n       To call student-athletes employees is an affront to those \n     players who are taking full advantage of the opportunity to \n     get an education. Do we really want to signal to society and \n     high-school students that making money is the reason to play \n     a sport in college, as opposed to getting an education that \n     will provide a lifetime benefit?\n\n  President Patrick Harker, president of the University of Delaware, in \nthe same article said:\n\n       Turning student athletes into salaried employees would \n     endanger the existence of varsity sports on many college \n     campuses. Only about 10 percent of Division I college sports \n     programs turn a profit, and most of them, like our $28 \n     million athletic program at the University of Delaware, lose \n     money. Changing scholarship dollars into salary would almost \n     certainly increase the amount schools have to spend on \n     sports, since earnings are taxed and scholarships are not. In \n     order just to match the value of a scholarship, the \n     university would have to spend more.\n\n  At Wake Forest, let me say, today a scholarship is worth $45,600 in \ntuition in fees, $15,152 in room and board, $1,100 in books. I will say \nto my good friend from Tennessee, I am not sure if there is still $15 \nof laundry money a month that exists under a scholarship. That is what \nit was when I was there. I daresay I hope it is more than that today \nbecause I do not think you can do laundry for $15 a month.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if I can ask the Senator to reflect a little \nbit on some of the practical consequences of a student athlete suddenly \nfinding himself thought of as an employee of the university. I wonder, \nfor example, would the employee of the university, the quarterback or \nwhatever position he plays, have to pay taxes on his income? I would \nthink so.\n  I was thinking about the recent changes in Federal labor law that \nallow for micro-unions. Almost any little group can petition the \nNational Labor Relations Board, under the Obama administration's views, \nto become a union. I wonder if quarterbacks would become a micro-union. \nThey would say: We are more important. Look at the NFL. They get paid a \nlot more. We want a bigger scholarship than others.\n  I wondered about five-star recruits. Let's say there is a terrific \ndefensive back--as I am sure Senator Burr was when he was in high \nschool. He had five stars from all the recruiting services. Would the \nprivate schools who are unionized go out and compete to see who could \npay the highest compensation to the five-star recruits, a lot less to \nthe walk-on, maybe less for a three-star. What are the practical \nconsequences of a student athlete suddenly finding himself defined as \nan employee of the university under the National Labor Relations Act?\n  Mr. BURR. Let me say to my good friend, as one who remembers August \npractices in the South--hottest time of the year, three practices a \nday--the first thing I would bargain out for all players is that I \nwould have to get my ankles taped at 4:30 in the morning, that I would \nhave to go all day and most of the night, and that I could not take \nthat tape off until 8:30 after three practices.\n  I would negotiate away the smell of dead grass in August, a memory \nevery college football player, as a matter of fact every football \nplayer, has of that dead grass in summer practice in hot weather.\n  I plead with those who play today: Do you truly believe you can form \na team if in fact you have individuals who negotiate individual things \nfor themselves? If quarterbacks negotiate they cannot be hit, how good \nis the club? But where is the team? If individuals find that it is \nadvantageous to them because they are stars and they can negotiate it, \nwhere have we lost the sense of team sports?\n  The Senator from Tennessee mentioned this to begin with: College \nsports is a lot about the experience. It builds character. It builds \nintegrity. It builds drive. It builds resilience. It is not the only \nthing in life that does it, but to me, for many individuals, for many \nyoung men and women, this is the most effective way for them to become \nleaders. I might say it is very much the style of our training in the \nmilitary. As we raise those young officers, they go through a very \nregimented training.\n  Imagine what it would be like if we allowed the military to \ncollectively bargain. Let me tell you, none of us would feel safe at \nnight because we don't know exactly what they have gone through. Today \nwe feel safe because we know they have all gone through the same thing.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I think our time is coming toward a \nclose, but we have about 5 minutes left. Then we will be looking \nforward to the comments of the Senator from Iowa. We thank him for his \ncourtesy in allowing us to go ahead.\n  I guess the message--I particularly enjoyed hearing the Senator from \nNorth Carolina. The message today is directed at two groups. One is to \nthe NCAA, which is to say, do not think that the attitude of one \nRegional Director of the National Labor Relations Board reflects the \nview of the U.S. Government. It does not. The other is to the student \nathletes. Think about the value of the opportunity you have.\n  Here are two former student athletes of varying talents who benefited \nenormously from that. There are many others who would say the same. The \nuniversity does not owe us anything. We owe the university--at least \nthat is the way I feel about it--for the privilege of competing, for \nthe privilege of attending. If I had a scholarship, that would have \nbeen even better--just the privilege of participating.\n\n[[Page S2364]]\n\n  To the NCAA, the members of the NCAA have talked about issues such as \nshould we provide more expense money for athletes. I mentioned earlier \nthat 40 percent of them have Pell grants which can go up to $5,600 a \nyear in addition to their $55,000 or $60,000 of football scholarships. \nSo think about that. That was considered by the NCAA and voted down \nbecause the small schools said: It will hurt us. Women's programs said: \nWe will have to drop women's programs.\n  So this is more complicated than it would seem at first. What about \nhealth care? Of course, a student athlete can be covered by his \nparents' health care insurance. Under the Affordable Care Act, I am \nsure many on the other side would be quick to say, they would always be \nable to be insured for any sort of preexisting condition, but these are \nissues that can be properly looked at by the NCAA.\n  Unionization, in my opinion, would destroy intercollegiate athletics \nas we know it. I think we should look back to the opinion of the Knight \nCommission, headed by Bill Friday of North Carolina and Ted Hesburgh of \nNotre Dame, and reaffirm that the student athlete is not a \nprofessional, not a hired hand. He or she is a student. One percent of \nthe athletes in this country--there may be problems to solve, but the \nuniversities and the NCAA can address those problems. Unionization is \nnot the way to do it.\n  Mr. BURR. I just wanted to address one last thing; that is, the claim \nthat this case was all about health care. The Senator from Tennessee \nhas pointed out as well the options that we have today. But let me \nspeak from a firsthand experience: a college athlete, four operations--\ntwo knees, an elbow, a finger. Probably the only record I hold at Wake \nForest is the total number of inches of scars on my body. Because of \nmodern medicine, that record will not be broken because they do not do \nsurgery that way anymore.\n  But I think it is best summed up by our current Secretary of \nEducation, Arne Duncan, when he said this:\n\n       When sports are done right, when priorities are in order, \n     there is no better place to teach invaluable life lessons \n     than on a playing field or court. . . . Discipline, \n     selflessness, resilience, passion, courage, those are all on \n     display in the NCAA.\n\n  Why would we do anything to risk that? Not only do I believe this is \nrisky, I think just a consideration of it is enough to make us--or \nshould make us reject this quickly, not embrace it.\n  I thank my colleague from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank my colleague from North Carolina.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his courtesy in allowing us to go \nahead.\n  Some 50 years ago, I had the opportunity to compete in track and \nfield for Vanderbilt University. Unlike my colleague from North \nCarolina, who as a fine defensive back at Wake Forest University, there \nwas no athletic scholarship available for me. But I was fortunate \nenough to be a member of a record setting team.\n  Twenty-five years ago, while I was president of the University of \nTennessee, I was asked to serve on the Knight Commission on \nIntercollegiate Athletics. The Knight Commission was created in October \n1989 in response to a series of scandals in college sports. After 18 \nmonths of careful study, our 22-member commission issued a report \ncalled ``Keeping the Faith with the Student-Athlete: A New Model for \nIntercollegiate Athletics.''\n  Our central recommendation was that college presidents needed to \nexercise stronger control of their athletics programs to ensure their \nacademic and financial integrity. And our guiding principle in making \nthat recommendation was that athletes are students first, not \nprofessionals. We wrote:\n\n       We reject the argument that the only realistic solution to \n     the problem is to drop the student-athlete concept, put \n     athletes on the payroll, and reduce or even eliminate their \n     responsibilities as students.\n       Such a scheme has nothing to do with education, the purpose \n     for which colleges and universities exist. Scholarship \n     athletes are already paid in the most meaningful way \n     possible: with a free education. The idea of intercollegiate \n     athletics is that the teams represent their institutions as \n     true members of the student body, not as hired hands. Surely \n     American higher education has the ability to devise a better \n     solution to the problems of intercollegiate athletics than \n     making professionals out of the players, which is no solution \n     at all but rather an unacceptable surrender to despair.\n\n  The Knight Commission's perspective on student athletes could not be \nmore different to the perspective in the recent decision, issued by a \nregional director of the National Labor Relations Board in Chicago, to \ntreat athletes as employees and permit them to form a union.\n  Student athletes are found throughout all levels and at all types of \ncolleges--small through large, but those that receive athletic \nscholarships are only at division I and II schools. Division III \nschools are not allowed to award athletic scholarships.\n  For the purposes of the NLRB decision, we are talking about an even \nsmaller subset of athletes--scholarship athletes at private \ninstitutions like Notre Dame, Vanderbilt, and Stanford. For example, as \na non-scholarship athlete at Vanderbilt, I would not have been able to \nunionize. Senator Burr, on the other hand was given a scholarship to \nplay defensive back at Wake Forest. He would be allowed to unionize.\n  In 2011, there were roughly 25 million undergraduate students; 9 \nmillion Pell recipients, which is approximately 36 percent of \nundergraduate students. In addition, there were 177,000 scholarship \nathletes enrolled in bachelor programs at public and private \ninstitutions. This is approximately 1.7 percent of all students in \nbachelor's programs. Of those, 71,000 received Pell Grants, \napproximately 40 percent of scholarship athletes. The number of \nscholarship athletes at private institutions enrolled in a bachelor's \nprogram was 104,000, approximately 4.2 percent of private students in \nbachelor's programs. Of those, 43,700 received Pell Grants, \napproximately 42 percent of private scholarship athletes.\n  The total number of division I and II schools is 662 of which 283 are \nprivate institutions. In division I the total is 350 with 119 of them \nbeing private, while the division II total is 312 with 164 private.\n  Athletic scholarships are limited to only tuition and fees, room and \nboard, and required course-related books. At Vanderbilt the total \nscholarship could be as much as $58,520 which is a combination of \n$42,768 for tuition, $14,382 for room and board, and $1,370 for books. \nAt Stanford the total scholarship could be as much as $59,240 which is \na combination of $44,184 for tuition, $13,631 for room and board, and \n$1,425 for books.\n  Contrast that with the University of Tennessee where the scholarship \ntotal could be up to $21,900 consisting of $11,194 for in-state \ntuition, $9,170 for room and board, and $1,536 for books.\n  Scholarship athletes may also combine other sources of financial aid, \nnamely Federal or State need-based aid or earned entitlements, in order \nto cover the full cost of attendance. These include, Pell Grants, \nSupplemental Education Opportunity Grants, work-study, State grants \nbased on need using Federal need calculations such as Tennessee's HOPE \nScholarship and veterans programs such GI Bill or post\n9/11 GI Bill.\n  Athletic scholarships are awarded in most cases by the athletic \ndepartment which encourages an athlete to complete the federal \napplication. If an athlete is determined to have a need, then the \nfinancial aid office awards the need-based aid, Federal, State, or \nboth. A student athlete is restricted to the institutional cost of \nattendance when combining other aid with their scholarship, unless they \nare using their Pell Grant or a veterans benefit. Thus a student \nathlete with need could receive a full scholarship covering all costs \nand receive additional funds.\n  Only 1 percent of student athletes will ever play professional \nsports. For the remainder, their college degree is the primary benefit \nof participating in college sports. According to the College Board, the \nvalue of a college degree is $1 million over an individual's lifetime. \nAs a former student athlete, who wasn't on scholarship, I can speak \nfrom experience that the value of college athletics goes beyond the \nmoney. It can enrich every aspect of our education, teaching lessons \nand developing habits that will pay dividends no matter what a student \npursues in life.\n  Unfortunately, the problems the Northwestern football players are \nconcerned with are not unique to Northwestern and they are not new. \nThese problems include: the NCAA does not\n\n[[Page S2365]]\n\ncurrently allow a full-ride athletic scholarship to cover the actual \nfull cost of attendance; Other expenses include: transportation costs; \nhealth fees; student activity and recreation fees and personal expenses \nallowable under Federal financial aid rules.\n  For example, a full-ride scholarship at Vanderbilt University is \nworth $58,520 but the full cost of attendance is calculated by the \nschool to be $62,320. The difference must be made up by the student.\n  For some student athletes, the lingering effects and potential \ndisabilities will be felt for many years after their playing days are \nover. Some students are asking for long term medical coverage to help \nthem cover costs of treating these injuries. Schools could provide for \nsome form of additional medical coverage.\n  While playing sports has certain inherent risks, we do know more now \nthan ever before about how injuries can be avoided. Better protections \nfrom injury--football concerns with concussions. Schools can take, and \nsome are taking, steps to improve the safety of their student athletes.\n  Some students are asking for help to finish their education even when \nathletic eligibility has run out.\n  There is money available to address these concerns and take care of \nour student athletes without unions.\n  The NCAA and the member universities do need to reform their rules \nand guidance; and they will.\n  Earlier this week we spoke to David Williams, Vanderbilt University's \nathletic director, who had this to say:\n\n       The NCAA and its member universities have the authority and \n     the responsibility to correct the flaws that exist in the \n     system today, many of which are mentioned by the student \n     athletes at Northwestern University. The question is do we \n     have the will to do so. I believe we do and that we will.\n\n  Mark Emmert the President of the NCAA, quoted in a recent Meet the \nPress interview said:\n\n       We have twice now had the board of the N.C.A.A. pass an \n     allowance to allow schools to provide a couple of thousand \n     dollars in what we call ``miscellaneous expense'' allowances. \n     . . . The board's in favor of it. The membership, the more \n     than a thousand colleges and universities that are out there, \n     the 350 of them that are in division one had voted that down. \n     We're in the middle right now of reconsidering all that. I \n     have every reason that that's going to be in place sometime \n     this coming year.\n\n  What would actually happen if college sports teams were unionized? \nWell, David Williams, Vanderbilt's athletic director, said:\n\n       The decision by the NLRB regional board has the power to \n     change the structure, dynamics and maybe the effectiveness of \n     college athletics. It may ultimately end college athletics as \n     we know it today.\n\n  I agree with this statement. And think those who support turning \ncollege athletes into employees and unionize them should consider the \npotential consequences. One potential consequence relates to taxes. \nThis recent decision, in essence, may require the entire scholarship to \nbe treated as compensation thus making the whole amount taxable.\n  Another consequence of potential collegiate unionization relates to \nlabor. One of the most commonly thought of traits when a union \nrepresents a workforce is the right to strike. Section 13 of the \nNational Labor Relations Act, NLRA, expressly provides the right of \nemployees to strike, with some exceptions. If a unionized college \nbaseball team doesn't like the coaches' decision to switch practice \ntimes, they could decide to walk off the field right before the first \npitch is thrown, and call a strike.\n  The NLRA requires the union and employer to bargain over wages, \nhours, and other conditions of employment. If a football team joins a \nunion, will the union negotiate different compensation amounts \ndepending on the player's position or contribution to the team? For \nexample, a five star quarterback in high school could decide to attend \nNotre Dame, because the players' union promises to negotiate a larger \nscholarship package for him, but the one star, offensive lineman may \nonly get the bare minimum. This could lead to a team and its union \nmaking value judgments based on the on-field contributions of a player.\n  What about when a coach decides to change the offensive scheme from a \npro-style offense to the wish-bone. A union wide receiver might have a \ngrievance because this could effect the ``condition of employment,'' in \nthat his role on the team could be diminished. Under the NLRA, a \ndecision like that would have to be bargained for. A coach could not \nunilaterally change the playbook without approval of the union.\n  But let's say that a wide receiver decides to go directly to the \ncoach to discuss his grievance about switching offensive schemes. Under \nthe act, that conversation will not be a one-on-one between the coach \nand the player. Instead, a union representative has the right to be \npresent at that meeting. And instead of resolving the issue internally, \nthe Federal government through the NLRB, or possibly the Federal courts \ncould have the final say.\n  The current NLRB has struck down several employee conduct policies \nand handbooks, because they violate an employee's section 7 right to \n``concerted activity'' under the NLRA. Will the NLRB now turn its \nattention to and interfere with the player conduct policies that \nschools require of their players?\n  The NLRB issued a 2011 decision in Specialty Healthcare, that \npermitted unions to organize, multiple, small groups of employees \nwithin a single workplace, known as ``micro-unions.'' It is conceivable \nthat every different position on the football team could decide to have \ntheir own bargaining unit. The quarterbacks in one unit, the lineman in \nanother unit, and the linebackers in another, etc. The university would \nthen have to separately bargain with multiple different unions, all \nwith different demands.\n  Universities require its athletes to maintain a 2.0 grade point \naverage, GPA, to keep an athletic scholarship. Would the NLRA consider \na minimum grade point average as a condition of employment under the \nlaw that must be bargained for? Schools and players' unions could \nbargain a lower GPA.\n  What if a coach benches the star point guard, who is a union member, \non the basketball team, and replaced him with a non-scholarship, walk-\non point guard? Could the team be accused of retaliating against a \nunion player in violation of the NLRA? Under the NLRA it is unlawful to \ndischarge, discipline or otherwise discriminate against an employee for \nengaging in protected concerted activities. If that star player could \nshow that the benching came after he had been discussing a team related \nissue with his fellow teammates it would be considered retaliation.\n  The bottom line, is that importing the sometimes head-scratching \nrulings of the NLRB into a competitive, team atmosphere is recipe for \ndisaster.\n  Do they now hire athletes and not worry if they are students? Mark \nEmmert, NCAA President, said:\n\n       To unionize them, you have to say, These are employees. If \n     you're going to do that, it completely changes the \n     relationship. I don't know why you'd want them to be \n     students. If they're employees and they're playing basketball \n     for you, don't let calculus get in the way.\n\n  Yesterday, the Senate voted against cloture on the Paycheck Fairness \nAct. This is a bill that would amend the Equal Pay Act to make it \neasier to sue for pay discrimination based on gender by limiting an \nimportant employer defense.\n  Under the bill, the employer would have to prove any difference in \npay would be job-related and consistent with a business necessity; If \nthese student athletes are now considered ``employees'' under the eyes \nof a regional director in Chicago, they would theoretically be entitled \nto protection under statutes like the Equal Pay Act; And if the \nPaycheck Fairness Act were to become law, it is conceivable \nuniversities could be liable for any differences in compensation that \nthey provide the football team, versus the women's soccer team;\n  Then there is the effect on smaller schools. Big schools with big \nbudgets may have the ability to negotiate with a union for better \nbenefits for their student athletes. If a football union at Notre Dame \nnegotiates for higher compensation that may set a standard the school \nmust match for other athletes as well. I imagine that there is enough \nmoney coming into the Notre Dame or Stanford athletic departments to \nallow them to adjust to the realities of unionized college athletics.\n  But what about smaller schools? They will have to make cuts \nsomewhere. If they preserve their football\n\n[[Page S2366]]\n\nprogram, it will likely be at the cost of other sports.\n  Another consideration that must be taken into account are public \nuniversities versus private universities. Because the NLRB regional \ndirector's decision only applies to private universities, it creates a \ndifferent set of rules for private universities than for public \nuniversities.\n  The private schools with athlete unions may ultimately be forced to \nnegotiate salaries or other benefits that violate NCAA rules; to \ncontinue competing, they would have to set up their own conference or \nassociation. The departure of schools from the NCAA to this new, union \nfriendly association, would fracture the foundations of collegiate \nsports.\n  And what about possible title IX implications? As title IX was \nenforced related to college athletics, institutions made difficult \nchoices to eliminate many athletic programs. Title IX is focused on \nimproving equal access to education. If athletes are employees, then it \nis unclear how the requirements and protections of title IX will apply \nto them.\n  Due to the current limited nature of the ruling, if football players' \ncompensation are considered salaries and not scholarships, then would \none of the possible effects be a reduction in the number of women's \nscholarships that title IX requires the university to offer? Or would \ntitle IX require that any new benefits received by a football team \nunder their collective bargaining be shared equitably with the women's \nsports at the university?\n  With limited resources and title IX requiring both proportional \nopportunity for athletes and pay, the recent decision may result in \nfurther reductions of athletic programs and opportunities on college \ncampuses.\n  The Knight Commission's executive director, Amy Privette Perko, \nrecently wrote in the New York Times that:\n\n       The commission supports many of the benefits being sought \n     for college athletes by groups like the College Athletes \n     Players Association, but unions are not needed to guarantee \n     those benefits. Colleges can enact proposals long recommended \n     by the commission for colleges to restore the educational \n     role of athletics and improve athletes' experiences.\n\n  I continue to believe that athletes are students first, not \nprofessionals. Some of the concerns raised by these college athletes \nare legitimate but unions are not the solution. They can and should be \naddressed by the schools and the NCAA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                       Whistleblower Protections\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 25 years ago today the Whistleblower \nProtection Act of 1989 was signed into law. To mark that anniversary, I \ncome to the floor to discuss some of the history that led to that \nlegislation, the lessons learned over the past 25 years, and the work \nthat still needs to be done to protect whistleblowers.\n  I emphasize that last part because there still needs to be a lot of \nwork done to protect whistleblowers. The Whistleblower Protection Act \nwas the result of years of effort to protect Federal employees from \nretaliation. Eleven years before it became law in 1989, Congress tried \nto protect whistleblowers as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of \n1978.\n  I was then in the House of Representatives. There I met a person \nnamed Ernie Fitzgerald, who had blown the whistle on the Lockheed C-5 \naircraft program going $2.3 billion over budget. Ernie was fired by the \nAir Force for doing that, and as he used to say: He was fired for the \nact of ``committing truth.''\n  When the Nixon tapes became public after Watergate, they revealed \nPresident Nixon personally telling his Chief of Staff to get rid of \nthat SOB. That is how a famous whistleblower who pointed out the waste \nof $2.3 billion was treated.\n  The Civil Service Commission did not reinstate Ernie until 12 years \nlater. In the meantime, he was instrumental in helping get the Civil \nService Reform Act of 1978 passed. Yet it soon became very clear that \nlaw did not do enough to protect whistleblowers. In the early 1980s, \nthe percentage of employees who did not report government wrongdoing \ndue to fear of retaliation nearly doubled.\n  Some whistleblowers still had the courage to come forward. In the \nspring of 1983, I became aware of a document in the Defense Department \nknown as the Spinney report. The report exposed the unrealistic \nassumptions being used by the Pentagon in its defense budgeting. Those \nunrealistic assumptions were the basis for add-ons later on so defense \ncontractors could bid up the cost. It was written by Chuck Spinney, a \ncivilian analyst in the Defense Department's Program Evaluation Office.\n  I asked to meet with Chuck Spinney but was stonewalled by the \nPentagon. When I threatened a subpoena, we finally got them to agree to \na Friday afternoon hearing in March 1983. The Pentagon hoped the \nhearing would get buried in the end-of-the-week news cycle. Instead, on \nMonday morning the newsstands featured a painting of Chuck Spinney on \nthe front cover of Time magazine.\n  It labeled him as ``a Pentagon Maverick.'' I called him what he ought \nto be called, the ``conscience of the Pentagon.'' The country owes a \ndebt of gratitude to people such as Ernie Fitzgerald and Chuck Spinney. \nIt takes real guts to put your career on the line, to expose waste and \nfraud, and to put the taxpayers ahead of Washington bureaucrats.\n  In the mid-1980s, we dusted off an old Civil War-era measure known as \nthe False Claims Act, as a way to encourage whistleblowers to come \nforward and report fraud. We amended that Civil War law in 1986 to \ncreate the modern False Claims Act, which has resulted in over $40 \nbillion in taxpayers' money being recovered for the Federal Treasury. \nWe made sure when we passed it that it contained very strong \nwhistleblower protections. Those provisions helped to build up support \nfor whistleblowing.\n  People such as Chuck Spinney and Ernie Fitzgerald helped capture the \npublic imagination and showed what whistleblowers could accomplish.\n  However, that didn't mean the executive branch stopped trying to \nsilence whistleblowers. For example, in the spring of 1987 the \nDepartment of Defense asked Ernie to sign a nondisclosure form. It \nwould have prohibited him from giving out classifiable--as opposed to \nclassified--classifiable information without prior written \nauthorization. That, of course, would have prevented those of us in \nCongress from getting that information so we couldn't do our oversight \nwork.\n  Further, the term ``classifiable'' didn't only cover currently \nclassified information, it also covered any information that could \nlater be classified.\n  The governmentwide nondisclosure form arguably violated the Lloyd-\nLaFollette Act of 1912. That law states that ``the right of employees . \n. . to furnish information to . . . Congress . . . may not be \ninterfered with or denied.''\n  Just to make sure, I added the so-called anti-gag appropriations \nrider that passed Congress in December 1987. That rider, the anti-gag \nrider, said that no money could be used to enforce any nondisclosure \nagreements that interferes with the right of individuals to provide \ninformation to Congress. It remained in every appropriations bill until \n2013. I then worked to get that language into statute in 2012 through \nthe passage of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act.\n  By the time of the first anti-gag rider in 1987, there was widespread \nrecognition that all Federal employees ought to be protected if they \ndisclosed waste and fraud to the Congress or for a lot of other reasons \nas well.\n  Meanwhile, I had also worked with Senator Levin of Michigan to \ncoauthor what we called the Whistleblower Protection Act. It was \nintroduced in February 1987. There were hearings on our bill in the \nsummer of 1987 and the spring of 1988. It proceeded to pass the Senate \nby voice vote in August. Then the House unanimously did that in \nOctober. After reconciling the differences, we sent the bill to the \nWhite House. However, President Reagan failed to sign it. That meant we \nhad to start all over again in the next Congress.\n  We didn't let President Reagan's inaction--because that was a pocket \nveto--stand in the way. Senator Levin and I moved forward again. When \nwe reintroduced the bill in January 1989, I came to the floor to make \nthe following statement:\n\n       We're back with this legislation in the 101st Congress, and \n     this time, we're going to make it stick.\n\n[[Page S2367]]\n\n       Congress passed this bill last fall after extensive \n     discussions with members of the Reagan administration.\n       But in spite of the compromise we worked out, this bill \n     fell victim to President Reagan's pocket veto.\n       Whistleblowers are a very important part of government \n     operations. By exposing waste, fraud, and abuse, they work to \n     keep government honest and efficient. And for their loyalty, \n     they are often penalized--they get fired, demoted, and \n     harassed. . . . Under the current system, the vast majority \n     of employees choose not to disclose the wrongdoing they see. \n     They are afraid of reprisals and the result is a gross waste \n     of taxpayers' dollars.\n       Government employers should not be allowed to cover up \n     their misdeeds by creating such a hostile environment.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the statement I made on the \nintroduction of that bill in January 1989.\n  Once again, the bill passed the Senate and the House without \nopposition. Working with George H.W. Bush, this time we got the \nPresident to sign it. On April 10, 1989, the Whistleblower Protection \nAct became law.\n  We left part of the work undone 25 years ago. The Civil Service \nReform Act of 1978 had exceptions for the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, and \nother parts of the intelligence community. The Whistleblower Protection \nAct left employees of those agencies unprotected, and so have the laws \nthat followed it. I am very pleased that the preconferenced \nintelligence authorization bill released today will remedy that for the \nintelligence community.\n  Back in 2012 I championed the addition of intelligence whistleblower \nprotections to the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. The \nprovisions I authored prohibited various forms of retaliation, \nincluding changing an employee's access to classified information. \nWorking closely with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, we \ngot that language into the bill that passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent May 8, 2012. However, it was not included in the bill the House \npassed on September 28, 2012.\n  Prior to the differences being reconciled on October 10, 2012, \nPresident Obama issued Presidential Policy Directive 19. It provided \ncertain limited protections for whistleblowers with access to \nclassified information. Yet that Executive order by President Obama was \nweaker than the provisions I had authored in the Whistleblower \nProtection Enhancement Act. Unfortunately, President Obama's actions \nundercut support for those provisions by suggesting that statutory \nprotection was now necessary. The final law that passed in November \nleft intelligence whistleblowers at the mercy of the Presidential \ndirective.\n  Now, much of the language I had championed is in the Intelligence \nauthorization bill currently under consideration. It is certainly a \nstep up from Presidential Policy Directive 19. Making any protections \nstatutory is very significant. The bill also has better substantive \nprotections than the Presidential directive.\n  It does still have some gray areas, I am sorry to say. It leaves some \nof the policy and procedure development to the discretion of the \nexecutive branch, and that is a mistake we know exists because we had a \nsimilar thing happen with the FBI because in 1989 the protections of \nthe Whistleblower Protection Act didn't apply to the FBI. That turned \nout to be a big mistake.\n\n  Yet that law did require the Attorney General to implement \nregulations for FBI whistleblowers consistent with those in the \nWhistleblower Protection Act. However, it soon became clear that was a \nlittle like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. The Justice \nDepartment and the FBI simply ignored that part of the law for nearly \n10 years. Not until 1997 did the Attorney General finally implement \nregulations for whistleblowers at the FBI.\n  The Justice Department was pushed into finally issuing those \nregulations by an FBI employee by the name of Dr. Fred Whitehurst. Dr. \nWhitehurst was considered by the FBI to be its leading forensic \nexplosive expert in the 1990s.\n  What I am about to show you is that by being a good, patriotic \nAmerican and blowing the whistle when something is wrong, you can ruin \nyourself professionally.\n  Shortly after the Whistleblower Protection Act was passed in 1989, \nDr. Whitehurst disclosed major problems with the FBI crime lab. From \n1990 to 1995 he wrote close to 250 letters to the Justice Department \ninspector general about these problems. In other words, he tried to be \nloyal to the agency he was in and work within that agency to expose \nwrongdoing but didn't get very far.\n  In January 1996 he formally requested that the President implement \nregulations as required by the Whistleblower Protection Act. Only after \nFred was suspended in 1997 did the White House finally issue such a \nmemo to the Attorney General. It instructed the Attorney General to \ncreate a process for FBI whistleblowers as directed by the \nWhistleblower Protection Act. Fred Whitehurst's case dragged on for \nanother year until the FBI finally agreed to settle with him in \nFebruary 1998. He got more than a $1 million settlement out of that \njust because he was trying to do the right thing. But he got his badge \nand his gun taken away from him, and he was, in a sense, ridiculed for \ndoing what a patriotic American ought to do.\n  Fred Whitehurst is not alone in the FBI as far as people having \nproblems. Over the years, others--such as Mike German, Bassem Youssef, \nJane Turner, and Robert Kobus--have blown the whistle from within the \nFBI. Even after the inspector general issued findings in their favor, \nseveral had to navigate a never-ending Kafkaesque internal appeals \nprocess. It seemed designed to grind down these patriotic Americans \ninto submission through years of inaction.\n  Now history has started to repeat itself. As Congress was passing the \nWhistleblower Protection Enhancement Act in 2012, President Obama \nissued Presidential Policy Directive 19. He tasked Attorney General \nHolder with reevaluating the same FBI whistleblower procedures that \nFred Whitehurst helped get in place in 1997. The Attorney General was \ngiven 6 months to report back.\n  When the Attorney General didn't report back and didn't issue that \nreport at the 6-month mark, I asked the Government Accountability \nOffice to do its own independent evaluation of the FBI whistleblower \nprotections.\n  Now 18 months after the President's directive, Attorney General \nHolder still hasn't released his report. This is a person appointed by \nthe President of the United States, directed by the President of the \nUnited States to do something in 6 months, presumably loyal to the \nPresident of the United States, and he isn't doing what the Chief \nExecutive of our great country told him to do.\n  Potential whistleblowers should not have to wait a decade, as they \ndid with the first set of regulations. It appears that the Justice \nDepartment is simply sitting on its hands once again.\n  The example of the FBI should be instructive. Unlike the \nWhistleblower Protection Act, the Intelligence authorization bill is \nmuch more detailed about the protections Congress intends. It puts a \ntime limit on how long the intelligence community has to create their \nprocedures, giving them 6 months. However, remember that is exactly the \nsame amount of time President Obama gave Attorney General Holder to \ncome up with regulations, and it still hasn't happened 18 months later. \nCongress needs to be vigilant about getting both the intelligence \ncommunity and the Attorney General to act.\n  In the meantime, the FBI fiercely resists any efforts at \ncongressional oversight, especially on whistleblower matters. For \nexample, 4 months ago I sent a letter to the FBI requesting its \ntraining materials on the insider threat program. When we just want \ncopies of training materials, would that be difficult for a bureaucracy \nto present to a Member of Congress?\n  That program happened to be announced by the Obama administration in \nOctober of 2011. It was intended to train Federal employees to watch \nout for insider threats among their colleagues. Public news reports \nindicated that this program might not do enough to distinguish between \ntrue insider threats and legitimate whistleblowers. I relayed these \nconcerns in my letter. I also asked for copies of the training \nmaterials. I said I wanted to examine whether they adequately \ndistinguished between insider threats and whistleblowers so it didn't \nbecome a damper on whistleblowing.\n  In response, an FBI legislative affairs official told my staff that a \nbriefing might be the best way to answer my questions. It was scheduled \nfor last\n\n[[Page S2368]]\n\nweek. Staff of both Chairman Leahy and myself attended. The FBI brought \nthe head of their insider threat program. Yet the FBI didn't bring the \ninsider threat training materials as we had requested. However, the \nhead of the insider threat program told the staff of both Senator Leahy \nand myself there was no need to worry about whistleblower \ncommunications.\n\n  They are telling me that at a time when we have decades of history of \nwhistleblowers being treated like skunks at a picnic? This gentleman \nsaid whistleblowers had to register in order to be protected and the \ninsider threat program would know to avoid these people.\n  I have never heard of whistleblowers ever being required to \n``register,'' in order to be protected. The idea of such a requirement \nshould be pretty alarming to all Americans. We are talking about \npatriotic Americans wanting to make sure the government does what the \nlaw says it should do and spend money the way Congress intended it be \nspent. They have to register to be protected just because they are a \npatriotic American? The reason they can't do that is because sometimes \nconfidentiality is the best protection a whistleblower has.\n  Unfortunately, neither my staff nor Chairman Leahy's staff was able \nto learn more because after only 10 minutes--only 10 minutes--in the \noffice and into the briefing, the FBI got up and abruptly walked out.\n  It might be one thing to walk out on Republican staff, but they \nwalked out on the staff of a Democratic chairman of one of the most \npowerful committees in the U.S. Senate as well--Chairman Leahy's staff.\n  FBI officials simply refused to discuss any whistleblower \nimplications in its insider threat program and left the room. These are \nclearly not the actions of an agency that is genuinely open to \nwhistleblowers or whistleblower protection.\n  Like the FBI, the intelligence community has to confront the same \nissue of distinguishing a true insider threat from legitimate \nwhistleblowers. This issue will be impacted by title V of the current \nIntelligence authorization bill, which includes language about \ncontinuous monitoring of security clearance holders.\n  Director of National Intelligence James Clapper seems to have talked \nabout such procedures when he appeared before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on February 11 of this year. In his testimony he said this:\n\n       We are going to proliferate deployment of auditing and \n     monitoring capabilities to enhance our insider threat \n     detection. We're going to need to change our security \n     clearance process to a system of continuous evaluation. . . . \n     What we need is . . . a system of continuous evaluation, \n     where we have a way of--\n\n  Now, get this.\n\n     --monitoring their behavior, both their electronic behaviors \n     on the job as well as off the job, to see if there is a \n     potential clearance issue.\n\n  Director Clapper's testimony gives me major pause, as I hope it does \nmy colleagues. It sounds as though this type of monitoring would likely \ncapture the activity of whistleblowers communicating with Congress.\n  To be clear, I believe the Federal Government is within its right in \nmonitoring employee activity on worker computers. That applies all the \nmore in the intelligence community. However, as I testified before the \nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee recently, there are \nareas where the executive branch should be very cautious.\n  The House oversight committee held a hearing on electronic monitoring \nthat the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had done of certain \nwhistleblowers in that agency. This monitoring was not limited to work-\nrelated activity. The Food and Drug Administration allows its employees \nto check personal email accounts at work. As a result, the FDA's \nwhistleblower monitoring captured personal email account passwords. It \nalso captured attorney-client communications and confidential \ncommunications to Congress and the Office of Special Counsel.\n  Some of these communications are legally protected. If an agency \ncaptures such communications as a result of monitoring, it needs to \nthink about how to handle them very differently; otherwise, it would be \nthe ideal tool to identify and retaliate against whistleblowers. \nWithout precautions, that kind of monitoring could effectively shut \ndown legitimate whistleblower communications.\n  It wouldn't surprise me, considering the culture of some of these \nagencies, that is exactly what they want to do, because there is a \ngreat deal of peer pressure to go along to get along within these \nagencies. Whistleblowers, as I said, are kind of like a skunk at a \npicnic.\n  There could be safeguards, however. For example, whistleblower \ncommunications could be segregated from other communications. Access \ncould be limited to only certain personnel rather than all of the upper \nmanagement. In any case, whistleblowing disclosures to Congress or the \nspecial counsel can't just be routed back to the official accused of \nwrongdoing.\n  As the 1990 Executive order made clear, whistleblowing is a Federal \nemployee's duty. It should be considered part of their official \nresponsibilities and something they can do on work time. However, that \ndoesn't mean they aren't allowed to make their protected disclosures \nconfidentially to protect against the usual retaliation. A Federal \nemployee has every right to make protected disclosures anonymously, \nwhether at work or off the job.\n  Every Member of this body should realize that without some safeguards \nthere is a chance their communications with whistleblowers may be \nviewed by the executive branch.\n  These same considerations apply to the intelligence community. The \npotential problems are heightened if electronic monitoring extends off \nthe job, such as Director Clapper mentioned in the quote I gave. We \nhave to balance detailing insider threats with letting whistleblowers \nknow their legitimate whistleblower communications are protected.\n  With continuous monitoring in place, any whistleblower would \nunderstand their communications with the inspector general or Congress \nwould likely be seen by their agency and punishment could follow. They \nmight perhaps even be seen by those they believe are responsible for \nwaste, fraud, or abuse, and punishment to follow. That leaves the \nwhistleblower open to retaliation.\n  Even with the protections of this bill, we should all understand it \nis difficult to prevent retaliation because it is so indigenous in the \nculture of most government agencies. It requires a lengthy process for \nan individual to try to prove the retaliation and get any remedy. It is \nfar better, where possible, to take precautions that prevent the \nlikelihood of retaliation even occurring; otherwise, it will make it \nvirtually impossible for there even to be such a thing as an \nintelligence community whistleblower. Fraud and waste would then go \nunreported. No one would dare take the risk.\n  To return to the theme I started with, whistleblowers need protection \nfrom retaliation today just as much as they did 25 years ago when the \nWhistleblower Protection Act was passed on April 10 of that year. I \nhave always said whistleblowers are too often treated like a skunk at a \npicnic. You have now heard it for the third time. You can't say it too \nmany times. I have seen too many of them retaliated against.\n  However, 25 years after the Whistleblower Protection Act, the data on \nwhistleblowing is in, and the debate on whether to protect \nwhistleblowers is over. There is widespread public recognition that \nwhistleblowers perform a very valuable public service.\n  Earlier this year PricewaterhouseCoopers found that 31 percent of \nserious fraud globally was detected by whistleblowing systems or other \ntipoffs. According to a 2012 report from another organization, that \nnumber is even higher when looking just in the United States, with 51 \npercent of the fraud tips coming from a company's own employees.\n  In 2013, of U.S. workers who had observed misconduct and blown the \nwhistle, 40 percent said the existence of whistleblower protection had \nmade them more likely to report misconduct.\n  Whistleblowers are particularly vital in government, where \nbureaucrats only seem to work overtime when it comes to resisting \ntransparency and accountability.\n  A year and a half after the Whistleblower Protection Act, President \nBush\n\n[[Page S2369]]\n\nissued Executive Order 1990 that said all Federal employees ``shall \ndisclose waste, fraud, abuse and corruption to appropriate \nauthorities.'' That should have changed the entire culture of these \nagencies that are antiwhistleblower, but it hasn't. But that is what \nthe directive says.\n  Federal employees are still under obligations this very day. They are \nfulfilling a civic duty when they blow the whistle.\n  I encouraged President Reagan and every President after him that we \nshould have a Rose Garden ceremony honoring whistleblowers. If you do \nthat, it sends a signal from the highest level of the U.S. Government \nto the lowest level of the U.S. Government that whistleblowing is \npatriotic. Unfortunately, there isn't a single President who has taken \nme up on my suggestion.\n  Further, while the Obama administration promised to be the most \ntransparent in history, it has, instead, cracked down on whistleblowers \nas never before.\n  Last week, the Supreme Court denied a petition to hear an appeal from \na case named Kaplan v. Conyers. The Obama administration's position in \nthat case, if allowed to stand, means untold numbers of Federal \nemployees may lose some of the very same appeal rights we tried to \nstrengthen in the Whistleblower Protection Act. There could be half or \nmore of the Federal employees impacted. Such a situation would undo 130 \nyears of protection for civil servants dating back to the Pendleton \nCivil Service Reform Act of 1883.\n  We all remember that President Obama promised to ensure that \nwhistleblowers have full access to the courts and due process. However, \nhis administration has pursued the exact opposite goal here. That ought \nto be unacceptable to all of us.\n  I think it is important to send a loud and clear signal that waste, \nfraud, and abuse won't be tolerated in government, and that is why I am \npleased to announce I will officially be forming a whistleblower \nprotection caucus at the beginning of the 114th Congress. Until then, I \nwill be talking to my colleagues and encouraging them to join me as we \nstart putting together an agenda for that caucus in a new Congress.\n  As we celebrate the 25th anniversary of this very important bill \ncalled the Whistleblower Protection Act, we should all recognize \nwhistleblowers for the sacrifices they make. Those who fight waste, \nfraud, and abuse in the government should be lauded for patriotism. \nWhistleblower protections are only worth anything if they are enforced.\n  Just because we have passed good laws does not mean we can stop \npaying attention to the issue. There must be vigilance and oversight by \nthe Congress.\n  The best protection for a whistleblower is a culture of understanding \nand respecting the right to blow the whistle. I hope this whistleblower \ncaucus will send the message that Congress expects that kind of \nculture.\n  I call on my colleagues to help me make sure whistleblowers continue \nto receive the kind of protection they need and deserve.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    STOP Identity Theft Act of 2013\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \npass the Stopping Tax Offenders and Prosecuting Identity Theft Act of \n2013. With tax day coming upon us on Tuesday, the time is now to pass \nthis bipartisan legislation.\n  I worked on the STOP Identity Theft Act to address the growing \nproblems of tax identity theft and to protect taxpayers against \nfraud. From the beginning this bill has been bipartisan. Senator \nSessions is the lead Republican on this bill, and in fact recently this \nbill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on a vote of 18-0. Given the \nnumber of members on the committee with very different views on issues, \nthat is an accomplishment and shows what a pressing problem this is.\n\n  I think people will be pretty shocked, as you will be, Mr. President, \nwhen you hear these numbers. Criminals are increasingly filing false \ntax returns using stolen identity information in order to claim \nvictims' refunds. You might think that would be a rare incident, but as \na former law enforcement person, as the attorney general for the State \nof New Mexico, I think you know anything can happen. This is a problem \nwhere more than anything is happening.\n  In 2012 alone, identity thieves filed 1.8 million fraudulent tax \nreturns, almost double the number confirmed in 2011. The numbers and \nthe documents in these cases may be forged, but the dollars behind them \nare real, because in 2012 there was another 1.1 million fraudulent tax \nreturns that slipped through the cracks, and our U.S. Treasury paid out \n$3.6 billion in the fraudulent returns--$3.6 billion. That is the \nnumber coming from the IRS. That is your taxpayer dollars going down \nthe drain to people who are actually stealing taxpayers' identities, \nputting them on returns, filing returns, and getting back the money.\n  When criminals file these tax returns, it is not just the Treasury \nthat loses out. Everyday people are the real victims here, because when \nsomeone else uses your identity, when someone else fakes your identity, \npeople are then forced to wait months and sometimes even years before \nreceiving their actual refund.\n  So what is going on? Well, we are having double refunds, right? First \nthey go to the thief. This is happening millions of times. Then the \nreal taxpayer says: Wait a minute, where is my refund, and files a \nreturn. The government has to check this out and figure out the first \none and they then pay twice. This is what is happening in the United \nStates of America.\n  In 2012, Alan Stender, a retired businessman from the 5,000-person \ntown of Circle Pines, MN, was working to file his taxes on time just as \npeople are doing right now. After completing all the forms and sending \nin his tax returns, Alan heard from the IRS that there was a major \nproblem. So he gets it done on time and files the return and finds out \nfrom the IRS there is a problem. Someone had stolen his identity and \nused his personal information to fraudulently file his taxes and steal \nhis tax return.\n  Just last week 25 people were arrested in Florida for using thousands \nof stolen identities to claim $36 million in fraudulent tax refunds. \nThis included the arrest of a middle school food service worker who \nsold the identities of more than 400 students, if you can believe it. \nThose victims are just kids, and criminals are stealing their \nidentities to file fake returns.\n  Are you ready for this one? Attorney General Eric Holder recently \nrevealed that he was a victim of tax return identity theft. This came \nout this week. Two young adults used his name, his date of birth, and \nSocial Security number to file a fraudulent tax return. They got \ncaught. They were prosecuted. But if you can imagine that this can \nhappen to the Attorney General of the United States--at least we got \naction there--think about some guy in Circle Pines, MN, who has it \nhappen. As I said, it is happening over a million times every year, \nfrom a retired man in Minnesota to middle school students in Florida, \nto the Attorney General of the United States. It is clear that identity \ntheft can happen to anyone.\n  We also know this crime can victimize our most vulnerable citizens, \nvictims such as seniors living on fixed incomes or people with \ndisabilities who depend on tax returns to make ends meet and cannot \nfinancially manage having their tax returns stolen. There is a lot at \nstake here and action is needed. That is why I put forward the \nbipartisan legislation a few years back with Republican Senator Jeff \nSessions of Alabama, to take on this problem and crack down on the \ncriminals committing this crime. There was also significant bipartisan \nwork in the House last year. A very similar bill was passed in the \nHouse that did the same thing, passed bipartisan bills in the House of \nRepresentatives. It happened. And the Senate now, as we know, passed it \n18-0 out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  This critical legislation will take important steps to streamline law \nenforcement resources and strengthen\n\n[[Page S2370]]\n\npenalties for tax identity theft. The STOP Identity Theft Act will \ndirect the Justice Department to dedicate additional resources to \naddress tax identity theft. It also directs the Department to focus on \nparts of the country with especially high rates of tax return identity \ntheft and to boost protections for vulnerable populations such as \nseniors, minors, and veterans.\n  We also urge the Justice Department to cooperate fully and coordinate \ninvestigations with State and local law enforcement organizations.\n  Identity thieves have become more creative and have expanded from \nstealing identities of individuals to stealing that of businesses and \norganizations. My bill recognizes this change and broadens the \ndefinitions of tax identity theft to include businesses, nonprofits, \nand other similar organizations. This is important because once a \ncompany or an organization's tax information is stolen, it can be used \nto create fraudulent tax returns and claim false refunds.\n  Finally, we need to crack down on the criminals committing this \ncrime. This bill would strengthen tax identity theft penalties by \nraising the maximum jail sentences from 15 to 20 years. I believe this \nbill goes a long way in helping law enforcement use their resources \nmore efficiently and effectively and it is time to bring it to the \nfloor.\n  In recent weeks we have made significant progress, as I said, by \npassing the bill out of the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously on \nan 18-0 vote. It doesn't happen often. I thank all of my colleagues on \nthe committee and all of my friends across the aisle for joining with \nus to vote for this bill. After a long discussion we had amendments. We \ngot this bill. Every single member of the Judiciary Committee voted for \nthis bill, including Senator Cruz, Senator Schumer, Senator Feinstein, \nand Senator Hatch. It was a unanimous 18-0 vote.\n  Now I want to bring this bill to the full Senate. I would love to get \nthis done before tax day. I know there is a holdup on the other side of \nthe aisle, and it is time for people to understand that this is a bill \nthat passed the House of Representatives, it passed on an 18-0 vote out \nof Judiciary, and we simply need to get this done.\n  When the Attorney General of the United States of America is having \nhis identity stolen and his identity is used to file fake tax returns, \nwe have a problem. We have a problem that involves a lot of money. We \nhave a problem that involves 1.8 million fraudulent tax returns in 2012 \nalone, double the number in 2011. We have a problem that also involves \na lot of money. We have a problem that involves $3.6 billion in 1 year \nalone in 2012, paid out by the U.S. Government. What do you think \ntaxpayers think when they hear that, that $3.6 billion went to thieves \nand we have a bill that passed out of the Judiciary Committee 18-0? I \nwould want someone explaining why they are holding up this bill.\n  It is time to get this bill done. I would love to see it happen \nbefore we go back to our home State so I can explain it to my \nconstituents, and I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwill work with us. Because with tax season upon us, it is time to pass \nthis bipartisan legislation, to crack down on identity thieves and \nprotect the hard-earned tax dollars of innocent Americans. The time to \ndo it is now.\n  I again thank Senator Jeff Sessions for being the Republican on this \nbill, and I thank all my colleagues for passing it through the \ncommittee. I thank the House for getting it done over there. It is now \nthe time to pass it in the Senate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I would ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I wish to speak as if in morning business.\n\n\n                              The DATA Act\n\n  Mr. President, I was not able to be here earlier on the Senate floor \nwhen my colleague Senator Warner got unanimous consent to pass the DATA \nAct. This is the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act, something \nwe have been working on over the last couple of years.\n  It is a good bill, and it is about good government and I am glad we \nwere able to pass it this afternoon in the Senate. I now hope it will \ngo to the House for passage and get to the President's desk, because it \nwill help to give all the taxpayers a better view into our government.\n  Specifically, it improves Federal financial transparency and data \nquality, both of which are going to help identify and illuminate the \nways we spend--certainly something we should be focused on with the \nhuge deficits and all the pressure we are facing.\n  It will also ease the compliance burden with the people working in \nthe Federal Government and recipients of Federal funds. At the same \ntime it improves the data that they send to the Federal Government. It \nis a win/win for the taxpayer, for the government, at getting at the \nissue of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  It is an issue that transcends party lines. I want to thank my friend \nSenator Coburn because he has been a leader in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and also the chairman of the committee, Senator Tom Carper. \nWithout their help, Senator Warner and I would not have been able to \nget this bill to the floor today. We also have a number of other \ncosponsors on a bipartisan basis.\n  We all know that the Federal Government spends a lot of money--over \n$3 trillion a year. The goal is to know more about how that money is \nspent so we can ensure it is being spent on the right things. This \nlegislation, the DATA Act, picks up on lessons we learned about how to \nmake it more accountable and more transparent so taxpayers have a \nbetter understanding of how the money is being used. This has to do \nwith grants and contracts. I think it is something that is going to \nhelp ensure that we are not just spending the money right but also \neliminating fraud and abuse that we otherwise would not find.\n  I first got involved in this issue when I was at the Office of \nManagement and Budget. I supported it and then was tasked with \nimplementing a 2006 bill that was introduced by Senator Coburn and \nSenator Obama at the time. It was called the Federal Funding \nAccountability and Transparency Act, FFATA--an unfortunate acronym in \nmy view.\n  FFATA worked in the sense that it led to something which is called \nusaspending.gov. Back then a lot of Federal agencies thought this could \nnot be done; that we wouldn't be able to improve our transparency up to \nthe standards that were established in FFATA, and we proved them wrong, \nthanks to a lot of hard work by a lot of folks in the agencies and at \nthe Office of Management and Budget where I served as Director. It \nended up with the ability of taxpayers to get a wealth of information \nonline, again, about Federal grants and Federal contracts so they could \nbetter understand how their tax dollars were spent.\n  It was a good start. It also helped us learn some lessons about how \nto improve fiscal data quality and transparency even more. We learned \nthat the usaspending.gov can be more comprehensive, more accurate, more \nreliable, and more timely.\n  By the way, if you have not gone on this Web site, usaspending.gov, I \nrecommend it. If we pass this legislation, you will like it even more \nbecause the data you will be seeing will be more understandable, will \nbe more uniform across the agencies, and will enable us all, as \ntaxpayers, to get a better view into the government.\n  What does it do? First, it makes it easier to compare spending across \nthe Federal agencies by requiring establishment of these governmentwide \nstandards, such as financial data standards, which is very difficult to \ndo, as I learned when I was at the Office of Management and Budget. It \nsounds easy, but it is hard and it pays off. It promotes consistency \nand reliability in data. Second, it strengthens the Federal financial \ntransparency by reforming and significantly improving the Web site \nitself. It requires more frequent updates--quarterly financial updates \nof spending by each Federal agency on their programs and at the object \nclass-level basis. It is basically more\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\nspecific data and more up-to-date so it refreshes the Web site more to \nmake it more useful.\n  Third, it empowers the inspector general and the GAO to hold agencies \naccountable. I think putting the inspectors general into this is a good \nidea because it has another level of accountability. This will make \nthem more accountable for completeness, timeliness, quality, and \naccuracy of the data they are submitting to the usaspending.gov. This \nis new and will make the Web site work even better.\n  Fourth, it simplifies the reporting requirements by recipients of \nFederal funds, eliminating unnecessary duplication and burdensome \nregulations. It basically streamlines what people have to provide to \nthe Federal Government. This will actually make it easier for us to \nunderstand what is going on with these contractors, again, as taxpayers \ndoing oversight, but it also makes it easier to do business with the \nFederal Government. It makes it less complicated for them and gives \nmore transparency for taxpayers, so it is another good aspect of this \nlegislation.\n  I think each of these reforms will enhance Federal financial \naccountability in real ways by allowing citizens to track government \nspending better, allowing agencies to more easily identify improper \npayments and unnecessary spending.\n  We have a big issue around here with spending. We spend more than we \ntake in every year to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. We \nhave a debt that is at least $17 trillion. It is time to make sure we \nare not wasting money that could be applied to that debt or it could \npay for programs that are a top priority. This bipartisan legislation \nwill help us get there.\n  I am very pleased we were able to get it passed today. Again, I will \nbe working hard with Senator Warner and others to ensure that we get \nthis through the House and to the President's desk for signature so we \ncan indeed begin to help all of us as citizens have a better view into \nour Federal Government.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2371-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the more than 30 years \nof hard work and leadership Mr. Peter Munk has demonstrated as the \nfounder and chairman of the board of Barrick Gold Corporation.\n  Since Barrick Gold was established in 1983, Mr. Munk has worked to \nmake Barrick one of the world's largest gold mining companies, with \nprojects reaching four continents. In 1986, Mr. Munk bet on Nevada, \nbringing Barrick to the Silver State with the acquisition of the \nGoldstrike mine located on the Carlin Trend in Eureka County. Nevada \nhas since become the largest source of gold in the United States, \nproducing more than 75 percent of the gold mined throughout the \ncountry. Even today, the Goldstrike mine is one of Barrick's most \nproductive properties. Two of Barrick's 5 core gold mines are located \nin Nevada, and the company continues to operate 7 mines throughout the \nState, employing more than 4,200 people.\n  Mr. Munk has shared his many successes and accomplishments with the \ncommunities in which he works and lives, and through his philanthropy, \nhe has demonstrated his dedication to education and health. He created \nthe Peter Munk Charitable Foundation in 1992 and has made significant \ndonations to his alma mater, the University of Toronto, which is home \nto the Munk School of Global Affairs. Additionally, the premier Peter \nMunk Cardiac Centre was constructed at the University Health Network in \nToronto as a product of his generous contributions.\n  Under Mr. Munk's strong leadership, Barrick Gold has given back to \nthe many communities surrounding Barrick mining operations, and the \ncompany has helped provide added support for local economic, health, \nand social development. In Nevada, much needed school supplies, college \nscholarships, and large community projects have been funded with the \nsupport of Barrick Gold. The company has also implemented strict \ncontrols to help reduce the impacts of mining on the environment and \ncontributed to wildlife restoration and improvement projects to enhance \nNevada's native plants and species habitats. For instance, in 2012, \nBarrick partnered with Federal and State land managers to restore vital \ngreater sage-grouse habitat that had been scarred and damaged by a \ndevastating wildfire.\n  Mr. Munk has made a significant impact on the State of Nevada and has \nestablished a lasting legacy on the international mining industry. His \ninfluence has been recognized by the Canadian Business Hall of Fame and \nthe Canadian Mining Hall of Fame, and he was honored with one of \nCanada's highest honors for a private citizen when he was made a \nCompanion of the Order of Canada. Additionally, Mr. Munk was the first \nCanadian to be awarded the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate \nCitizenship in 2002 and received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee \nMedal in 2012.\n  As Mr. Munk steps down from his role as chairman of the board of \nBarrick Gold Corporation, I congratulate him on his many years of \nsuccess and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2371-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2371-S2372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUSTICE FOR ALL ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week marks the 30th annual National \nCrime Victims' Rights Week. It is a time to recognize victims of crime \nand their families and to acknowledge the efforts to help them recover \nand rebuild their lives in the wake of tragedy. It is also a time to \nask what more we can do to help serve victims of crime and improve our \ncriminal justice system. We have an opportunity this week to pass a \nbill that will not just pay lipservice to crime victims but actually \nimpact and improve their lives. It is time to pass the Justice for All \nAct.\n  The Justice for All Act is a bipartisan bill that Senator Cornyn and \nI introduced nearly 1 year ago to improve the quality of justice in \nthis country. It was approved by the Judiciary Committee in October by \na unanimous voice vote, and it cleared the Democratic side of the \nhotline on March 27. However, it still has not passed the Senate \nbecause Senate Republicans object. For reasons that have not been \nexplained, Republicans have failed to consent to passing this \ncommonsense bill. This is no way to treat victims of crime, especially \nduring a week when we seek to honor them.\n  The Justice for All Act reauthorizes the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog \nReduction Act, which has provided significant funding to reduce the \nbacklog of untested rape kits so that victims need not live in fear \nwhile kits languish in storage. That program is named after Debbie \nSmith, who waited years for her rape kit to be tested. Although delayed \nfor years, that rape kit test ultimately enabled the perpetrator to be \ncaught. She and her husband Rob have worked tirelessly to ensure that \nothers will not have the same experience. I thank Debbie and Rob for \ntheir continuing help on this extremely important cause.\n  The Justice for All Act reauthorization establishes safeguards to \nprevent wrongful convictions and enhances protections and legal rights \nfor crime victims. It is supported by experts in the field and law \nenforcement, including the National Center for Victims of Crime, the \nNational Center of Police Organizations, and the National District \nAttorneys Associations. Yet even during Crime Victims' Week, which \ncoincides with Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, Senate \nRepublicans have not yet shown a willingness to clear the important \nreauthorization.\n  Senator Cornyn was on the floor just last week and earlier today \nexpressing his commitment to getting this passed and signed into law. I \nurge him to lead\n\n[[Page S2372]]\n\nhis caucus to get it through the Senate. He and I both know that a \nunanimous voice vote in the Judiciary Committee is uncommon and happens \non only the most uncontroversial and uniformly applauded bills. This is \none of those bills, and we need to pass this today.\n  Senator McConnell is also a cosponsor of this bill. This effort has \nbeen bipartisan from the beginning, and I am proud that we have the \nminority leader and the minority whip helping to lead this effort. \nDespite the support of the Senate Republican leadership, the bill \nnonetheless remains stalled. Perhaps it is because the House Republican \nleadership would rather pass a much narrower bill. I trust that the \nSenate will stand up for all victims who deserve justice, just as we \ndid when the Senate passed an inclusive Violence Against Women Act \nreauthorization last year.\n  Our bipartisan Senate legislation strengthens the Kirk Bloodsworth \nPost-Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program, one of the key programs \ncreated in the Innocence Protection Act. Kirk Bloodsworth was a young \nman just out of the Marines when he was sentenced to death for a \nheinous crime that he did not commit. He was the first death row inmate \nin the United States to be exonerated through the use of DNA evidence.\n  Since the Justice for All Act was first enacted in 2004, we continue \nto see cases in which people are found to be innocent after spending \nyears in jail.\n  Thomas Haynesworth was exonerated in 2011 after spending 27 years in \nprison for crimes he did not commit, thanks to a grant provided by the \nJustice for All Act. He was accused of rape in 1984 and wrongfully \nconvicted, and the real perpetrator in this case went on to rape more \nthan a dozen women.\n  It is an outrage when an innocent person is punished, and this \ninjustice is compounded when the true perpetrator remains on the \nstreets, able to commit more crimes. We are all less safe when the \nsystem gets it wrong.\n  This bill also provides funding for the Paul Coverdell Forensic \nScience Improvement Grant Program, which assists laboratories in \nperforming the many forensic tests that are essential to solving crimes \nand prosecuting offenders.\n  I cannot imagine why is there an objection to supporting scientific \ntesting and improving the reliability of criminal convictions. Every \nAmerican, including crime victims, is better served when our justice \nsystem has the resources it needs to operate effectively. If there is a \nperson in the Senate who objects, I ask them to come forward and \nexplain that to me and to the American people. I would welcome that \ndebate.\n  The hotline on this bipartisan Justice for All Act reauthorization \nhas been running on the Republican side since March 31, and I have not \nheard one substantive argument against the merits of this bill. Police \nofficers, prosecutors, and crime victims agree on the necessity of this \nbill. Why can't we?\n  The Justice for All Act takes important steps to ensure that all \ncriminal defendants, including those who cannot afford a lawyer, \nreceive effective representation. Our justice system, including \nsuccessful prosecution, depends upon effective representation on both \nsides.\n  This is not a time for delay. This is a time for leadership. The \nstakes are too high and crime victims are depending on us to do the \nright thing. I urge all Senators, and particularly those in the \nRepublican caucus, to clear this bill today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2372-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. WARREN.

Mr. President, I wish to discuss the ongoing crisis in \nSyria. Last month marked the 3-year anniversary since the brutal \nconflict began. According to the United Nations Security Council \nResolution 2139, which was unanimously accepted in February of this \nyear, the conflict has resulted in the death of over 140,000 people in \nSyria, including at least 10,000 children. UNICEF reports that Syria is \namong the most dangerous places on Earth to be a child, pointing to \nhigh child casualty rates, brutalizing and traumatic violence, \ndeteriorating access to education, and health concerns. The number of \nchildren suffering in Syria more than doubled in the third year of the \nconflict.\n  The crisis is only getting worse. Hundreds of thousands of Syrian \ncivilians are under fire by government and opposition forces in \nviolation of internationally accepted Laws of Armed Conflict. These war \ncrimes are truly devastating, and to escape the violence, millions of \nrefugees have flooded into neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, \nwhile thousands more remain internally displaced inside Syria Last year \nI visited the Kilis refugee camp in Turkey which is currently \nsheltering more than 14,000 Syrian refugees. I witnessed first-hand the \nremarkable bravery of the Syrian refugee population. Many of these \nfamilies relocated several times within Syria before ultimately making \nthe heart-wrenching decision to leave their country in order to seek \nfood, medical attention, and safety outside of Syria.\n  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has registered more \nthan 2.6 million Syrian refugees with women and children making up more \nthan 80 percent of the refugee population. By the end of this year, the \nUnited Nations estimates that the number of refugees could increase to \n4 million.\n  That is why I am a cosponsor of the Syria Humanitarian Resolution of \n2014, which urges all parties in Syria to allow for and facilitate \nimmediate, unfettered access to humanitarian aid throughout the Syrian \nArab Republic. This legislation calls for the safety, security, \nindependence, and impartiality of humanitarian workers and demands \nfreedom of movement to deliver aid.\n  I remain deeply concerned by the instability of the entire region, as \nviolence spills over into neighboring countries such as Turkey, Jordan, \nLebanon, and Israel.\n  Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has testified that, \n``In Syria, the ongoing civil war will probably heighten regional and \nsectarian tensions.'' The influx of Syrian refugees to Lebanon, Jordan, \nTurkey and Iraq is putting a strain on those countries' resources.\n  The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on \nthe Syrian Arab Republic reports that pro-government forces have \nmurdered, tortured, assaulted, and raped civilians in Syria. Anti-\ngovernment groups have also engaged in murder, execution without due \nprocess, torture, hostage-taking, and shelling of civilian \nneighborhoods.\n  But nowhere is the brutality of this war more evident than in the \nevents of August 21, 2013, when the Syrian Army, under the direction of \nPresident Assad, launched a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus \nsuburbs. This attack left over 1,400 innocent Syrian civilians dead--\nmany of whom were children.\n  Assad's criminal use of chemical weapons against his own people is \nmorally reprehensible and violates internationally accepted rules of \nwar. The international community cannot stand by and allow the murder \nof innocent men, women, and children to go unchallenged. We must bring \nAssad and all other perpetrators of gross human rights violations in \nthe Syrian conflict to justice.\n  It is clear that we must take action. Last week I introduced, the \nSyrian War Crimes Accountability Act of 2014, S. 2209 along with \nSenators Rubio and Kaine.\n  My bill strongly condemns the ongoing violence, the use of chemical \nweapons, the targeting of civilian populations, and the systematic \ngross human rights violations carried out by both the Syrian government \nand opposition forces.\n  My legislation requires the Secretary of State to provide Congress \nwith a description of violations of internationally recognized human \nrights abuses\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\nand crimes against humanity committed during the conflict in Syria. \nFinally, the bill requires the Secretary to report to Congress on \nefforts by the Department of State and USAID to ensure accountability \nfor these violations and provide a review of the facts concerning any \nprosecution in the case of Syrian crimes that could be defined under \nuniversal jurisdiction.\n  This Monday marked the 20th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda. \nUnfortunately, we have not learned the lessons of the past. We must do \nbetter to not only see that sort of atrocities never again occur under \nour watch, but to ensure that the perpetrators of such heinous crimes \nare held accountable for their actions.\n  Ignoring the crisis in Syria is both morally wrong and \ncounterproductive to our National security and that of our allies. War \ntactics employed in Syria by government and some opposition forces fly \nin the face of the rules of war. For the sake of our National security \ninterests and regional stability, we cannot turn a blind eye to these \nheinous acts.\n  I strongly believe that there are times when the international \ncommunity must come together to end atrocities, protect innocent lives \nfrom crimes against humanity and hold accountable the groups that \nperpetrate them.\n  The Syrian War Crimes Accountability Act of 2014 sends a strong \nmessage to the international community that the United States is firmly \ncommitted to bringing all perpetrators of international crimes in Syria \nto justice. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2373-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2373-S2374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

This resolution \nis very important to me and my family, as my grandson, Jim Beau, is a \nCDH survivor.\n  CDH is a birth defect that occurs when the fetal diaphragm fails to \nfully develop. The lungs develop at the same time as the diaphragm and \nthe digestive system. When a diaphragmatic hernia occurs, the abdominal \norgans move into and develop in the chest instead of remaining in the \nabdomen. With the heart, lungs, and abdominal organs all taking up \nspace in the chest, the lungs do not have space to develop properly. \nThis may cause the lungs to be small and underdeveloped.\n  A diaphragmatic hernia is a life-threatening condition. When the \nlungs do not develop properly during pregnancy, it can be difficult for \nthe baby to breathe after birth or the baby is unable to take in enough \noxygen to stay healthy.\n  CDH will normally be diagnosed by a prenatal ultrasound, as early as \nthe 16th week of pregnancy. If undiagnosed before birth, the baby may \nbe born in a facility that is not equipped to treat its compromised \nsystem because many CDH babies will need to be placed on a heart-lung \nbypass machine, which is not available in many hospitals. All babies \nborn with CDH will need to be cared for in a neonatal intensive care \nunit, NICU, and most will need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, \nECMO.\n  Babies born with CDH will have difficulty breathing as their lungs \nare often too small, biochemically and structurally immature. As a \nresult, the babies are intubated as soon as they are born, and parents \nare often unable to hold their babies for weeks or even months at a \ntime.\n  Most diaphragmatic hernias are repaired with surgery 1 to 5 days \nafter birth, usually with a GORE-TEX patch. The abdominal organs that \nhave migrated into the chest are put back where they are supposed to be \nand the hole in the diaphragm is closed, hopefully allowing the \naffected lungs to expand. Hospitalization often ranges from 3 weeks to \n10 weeks following the procedure, depending on the severity of the \ncondition.\n  Survivors often have difficulty feeding, some require a second \nsurgery to control reflux, others require a feeding tube, and a few \nwill reherniate and require additional repair.\n  Awareness, good prenatal care, early diagnosis, and skilled treatment \nare the keys to a greater survival rate in these babies. That is why \nthis resolution is so important.\n  Within the last year, researchers identified a specific gene that may \ncontribute to CDH. The research found that an abnormality in a gene, \nNdst1, could lead to the development of CDH. This study was conducted \non mice, so more research is needed to determine the role of this gene \nin humans. However, it certainly is a step in the right direction \ntoward identifying the cause of this defect.\n  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect that occurs in 1 \nout of every 3,817 live births worldwide. The CDC estimates that CDH \naffects 1,088 babies in the U.S. each year.\n  Every 10 minutes a baby is born with CDH, adding up to more than \n600,000 babies with CDH since just 2000. CDH is a severe, sometimes \nfatal defect that occurs nearly as often as cystic fibrosis and spina \nbifida. Yet, most people have never heard of CDH. The cause of CDH is \nunknown. Most cases of diaphragmatic hernia are believed to be multi-\nfactorial in origin, meaning both genetic and environmental are \ninvolved. It is thought that multiple genes from both parents, as well \nas a number of environmental factors that scientists do not yet fully \nunderstand, contribute to the development of a diaphragmatic hernia.\n  Up to 20 percent of cases of CDH have a genetic cause due to a \nchromosome defect or genetic syndrome. According to the CDC, babies \nborn with CDH experience a high mortality rate ranging from 20 percent \nto 60 percent depending on the severity of the defect and the \ntreatments available at delivery. The mortality rate has remained \nstable since 1999.\n  Approximately 40 percent of babies born with CDH will have other \nbirth defects in addition to CDH. The most common is a congenital heart \ndefect.\n  Babies born with CDH today have a better chance of survival due to \nearly detection and research on treatment options. Researchers are \nmaking great progress to determine the cause of this birth defect and \nto identify optimal treatment methods for babies born with CDH.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center on \nBirth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, NCBDDD and the National \nBirth Defects Prevention Network, NBDPN, collaborate to identify risk \nfactors for birth defects and to assess the effect of these birth \ndefects on children, families, and the healthcare system. NBDPN \ninvestigators are currently working to examine risk factors for CDH and \npredictors of long-term survival for infants born with CDH, with \nanalysis planned in 2014 and publication anticipated by 2015.\n  In addition, investigators at the National Birth Defects Prevention \nStudy, NBDPS, have proposed conducting specific research to better \nunderstand risk factors for CDH, as well as factors that predict \nimproved survival rates for infants born with CDH.\n  In fiscal year 2013, NIH funded approximately $2,560,000 in CDH \nresearch.\n  The Developmental Biology and Structural Variations Branch, DBSVB, at \nthe NIH is currently supporting a collaboration between basic \nscientists who study CDH and clinicians who work with CDH patients and \ntheir families by working with the Massachusetts General Hospital and \nthe Children's Hospital of Boston. The researchers then use the genetic \ninformation and biological samples obtained from patients and their \nfamilies to identify specific genes that could be involved in the \ndefect.\n  In 2009, my grandson Jim Beau was diagnosed with CDH during my \ndaughter Mary Abigail's 34th week of pregnancy. At that time, no one in \nmy family had heard of CDH before. Fortunately, she was referred to Dr. \nDavid Kays at Shands Children's Hospital in Gainesville, FL, who is a \npremier surgeon and expert on CDH.\n  Jim Beau was born on November 30, 2009. My daughter and her husband \nPaul heard their son cry out twice after he was born, right before they \nintubated him, but they were not allowed to hold him.\n  The doctors let his little lungs get strong before they did the \nsurgery to\n\n[[Page S2374]]\n\ncorrect the hernia when he was 4 days old.\n  It turned out that the hole in the hernia was large. His intestines, \nspleen and one kidney were up in his chest. The skilled surgeon was \nable to close the hole and properly arrange the organs. Thankfully, Jim \nBeau did not have to go on a heart/lung bypass machine, but he was on a \nventilator for 12 days and on oxygen for 36 days. In total, he was in \nthe NICU for 43 days before he was able to go home.\n  He is now a healthy, high-spirited 4-year-old and a delight to be \naround.\n  Fortunately for my family and thousands of similar families across \nthe United States, a number of physicians are doing incredible work to \ncombat CDH. The CDH survival rate at Shands Children's Hospital in \nGainesville, FL, where my grandson was treated, is one of those fine \ncenters. The survival rate of CDH babies born at Shands is between 80 \npercent and 90 percent.\n  Dr. David Kays, the head physician and who performed my grandson's \nsurgeries, uses gentle ventilation therapy as opposed to \nhyperventilation. Gentle ventilation therapy is less aggressive and \ntherefore protects the underdeveloped lungs.\n  Dr. Kays published a paper in the Annals of Surgery in October 2013 \nregarding his work with CDH babies. He and his colleagues reviewed 208 \nCDH patients to analyze the impact of the timing of the hernia repair \non babies born with CDH. This study found that those with more severe \nCDH may benefit from repair before ECMO, while those with a less severe \nhernia have higher survival rates and reduced need of ECMO if the \nrepair surgery is delayed at least 48 hours after birth, as was the \ncase with Jim Beau. This conclusion is a vital step in the development \nof a risk-specific treatment strategy for management of CDH. The final \nline of Dr. Kays' paper should be noted:\n\n       [T]he survival attained in this large and inclusive series \n     of patients with CDH should be reassuring to physicians and \n     parents faced with a new prenatal diagnosis of CDH.\n\n  My family was very lucky that Jim Beau's defect was caught before he \nwas born, and that he was in the right place to receive excellent care \nfor his CDH.\n  The resolution Senator Cardin and I introduced is important because \nit will bring awareness to this birth defect, and this awareness will \nsave lives. Although hundreds of thousands of babies have been \ndiagnosed with this defect, the causes are still unknown and more \nresearch is needed. Every year more is learned and there are more \nsuccesses. We are making good progress and we must continue our \nefforts.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation to \nbring awareness to CDH.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2374-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT 35TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to celebrate the 35th anniversary \nof the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act, TRA, which has served as \na tangible symbol of the unbreakable friendship between the United \nStates and Taiwan. Today, the partnership between our two countries is \nstronger than ever.\n  The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act provides the framework for our official \nengagements with Taiwan, which marked the end of our official \ndiplomatic ties. For 35 years the TRA has facilitated a partnership \ncommitted to facilitating trade, investment, security cooperation, and \npromoting regional security.\n  The bilateral achievements made through the TRA have allowed our \ncitizens to create innovative and lasting advancements to the world \neconomy. Today, Taiwan stands as our 12th largest trading partner, and \nin 2013, the United States and Taiwan traded over $63 billion in goods \nand services. This bilateral relationship has supported thousands of \njobs in both countries, and we must remain committed to the mutual \ngains this collaboration can provide.\n  I applaud our West Virginia businesses that have recognized the \npotential of the Taiwanese economy and exported over $41 million in \ncommodities, high-tech goods, and services to Taiwan last year. We must \nbuild on this strong foundation while helping Taiwan meet its needs for \nforeign sources of energy. I will continue to seek opportunities for \nfurther trade integration with Taiwan and shared economic prosperity.\n  I look forward to working hand-in-hand with our friends in Taiwan to \nensure the next generation of American leaders can stand where I stand \ntoday, 35 years from now, and celebrate several more decades of \npeaceful and vibrant collaboration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2374-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ARMENIAN GENOCIDE ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, the Armenian genocide is sometimes called \nthe ``forgotten genocide.'' But every April, we come together to \nremember and commemorate the Armenian genocide and to declare that we \nwill never forget.\n  In order to prevent future genocides, we must clearly acknowledge and \nremember those of the past. For many years the Congress has had before \nit a resolution which clearly affirms the factual reality that the \nArmenian genocide did occur. I was a strong and vocal supporter of the \ngenocide resolution for my entire tenure in the House, and I am proud \nto have joined Senator Menendez and Senator Kirk in introducing the \nArmenian genocide resolution in the Senate.\n  This is the 99th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, yet the \nsuffering will continue for Armenians and non-Armenians alike as long \nas the world allows denial to exist and prevail. It is long overdue for \nthe United States to join the many other nations that have formally \nrecognized the Armenian genocide.\n  That is why today's passage by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nof the genocide resolution in advance of the 99th anniversary is so \nhistoric. I was proud to vote for this important resolution today in \ncommittee, and I will keep fighting to ensure its passage by the full \nSenate. I will continue to work with the Armenian-American community to \nbuild a prosperous and bright future for the Armenian people.\n  We must continue to stand with our ally Armenia to address the \nchallenges they face. Armenia is confronted with blockades by Turkey \nand Azerbaijan--one of the longest lasting blockades in modern history. \nThe United States must provide increased assistance to Armenia, work to \npromote trade with Armenia, and work to reestablish the Turkish \nGovernment's commitment to normalized relations. And the United States \nshould work to facilitate a closer relationship between Armenia and \nEurope.\n  The Armenian people are true survivors. Despite repeated invasions, \nloss of land, and the loss of between one-half and three-quarters of \ntheir population in the genocide, the people of Armenia have prevailed.\n  We have a shared responsibility to ensure that the Armenian people \nare able to build their own independent and prosperous future. Together \nwe can continue to build an Armenia that is respected and honored by \nits allies and neighbors. But for this to happen, there needs to be \nuniversal acknowledgement of the horror that was the Armenian genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2374-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2374-S2375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARION LOOMIS\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, after 38 years with the Wyoming Mining \nAssociation, Marion Loomis is retiring.\n  Marion started his career in the early 1970s with the State of \nWyoming's Department of Economic Planning and Development as an \neconomic development geologist. In one of his first jobs, he ran the \nfuel allocation office during the Arab oil embargo in 1973. In 1976, he \njoined the Wyoming Mining Association and was made executive director \nin 1991. His vast knowledge and experience are tremendous assets to the \nState and its people, and we are grateful for his service.\n  In Wyoming, we have adopted the Code of the West as our official \nState code of ethics. Marion Loomis personifies the code. This list of \nten ideals every man and woman should live by perfectly describes \nMarion's personal--and professional--demeanor. Marion Loomis takes \nquiet pride in his work. With his advocacy, Wyoming has seen \nexponential growth in the coal industry. When he began, Wyoming \nproduced 8 million tons of coal annually. Today, around 400 million \ntons of Wyoming coal are mined and shipped nationwide--and worldwide.\n\n[[Page S2375]]\n\n  Marion has never been one to boast or brag. Instead, he lets his \naccomplishments speak for themselves. In the past 40 years, Wyoming's \nproduction of trona has grown from 1 mine that produced 300,000 tons \nper year to 4 mines which produce over 10 million tons annually. When \nhe speaks, people listen. They know that his opinions reflect a \nlifetime of study and are tough, balanced, and fair.\n  Throughout his career, Marion Loomis has been a champion for Wyoming \nenergy. He was a steadfast leader for the Wyoming Mining Association \nduring several boom and bust cycles in energy development. The State's \nuranium production is a prime example. He witnessed a booming industry \nstagnate in the 1990s. Today, it has emerged again as a valuable \nresource. Marion has always promoted Wyoming as a key player in our \nNation's quest for energy independence. He truly does ride for the \nbrand, and his leadership is inspiring.\n  Marion retired from the Wyoming Mining Association earlier this \nmonth. He will be missed, but he has left both the association and the \nindustry stronger, thanks to his dedication and hard work. In the days \nahead, Marion plans to fish the streams of Wyoming's Bighorn Mountains, \nwhere he and his wife have a cabin. I cannot think of a more fitting \nreward for a job--and a career--well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2375-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL HEALTHCARE DECISIONS DAY\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to recognize National Healthcare \nDecisions Day, which is next Wednesday, April 16, a day to educate the \npublic about advance care planning and encourage them to have \nconversations with loved ones to plan for end-of-life decisions. I am \npleased that over 50 organizations--representing health providers, \ncommunities of faith, the legal community, and the public sector--in \nFlorida are participating in the day's events.\n  This issue has been important to me throughout my career, and as the \nchairman of the Senate's Special Committee on Aging, I had the \nopportunity to chair a hearing on end-of-life care last June. We found \nthat polls show most Americans would like to talk about their advanced \ncare needs, but they do not know how or with whom to have these \nconversations. In fact, only about 20 percent of Americans have \nexecuted an advanced directive, in part due to a lack of knowledge \nabout planning.\n  Our hearing also touched on some commonsense solutions that \nindividuals have used to broach this topic with their loved ones. For \nexample, Aging with Dignity, an organization based in my home State of \nFlorida, has created a simple resource called Five Wishes that is \nfocused on things that are meaningful for patients and families, rather \nthan a system of advance care planning dictated exclusively by the \nterms of doctors and lawyers. Five Wishes takes into account personal, \nemotional, and spiritual needs as well as medical wishes. With a \nstraightforward, easy-to-complete questionnaire, Five Wishes takes end-\nof-life decision-making out of the emergency room and into the living \nroom.\n  There are also areas where the Federal Government could help \nalleviate some of the barriers individuals face in trying to complete \nan advance directive. We know many people could use the assistance of a \ntrusted health care provider in completing an advance directive. In \n2010, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--CMS--included \nadvance care planning as a reimbursable item as part of the annual \nwellness visit for Medicare beneficiaries under the Affordable Care \nAct. Unfortunately, just a short time later, CMS reversed itself and \nremoved this service as reimbursable. I hope this decision is \nrevisited.\n  At the same time, there are efforts at the State level. For example, \nin Florida, a consortium of health care providers, faith-based groups, \nand the legal profession are collaborating to establish the Physician \nOrders for Life-Sustaining Treatment program to ensure that advance \ndirectives are honored.\n  It is my hope Congress will support the goals of National Healthcare \nDecisions Day. Advance care planning is a desired health service and \nshould be a normal part of health care. Advance care planning can \nempower individuals and allow adults to voice their medical treatment \npreferences. Together, we can ensure Americans' wishes for medical care \nat the end of their lives are respected and achieved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2375-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2375-S2376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MEDICARE PHYSICIAN PAYMENT SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, recently the Senate failed to permanently \nrepeal the current system of automatic payment cuts for physicians who \ntreat Medicare patients and to replace it with a more sensible system \nfor reimbursing physicians. Instead, the Senate voted--yet again--to \npass a short-term patch to this broken system, which postponed these \npayment cuts for one more year.\n  After talking with Medicare providers in my State, I decided to \noppose this legislation since it provides only a bandaid for a wholly \nbroken system. I believe that an enduring solution is possible and \nabsolutely necessary, and I will continue to fight for a more \nsustainable replacement that rewards physicians for the high-quality \ncare they deliver.\n  Minnesota is No. 1 in the Nation when it comes to the quality of the \nhealth care that we provide. If our system of reimbursement could \nreward providers for their efficiency and quality--rather than the \nquantity of the services they administer--we could improve the value of \nthe care that our seniors receive while rewarding providers who keep \npatients healthy. We can do that by overhauling the Medicare physician \npayment formula and implementing a system that rewards health care \nvalue over volume, and there has never been a better moment to do that \nthan now. Over the past 10 years, Congress has spent $150 billion on \nshort-term fixes; the Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier \nthis year that the cost of permanently repealing the formula and \nreplacing it with a more sustainable program now would be even lower \nthan that total so far. For the first time since the passage of our \ncurrent formula, there was bipartisan, bicameral legislation to fully \nrepeal the Medicare physician payment formula and replace it with a \npayment system that would better reward physicians for providing high-\nvalue care.\n  We have a unique opportunity to permanently solve this problem. \nTemporary patches--like the one just passed--only perpetuate the \ninstability created by the annual threat of payment reductions. This \ninstability is bad for patients and bad for providers. Take, for \nexample, the young physician from Rogers, MN who recently called my \noffice to discuss how proposed payment cuts would affect his practice \nand his future. As a father and a new surgeon, this doctor described \nthe challenges of paying off high levels of debt and starting a new \npractice in a time of financial uncertainty. Temporary fixes will not \nhelp this young doctor to establish a practice and provide the best \npossible care to his patients. Stopgap measures fail to address the \nunderlying problem with the way Medicare pays for physician services, \nand I am tired of postponing good policies that help support high-\nquality providers in Minnesota.\n  It is clear that now is time to permanently repeal and replace the \nMedicare physician payment formula. That is why I did not support the \nlegislation to temporarily patch our provider payment system and why I \nam committed to working towards a permanent solution that would put in \nplace a payment system to reward high-value care.\n  My goal is to make sure that Medicare beneficiaries, now and in the \nfuture, have access to high-quality, affordable health care services. \nTo achieve this, Medicare must be on sound financial footing and be \nprepared to meet the needs of an aging baby boomer generation.\n  Replacing Medicare's broken system of provider payments with a system \nto promote high-value care is a critical step in this direction. I \nremain committed to helping to take this step.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \ninvaluable member of my staff on the Select Committee on Intelligence, \nAndrew Kerr. Andrew has been a familiar face around the committee for \nthe last 7 years, but he will leave us shortly to return to the State \nDepartment. I am\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\nhonored to have the opportunity to thank Andrew for his service on the \ncommittee, and I want to publicly note my appreciation for his \noutstanding work.\n  Since becoming the vice chairman of the committee in 2011, I have \noften looked to Andrew for guidance and counsel on intelligence and \ncounterterrorism matters. Despite the successes or shortcomings of the \nintelligence community, Andrew has always provided grounded and \ndependable advice. He has also done extensive oversight work designed \nto reduce excessive spending and encourage efficiency in the \nintelligence community.\n  Andrew is a dedicated public servant and I am sure the State \nDepartment is happy to have him return. His presence will be missed on \nthe committee and in the Senate, but I want to wish him well as he \nreturns to the Executive branch. Thanks Andrew, for a job well done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2376-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      SOUTH ANCHORAGE HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BEGICH.

Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to a \nstrong community leader, dedicated public servant, and advocate from \nthe State of Washington, Val Ogden.\n  Val was a longtime friend and I would not be where I am today without \nher support.\n  She was a community advocate, in the truest and strongest sense of \nthe word, and she was a champion for women and children.\n  She was a member of the Washington State House of Representatives, \nserving as speaker pro tempore.\n  Val was a leader for her community, securing funding for Washington \nState University Vancouver. She was a strong Democrat and very active \nin the Clark County Democratic Party. Val served as the executive \ndirector of the Clark County YWCA.\n  But you can't talk about Val without talking about her husband of 67 \nyears, Dan.

Along with Dan, \nshe is survived by three children: Dan, Janeth and Patti, six \ngrandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.\n  She will be missed by many but her legacy and leadership lives on.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in paying \nhomage to Val Ogden.

Mr. President, I wish to bring to your attention \nto a remarkable Vermont family.\n  The Marvin family has an incredible family tie to Vermont and to one \nof the State's best known products--maple syrup. David Marvin founded \nButternut Mountain Farm in 1972 on land his father purchased in \nJohnson, VT., in the 1950s.\n  David Marvin has a strong and enduring commitment to an iconic \nVermont industry. Through careful stewardship, and with the help of his \nwife Lucy, he has built a company renowned for quality maple products.\n  The family produced maple syrup, grew Christmas trees and consulted \non timber management. Today, David's children, Ira and Emma, are \nintegral to the operation, which includes more than 80 employees, maple \nsyrup from 300 Vermont farms, and a 75,000 square-foot facility in \nMorrisville, VT. Butternut Mountain Farm is more than just a producer \nof maple syrup; it has also become an effective marketer of a treasured \nproduct of Vermont.\n  The family and the company have been recognized for their success. \nJust a decade after the company's founding, for example, Butternut \nMountain Farm was named Vermont State Tree Farm of the Year and \nNational Tree Farm of the Year by the American Forest Institute.\n  The Marvins are encouraging a culture of conservation. Their \nMorrisville operation is increasingly relying on renewable energies and \nenergy efficiency. The family has also developed a pay structure that \nseeks to reward employees with flexible hours, to help reduce commuting \ncosts, and a fair wage.\n  It is also worth noting that the Marvin family's business plays a \ncrucial role in supporting the jobs of countless Vermonters throughout \nthe state who produce maple syrup which is bottled by Butternut \nMountain Farm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2376-5", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2376-6", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2376-7", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2376-S2377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2195.

A bill to secure the Federal voting rights of persons when \nreleased from incarceration; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nDemocracy Restoration Act, known as the DRA. I want to thank Judiciary \nCommittee Chairman Leahy and Senators Durbin, Whitehouse, Booker, \nHarkin, and Sanders as original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  As the late Senator Kennedy often said, civil rights is the \n``unfinished business'' of America. The Democracy Restoration Act would \nrestore voting rights in Federal elections to approximately 5.8 million \ncitizens who have been released from prison and are back living in \ntheir communities.\n  After the Civil War, Congress enacted and the States ratified the \nFifteenth Amendment, which provides that ``the right of citizens of the \nUnited States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United \nStates or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition \nof servitude. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by \nappropriate legislation.''\n  Unfortunately, many States passed laws during the Jim Crow period \nafter the Civil War to make it more difficult for newly-freed slaves to \nvote in elections. Such laws included poll taxes, literacy tests, and \ndisenfranchisement measures. Some disenfranchisement measures applied \nto misdemeanor convictions and in practice could result in lifetime \ndisenfranchisement, even for individuals that successfully reintegrated \ninto their communities as law-abiding citizens.\n  It took Congress and the States nearly another century to eliminate \nthe poll tax, upon the ratification of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment in \n1964. The Amendment provides that ``the rights of citizens of the \nUnited States to vote in any primary or other election for President or \nVice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not \nbe denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of \nfailure to pay any poll tax or other tax.''\n  Shortly thereafter Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \nwhich swept away numerous State laws and procedures that had denied \nAfrican-Americans and other minorities their constitutional right to \nvote. For example, the act outlawed the use of literacy or history \ntests that voters had to pass before registering to vote or casting \ntheir ballot.\n  The act specifically prohibits States from imposing any ``voting \nqualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or \nprocedure . . . to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the \nUnited States to vote on account of race or color.'' Congress \noverwhelmingly reauthorized the Act in 2006, which was signed into law \nby President George W. Bush. Congress is now working on legislation to \nrevitalize the VRA after recent Supreme Court decisions curtailed its \nreach.\n  In 2014, I am concerned that there are still several areas where the \nlegacy of Jim Crow laws and State disenfranchisement statutes lead to \nunfairness in Federal elections. First, State laws governing the \nrestoration of voting rights vary widely throughout the country, such \nthat persons in some States can easily regain their voting rights, \nwhile in other States persons effectively lose their right to vote \npermanently. Second, these State disenfranchisement laws have a \ndisproportionate impact on racial and ethnic minorities. Third, this \npatchwork of State laws results in the lack of a uniform standard for \neligibility to vote in Federal elections, and leads to an unfair \ndisparity and unequal participation in Federal elections based solely \non where an individual lives. Finally, studies indicate that former \nprisoners who have voting rights restored are less likely to reoffend, \nand disenfranchisement hinders their rehabilitation and reintegration \ninto their community.\n  In 35 States, convicted individuals may not vote while they are on \nparole. In 11 States, a conviction can result in lifetime \ndisenfranchisement. Several States require prisoners to seek \ndiscretionary pardons from Governors, or action by the parole or pardon \nboard, in order to regain their right to vote. Several States deny the \nright to vote to individuals convicted of certain misdemeanors. States \nare slowly moving or repeal or loosen many of these barriers to voting \nfor ex-prisoners.\n  An estimated 5,850,000 citizens of the United States, or about 1 in \n40 adults in the United States, currently cannot vote as a result of a \nfelony conviction. Of the 5,850,000 citizens barred from voting, only \n25 percent are in prison. By contrast, 75 percent of the \ndisenfranchised reside in their communities while on probation or \nparole after having completed their sentences. Approximately 2,600,000 \ncitizens who have completed their sentences remain disenfranchised due \nto restrictive State laws. In six States: Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, \nMississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia--more than 7 percent of the total \npopulation is disenfranchised.\n  Studies show that a growing number of African-American men, for \nexample, will be disenfranchised at some point in their life, partly \ndue to mandatory minimum sentencing laws that have a disproportionate \nimpact on minorities.\n  Eight percent of the African-American population, or 2 million \nAfrican-Americans, are disenfranchised. Given current rates of \nincarceration, approximately 1 in 3 of the next generation of African-\nAmerican men will be disenfranchised at some point during their \nlifetime. Currently, 1 of every 13 African-Americans are rendered \nunable to vote because of felony disenfranchisement, which is a rate 4 \ntimes greater than non African-Americans. Nearly 8 percent of African-\nAmericans are disenfranchised, compared to less than 2 percent of non-\nAfrican-Americans. In 3 states more than 1 in 5 African-Americans are \nunable to vote because of prior convictions: the rates are Florida at \n23 percent, Kentucky at 22 percent, and Virginia at 20 percent.\n  Latino citizens are disproportionately disenfranchised based on their \ndisproportionate representation in the criminal justice system. If \ncurrent incarceration trends hold, 17 percent of Latino men will be \nincarcerated during their lifetime, in contrast to less than 6 percent \nof non-Latino white men. When analyzing the data across 10 States, \nLatinos generally have disproportionately higher rates of \ndisenfranchisement compared to their presence in the voting age \npopulation. In 6 out of 10 States studies in 2003, Latinos constitute \nmore than 10 percent of the total number of persons disenfranchised by \nState felony laws. In 4 States, California, 37 percent; New York, 34 \npercent; Texas, 30 percent; and Arizona, 27 percent, Latinos were \ndisenfranchised by a rate of more than 25 percent. Native Americans are \nalso disproportionately disenfranchised.\n  Congress has addressed part of this problem by enacting the Fair \nSentencing Act to partially reduce the sentencing disparity between \ncrack cocaine and powder cocaine convictions. Congress is now \nconsidering legislation\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\nthat would more broadly revise mandatory sentencing procedures and \ncreate a fairer system of sentencing. While I welcome these steps, I \nbelieve that Congress should take stronger action now to remedy this \nparticular problem.\n  The legislation would restore voting rights to prisoners after their \nrelease from incarceration. It requires that prisons receiving Federal \nfunds notify people about their right to vote in Federal elections when \nthey are leaving prison, sentenced to probation, or convicted of a \nmisdemeanor. The bill authorizes the Department of Justice and \nindividuals harmed by violation of this act to sue to enforce its \nprovisions. The bill generally provides State election officials with a \ngrace period to resolve voter eligibility complaints without a lawsuit \nbefore an election.\n  The legislation is narrowly crafted to apply to Federal elections, \nand retains the States' authorities to generally establish voting \nqualifications. This legislation is therefore consistent with \nCongressional authority under the Constitution and voting rights \nstatutes, as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has been endorsed by a large \ncoalition of public interest organizations, including: civil rights and \nreform organizations; religious and faith-based organizations; and law \nenforcement and criminal justice organizations. In particular I want to \nthank the Brennan Center for Justice, the ACLU, the Leadership \nConference on Civil and Human Rights, and the NAACP for their work on \nthis legislation.\n  This legislation is ultimately designed to reduce recidivism rates \nand help reintegrate ex-prisoners back into society. When prisoners are \nreleased, they are expected to obey the law, get a job, and pay taxes \nas they are rehabilitated and reintegrated into their community. With \nthese responsibilities and obligations of citizenship should also come \nthe rights of citizenship, including the right to vote.\n  In 2008, President George W. Bush signed the Second Chance Act into \nlaw, after overwhelming approval and strong bipartisan support in \nCongress. The legislation expanded the Prison Re-Entry Initiative, by \nproviding job training, placement services, transitional housing, drug \ntreatment, medical care, and faith-based mentoring. At the signing \nceremony, President Bush said: ``We believe that even those who have \nstruggled with a dark past can find brighter days ahead. One way we act \non that belief is by helping former prisoners who have paid for their \ncrimes. We help them build new lives as productive members of our \nsociety.''\n  The Democracy Restoration Act is fully consistent with the goals of \nthe Second Chance Act, as Congress and the States seek to reduce \nrecidivism rates, strengthen the quality of life in our communities and \nmake them safer, and reduce the burden on taxpayers.\n  More recently, in a February 2014 speech, Attorney General Eric \nHolder called on elected officials to reexamine disenfranchisement \nstatutes and enact reforms to restore voting rights.\n  I therefore urge Congress to address the issue of disenfranchisement \nand support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 2243. A bill to expand eligibility for the program of \ncomprehensive assistance for family caregivers of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, to expand benefits available to participants under \nsuch program, to enhance special compensation for members of the \nuniformed services who require assistance in everyday life, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce \nthe Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act. This is a \nbill that will make critical improvements to how we support our ill and \ninjured veterans and their caregivers.\n  I am especially pleased to be joined this morning by our former \ncolleague Senator Elizabeth Dole, who has come to the floor today and \nwho has been such a tremendous and invaluable person in working to \nbring these caregiver issues to national attention. I really appreciate \nher being here and being such a champion on this, and a leader. She has \nbrought people from all over the country together to make a difference \nfor our caregivers and for our veterans.\n  We also have many of the very caregivers this bill is designed to \nhelp--representing, by the way, almost every State--in the gallery \ntoday to see this legislation introduced. I am very proud they are \nhere. It is incredibly important that they are here today and on \nCapitol Hill because, as the Presiding Officer knows, our caregivers \nwork extremely hard without any recognition, and they rarely ask for \nanything for themselves. In fact, most of the caregivers I have met \nsound much like the veterans and servicemembers they care for when they \nsay: Oh, this isn't about me; I am just doing my part.\n  So last week, when RAND released their comprehensive, groundbreaking \nstudy on military caregivers, they chose a very appropriate title: \n``Hidden Heroes.'' That is why it is so important to have all of those \ncaregivers here today and working constantly to make sure we all \nunderstand what they do.\n  I am very proud to be introducing this bill not only as a Senator and \na senior member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and someone who has \nfought so hard for the implementation of the VA caregivers program, \nbut, as many of my colleagues know, for me, this is really a deeply \npersonal issue.\n  Growing up, I saw firsthand the many ways military service can affect \nboth veterans and their families. My father served in World War II. He \nwas among the first soldiers to land in Okinawa. He came home as a \ndisabled veteran and was awarded the Purple Heart.\n  Later in life he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Eventually he \nbecame too sick to work at the little five-and-dime store he managed, \nand my mom became his caregiver. This was no small burden for my mom, \nwho had to raise seven children, care for my dad, and was now all of a \nsudden the primary source of income for our family.\n  Today, after more than a decade of two wars, men and women in \nuniform, as did my father, have done everything that has been asked of \nthem and so much more. But now, as our role in this conflict winds \ndown, the support we provide cannot end when the war no longer leads \nthe nightly news broadcasts and disappears from the front pages of our \nnewspapers. It is an enduring commitment for those who will first need \nhelp now or those who will need help later in their lives. It is a \nlifetime of care for so many.\n  In so many cases, the responsibility for providing that care often \nfalls on the loved ones of severely injured veterans. Their courage and \ntheir devotion in taking on these responsibilities is inspiring for all \nof us. They are the reason we created the VA caregivers program, which \nnow provides these family members with health care and counseling and \ntraining and respite and a living stipend.\n  I was proud to lead congressional efforts to push the VA to stop \ndelaying the implementation of the caregivers program and restore the \neligibility criteria to the intent of the law. Thankfully, as we know, \nin the end the White House and the VA announced they would allow more \ncaregivers of more veterans to be eligible for benefits and finally got \nthe program implemented. But there is a lot more we can do because, as \nthe RAND study clearly shows us, caregivers are still struggling. \nMilitary caregivers have significantly worse health than noncaregivers, \nand they are at higher risk for depression. The stress they live under \njeopardizes their relationships and puts them at greater risk of \ndivorce, and they have trouble with employment and keeping health \ninsurance. There is no way we will sit by and let caregivers and \nveterans face this on their own--not when we can make it a little bit \neasier.\n  The bill we are introducing this morning, the Military and Veterans \nCaregivers and Services Improvement Act, makes some broad changes to \nhelp give caregivers and veterans the tools they need to help tackle \nwhat they face. I wish to take a moment on the floor today to highlight \njust a few of the important provisions contained in this bill.\n  First and foremost, this bill will make veterans of all eras eligible \nfor the full range of caregiver support services. We took an important \nfirst step in creating the post-9/11 veterans caregivers program. Now \nthat the VA has had some time to get this program\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\nworking, it is time for us to get services to our older veterans who \nare also in great need.\n  The bill also expands eligibility for the VA caregivers program by \nrecognizing a wider array of needs which may require caregiving, \nplacing greater emphasis on mental health injuries and removing \nrestrictions on who is eligible to become a caregiver.\n  Under the bill, caregiver services will also be expanded to include \nchildcare, financial advice, and legal counseling. Those are some of \nthe top and currently unmet needs of family caregivers.\n  The bill will also require the Federal Government to meet the unique \nneeds of employees who are caregivers with flexible work arrangements \nso they can stay employed while caring for their veteran. I, of course, \nwant to see all employers make these kinds of accommodations for \ncaregivers, but I want the Federal Government to lead by example.\n  When it comes to the Department of Defense, the bill makes several \nimprovements to the special compensation for assistance with activities \nof daily living--first, by making those benefits tax exempt, and \nsecond, eligibility for special compensation would also be set at a \nmore appropriate level of disability and would be more inclusive of \nmental health injuries and TBI.\n  The Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act also \naddresses a key theme identified by RAND. There are many services \ninside the government and outside to assist caregivers, but these \nprograms are not coordinated. Eligibility criteria are different for \neach one of them, and there is not enough oversight to ensure the \nquality of those services. So what our bill does is create a national \ninteragency working group on caregiver services. It will coordinate \ncaregiver policy among all the different departments and create \nstandards of care and oversight tools to make sure our veterans and \ntheir caregivers receive high-quality services.\n  The last provision I wish to highlight is intended to help a military \nspouse who may be required to become the primary source of income for \nthe family after the servicemember has been injured, just as my mom \nwas. In order to help that spouse get the job they need to support the \nfamily, this bill will allow the injured servicemember or veteran to \ntransfer their post-9/11 GI bill benefits to their dependents by \nexempting them from the length of service requirements that would \ncurrently prevent them from transferring those benefits. Injured \nveterans should not be penalized because their injury occurred early in \ntheir service.\n  This provision is extremely important because for 2013 the \nunemployment rate for people with bachelor's degrees was only 4 \npercent--about one-third lower than the national average--and their \nmedian weekly earnings were 34 percent higher than the national \naverage. Meanwhile, the RAND study found that 62 percent of post-9/11 \ncaregivers reported financial strain because of their caregiving.\n  I know this is important because I saw it in my family. For my \nfamily, the additional education my mom obtained got her a better job \nso she could support her family while she was caring for my dad. It is \nwhat made the difference.\n\n  I want to again thank some key people who have been true leaders to \nget this to this point.\n  I again want to thank Senator Dole and her great staff at the \nElizabeth Dole Foundation for keeping our country focused on the needs \nof our military and veteran caregivers and for bringing such national \nmomentum to make the changes we need.\n  I also want to thank the Wounded Warrior Project, which was a driving \nforce in creating the very first VA caregivers program. They have \nprovided invaluable advice in developing the bill I am introducing \ntoday.\n  Finally, I really want to thank the outstanding folks at the RAND \nCorporation. They have put together a truly groundbreaking study that \ntakes stock of where care and benefits have fallen short, where new \nneeds are emerging, and how we can make it easier for veterans to get \nthe care and benefits they deserve.\n  There are many ways for the whole country--government, nonprofits, \nbusinesses, community leaders, faith leaders--to do more to help. For \nall of us in Congress, that starts with passing this legislation to \nhelp our hidden heroes--our military and veteran caregivers.\n  I again want to thank all of our tremendous caregivers in this \ncountry for their service, for not asking for help, as they should. We \nare the ones who need to ask for help for them and to be there to \nprovide it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2243\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 421\n\n       Whereas June 6, 2014, marks the 70th anniversary of the \n     Allied assault at Normandy, France, by American, British, and \n     Canadian troops, which was known as Operation Overlord;\n       Whereas, before Operation Overlord, the German Army still \n     occupied France and the Nazi government still had access to \n     the raw materials and industrial capacity of Western Europe;\n       Whereas the naval assault phase on Normandy was codenamed \n     ``Neptune'', and the June 6th assault date is referred to as \n     D-Day to denote the day on which the combat attack was \n     initiated;\n       Whereas the D-Day landing was the largest single amphibious \n     assault in history, consisting of approximately 31,000 \n     members of the United States Armed Forces, 153,000 members of \n     the Allied Expeditionary Force, 5,000 naval vessels, and more \n     than 11,000 sorties by Allied aircraft;\n       Whereas soldiers of 6 divisions (3 American, 2 British, and \n     1 Canadian) stormed ashore in 5 main landing areas on beaches \n     in Normandy, which were code-named ``Utah'', ``Omaha'', \n     ``Gold'', ``Juno'', and ``Sword'';\n       Whereas, of the approximately 10,000 Allied casualties \n     incurred on the first day of the landing, more than 6,000 \n     casualties were members of the United States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas the age of the remaining World War II veterans and \n     the gradual disappearance of any living memory of World War \n     II and the Normandy landings make it necessary to increase \n     activities intended to pass on the history of these events, \n     particularly to younger generations;\n       Whereas the young people of Normandy and the United States \n     have displayed unprecedented commitment to and involvement in \n     celebrating the veterans of the Normandy landings and the \n     freedom that they brought with them in 1944;\n       Whereas the significant material remains of the Normandy \n     landing, such as shipwrecks and various items of military \n     equipment found both on the Normandy beaches and at the \n     bottom of the sea in French territorial waters, bear witness \n     to the remarkable material resources used by the Allied Armed \n     Forces to execute the Normandy landings;\n       Whereas 5 Normandy beaches and a number of sites on the \n     Normandy coast, including Pointe du Hoc, were the scene of \n     the Normandy landings, and constitute both now and for all \n     time a unique piece of humanity's world heritage, and a \n     symbol of peace and freedom, whose unspoilt nature, \n     integrity, and authenticity must be protected at all costs; \n     and\n       Whereas the world owes a debt of gratitude to the members \n     of the ``greatest generation'' who assumed the task of \n     freeing the world from Nazi and Fascist regimes and restoring \n     liberty to Europe: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 70th anniversary of the Allied \n     amphibious landing on D-Day, June 6, 1944, at Normandy, \n     France, during World War II;\n       (2) expresses gratitude and appreciation to the members of \n     the United States Armed Forces who participated in the D-Day \n     operations;\n       (3) thanks the young people of Normandy and the United \n     States for their involvement in recognizing and celebrating \n     the 70th Anniversary of the Normandy landings with the aim of \n     making future generations aware of the acts of heroism and \n     sacrifice performed by the Allied forces;\n       (4) recognizes the efforts of the Government of France and \n     the people of Normandy to preserve, for future generations, \n     the unique world heritage represented by the Normandy beaches \n     and the sunken material remains of the Normandy landing, by \n     inscribing them on the United Nations Educational, \n     Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage \n     List; and\n       (5) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe the anniversary \n     with appropriate ceremonies and programs to honor the \n     sacrifices of their fellow countrymen to liberate Europe.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, on June 6th, 1944, the brave men and \nwomen of the Allied Forces began the opening phase of Operation \nOverlord in an effort to break the Nazi stranglehold on Western Europe. \nOn that early morning, 31,000 members of the United States Armed \nForces, and 153,000 of their counterparts in the Allied Expeditionary \nForce, stormed ashore five landing areas on the beaches of Normandy, \nFrance, in what is known as D-Day. In that first day alone, \napproximately 10,000 allied soldiers were wounded or killed, including \n6,000 Americans. Now, 70 years later, it remains our duty to remember \nthe sacrifices made by the members of the ``greatest generation'' who \nanswered the call of those being oppressed by the Nazi and Fascist \nregimes. In recognition of the incredible feats achieved by our \nveterans, the Parliament of the French Republic has asked to join us in \nthe passage of an identical resolution in both bodies, honoring these \nsacrifices made in the name of liberty. As co-chairs of the Senate \nFrench Caucus, I have joined with Senator Landrieu to introduce this \nresolution to recognize the upcoming 70th Anniversary of the D-Day \nLandings and to express our gratitude and appreciation to the members \nof the U.S. Armed Forces who participated in these operations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/10/senate-section/article/S2387-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 422--TO AUTHORIZE WRITTEN TESTIMONY, DOCUMENT \n  PRODUCTION, AND REPRESENTATION IN MONTANA FISH, WILDLIFE AND PARKS \n                   FOUNDATION, INC.
