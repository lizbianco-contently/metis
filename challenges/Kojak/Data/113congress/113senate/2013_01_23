Madam President, yesterday I had the opportunity to meet \nwith my Democratic Senate caucus for the first time this year. It was \nthe first opportunity for all of us to sit down together, to break \nbread, and to discuss challenges and opportunities we all face. As the \nmajority leader, I was gratified to see so many new faces and to have \nsuch an inclusive caucus. It was music to my ears to hear the \nannouncement that the Presiding Officer today would be Heidi Heitkamp.\n  We have nine new Democratic Senators. Four of these new Senators are \nwomen, and so about one-third of our Democratic caucus is now women. We \nhave, for example, the first Asian woman. We have expanded our \nmajority. I am particularly satisfied that with each passing election \ncycle our caucus better reflects the Nation it serves. But despite the \ndiversity of the caucus--and in particular its freshmen--there is one \nquality shared by each Democratic Senator: deep and abiding patriotism.\n  As Governor Adlai Stevenson said:\n\n       Patriotism is not short, frenzied outbursts of emotion, but \n     the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime.\n\n  That is true. Patriotism is not short, frenzied outbursts of emotion, \nbut the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime. If we look at the \nrecords, the careers of these new Senators, that is the way it is.\n  Each person coming here reminds me of my first few weeks in the House \nof Representatives when Tip O'Neill--we had a large incoming class, so \nhe called us in these groups of maybe 15 or so, and he told us \nsomething I have always remembered. He said: Each of you are successful \npoliticians or you wouldn't be here. And that is true. I say that to \neach of my new Senators. They are successful politicians, and there is \nnothing wrong with the word ``politician.'' I am proud I am a \npolitician. I am proud I serve in government, and we should each be \nproud.\n  So I am pleased now, and I was pleased yesterday, to be surrounded by \nso many dedicated public servants, new Members and old alike, who have \ndevoted their lives to making their individual States and our shared \nNation a better place in which to grow up, grow a family, and grow old.\n  Each new Democratic Member is accomplished, I repeat, in his or her \nown right. Our new caucus members include a couple of former Governors, \na Harvard law professor, an engineer, just to name a few. While they \nhave each accomplished so much already, their greatest achievements are \nstill ahead of them. I know they will look back with satisfaction on \nthe work we do together in the Senate.\n  Our caucus, this Congress, and our country face immense challenges. \nAs we approach these tests and trials, this diverse group of new \nDemocratic Senators will be united by a single objective: to fight for \nfairness and balance on behalf of the middle class.\n\n[[Page S190]]\n\n                          Senate Rules Reform\n\n  We are going to continue to work on Senate rules reforms. I will \ncontinue to work with the Republican leader on a package of reforms I \nhope we can agree on. As I have said before, if we don't agree, then we \nare going to do something as a Democratic caucus alone. I remain \ncautiously optimistic we will be able to move forward on a bipartisan \nbasis. I hope we can do that. I will have more to say about that if, in \nfact, we can do that.\n  We are not going to get everything we want, and the Republicans \naren't going to get everything they want. But maybe we can find a sweet \nspot in the middle and come up with something that will make the Senate \nmore efficient. However, Democrats reserve the right of all Senators to \npropose changes to the Senate rules. We will explicitly not acquiesce \nin the carrying over of all the rules from last Congress. There must be \nsome agreement reached or we will have to use every means to make the \nCongress--especially the Senate--more efficient.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S190-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, earlier this week, through the eyes of \nthe Nation watched the inauguration ceremony here in Washington. A week \nbefore that, back in Indiana, I was present for the celebration of the \ninauguration of Indiana's 50th Governor, former Congressman Mike Pence, \nwho is taking over after 8 years of leadership under our former \nGovernor, Mitch Daniels. So back-to-back weekends had two special \nevents.\n  Inauguration ceremonies are a time for reflection on what has \nhappened in the past and a time for new vision on how we ought to go \nforward with the future. It is also a time for new opportunity. An \nopportunity for the kind of change necessary to address the problems \nand challenges we face.\n  As I participated in the inauguration events for Governor Pence in \nIndianapolis just two weekends ago, I couldn't help but think of the \nremarkable record of achievement and the bold reforms that our former \nGovernor, Mitch Daniels, delivered to the Hoosier State and the lessons \nthey may offer to Washington.\n  In 2005, Indiana faced a several-hundred-million-dollar deficit. This \npales by comparison to the deficit we face here; but, nevertheless, for \na State of our size it is a significant amount. Although it is \nconstitutionally mandated in Indiana, we had not balanced our budget \nfor 7 years. Governor Daniels and his team had a vision and the \npolitical courage to make much needed changes, and the people of \nIndiana supported and responded. While other States increased spending \nand raised taxes, Indiana reduced spending, cut taxes, and paid down \nour debts.\n  Governor Daniels, with the help of the legislature and with the \nsupport of the people of Indiana, slowed down the rate of spending. The \nState's expenditures have grown at less than one-quarter the rate of \nthe previous decade. We also reduced the size of State government.\n  Indiana has the fewest State employees per capita in the country. We \npaid down the previous debt by 43 percent, and we currently sit with a \nbudget surplus and a rebate program which will give money collected in \ntaxes back to the taxpayer because of our state's efficiency and \neffectiveness in terms of running our government. Indiana, as a result \nof this, has received its first AAA credit rating. This means when we \ndo need to borrow or sell bonds to do certain infrastructure or meet \nother needs, we can receive low interest rates because of our superb \nAAA rating. All this has transformed Indiana's balance sheet and made \nour State one of the most attractive places to live, raise a family, \nand do business in the Midwest, if not in the Nation.\n  The story of Indiana and how it got hold of its fiscal issues has \nbeen written up in national journals and newspapers and documentaries \nand others. It is a remarkable story. It is not unique because we see \nthese things happening in other States around the country led not only \nby Republican Governors but Democrat Governors. These are the kinds of \ndecisions that have to be made and are being made to restore state and \nlocal governments. And it has created a much brighter future for the \ncitizens of those States.\n  Governor Daniels has often said, ``You'd be amazed by how much \ngovernment you'll never miss.'' The results of his administration back \nthat up.\n  You can go around Indiana, as I have, and talk to people from big \ncities to small, rural to urban and everything in between and ask them \nhow we have moved from deficit to surplus in our state. You can ask if \nthey still believe our state performs the necessary functions of \ngovernment and you can ask Hoosiers what has been cut that you think \nshould have stayed.\n  Frankly, no one could come up with an answer that says: We have had \ndisastrous consequences from these decisions. The vast majority say \nthat things are working pretty well. In fact, I can get my license \nrenewed through a total revamp of our licensing system in just a few \nminutes over the Internet or just a few minutes at the DMV. Governor \nDaniels' measure for that was in and out in less than 7 minutes.\n  For those of us who have spent hours and hours committing half a day \nor more to getting our license renewed, this is a remarkable \nachievement. The use of technology, privatization, and the use of more \nefficient government demands that our civil servants do more with less \nand this has proven to be effective.\n  While the fiscal situation we faced in Indiana is not totally \nanalogous to what we face here, the principles are the same, and there \nstill are many similarities. As Washington seeks answers at the start \nof this new session of Congress on how we move forward and address our \nextremely serious debt situation and get our fiscal house back in order \nso that we too can retain a AAA rating and so we too can provide the \nopportunity for growth and opportunity not just for the middle class \nbut for all Americans in the future, maybe there are some lessons to be \nlearned from Indiana. The spend less, borrow less, and tax less Hoosier \nmodel has resulted in balanced budgets, job creation, and a AAA credit \nrating. In contrast, the spend more, borrow more, and tax more approach \nin Washington during these last several years has resulted in fewer \njobs, higher debt, and a threatened downgrade from credit agencies.\n  So as we reflect back on the last 4 years of this current \nadministration, it is clear to me we must take a different course in \nthe second term of this administration.\n  Whether lawmakers want to admit it, the crux of our problem is this: \nWashington has promised Americans far too much and committed well \nbeyond our means. Federal spending and borrowing cannot continue at \nthis current pace without dire consequences.\n  Whether one is reading or listening to a liberal, conservative or a \nnonpartisan economist or an analyst, there is a consensus that \nsustaining our current rate or continuing our rate of borrowing and \nspending simply is not feasible and the consequences will be dire if we \ndo not address it.\n  As we seek to address these issues, my suggestion for Washington is \nto take a look at the Hoosier model. It is tested, it is proven, and it \nis working.\n  We need to go big and bold. We need to have the political courage to \nlook beyond the short-term political consequences, as we perceive them, \nto the\n\n[[Page S191]]\n\nlong-term benefit from sound policies--which, interestingly enough, \ntranslate into good politics. Strengthening the economy and getting our \ncountry on a track to brighter and more prosperous times should be our \npriority.\n  We have proven in Indiana that good policy, no matter how politically \ndifficult it might seem at the time to achieve, does translate into \ngood politics. But much more important than the politics, good policy \ncan translate into strengthening our economy, improving the lives of \nAmericans, and providing opportunity for future generations.\n  It is time we learn that lesson in Washington that our State of \nIndiana and many States across the country, as well as other \ncommunities, are learning. It is time we exhibit the political courage \nto stand and do what I think just about everyone in this body \nunderstands; that is, to get a hold of runaway spending and borrowing \nthat is putting us in a very deep fiscal hole and will have \nsignificant, dire consequences not only on future generations but even \nour current generation.\n  The time is now. As I said from this spot yesterday, 2013 is the \ndecisive year. In 2014, we will be back into an election year, and that \ntired old belief that we cannot make these kinds of changes with the \nelection looming will surface again. If we don't act now, more people \nwill say that we need to wait until after the next election. It will \npush us into 2015. Many who have looked at our situation fiscally and \nanalyzed it from a nonpartisan, nonideological basis have said 2015 is \ntoo late.\n  This is the time when we need to summon our courage, summon our \npolitical will, and do what is right for the American people. We cannot \ncontinue to bump along at less than 2 percent growth. We cannot \ncontinue to keep more than 8 percent or nearly 8 percent of our people \nunemployed; and, obviously, that number is much higher when we count \nthose who are no longer looking for work who have given up. We cannot \ncontinue to keep America on the edge of uncertainty in terms of what \nour fiscal future will look like.\n  Let us summon that courage to go forward. Let us use examples from \nthose States, the support of those Governors and the support they have \nreceived from people across those States. Let us summon the courage to \ndo what we need to do.\n  I want to continue talking about how we need to address this with a \n``go big, go bold'' type of approach. Everyone says and concludes that \nif we can put that package together to address our long-term ills over \na period of time and bring us back to balance and stability, we will \nsee a revival of the economy of this country and we will see great hope \nfor the American people going forward.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Madam President, President Obama may have been vague \non details in his inaugural speech on Monday, but I will give him this, \nhe couldn't have been clearer about the tone and the direction he has \nin mind for the second term. Gone is the postpartisan rhetoric that \npropelled him onto the national stage and into the White House. In its \nplace is an unabashedly leftwing appeal for more bureaucratic control \nand centralized power here in Washington.\n  On Monday, we saw a President and a party that appeared to have \nshifted into reverse and jammed on the gas. For Democrats in the Obama \nage, the era of big government being over is officially over. And \nanybody who disagrees with their approach isn't just wrong, they are \nnot just standing in the way of progress, they are malevolent, they are \nthe bad guys, they are the ones who want to take food away from \nchildren, they want the old and the infirm to suffer, they want to \nchoose between caring for the people who built this country, as the \nPresident put it on Monday, and investing in those who will build our \nfuture.\n  I don't know if the President buys all this stuff; I don't know if he \nbelieves his own caricature--I certainly hope not--but one thing I do \nknow is that questioning the intentions of one's political opponents \nmakes it awfully hard to get anything done in a representative \ndemocracy. As the President himself said, without so much as a hint of \nirony, we cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute \nspectacle for politics or treat name calling as reasoned debate.\n  The President won the election. I congratulate him on his victory. It \nis his prerogative to lay out an agenda and to make an argument--\nagainst all evidence--for the efficacy of big government, more \nWashington spending, and centralization. It is even his prerogative to \nargue--mistakenly, in my view--that America's greatness somehow rests \nnot on its communities and voluntary associations, its churches and \ncharities, on civil society, but instead on the dictates of Washington. \nBut to suggest that those of us and our constituents who believe \notherwise don't want the best interest of our parents or our children \nor our country's future is, at best, needlessly provocative; at worst, \nit suggests a troubling inability to view those who don't happen to \nshare your opinions as beneath you.\n  To suggest, as one of the President's spokesmen did earlier this \nweek, that both the American political system and those who belong to \nthe party of Lincoln aren't worthy of this White House or its agenda \nisn't the way to get things done. It makes it impossible to tend to \nproblems we simply have to face up to and that we will only solve \ntogether. Frankly, it calls into question the President's own belief in \nthe wisdom and the efficacy of the constitutional system of checks and \nbalances that the Founders so wisely put in place.\n  The postinaugural period is usually a chance to pivot to governing \nafter a long campaign. It is an opportunity for Presidents to reach out \nto the minority and to forge compromises. But that is not what we are \nseeing this time around. Even before Monday we all noted the harsh \nchange in tone, the reboot of the campaign machine, and how, instead of \noffering an olive branch to those who disagree with him, the President \nhad already decided to transform his campaign operation into a weapon \nto bulldoze anyone who doesn't share his vision. Well, I would suggest \nthat one thing the American people don't want is a permanent campaign. \nThat is the last thing the American people are looking for--a permanent \ncampaign. They want us to work together on solutions to our problems. \nAnd deficits and debt are right at the top of the list.\n  I wish to suggest this morning the President rethink the adversarial \ntone he has adopted in recent weeks. Our problems are simply too urgent \nand too big for the President to give up on working with us. I appeal \nto him once again to work with us on the things we can achieve \ntogether, and let us start with the deficit and the debt. Because the \nonly way we will be able to tackle these problems is by doing it \ntogether.\n\n[[Page S192]]\n\nIf he refuses, if he insists on spending the next 4 years pushing a \npolarizing hard-left agenda instead, I assure him he will meet a \ndetermined opposition not only from Republicans in Washington but from \nthe very people he seems to believe are squarely on his side in the \npush to remake government in his image.\n  The irony in the President's attacks, of course, is that the kind of \nreforms Republicans are calling for are the only conceivable route to \nsaving the programs the President claims he wants to protect. Failing \nto reform the entitlement programs of the last century now--right now--\nis the best way to guarantee they no longer exist in their current \nform. I mean, one could practically hear the ring of the cash register \nwith every new promise the President made. At a time when we can all \nsee the failure of such policies by simply turning on the news, he \nseems blissfully--blissfully--unaware of the fact that from Athens to \nMadrid the sad, slow death of the left's big government dream is on \ndisplay for all to see. If we want a less prosperous, less dynamic, \nless mobile society, that is the way to go--just ``Europeanize'' \nAmerica.\n  The President's vision of an all-powerful government that rights \nevery wrong and heals every wound may warm the liberal heart, but it is \ncompletely divorced from experience and from reality. So today I wish \nto do my part to bring the President and his allies in Congress a \nlittle closer down to Earth. I know it may be hard for them to accept, \nbut the reality is this: We have a spending problem--not a taxing \nproblem, a spending problem.\n  Let's take a look at the chart to my right. The green represents \nhistoric and projected tax revenue. And we can see it goes right \nstraight across here out to 2040. The tax increases of 3 weeks ago were \ndelivered by operation of law. In other words, the law expired and all \nof the Bush tax cuts were over. The Congress, 2 hours after everybody's \ntaxes went up--in other words, after all the Bush tax cuts expired--\nrestored tax relief for 99 percent of the American people, and they did \nit on a permanent basis to guarantee we wouldn't have another cliff, as \nwe inevitably have. When a law sunsets, we have a cliff.\n  So the President was able to get some new revenue by operation of \nlaw, and that represents this dark blue line right across here. You can \nsee that is pretty steady out to 2040.\n  The President, of course, said that wasn't nearly enough. He said: We \nneed more taxes, and we will be back asking for more taxes later. So as \nnearly as we can tell, based on what he has said, the taxes he would \nlike to add to the ones he got by operation of law 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago is \nthis light blue line right across here.\n  If the President were given all the tax increases he says at the \nmoment he wants, that would provide this amount of revenue going out to \n2040. As you can see, that doesn't do anything to solve the problem \nbecause the red represents spending in the past and the spending \nescalation that will occur if we don't do anything to solve the \nspending problem.\n  Look at this line dramatically going up to 2040. So as you can see, \nthere is not enough revenue we can raise without completely shutting \ndown the economy to solve the problem. In fact, it produces a rather \nstatic and totally insignificant amount of revenue in order to deal \nwith the massive spending problem.\n  So this constant demand for more and more tax increases on, I guess, \nwhom people assume is the more successful guy down the street may be a \ngreat campaign tactic, but it doesn't do anything to solve the problem. \nEven if the President were able to get every bit of taxes he wants, we \nstill have an enormous gap in spending if we don't deal with the real \nproblem, which is spending. We have a spending addiction. I didn't make \nthis up. This is a fact. This is reality.\n  So the tax issue is over. Congress has restored permanent tax relief \nfor 99 percent of the American people. Even if the President were to \nget--and he will not--any more tax revenue, it is perfectly obvious \nthat doesn't do anything to solve the problem.\n  So the challenge for us--and looking at the chart we can see--is \nrevenue today is just about where it has been for the past 30 years or \nso. The President spent nearly his entire first term arguing that we \nneeded to tax the so-called rich to solve our fiscal woes. He harangued \nCongress about it. He argued for it in rallies and debates. He \nthreatened to push us over the cliff if he didn't get his way.\n  In the end, by operation of law he got part of what he asked for. And \nthe reason he got it, as I said earlier, is because the tax relief we \npassed in 2001 and 2003 carried an expiration date. President Obama got \nsome of the tax increases he wanted because the law expired. Then \nCongress, led by Republicans, voted to make Bush-era tax rates \npermanent for 99 percent of all Americans. Now, permanency is \nimportant. It has been kind of lost on the general public, but the \nimportance is we don't have another cliff, another expiration date \nwhere all of a sudden everything changes.\n  Given how much time he devoted to that one topic, one would think his \ntax hike would have closed the deficit, eliminated the entire national \ndebt, and left us with extra cash to spare. But do you see that tiny \nlittle blue line I pointed to right here? That is how much additional \nrevenue he got. This blue area is the revenue he says he wants. He will \nnot get it; but if he did, it is pretty apparent it has nothing \nwhatsoever to do with solving the spending addiction.\n  So if this revenue doesn't come anywhere close to solving the \nproblem, the real challenge, obviously, is how we are going to control \nall of this red. What do we do about this? Well, we are clearly \nspending way more than we take in. The real uptick, interestingly \nenough, occurs about the time the President took office. It has been \nhard enough to find ways to close the President's trillion-dollar \ndeficits. But as I just pointed out, they are nothing next to what is \ngoing to hit us when tens of millions of baby boomers reach retirement \nage--nothing compared to what is heading our way.\n  I pointed out the massive slope. That is what is headed our way. \nNothing short of a bipartisan effort is going to fix this problem, and \nthere is only one way we can do it. We can't tax our way out of this \nproblem. The revenue question is behind us. The law we voted for, as I \nsaid, made current tax rates permanent. I am pretty confident not a \nsingle Republican in the House or Senate will vote to raise any more \ntaxes. But even if we were to do that, all the taxes the President \nasked for would only put us here in 2040. And look at what would be \nspent.\n  So the reality the President needs to face--and quickly--is that \nthere is no realistic way to raise taxes high enough to even begin to \naddress this problem. That is why Republicans are saying we need to \nstart controlling spending, and we need to do it now. That is why if \nthe President wants to do something good right now, he should put us \nout of the liberal wish list and put us out of the character attacks \nand join us in this great task. It is the transcendent issue of our \ntime.\n  If we don't fix this problem, we don't leave behind for our children \nand grandchildren the kind of America our parents left behind for us. \nThere is no bigger issue, even though it got scant mention in the State \nof the Union.\n  Now, I have no animus toward the President. I just want to see him do \nsomething about the problem because the longer we wait, the worse the \nproblem becomes. The more we delay the inevitable, the less time \nyounger Americans will have to plan for the reforms we make today. That \nis simply not right.\n  So the President has a choice. He can paint himself as a warrior of \nthe left and charge into battle with failed ideas we have already tried \nbefore; he can demean and blame the opposition for his own failure to \nlead; he can indulge his supporters in a bitter, never-ending campaign \nthat will only divide our country further; or he could take the \nresponsible road. He can help his own base come to terms with the \nmathematical reality.\n  Some people over there are living in a fantasy world--a world that \ndoesn't exist. He could reach out to leaders in both parties--and all \nof the members in both parties--and negotiate in good faith. We would \nbe happy to give him credit. That is fine by me. If boosting his legacy \nis what it takes and it helps the country, that is all the better.\n  If my constituents believe they are working to help make their future \na\n\n[[Page S193]]\n\nlittle better and a little brighter, great. But we can't waste any more \ntime denying the reality that is staring each of us in the face. There \nis only one way to solve this problem, and that is to do something \nabout this spending addiction that is going to sink this country and \nturn us into Greece.\n  Senate Republicans are ready to help the President solve this \nproblem. I hope we have an opportunity to do so.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wonder if I might pose a question \nto the Republican leader, if he would retake the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would be happy to respond.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I want to congratulate the Republican leader for his \nremarks.\n  Here is my question. We have arrived at a time when we have a newly \nelected President who has had a fine inaugural day. He has an agenda \nthat he wants to follow which he announced in his inaugural address. It \nis not an agenda that most of us on this side agree with, but he has an \nagenda that he wants to follow in his second term, all of which would \nensure--in his eyes--his legacy as a President.\n  But isn't there one thing that in order to get to that agenda--or any \nother thing--he and we have to do, and that is to address the debt? \nIsn't the very best time--isn't the very best time to do something \ndifficult, something nobody wants to talk about, something that is \nhard--the best time to do that is at a time when we have a divided \ngovernment, a Democratic President, a Republican House, and 30 or 40 or \n50 of us Senators on both sides of the aisle who have been saying for 2 \nyears that we are ready to fix the debt?\n  Isn't this an opportunity now? Not just because it is a divided \ngovernment, but because the House of Representatives today may very \nwell create a 2-month or 3-month window during which we can address all \nof these issues if we had Presidential leadership?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Tennessee, it is \ncounterintuitive. But one could argue that a divided government--which \nwe have had more often than not since World War II--has produced four \nof the most significant accomplishments for our country in modern \ntimes.\n  In the Reagan administration, President Reagan and Tip O'Neill, the \nDemocratic Speaker of the House, agreed to raise the age for Social \nSecurity to save Social Security for another generation. Reagan and Tip \nO'Neill did the last comprehensive tax reform.\n  Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress did welfare reform, arguably \nthe most important piece of social legislation in recent times. And \nBill Clinton and a Republican Congress actually balanced the budgets in \nthe late 1990s.\n  My friend from Tennessee is correct. Divided government actually is \nthe perfect time--some would argue even the only time--we can do tough \nthings, hard-to-explain things that need to be done to save the \ncountry. So I hate to miss the opportunity presented by a divided \ngovernment to tackle the transcendent issue of our times.\n  The President talked about a lot of things, and that is all \ninteresting, but it had nothing to do with fixing the country. Until we \nfix this problem, we will not have the kind of country for our children \nand our grandchildren that our parents left behind for us.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wonder if I might pose one more \nquestion to the Republican leader after making a short statement.\n  I came to this body as a young lawyer-legislative aide to Senator \nHoward Baker a long time ago, in 1967. I remember very well Senator \nBaker's story about how the civil rights bill of 1968 was passed. I \nhave discussed this with the Republican leader before. He knows that \nera as well or better than I do.\n  But there was a time when Senator Baker said he was in Everett \nDirksen's office--he is the man who had the job that Senator McConnell \nnow has. He was the Republican leader then. He said he heard the \ntelephone ring. He heard only one end of the conversation, but Senator \nDirksen was saying: No, Mr. President, I cannot come down and have a \ndrink with you tonight. I did that last night, and Luella is very \nunhappy with me. And that was the conversation.\n  About 30 minutes later there was a rustle out in the outer office of \nthe Republican leader's office--the very office that Senator McConnell \nnow holds. Two beagles, followed by the President of the United States, \ncame in. Lyndon Johnson, the President, said to the Republican leader: \nEverett, if you won't have a drink with me, I am down here to have one \nwith you. And they disappeared in the back room for 45 minutes.\n  The point of all that is not their socializing. The point was it was \nin that very office, the Republican leader's office, that in 1968, the \nnext year, the civil rights bill was written and enacted. Lyndon \nJohnson got the credit for that in history but Everett Dirksen made it \npossible, and there were at that time many more Democrats in the Senate \nthan Republicans.\n  What I want to say to Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, the \nquestion I want to ask him, is this. He has seen the U.S. Senate and \nPresidency for the last number of years. He has seen many relationships \nbetween the President and leaders of the opposite party. He knows how \nthis place works. My sense of the Republican leader and of the large \nmajority of us is that we wish to see a result. We wish to see a result \non this very tough issue of saving Social Security, saving Medicare, \nsaving Medicaid, saving these programs on which seniors depend. I \nwonder if the Republican leader would agree with me that despite the \nfact that we engage every day in political matters, that we have big \ndifferences of opinion, that on this issue, without Presidential \nleadership, we cannot get a result and that there are a lot of us on \nboth sides of the aisle who are ready to work with the President to fix \nthe debt?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Tennessee--in many ways it is \na statement of the obvious but a lot of people forget it--there is only \n1 person in America out of 307 million Americans who can sign something \ninto law and only 1 person in America who can deliver the members of \nhis party to support an agreement that he makes. The only way to get an \noutcome on the biggest issue of our time is with Presidential \nleadership. So it was disappointing to see scant reference in the State \nof the Union. Of course that is just one speech and I have not given up \nhoping that this President can make solving the transcendent issue of \nour time one of his premier accomplishments.\n  The point I think the Senator from Tennessee and I are making this \nmorning is there are potential partners on this side of the aisle to \nmake this happen. I hope we will not lose this opportunity once again \nto deal with the biggest issue in the country.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for extending his \ntime on the floor. On my own I wish to continue that line of thinking a \nlittle bit.\n  It is traditional that when we have a new President, a newly \ninaugurated President, that he has a pretty good opportunity to get \nwhat he asks; that it is a time of maximum leverage, it is a time to do \nimportant things, it is a time to do difficult things, it is a time to \ndo things that otherwise might not get done.\n  Presidents are defined by their skills--their communication skills, \ntheir electoral ability--but they are also defined by their capacity \nover a period of years to identify the hard issues that are important \nto our country and cause people, as the President said in his address \nday before yesterday, to work together to solve those problems. Now the \nproblem is whether you want to raise taxes on the guy down the street \nwith the biggest house. That is not so hard to do. The problem is to \nspend money that you do not have--because you can do it; that is not so \nhard to do. If the problem is to address a disaster to help people who \nare in desperate shape, there might be some debate about whether it is \nreally a disaster or not but it is not hard to do because in the end it \nis going to happen. What Presidents are remembered for is dealing with \nimportant, difficult crises.\n  President Clinton is remembered for a number of things but one of the \nthings he did was challenge the conventional thinking in his own party \nto\n\n[[Page S194]]\n\ndeal with welfare reform. It would not have happened if he had not done \nit. It would not have happened if he had not done it because a \nRepublican could not have made the argument. A President's job, \naccording to George Reedy, the former press secretary to Lyndon \nJohnson, is three things: One is to see an urgent need, two is to \ndevelop a strategy to meet the need, and the third is to persuade at \nleast half the people he is right.\n  President Nixon in the early 1960s went to China. That seems like \nancient history but that was straight against the core of the \nRepublican Party at that time. That was something that was \ninconceivable for a Republican President to do, given the history of \nmainland China and Taiwan, as they were both called.\n  There have been many times in our history when Presidents have had to \ndo the hard work. President George H.W. Bush made a budget agreement \nwhich may have caused him to lose the election in 1992 because it \nangered a number of Republicans. But it also helped balance the budget \nand gave us a period of time in the 1990s when that budget agreement \nplus a good economy gave us an actual surplus of funding.\n  I sense that there is at the White House a feeling, two things I wish \nto disabuse the White House of. The first is that the budget problem is \nnot a real problem. I cannot believe people at the White House think \nthat. Everybody knows it is. Senator McConnell gave a very good \nexplanation of what was going on there. But let me say it this way: In \n2025, according to the Congressional Budget Office, every dollar of \ntaxes we collect will go to pay for Medicare, Medicaid, Social \nSecurity, and interest on the debt, and there is nothing left for \nnational defense, National Laboratories, Pell grants for education, \nhighways, or the investments that we need to make in research to grow \nthis country. It all goes for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and \nthe interest on debt, every single penny we collect. And that is only \n12 years away. That is not me talking. That is the Congressional Budget \nOffice saying that. The Medicare trustees have said that in 2024 the \nMedicare Program will not have enough money to pay all of its bills. \nWhose bills? Bills of seniors, bills of Tennesseans, many of whom are \nliterally counting the days until they are old enough to be eligible \nfor Medicare so they can pay their medical bills. It would be a tragedy \nif that day arrived and there were not enough money to pay the bills. \nBut the Medicare trustees, who by law are supposed to tell us these \nthings, say that day will come in 2024. It is just 11 years away and \nthat is the day for people already on Medicare and people who are going \nto be on Medicare.\n  Medicaid, which is a program for lower income Americans, is an \nimportant program. As Governor, I dealt with it in my State. But when I \nwas Governor, it was 8 percent of the State budget. Today it is 26 \npercent of the State budget. It is soaking up almost every dollar that \nwould go to higher education. As a result, students around the country \nare wondering: Why are my tuition fees going up? It is because of \nWashington's Medicaid Program requiring States to make decisions that \nsoak up money that otherwise would be used to fund education.\n  In our State of Tennessee, 30 years ago the State paid 70 percent of \nthe cost of going to the University of Tennessee. Today it pays 30. And \nMedicaid is the chief culprit.\n  Everyone knows this. The President's own debt commission has told him \nthis and suggested a way to deal with it. Forty or fifty of us on both \nsides of the aisle have been working together, meeting together, having \ndinner together, writing bills together, trying to come up with plans \nto do it. Senator Corker, my colleague from Tennessee, has developed a \nbill on which I am his prime cosponsor which says we have found a way \nto strengthen Medicare and other entitlements by reducing the growth in \nspending. We understand this.\n  We passed a Budget Control Act a couple of years ago. People said \nthey didn't like it. It was not so bad because it took 38 percent of \nthe budget, which is all of our discretionary spending--including \nnational defense, national parks, national labs--and said it will go up \nat about the rate of inflation. This is before we get to the so-called \nsequester. But what about the rest of the budget? That is the automatic \nstuff we do not even vote on: Medicare, entitlements, all this? It is \ngoing up at about three to four times the rate of inflation. It is \ngoing to bankrupt these programs. Seniors will not be able to have \ntheir medical bills paid and the country will be bankrupt. That is no \noverstatement. The former Comptroller of the Currency says that. \nPresident Clinton says this is an urgent problem. The former Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff says the national debt is the single \nbiggest threat to our national security. Why are we not dealing with \nit? I think we are not dealing with it, A, because it is hard to do; B, \nbecause on both sides of the aisle we have not been effective in \ndealing with it before.\n  I remember when we had an all-Republican cast of characters here in \ntown--President Bush, a Republican majority--we tried to reduce the \ngrowth of Medicare and we could not get the votes to do that.\n  This is not easy to do, but Robert Merry, who wrote a book about \nPresident Polk, had lunch with some of us yesterday, made this \nstatement: ``In America's history every crisis has been solved by \nPresidential leadership or not at all.''\n  Whether it was Lincoln in the Civil War or Reagan and Tip O'Neill or \nNixon to China or Clinton on welfare reform--we can all identify the \ncrises. But it takes Presidential leadership to do it. It takes that to \ndo it.\n  I was a Governor, which is much smaller potatoes. If I sat around \nwaiting for the State legislature, with all respect, to come up with a \nroad program we would still be driving on dirt roads. They were waiting \nfor the Governor to do it. That is how our system works.\n  I wonder if the President thinks that the debt is not a problem? I \ncannot imagine anybody at the White House thinks that. This is a \nproblem. If the President does not address it during his two terms he \nwill be remembered by history as failing to do that. His legacy may be \na failure to address financial matters that put this country on a road \nto bankruptcy. Or, if he were to do it, if he were to provide the \nleadership, he would be--as the Australian Foreign Minister has said, \n``America is one budget agreement away from reasserting its global \npreeminence.'' Why wouldn't President Obama want to be known as the \nPresident who caused America to reassert its global preeminence by \ndealing with a budget agreement during the first 3 months of his term \nand then he can get on with his agenda, about which we can argue? That \nleaves me with only one thought: That the President thinks we don't \nwant to do it. We do want to do it and it is a misunderstanding if he \nthinks that.\n  I know the Republican leader would not mind me saying he is a wily, \nclever tactician who knows the Senate as well as anyone here. But if \nyou look carefully, when we got down to the last few days of the year \nand needed an agreement on taxes, the Republican leader was in the \nmiddle of the agreement. When we needed an agreement to try to avoid \ndefault on the debt, the Republican leader was the one who was in the \nmiddle of doing that.\n  I think if the White House thinks that the Republican leader or we on \nthe Republican side do not want to fix the debt, they are badly \nmisunderstanding where we are and who we are. I do not know how we can \nsay it more clearly. We have written bills that do it. We have held \ndinners to talk about it. We have made public statements with \nDemocrats, 30 or 40 of us at a time, saying we support Simpson-Bowles, \nwe support Domenici-Rivlin, or we support this or we support that. What \nis missing? Two words: Presidential leadership. This is not a partisan \ncomment. It just does not work unless the President lays out his plan.\n  Some say the President does not want to lay out his plan. He has to \nlay out his plan. He is the President. We are just legislators. Senator \nCorker and I have put out our plan. Who pays attention to that? Madam \nPresident, $1 trillion in reductions and a $1 trillion increase in the \ndebt ceiling--it is out there. That is not going to work. However, if \nPresident Obama, with his skills, calls together Simpson and Bowles or \nhis advisers and says: Here is\n\n[[Page S195]]\n\nmy plan to save Medicare, here is my plan to save Medicaid, here is my \nplan to fix the debt, and I want bipartisan support to do that, he will \nget it. At first, because it is a difficult issue, everybody will say: \nOh, no, we can't do it that way. We need to sit down, talk, and come up \nwith a result. I think the Republican leader has shown he is prepared \nand willing to do that. He has said it and done it on other issues. I \ndon't know what else the rest of us can do to show that.\n\n  What I am trying to respectfully say today, as much as anything, to \nthe President of the United States is congratulations on your \ninauguration. I was there. I was proud to participate in it and have \nthe opportunity to speak for a minute and a half about why we celebrate \nfor the 57th time the inauguration of an American President. We \ncelebrate it because our country is distinguished from most other \ncountries in the world by the peaceful transition or reaffirmation of \nthe largest amount of power in the world. We have our political \ncontests, and then we have the restraint to respect the results.\n  After winning the election, it is important, first, to get the fiscal \nhouse in order. The time to do it is while we have a divided \ngovernment. The time to do it is while the President is at the peak of \nhis popularity. The time to do it is while the House of \nRepresentatives--the Republican House--has created a window of 2 or 3 \nmonths to deal with all the fiscal issues. The time to do it is after 2 \nyears of discussion with Republicans and Democrats in a bipartisan way \nabout the need to fix the debt and the importance of it for the \ncountry.\n  My hope is that as the President and his advisers look at the Senate, \nthey see a willingness to solve the problem of fixing the debt in a \nbipartisan way. I get the feeling they don't believe that about us. I \ndon't know what else we can do to cause them to believe that. There is \nnot the same kind of comfortable, back-and-forth relationship there \nshould be. I have heard some people say: Well, the Johnson-Dirksen days \nare ancient history. That was a long time ago. However, human nature \ndoesn't change. Human nature doesn't change in 50 years, 100 years, or \n500 years.\n  There is plenty of good will across the aisle and on this side of the \naisle, at the beginning of this term, to work with a newly inaugurated \nPresident and say: Mr. President, we are ready to fix the debt. Provide \nus the leadership. No great crisis is ever solved without Presidential \nleadership in the United States. You are the President; you are the \nonly one who can lay out the plan. We will then consider it, amend it, \nargue about it, change it, and pass it. After that, we can get onto the \nPresident's agenda, about which we will have a difference of opinion, \nbut he will go down in history as the man who was willing to do \nsomething hard within his own party, which was to fix the debt and save \nthe programs seniors depend upon to pay their medical bills.\n  I hope I can say that in the spirit of someone who participated in \nthe inauguration and admires the President's considerable abilities. I \nhope he and his advisers stop, take a look, and say: Maybe we were \nwrong. Maybe this is the time to do it. Maybe we are the only ones who \ncan do it, so let's make a proposal and get started.\n  I thank the President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S195-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S195-S197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I was pleased to hear a few days ago \nthat Senator Schumer said we would have a budget in the Senate. It has \nbeen now, I think, about 1,370 days, give or take, since we have had a \nbudget in the Senate, even though plain statutory law requires the \nCongress to have a budget. Now Senator Murray has followed up today, I \nbelieve, with a quote saying: ``. . . the Senate will once again return \nto regular order and move a budget resolution through the Budget \nCommittee and to the Senate floor.''\n  So the Budget Committee has not been meeting. It has not been doing \nits duty. As the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, I have \nbeen aghast at the process and have talked about it for now for over \n1,000 days. So this will be a good step.\n  My colleagues would like to suggest somehow that they decided to do \nthis out of the goodness of their hearts because it is the right thing \nto do. But I think the American people have had a belly full of this.\n  The U.S. House of Representatives has repeatedly passed budgets, but \nthe Senate has refused to even bring one up in committee or on the \nfloor for over 2 years now. They have said they are raising the debt \nlimit for about 3 months, but they have declared that the Senate does \nnot get paid until we have a budget. Right now there is no punishment \nfor not passing a budget. I was a Federal prosecutor for over 15 years \nand know how to read a code. It has no penalty for failing to pass a \nbudget. It says the Senate should bring up a budget. It should complete \nthe budget process in committee by April 1 and then the full Senate \nshould take it up and it should be completed by April 15. The Senate is \ngiven priority: 50 hours of debate, virtually unlimited amendments--an \nopportunity to debate the financial condition of America.\n  That is why it has not happened. Senator Reid, the Democratic leader \nfor the last several years, has said it would be foolish to have a \nbudget. What he meant was that it would be foolish politically. Because \nwhen you bring up a budget, this is a tough thing. The House did that.\n  Paul Ryan offered a historic budget that would change the debt course \nof America and put us on a sound path. They had to make some tough \nchoices. So they were, of course, attacked in the election--Oh, these \nare horrible people; they want to throw old people off the cliff and \nthat kind of thing and it was irresponsible--while during this entire \nprocess, the Senate was in direct violation of Federal law that \nrequired us to bring up a budget. We did not bring it up because it \nwould be foolish, foolish politically, because we have to take tough \nvotes. We have to stand and be counted. Numbers have to be analyzed: \nHow much are you truly going to raise taxes? Oh, well, is that going to \nchange the debt course?\n  Is this latest $600 billion tax increase going to change the debt \ncourse of America? No; it is not. Our deficit last year was about \n$1,080 billion. How much would this tax increase, this $600 billion, \nhave changed that? That is $60 billion a year. Instead of $1,080 \nbillion or so in deficit, our deficit would have been $1,020 billion. \nIs that going to fix our problem? No, it will not.\n  These are difficult problems. These are very difficult problems, and \nit is not going to be easy. But it was easy to attack the House while \nnot producing a budget. It is a pretty flabbergasting thing to me. So I \nam glad we are now going to have this process. It will not be easy for \nRepublicans. It will not be easy for Democrats. But what are we paid to \ndo? What responsibility do we have as the Congress--that has the power \nof the purse--if not discussing the great issues of our time?\n  We are on an unsustainable debt path. Last year there was another \ntrillion-dollar deficit, and they are projecting we will have a \ntrillion-dollar deficit this year. That is 5 consecutive years of \ntrillion-dollar deficits. I know President Bush was criticized, and \ncorrectly sometimes, for spending too much. The highest deficit he ever \nhad in 8 years was $470 billion. The year before he left it was $160 \nbillion. President Obama has averaged well over $1,000 billion a year \nin an annual deficit ever since.\n  This is not sustainable, as every expert has told us time and time \nagain. So I am worried about it. Maybe we can move out of these secret \nmeetings where the Senate just sits around and we wait for the people \nto appear, write us a bill at midnight on December 31--actually 1 a.m. \non January 1--that is supposed to handle it and nobody has even read \nit.\n  That is what we have been doing for the last 4 years. It has worked \nout good politically because it has kept an honest discussion of the \ndangerous path we are on from being part of the public debate. We have \nto have it part of the\n\n[[Page S196]]\n\npublic debate. I am not saying this budget, if it moves through the \nSenate, is going to solve our problems and that it will be adopted. I \nam not saying that. But I do believe the American people will \nunderstand better the challenges we face and Senators will understand \nbetter the challenges we face, how deep they are, how systemic they \nare.\n\n  In 2011, after Republicans won a victory in the midterm elections, \nthere was hope we would have a new budget from the President, that he \nwould reach out to the House that had gotten a Republican majority for \na change--they took back the majority, and there were more Republicans \nin the Senate--and that the President was going to produce a budget \nthat would put us on the right path and maybe a historic path that \nwould help make Social Security and Medicare sustainable, preserve \nthose programs so people can go to bed at night and feel confident \nthese programs not going to go bankrupt and there are not going to be \ndramatic cuts. We can do that. It would take some belt-tightening, but \nwe could do that. Yet the administration refused: You are just \npartisan, Sessions.\n  I am saying, without fear of contradiction by anybody who knows what \nhas happened, that this administration basically has not wanted to talk \nabout those deep spending issues that amount to more than half the \nmoney we spend.\n  That was a challenge. Maybe that logjam has broken and this budget \nprocess will give us an opportunity to move forward.\n  I do not like to be critical of nominees or anyone. I try to be as \ncourteous and respectful as we can to people whom we deal with on a \nregular basis in the Congress. But I have to share with my colleagues a \ndeep feeling that we have a serious credibility problem with \ncredibility on debt and financing. We have to end that credibility \nproblem. We have to be honest and deal with real numbers.\n  In January of 2011, Mr. Jack Lew, the then-Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, with a substantial staff--one of their primary \nduties is to produce a budget every year--submitted the President's \nBudget to Congress. The President always submits a budget--it has been \nlate, but they have always sent them over. The Senate has not moved \nbudgets like it is required to, but every President has always sent \nover a budget. There was great hope that the budget would be the kind \nof breakthrough--with a Republican House and a Democratic President and \na Democratic Senate--that somehow this would be an opportunity for \nhistoric agreement to put America on a sound path and get us off these \ntrillion-dollar deficits, put us on a path to a balanced budget and do \nthe kind of things that are necessary for the welfare of our country.\n  Mr. Lew produced the budget, and he went on television immediately \nand talked about it. On Wednesday of that week, he was going to be \nbefore the Budget Committee, but this is what he said in his CNN Sunday \nmorning interview about his budget. I would ask you to listen to these \nwords, colleagues and friends, anybody who is watching, and see what \nthey mean to you. He said:\n\n       Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the \n     point where we can look the American people in the eye and \n     say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spending \n     money that we have each year--\n\n  Money that we have each year--\n\n     and then we can work on bringing down our national debt.\n\n  That was on CNN.\n  So he appeared before the Budget Committee and I asked him if that \nwas an accurate statement; did he stand by that. He said: Yes, sir, and \nhe never wavered from that.\n  I will just say that as part of the budget process we get a stack of \ndocuments--this much--from Mr. Lew's office. The Office of Management \nand Budget submits them--supporting documents--as part of their \nprocess. They are easily ascertainable. The numbers are not in dispute.\n  The lowest single deficit over 10 years that Mr. Lew projected was \nmore than $600 billion. In other words, there was never a balanced \nbudget, never paying down the debt, never a single year we were not \nborrowing at least $600 billion.\n  None of what he said is accurate. It is breathtaking. I called it the \ngreatest financial misrepresentation in history. It would have added \n$13 trillion to the debt of the United States over 10 years, by his own \nestimate, not stuff I made up. Yet he said we are not going to be \nadding to the debt anymore.\n  So I thought, if a businessman reported to potential stock \npurchasers, our company is on the right track, we are not adding to our \ndebt anymore--we are going to look the American people in the eye and \nsay we're not adding to the debt anymore, we are spending only money we \nhave--you are borrowing--the least amount of money you have borrowed in \na single year is $600 billion, larger than President Bush ever had in 8 \nyears as President.\n  When I asked him about it, he insisted that it was true. So we have \ngot a problem here, and that is why I am not going to support Mr. Lew \nfor the Secretary of the Treasury. I am not going to vote for him. I \nbelieve he knew exactly what he was saying. He produced a budget that \nwas panned by virtually every editorial board in America. They hammered \nit as failing to meet the challenge of our time, and he knew it was \nthat way. He is not a person who doesn't understand these issues. He \nknew what it was all about. But they decided they would go out and spin \nit this way. They would say it did what the American people wanted.\n  I hate to be this harsh, but there is only one conclusion. They \ndecided to produce a budget that did not change the debt course of \nAmerica and left us on an unsustainable path. Even their own numbers \nshow that, but they would tell the American people this, say it was \nfixed, and maybe lull them into a false sense of confidence.\n  Then they attacked Paul Ryan of the Republican House for producing a \nrealistic budget. It wasn't a dramatic budget, it didn't even balance \nin 10 years, but it changed us and put us on a sound path. They would \nattack him as not caring about people, and for 2 years that is what has \nhappened.\n  Once we bring a budget to the floor of this Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats are going to find out this is a very difficult situation we \nare in. The challenge is going to be very difficult, and we are going \nto have a hard time dealing with it.\n  Mr. Lew didn't just make that comment to CNN, in case you think I am \nexaggerating here. He also said this in an NPR, National Public Radio, \ninterview on February 15, 2011, the day, I believe, of a Budget \nCommittee hearing:\n\n       If we're able to reduce the deficit to the point where we \n     can pay for our spending and invest in the future, that is an \n     enormous accomplishment. This budget has specific proposals \n     that would do that.\n\n  He looked the American people in the eye, or, I guess, talked to \ntheir ears on NPR, and said his ``budget has specific proposals'' that \nwould put us in a position to pay for our spending and invest in the \nfuture and reduce our deficit.\n  He went on to say on February 15, 2011, at the Budget Committee \nhearing--and I think this was my question, Was this an accurate \nstatement that you made, Mr. OMB Director?\n  He said:\n\n       It's an accurate statement that our current spending will \n     not be increasing the debt. We've stopped spending money that \n     we don't have.\n\n  I mean, I almost can't read those words without the hair standing up \non the back of my neck. The Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget appeared before the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, and he said, \n``it's an accurate statement,'' this baloney, ``it's an accurate \nstatement that our current spending will not be increasing the debt . . \n. We've stopped spending money that we don't have.''\n  Nothing could be further from the truth--the lowest single deficit \nwas $600 billion.\n  What about on a different CNN interview on February 14, 2011:\n\n       It [the budget] takes real actions now so that between now \n     and 5 years from now we can get our deficit under control so \n     that we can stabilize things so that we're not adding to the \n     debt anymore.\n\n  He promised, and looked the American people in the eye and said, in 5 \nyears, we are not going to be adding to the debt anymore. He knew \nexactly what he was saying. He knew exactly what he wanted the American \npeople to hear. There is no ambiguity about it, and it was utterly \nfalse.\n  February 13, 2011, on ABC, he said:\n\n       This budget has a lot of pain, [but] it does the job, it \n     cuts the deficit in half by the end\n\n[[Page S197]]\n\n     of the President's first term . . . It's going to take us a \n     lot of hard work just to take us to the point where we're not \n     adding to the debt.\n\n  There is not one year that they are not adding to the debt.\n  In the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth years of the budget that Jack \nLew presented, when you look at his real numbers, the deficit was going \nup each year. So it was not a fix to our debt problem.\n  Then he says this on the White House blog, February 13, 2011:\n\n       Like every family, we have to tighten our belts and live \n     within our means while we're investing in the things that we \n     need to have a strong and secure future . . . We know that \n     you have to stabilize where we're going before you can move \n     on and solve the rest of the problem. This budget does that.\n\n  So it is going to stabilize us and move us forward.\n  Well, as I say, that was not well received. The New York Times wrote \nthis on February 5, 2011. That was his op-ed. I won't go into the \neditorials, but a whole list of those were critical of Mr. Lew.\n  I would just say this, we are in a difficult financial position. We \nneed honesty, we need a budget that is truthful, we need the regular \norder so the Budget Committee does its work, and then it comes to the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate--this will be first time in over a thousand \ndays--it guarantees 50 hours of debate, it can't be filibustered, it \ncan be passed with a simple majority, we will know what is in it, and \npeople can offer amendments. That is what should have been happening \nfor a long time that has not been happening. That is what the law \nrequires, and that should be completed by April 15 of this year.\n  As we go forward, I am confident that we will be better served by \npublic discussion of our debt, not secret meetings. I have been \ncritical of them. I had hoped that some of them would ripen into some \ngood solutions, but all we have had is temporary ``kick the can down \nthe road'' maneuvers, and nothing substantial has been done to change \nthe debt course of America.\n  By the way, when Mr. Erskine Bowles, whom President Obama appointed \nto head his fiscal commission, saw this budget in 2011, he said it goes \nnowhere near where they will have to go to resolve our fiscal \nnightmare. Everybody knew this budget wouldn't do the job, and that is \nwhy it was never brought through the process, and that is why it wasn't \nbrought to the floor for a full budget analysis in committee and in \ndebate on the floor.\n  So as we go forward, I will be meeting with our new chairman, Senator \nMurray. She is a great, tough advocate for her values, but she is a \ngood person to work with. I have told her we will try to work with her, \nbut we are going to talk about the great issues of our time, the \ndifficulties we face, and see if we can't make this system work better \nand try to put this country on a sound financial footing.\n  We can do it. We can get this country on a sound path. It is not \nimpossible, but anybody who thinks it will be easy is wrong. This is \ngoing to take some hard work. As we do that in a bipartisan, open way \nin the committee, on the floor of the Senate, the American people will \nbe able to digest the difficulty of some of our challenges, and so will \nour Members in Congress. In the end, that, I think, leaves us in the \nbest position to reach the kind of agreement, compromise, solution, \nthat can put us on the right path, because everybody is going to have \nto swallow a little bit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I couldn't help but listen to the words \nof my friend from Alabama regarding the debt and deficit, and then to \nbe reminded that we did balance the budget not too long ago. In fact, \nin 1993, we passed a tax bill here in the Senate and in the House--it \nwas signed into law by President Clinton--which set us on a course to \nreduce the deficit. In fact, by the years 1999 and 2000, we balanced \nthe budget. We had a surplus. Can you imagine that? We had a surplus \nfor 3 years in a row. The Congressional Budget Office and OMB said that \nif we had continued on that pathway, we would have fully paid off the \nnational debt by 2010.\n  When I hear my friends on the Republican side talk about reducing the \ndeficit and the debt, we did that. When the Democrats were in charge of \nthe Senate and the House and we had the Presidency, I would also point \nout that not one Republican on that side of the aisle voted for that \nbill in 1993. I can remember standing here and debating with my friend \nfrom Texas at that time on this bill, and there were all kinds of dire \nwarnings that if this bill passed, we were going to have depressions \nand recessions; the business community would stop, and it would be the \nworst thing that ever happened to this country if we passed the Clinton \ntax proposal. Well, we passed it, but without one Republican vote.\n  And what happened? We had the largest spurt of economic growth this \ncountry had seen almost since the 1950s and 1960s. This was to the \npoint to where, as I said, by the end of the 1990s we had a balanced \nbudget and we had a surplus.\n  Then President Bush comes into office, and we had surpluses, enough \nto retire the entire national debt by the year 2010. So what did \nPresident Bush say? Well, now we are going to give tax cuts. They \npushed through this big tax cut bill for which this Senator did not \nvote.\n  That tax cut bill gave a lot away to corporations and to the wealthy \nof this country, so that they didn't have to pay their fair share. \nAlso, there were two wars we didn't pay for, plus a recession, and now \nwe are in this huge deficit.\n  We know how to get ourselves out of this fix. We did it in 1993. It \nwas by having the people in this country pay their fair share of taxes, \nto make sure that corporations, to make sure that those who enjoy the \nbenefits of living in this free and productive society, pay their fair \nshare. This is for all of us to raise the revenues necessary to meet \nour obligations in education, health, infrastructure building, the \nsecurity of our Nation, and also to raise enough revenues so we can \nreduce the deficit.\n  But it can only be done with fairness and with fair sharing by all, \nand that is what President Obama has spoken about. He spoke about that \nin his inaugural address. That is what we have been talking about here \nfor a long time; that is, shared sacrifice on behalf of all, and to \nmake sure that all pay their fair share of taxes in this country so we \ncan once again do what we did in 1993. We can do it again if only my \nfriends on the Republican side will join with us in making sure we \nraise the necessary revenues to get us out of this hole.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin).

Madam President, first of all, this is the first time I \nhave spoken on the floor when you were in the chair. Welcome to the \nSenate and welcome to the presiding chair.\n  I want to talk for a few minutes today about a baseball great, a \nMissouri great, Stan Musial, who passed away on Saturday at the age of \n92. Stan Musial was born in November 1920 in Denora, PA. His title was \nStan ``The Man.'' He was the youngest of six children. When he wasn't \ncalled Stan ``The Man,'' he was just a guy who worked at a company as a \nyoung man, whose dad was a Polish immigrant, whose mother was of \nCzechoslovakian ancestry, and whose dreams were probably not to become \na professional baseball player but who was, indeed, a great athlete \nfrom the very start.\n\n  In his remarks, when he presented Stan Musial the Medal of Freedom in \n2011, President Obama said the following:\n\n       Stan matched his hustle with humility. He retired with 17 \n     records--even as he missed a season in his prime to serve his \n     country in\n\n[[Page S198]]\n\n     the Navy. He was the first player to make--get this--\n     $100,000. Even more shocking, he asked for a pay cut when he \n     didn't perform up to his own expectations.\n\n  I don't think that August Busch gave him the pay cut--again, a \nquote--but I have read the story where Stan Musial was holding out for \na pay package somewhere in the mid-90s and August Busch, Jr., who not \nlong before that had bought the Cardinals, called him into the office \nand said: I'm never going to pay you 90--whatever thousand dollars he \nwas asking for. He said: I'm going to pay you $100,000, and you are \ngoing to be the first baseball player to make $100,000.\n  Stan Musial played for the Cardinals from 1941 to 1963, the only \nMajor League team he played for. He entered the majors in 1941 as the \nfifth youngest player. He ended his career in 1963 as the third oldest \nplayer. He had a record of 24 times being named to the Major League \nBaseball All-Star team. He won seven National League batting titles, \nthree National League Most Valuable Player awards, and he led the \nCardinals to three World Series championships in the 1940s.\n  Stan Musial--No. 6--had a batting average of at least .300 in every 1 \nof his 17 seasons--a .300 hitter for every 1 of his 17 seasons. His \nlifetime batting average was .331. He batted .330 in the year before he \ndecided to retire. He had 3,630 career hits, hitting 1,815 hits in St. \nLouis at Sportsman Park and Busch Stadium, and he hit another 1,815 on \nthe road. He played as well at home as he did away from home. He missed \nthe entire 1945 season while he was serving in the Navy.\n  It was a fan at Ebbet's Field--with the Dodgers playing at Ebbet's \nField--who groaned as he came to the plate one time in a game--he was \nalways particularly good against the Dodgers. The fan said: Here comes \nthe man. And from that point on, his nickname was Stan ``The Man.''\n  I had a chance to sit by Tommy Lasorda at a luncheon a few years ago \nafter I had read a biography of Stan Musial. Tommy was sort of the \nlongtime Dodgers manager who was a player when Stan Musial was playing, \nand he said he thought Stan Musial was the best ballplayer he ever saw \nplay, and he was death on the Dodgers. The Dodgers fans liked him, but \nit was a real rivalry.\n  Stan was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame the first year he was \neligible, in 1969, and he would be one of the great ambassadors to \nbaseball for the rest of his life. When he retired in 1963, \nCommissioner Ford Frick said:\n\n       Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands \n     baseball's perfect knight.\n\n  Stan Musial became an American icon throughout ballparks and over the \nradio in the 1940s and 1950s. KMOX, in the 1960s, had a booming signal \nthat went almost all the way to the west coast and covered a lot of the \nSouth, and the St. Louis Cardinals were the furthest south of any \nbaseball team and the furthest west of any baseball team. Because of \nthat, Stan Musial played on a club that, in many ways, became America's \nteam at that time.\n  I can remember growing up in southwest Missouri on a dairy farm, and \nparticularly late at night when we were hauling hay--and I can remember \nthis when I was 10 or 12 years old--and whoever was in the truck must \nhave been almost deaf because the driver would have the radio turned as \nloud as you could turn the radio up, and the St. Louis Cardinals game \nwould be coming out of both windows as we were out there working in the \nfields or, if we weren't working in the field, we would be sitting on \nthe porch somewhere listening to the Cardinals play, and there was no \ngreater Cardinal than Stan Musial.\n  Bob Gibson, another great Cardinal and Stan's teammate and fellow \nHall of Famer, said:\n\n       Stan Musial is the nicest man I ever met in baseball.\n\n  And Bob Gibson went on to say he didn't particularly associate nice \nwith baseball, but he associated nice with Stan Musial.\n  Bob Costas had this to say about Stan Musial:\n\n       Stan Musial didn't hit in 56 straight games. He didn't hit \n     .400 for a season. He didn't get 4,000 hits. He didn't get \n     500 home runs. He didn't hit a home run in his last at bat, \n     just a single. He didn't marry Marilyn Monroe; he married his \n     high school sweetheart. His excellence was a quiet \n     excellence.\n\n  ESPN titled Musial the most underrated athlete ever. Only Hank \nAaron--thinking about the things Stan Musial didn't do--had more runs \nthan Stan Musial and extra base hits. Only Tris Speaker and Pete Rose \nhad more hits. And only Babe Ruth and Barry Bonds created more runs. \nBut Stan Musial was at the highest levels in all of those areas.\n  Writing in the St. Louis Post Dispatch this week, Bernie Miklasz \nwrote:\n\n       Let's celebrate Musial's extraordinary life and be thankful \n     for his enduring presence through the decades. Let's keep it \n     simple in honor of this remarkably uncomplicated man. There \n     has never been a more perfect union, a better relationship \n     between an athlete and a town, than Stan Musial and St. \n     Louis. From the time Stan took his first at-bat as a \n     Cardinal, until his death Saturday at his home in Ladue, he \n     was part of the community's soul for 71 years, 4 months, and \n     2 days.\n\n  Many stories about Stan Musial have been told, but I want to mention \nthree that Bernie mentioned in that same article. He talked about when \nMusial was first inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame--as I said \nearlier, as soon as you could possibly be inducted. It was an overcast \nday in Cooperstown. The crowd was quiet, subdued, and a little bit put \noff by the day. Moments before Musial's official ceremony, the clouds \ngot out of the way and the sunshine emerged, and Dizzy Dean's widow \nsaid: ``Stan brought the sun. He always does.''\n  In the 1960s, a second story emerged of Musial and other Major League \nstars visiting U.S. troops in Vietnam, and they went to the military \nhospitals to console the wounded soldiers. One seriously injured \nsoldier looked up at Musial from his hospital bed and said: ``You're \nthe best.'' And Musial's response was: ``No, you are.''\n\n  Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Joe Black, an African American, told a story \nabout being racially taunted by players in the St. Louis dugout during \na game. Musial, who was batting at the time, and facing Joe Black, \nstepped out and angrily kicked the dirt to display his disapproval of \nhis own teammates. He waited after the game to tell Black:\n\n       I'm sorry that happened. But don't you worry about it. \n     You're a great pitcher. You will win a lot of games.\n\n  Black said Musial's support helped him gain the confidence he needed \nto become a top pitcher.\n  The fourth and last story Bernie told was of legendary center fielder \nWillie Mays, who frequently talked about Musial befriending African-\nAmerican players, relating that at an All-Star game black players were \nbeing ignored by the other players. Mays said:\n\n       We were in the back of the clubhouse playing poker and none \n     of the white guys had come back or said, ``Hi'' or ``How's it \n     going?'' or ``How you guys doing?'' or ``Welcome to the All \n     Star Game.'' Nothing. We're playing poker and all of a sudden \n     I look up and here comes Stan towards us. He grabs a chair, \n     sits down and starts playing cards with us. And Stan didn't \n     know how to play poker! But that was his way of welcoming us, \n     of making us feel a part of it. I never forgot that. We never \n     forgot that.\n\n  Musial didn't make a lot of fiery speeches. He didn't ``lead'' a \nmovement or try to promote himself as an angelic humanitarian. He just \ndid good things.\n  There is one last story, a love story, between Stan and his wife Lil. \nThis may be the best Musial statistic of all. They were married for 71 \nyears, 4 months, and 2 days until Lil's death on May 3, with Stan \nfollowing her in January.\n  I listened to KMOX from the hay truck I talked about earlier, like \nlots of other Cardinals and Musial fans, but I remember the first time \nI saw Stan Musial play at Sportsman Park. I remember the first time, 30 \nyears later, I actually met him, when I was the Secretary of State in \nMissouri. Getting to meet Stan Musial was about as good as it got even \nthen. I remember hearing him play ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' on \nhis harmonica.\n  Baseball was lucky to have him, Missouri was lucky to have him, and \nthe Cardinals and St. Louis were lucky to have him, and I am pleased to \nbe here today to say how much we appreciate Stan Musial.\n  I am also pleased to be joined by my colleague from Missouri, Senator \nMcCaskill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I want to thank my colleague. He and \nI disagree on many things, but we agree on many things also, and one of\n\n[[Page S199]]\n\nthose things usually begins and ends with the State we love, Missouri, \nand certainly some of our most famous and beloved people who come from \nMissouri. Obviously, there is no one who deserves more love and respect \nthan Stan Musial.\n  There are so many memories about Stan Musial that I want to try to \nencapsulate today, but the interesting thing about the memories I have \nabout Stan Musial is that I don't have these memories because I am a \nSenator. They do not belong uniquely to me because I am an elected \nofficial. I have these memories that I share with hundreds of thousands \nof people who were lucky enough to encounter Stan Musial during his \ntime on Earth.\n  You know, when you meet somebody, and you can tell they are kind of \nlooking over you to try to find the person who is more important behind \nyou or maybe they are impatient because they do not think you are a big \nenough deal to be taking their time? If you look at our sports icons \ntoday who travel with posses and have entourages and certain rules \nabout who can come near them and who can't and when, that was not Stan \nMusial. Not one day of his career or one day after his career did he \nconsider himself untouchable. He saw it as his duty and obligation to \nbe there for all fans. Whether it was somebody who worked at the \nballpark sweeping after the game was over or whether it was a very \ntalented ballplayer from another team, everyone was equal in Stan \nMusial's eyes. What a wonderful American value.\n  I could stand here today, Madam President, and talk about his amazing \nrecord as a baseball player, his unique swing, and the beauty of his \naccomplishments in America's favorite pastime, but what we need to \nfocus on as we mourn the loss of this living legend is his character \nbecause it was his character that brought universal love, respect, and \ndevotion to the man, our man, Stan ``The Man.''\n  I know Senator Blunt talked about this story, but I want to elaborate \na little bit.\n  It is 1952. Joe Black has just been called up to the majors after \nspending 1 year in the minors with the Brooklyn organization. He is \nfacing Stan Musial. Now, keep in mind that this is an accomplished \nbaseball player who had won two championships in the Negro Baseball \nLeagues, and it had only been a few years since Jackie Robinson had, in \nfact, broken the color barrier for Major League Baseball. He is facing \nStan Musial, who already was the most feared hitter in baseball. He is \nstanding there as a Black man on the mound in this baseball game, and \nout of the Cardinal dugout come jeers and taunts. In fact, one of the \nthings said was, hey, Stan, you are not going to have any trouble \nhitting that ball against that dark background.\n  When the game was over, Stan Musial decided not to stay in the \nCardinal dugout. Joe Black told the story that as he sat in the dugout, \nhe felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked up, and there was Stan Musial \nfrom the opposing dugout saying to Joe Black: You are going to be a \ngreat pitcher.\n  Now, that encapsulates the character of Stan Musial.\n  Chuck Connors, ``The Rifleman,'' used to tell this story. He was a \nstruggling hitter for the Chicago Cubs.\n  I may need to explain to you, Madam President, but I certainly don't \nneed to explain to anybody in Cardinal Nation that the Chicago Cubs are \nan opponent. Now, we don't like the Chicago Cubs in Cardinal Nation.\n  Chuck Connors asked a teammate what he should do about his swing. He \nwas struggling with being able to hit in the majors, and they all told \nhim the same thing: The only guy who can help you is Stan Musial. So \neven though he was reluctant to approach a hitter on the opposing team, \nhe went to Musial and asked for help, and, of course, Stan responded as \nall of us would expect he would; he spent 30 minutes in the cage with \nan opposing player trying to help him with his swing. Connors recounted \nthat he really wasn't ever that good of a hitter, but he said he never \nforgot Stan Musial's kindness.\n\n       And when he finished watching me cut away at the ball, Stan \n     slapped me on the back and told me to keep swinging.\n\n  After the 1946 season, the promoters from the Mexican League decided \nit was time for them to up the ante on baseball. At the time, Stan \nMusial was making the enormous sum of $13,500 playing for the St. Louis \nCardinals. The Mexican League came to Stan Musial and said: We are \ngoing to offer you--a king's ransom at the time--$125,000 for 5 years. \nThat was a lot of money for Stan Musial and his family, but he turned \ndown the Mexican League. When asked about it later, he said:\n\n       Back in my day, we didn't think about money as much. We \n     just enjoyed playing the game. We loved baseball. I didn't \n     think about anybody else but the Cardinals.\n\n  Harry Caray knew Stan Musial for over 50 years. He would often tell \nthe story of Stan Musial wandering out of the ballpark after a steaming \ndoubleheader--and trust me, we can have steaming doubleheaders in \nMissouri--looking as if he had been through 15 rounds in a prize fight \nand every single thing in his body language signifying that he was \nexhausted and just wanted to go home and lie down. Instead, when he got \nto his car, he found fans waiting for him. ``Watch this,'' Harry Caray \ntold a friend. And sure enough, Musial's whole body straightened--like \nPopeye had just eaten a can of spinach--and he started shouting, \n``Whaddya Say! Whaddya Say!'' And he signed every single autograph of \nall the fans surrounding his car. Harry Caray loved telling that story \nnot because it was unusual--that is who Stan Musial was--but for the \nopposite reason: because it was ordinary. Even in his time, when \nbaseball players weren't paid as much and so were more part of the \ncommunity, Stan Musial stood apart by standing with the people in the \ncommunity.\n  It wasn't just Cardinal Nation that worshipped Stan Musial. His \nopponents, the opposing teams--can you imagine this happening today? \nBelieve it or not, the New York Mets had a Stan Musial Day at their \npark. And in Chicago, the home of the Cubs, he once finished first in a \nfavorite player survey, edging out the legendary Ernie Banks, who was \nalso a very nice guy who was beloved by the fans of baseball in the \nMidwest.\n  I could go on and on with stories that reflect this man's character. \nYes, he has amazing statistics. Yes, him hitting a baseball was a thing \nof beauty to all baseball fans in America. But, really, what this man \nwas about was that phrase we love to throw around in politics way too \noften; that is, American values. This was a man who didn't have to talk \nabout his values because he lived them--his love for his family and how \nclose they are.\n  I am very fortunate to be friends with the Musial family and have \nvisited with them in the days since his death. They received messages \nfrom every star in the constellation of American baseball, but one \nstood out. Joe Torre, upon hearing of Stan's death just a few days ago, \nsent a message to the Musial family, and it simply said this:\n\n       Stan Musial was a Hall of Famer in the game of life. We \n     will miss you, Stan Musial.\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S199-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S199-S200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as we get started on this next Congress--\nand I wish to congratulate the Presiding Officer for joining this \nChamber. As someone who has had the opportunity to preside during my \nfirst 2 years in the Senate, I commend the Presiding Officer for those \nactions and look forward to working with you on a variety of projects.\n  What I want to do today is continue a tradition that I actually \ninherited from one of our former colleagues, Senator Ted Kaufman of \nDelaware. Senator Kaufman, who had been a long-time employee of the \nSenate, came to this floor on a fairly regular basis during his time \nhere to basically celebrate and acknowledge--in most cases--the \ntireless, unsung work of so many of our Federal employees. As we debate \nbudgets, debt, and deficit, we oftentimes\n\n[[Page S200]]\n\nrecognize we have to make extraordinary and difficult choices in cuts. \nIn many instances, behind all of those cuts are Federal employees who \ndo remarkable work in keeping us safe, providing services, and helping \nour country grow.\n  Ted Kaufman used to come down here on a regular basis and celebrate \nsome of those unsung heroes. I was proud to continue his tradition \nduring the last Congress and look forward to carrying it on through \nanother session.\n  I start this next Congress actually celebrating two great Federal \nemployees, I might add, who both happen to be Virginians who serve as \nexcellent role models. They represent the thousands of professionals \nwho work quietly every day across our intelligence community to keep \nour Nation safe.\n  Very often these professionals work in anonymity and many risk their \nlives in troubled spots far away from the limelight, and that is how it \nshould be. Recently we have seen certain incidents abroad, and \nsometimes they pay with the highest sign of sacrifice in terms of their \nlives.\n  For their service, their late nights and early mornings away from \ntheir families, the risks they take, and the sacrifices they make every \nday--and because they do not hear this nearly enough--allow me to say \nthank you to those members of the intelligence community.\n\n\n                          Jeanne Vertefeuille\n\n  Today I wish to briefly tell the remarkable stories of two \nextraordinary women who built their careers at the Central Intelligence \nAgency. Jeanne Vertefeuille, who is pictured here, passed away on \nDecember 29 at the age of 80 after a brief illness.\n  In announcing her death to the CIA family, Acting Director Michael \nMorell appropriately described Ms. Vertefeuille as an icon within the \nagency. If her story were not true, it would read like a spy novel.\n  Jeanne joined the CIA when she graduated from college in 1954. It was \nthe year I was born and a year Dick Durbin was also young. This was a \ntime when the American intelligence community could be best described \nas an old boys' club. She was hired at the CIA as a GS-4 typist. This \nis a woman coming out of college in 1954 hired as a typist.\n  Over her career, which stretched over nearly a half century, Jeanne \nVertefeuille blazed a trail for women in the national clandestine \nservice. She methodically worked her way up to leadership positions. \nThere were overseas postings in Ethiopia, Finland, and The Hague. She \nbecame an expert in Soviet intelligence and spycraft. She retired as a \nmember of the Senior Intelligence Service in 1992.\n  Even after her retirement, she continued her work for the agency as a \ncontractor, making still more valuable contributions and working \nwithout a day's break in service until she became ill last summer. As \nher obituary reads:\n\n       She remained a quiet agency soldier . . . purposefully \n     nondescript and selflessly dedicated.\n       She lived alone and walked to work.\n       But if she was a great figure at the agency, Ms. \n     Vertefeuille was also a tenacious and effective one, and in \n     October of 1986 was asked to lead a task force to investigate \n     the disappearance of Russians whom the CIA had hired to spy \n     against their own country.\n\n  Together, with colleagues at the CIA she invested years in the \nmethodical and painstaking hunt for a mole. It was through her efforts, \nand the good work of many others, that we ultimately unmasked the \nnotorious traitor Aldrich Ames in 1984. Remember, this is a woman who \njoined the CIA in 1954 as a typist.\n  Aldrich Ames turned out to be one of the most dangerous traitors in \nthe Nation's history. Thanks in large measure to Ms. Vertefeuille, he \nwas convicted of espionage and is now serving a life term without \nparole.\n\n\n                              Sandy Grimes\n\n  Jeanne Vertefeuille's story does not end there. The Washington Post \nrecently described how one of her colleagues, Sandy Grimes--another \nVirginian who worked with her on the Ames task force--stepped up over \nthe past year to care for Jeanne as she was battling cancer.\n  Sandy Grimes, a career CIA employee whose parents worked on the \nManhattan Project, ultimately served as Jeanne's primary caregiver. She \nsat with her each day during the final 3 months of her remarkable life. \nShe monitored Jeanne's care and tried to make sure she remained \ncomfortable. She often brought personal messages of support and \nappreciation from their former colleagues. Ms. Grimes said:\n\n       I felt an obligation to be there with her. I can't imagine \n     not doing it. I was the one Jeanne would accept. I owed it to \n     her as a friend.\n\n  By all accounts Jeanne Vertefeuille was an intensely private woman, \nand she doubtless would recoil at the attention she is now receiving. \nOne cannot help but be inspired by this true-life story of service, \npatriotism, and friendship demonstrated by these two great employees, \nSandy Grimes and the late Jeanne Vertefeuille. Their service reflects \nwell on the thousands of other intelligence professionals whose names \ncan never be revealed. Both of them deserve our recognition and thanks.\n  During the last Congress I joined 14 Senators in a Joint Resolution \nto mark the U.S. Intelligence Professionals Day. At some point during \nthis Congress, I hope we can gather more supporters so we can have a \nday designated on a more formalized basis to recognize the enormous \ncontributions made by intelligence professionals. Again, this is an \neffort to bring respectful attention to these quiet professionals who \nliterally--as a member of the intelligence committee, I can testify to \nthis--keep our Nation safe every day without any thought of \nrecognition.\n  Again, I look forward to working with my colleagues so we can \nintroduce this resolution in the next Congress.\n  As I conclude my remarks, I see my friend the distinguished majority \nwhip. We have spent a lot of time over the last 2\\1/2\\ years grappling \nwith the challenges around the debt and deficit and trying to make some \nof the very hard choices we are going to need to make as a Nation.\n  While it appears that we may be avoiding some of the immediate \nconsequences of the so-called debt ceiling debate, which I am glad to \nsee, never should the full faith and credit of the United States be \nused as a political hostage. Again, I want to compliment my friend the \nSenator from Illinois who has been as stalwart as anyone in this \nChamber at stepping up and who has been willing to speak truth to even \nthose who are the most supportive about some of the challenges and \nchoices we have to make.\n  We are going to have to proceed at a level of spending that is less \nthan what we have had in the past. As we think about cutting back \nbudgets, I think it is important to remember that behind many of these \nbudgets, there are not just numbers but there are incredible \nprofessionals who give their life's service to making this a stronger \nNation. So with this tribute to Jeanne and Sandy, I commend these two \ngreat Federal employees.\n  I will be back on a regular basis to celebrate Federal employees \nthroughout this Congress because too often in today's day and life, \ngovernment service is disparaged. But for Jeanne Vertefeuille and Sandy \nGrimes we might not have as safe a Nation as we do today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will accept my colleague from Virginia's \nkind words with at least an indirect apology for the defamation which \nhe included in his speech suggesting that I was somehow an Ancient \nMariner here in the Senate. I wear my trousers rolled but not quite as \nrolled as my friend suggested.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership on this deficit and debt \nissue. We have a lot to do and we have to do it thoughtfully. I am glad \nmy colleague highlighted the two employees.\n  I read the obituary of the one the Senator from Virginia highlighted. \nIt was an extraordinary story of a woman who persevered in an agency \nwhich didn't have much use for women beyond the secretarial staff. I am \nglad the Senator continues this tradition of acknowledging these \nimportant Federal employees.\n  I thank my friend from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S200-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S200-S201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO STAN MUSIAL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been said in St. Louis, MO, \nbaseball is not a sport, it is a religion. If that is\n\n[[Page S201]]\n\ntrue, Stan Musial was a St. Louis civic patron saint.\n  Stan Musial was an icon in St. Louis. He was the best ballplayer to \nwear a Cardinal's uniform and one of the best to play the game of \nbaseball.\n  Stan Musial was my childhood hero when I was a boy and he remains a \nhero in my life to this day. When a person reaches my age, and maybe my \nstation in life, they are supposed to be beyond the stage of swooning \nadolescence. But when it comes to Stan Musial, I am a 10-year-old kid \nall over again in East St. Louis, IL, buying more bubble gum than I can \npossibly afford in the hope that I would open one of those packages and \nfind, covered in pink powder, a card that had Stan Musial's picture. It \nwas the treasure of my youth, and it still would be today if my mom had \nnot thrown those cards away.\n  Stan Musial's death has hit the Cardinals Nation like a death in the \nfamily. One Cardinal fan spoke for many of us when she said losing Stan \nMusial ``is like losing a grandparent. It's hard not to tear up.''\n  I grew up in East St. Louis across the river, and my most prized \npossession when I was a kid was my very first Stan Musial Rawlings \nbaseball glove. As a kid I rubbed that glove with something called \nGloveoleum until I was the only one who could still see Stan Musial's \nname burned in the leather. One of the highlights in my life came 2 \nyears ago when I got to meet Stan Musial in person for the very first \ntime in my life. It was at the White House, February 11, 2011. Stan \nMusial was there to receive from President Obama the Presidential Medal \nof Freedom. He is one of only eight other baseball players in the \nhistory of America to receive that prestigious honor. Listen to the \ncompany he joined: Joe DiMaggio, Jackie Robinson, Ted Williams, Roberto \nClemente, Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, and the famous Buck O'Neill.\n  At the White House I stood patiently waiting for the moment to ask \nStan Musial to sign that old baseball glove, which I still have and \nhave had since I was a kid. He agreed to do so. What a thrill. I was 10 \nyears old all over again.\n  Outside Busch Stadium in St. Louis is a statue of Stan ``The Man'' in \nhis playing prime. He is coiled up in his batting style. Every coach \nsaid don't bat like Stan ``The Man,'' even though he has great numbers. \nIf you do that, you will never hit the ball. We all tried; the coaches \nwere right. Etched in the base of that statue are words that Major \nLeague Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick said when Stan retired in 1963: \n``Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's \nperfect knight.''\n  On the field and off Stan Musial was always a gentleman, always a \nchampion. He exemplified the values of sportsmanship, discipline, hard \nwork, grace, consistency, and a love of family. Baseball broadcaster \nVince Scully, a Hall of Famer himself, once said: ``How good was Stan \nMusial? He was good enough to take your breath away.''\n  Stan Musial played his entire 22-year career for the St. Louis \nCardinals. He did take off one season in 1945 to serve our country in \nthe U.S. Navy during World War II. His 3,026 games with the same club \nare second only to the 3,308 games over 23 years by Carl Yastrzemski.\n  When Stan Musial retired from baseball after the 1963 season, he held \n29 National League records and 17 Major League records. Here are just \nsome of his career numbers: a batting average of .331, an on-base \npercentage of .417, 3,630 hits, 725 doubles, 177 triples, 475 homers--\nand the first homer I can ever remember seeing on television was the \nAll-Star game in St. Louis, and darned if Stan Musial didn't get up in \nthe 12th inning, parking a home run into the outfield stands, winning \nit for the National League. I couldn't have been more thrilled, my \nfirst exposure to baseball on television. He had 1,951 RBIs and 1,949 \nruns. He is the only baseball player to finish his career in the top 25 \nin all of these categories.\n  Where did he get that nickname? It was coined not by a Cardinals fan \nbut by a Brooklyn Dodgers fan in May 1946, after Musial's four hits \nhelped lead the Cardinals to a 13-to-4 drubbing of the Brooklyn \nDodgers. Every time Stan Musial came to the plate, the fans in Ebbets \nField said, ``Here comes the man.'' And the name stuck.\n  The legendary baseball writer Red Barber once described the 1947 \nseason as ``the year all hell broke loose in baseball.'' It was the \nyear Jackie Robinson integrated Major League Baseball. Jackie Robinson \nwould later recall when asked about his baseball career that it was \nStan Musial and Hank Greenberg, two players who went out of their way \nto be friendly and encouraging in that historic and difficult year.\n  Maybe Stan Musial's greatest baseball day came on May 2, 1954. It was \na double header in St. Louis against the New York Giants. He hit three \nhomers in the first game and two in the second.\n  In 1957, Stan Musial became the first Major League Baseball player to \nearn the amazing salary of $100,000 a year. Two years later, when his \nbatting average dipped to .255, it was Musial who went to the \nCardinals' owners and asked them to cut his salary back to $80,000. He \nwasn't playing up to what he thought he had the potential to play up \nto.\n  Late in his final season, he stayed up all night waiting for the \nbirth of his first grandchild, and the next day he became the first \ngrandfather to ever homer in the Major Leagues. Umpires--and this says \nsomething about what a gentleman he always was--umpires never once \nejected Stan Musial from a baseball game in more than 3,000 games.\n  On January 21, 1969, Stan Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of \nFame on the first ballot. He was named on 92 percent of the ballots--\nsomething on which to reflect after what we just went through a few \nweeks ago when no one made the cut for the Baseball Hall of Fame. Stan \nMusial was the first player to receive 300 votes on a Hall of Fame \nballot.\n  When he retired, the St. Louis Cardinals retired his number, No. 6. \nCardinals manager Mike Matheny has said that when the entire Cardinals \nteam takes the field this year, they will be wearing a No. 6 patch on \ntheir uniforms. But then he said:\n\n       It will be a call for us to do our very best to live up to \n     that high standard of excellence.\n\n  Then he added:\n\n       You don't come across names like warrior, prince and knight \n     by just having Hall of Fame statistics. It comes from making \n     an impact in people's lives. I was in that group. Mr. Musial, \n     I say thank you. He's a perfect example of what it means to \n     wear this jersey.\n\n  I want to give credit to my colleague, Senator Claire McCaskill. She \nworked with me--in fact, she led the way in terms of the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom, along with Senator Bond, for Stan Musial. And she \ncame up with a great idea. I don't know if it is going to go anywhere, \nbut I am going to try to help her make it a reality. She has suggested \nwe can honor this American hero, this regional hero and the values he \nstood for by naming the new bridge being built across the Mississippi \nRiver at St. Louis in honor of Stan Musial. I grew up on the Illinois \nside, and we kind of looked over at Missouri a little differently than \nmost, and they looked at us a little differently too. But if there was \none thing that ever united us it was baseball loyalty and Stan Musial. \nIt is a perfect name for a bridge that spans between Illinois and \nMissouri in that region of the country.\n  I am proud to join Senator Claire McCaskill, and we will be \nintroducing a bill to name the bridge the Stan Musial Memorial Bridge. \nOther legislation is being considered in the Illinois and Missouri \nGeneral Assemblies at this time. I wish them the best in honoring this \ngreat man. It was my great honor to join him on that historic date when \nhe was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n  (The remarks of Senator Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. \n113 and S. 114 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S201-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S201-S202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GOOD GOVERNMENT REFORM\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, more and more Americans from all walks of \nlife, of both political parties, feel there is not just a pond or a sea \nbut an ocean of difference between the real world where they live and \nWashington, DC. They view--I think correctly--Washington, DC, as a \ndifferent planet where\n\n[[Page S202]]\n\nnormal rules do not seem to apply. That is why on the first day I could \nintroduce new legislation in this new Congress, I chose to introduce a \npackage of reform measures--measures aimed at bridging that gap, \nbringing those two worlds together, returning us--returning Washington \nto the real world and reconnecting with the American people.\n  The American people are also concerned--rightly--about the bitter \npartisanship, the overly ideological tone of almost all of the debate \nwe have here in Washington now, here in Congress.\n  I believe these sorts of reform measures--the four bills I have \nintroduced in particular--can also help bridge that divide because they \nare not ideological, they are not partisan, they are good-government \nreform, things that can and should and, hopefully, will bring us \ntogether and bring us together and reconnect us with the American \npeople. Again, it is another reason I chose to introduce this package \nof four reform measures, four good-government bills on the first day I \ncould introduce legislation this Congress.\n  The first is a very simple and basic but fundamental idea: term \nlimits for Members of Congress. I am honored to be joined by six other \nSenators right out of the gate, right out of the box in terms of \ncosponsoring this important legislation: Senators Paul, Ayotte, Coburn, \nLee, Rubio, Cruz, and Johnson. I thank them for their cosponsorship and \ntheir support. This measure would limit Members of Congress in the \nHouse to three consecutive terms, a total of 6 years, and the Senate to \ntwo consecutive terms, a total of 12 years. It is a consensus measure \nsupported by citizens groups very active and supportive of the concept \nof term limits. The idea, again, is simple: to reconnect Congress with \nthe American people, to do away with the notion of legislating as a \ncareer, and to get back to the Founders' vision of citizen legislators.\n  When I was in the State legislature, I authored and passed term \nlimits for the State legislature. That required a State constitutional \namendment--a big deal--a two-thirds vote in each body, and then a vote \nof the people. But because of the people's voices rising and being \nheard, we achieved that. With that reform, which was voted \noverwhelmingly into the State constitution by the people of Louisiana, \nwe have a regular influx now of new, fresh blood, real experience from \nthe real world that reconnects in a very healthy way the State \nlegislature and all of us, the citizens, whom it is supposed to \nrepresent. That was needed for the State legislature, and if it was--\nand it was--it is needed a thousand times more for Congress because \nthat divide, that sea, that ocean, that difference between different \nplanets in the eyes of so many Americans is even greater between \nCongress and the real world, Congress and the American people.\n  The second bill I have introduced is a bill to do away with automatic \npay increases for Members of Congress. That is present law, that we get \nregular increases of pay with no proposal, no bill put in the hopper, \nno debate, no need for an inconvenient vote. I think that is just \noutright wrong. I think it helps build that distrust on the part of the \nAmerican people. I am joined by a bipartisan cosponsor, Senator \nMcCaskill of Missouri. I thank her for her leadership and her support \nof this measure. Again, the measure is very simple: Just repeal, do \naway with any automatic pay increases for Members of Congress. If there \nis to be a pay increase, there should be a bill proposing it and open \ndebate and a public vote.\n  The third measure is also fully bipartisan. I am introducing it with \nSenator Bill Nelson of Florida. It is reform of the Corps of \nEngineers--something very important for our two States but also for, \nindeed, the whole country. In Louisiana, in Florida, and elsewhere, \nunfortunately, the Corps of Engineers has become a poster child for a \ndysfunctional Federal Government, a Federal bureaucracy, a Federal \nsystem that is just bogged down, does not work. It takes 10 and 20 \nyears to study something, never ever getting to construction. We need \nto streamline and reform that process, and the Vitter-Nelson bill does \njust that by greatly streamlining the process by which Corps projects \ncan come to fruition, putting State and local leaders more in charge of \nthat effort, at first on a pilot basis. Hopefully, we will expand that \nin the future for important Corps of Engineers projects. Again, that is \nparticularly important for our States of Louisiana and Florida, but it \nis important for so many States and for the country as a whole.\n  Fourth and finally, I am introducing a measure that I have had before \nto reform Federal campaign finance law to prohibit PACs and campaign \nfunds from employing Members' spouses or family members.\n  That is just a way, quite frankly, in some circumstances for Members \nof Congress, politicians, to pad their family income. I think that is \nwrong, and that leads directly to the real suspicion and low regard in \nwhich so many Americans hold this institution.\n  Again, this bill is simple, straightforward, but important. It would \nprohibit spouses and immediate family members of Members of Congress \nfrom receiving payments from that Member's campaign accounts or \nleadership PACs. That is a loophole and an area of abuse we must close. \nWe must prohibit that abuse in the future.\n  These four bills won't solve every problem out there. They won't be \nthe be-all and end-all of important reform and good-government efforts, \nbut they would be an important start. They would help us truly \nreconnect with the American people and narrow this divide, which is so \nvast right now, between the real world, real Americans, and this \ninstitution. They would be important, nonpartisan, nonideological \nreform efforts that we can gather around, Republicans and Democrats \nalike, to do something positive, to do something productive, and to \nreconnect with the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues from both parties to support these measures, to \ncome on as cosponsors. Many of you already have, and I thank you for \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life, legacy \nand service of a dear friend--John Edward Bresch. Jack lead a life \nfilled with compassion. He worked tirelessly for everyone to have \naccess to affordable, quality health care, especially needy children \nand families. His heart was as big as heaven.\n  But Jack's life was also a life of great humor. Anybody who knew him \nalso knew his warm and infectious laugh. It was a sure sign that Jack \nwas somewhere nearby because you could almost hear his laughter before \nyou saw his face. And everybody was glad to see Jack coming their way. \nHe truly never met a stranger.\n  Sadly, we won't be able to hear that distinct laughter again. Jack \npassed away on September 1, 2012, surrounded by his family after a \nbrief and courageous battle with pancreatic cancer. From the moment of \nhis fateful diagnosis until the day he left us, we saw in him grace and \ncourage, dignity and humility, joy and, yes, laughter--and so much love \nand gratitude lived out on a daily basis that, even in our sorrow, his \nmemory will never be lost.\n  Tomorrow, Jack will be laid to rest in our Nation's most hallowed \nground--Arlington National Cemetery--with full military honors as a \ndecorated Naval Lieutenant who served as a Chaplain during the Vietnam \nwar.\n  In his life, Jack Bresch was many things but above all, a family man, \ndevoted to his wife, JoAnn; his children, Mary Elizabeth, James \nRichard, and\n\n[[Page S203]]\n\nJeffrey John; and 10 grandchildren on whom he doted. He also leaves \nbehind countless friends and colleagues whose lives are enriched with \nmemories of this gregarious, energetic, larger-than-life man. But when \na loved one is gone, it is often the little things you remember most. \nSome of us will remember how much Jack loved neckties. Some of us will \nremember sharing Jack's favorite drink--a Manhattan, made with Maker's \nMark, up, no bitters, with a twist of orange. Some of us will remember \nhow often Jack quoted the 19th century German politician Otto von \nBismark--``Politics is the art of the possible.'' And some of us will \nremember how proud Jack was to be at the White House when President \nObama signed the Affordable Care Act for which he worked so tirelessly. \nA friend saw Jack on TV and sent him a text to let him know, and Jack \ntexted back, ``Just a pleasure to be here.''\n  It was a pleasure for Jack to be anywhere. Simply put, Jack enjoyed \nbeing with people, and people enjoyed being with Jack. He was a great \nperson to talk to--probably because he began his adult life as a Roman \nCatholic priest. Jack was a priest in the Diocese of Pittsburgh, his \nnative city, from 1966 to 1974. In 1968, at the height of the Vietnam \nwar, he entered the U.S. Navy and served as a Navy and Marine Corps \nChaplain in posts around the world. During his time in the service, he \nsupervised drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs and worked as a \nliaison with the American Red Cross. After the war, Jack left the \npriesthood. But in some ways, he never stopped being a chaplain, in the \nsense that he never wavered from his steadfast belief in social \njustice. He carried that belief forward in career that made the world a \nbetter place--working for Congress, the Federal Government, the \nIllinois Hospital Association, the Catholic Health Association, and the \nAmerican Dental Education Association. Many members of Congress got to \nknow Jack through his work as the lead lobbyist for the Catholic Health \nAssociation. They also learned quickly just how hard it was to say \n``no'' to Jack.\n\n  While at the Catholic Health Association, Jack worked closely with \nthen First Lady Hillary Clinton and the White House to develop a plan \nfor reforming the Nation's health care system. While at the American \nDental Education Association, he was instrumental in improving access \nto dental care for needy children. For more than a decade, he worked \ndiligently to ensure that policymakers understood the value of oral \nhealth to overall health--the reason why he was invited to the White \nHouse for the signing of the Affordable Care Act. Jack lived long \nenough to see the Supreme Court uphold key portions of the Affordable \nCare Act. He knew the law wasn't perfect, but he was happy to see it \nmove forward. Remember, he believed that ``politics is the art of the \npossible.''\n  To JoAnn and Jack's entire family, my wife Gayle and I extend our \ndeepest sympathy because we are part of that family. Jack and I shared \nfour of his 10 grandchildren, but he lent all the rest of them to me, \ntoo. It is hard to think of this world without Jack being a part of it, \nmaking us laugh--and hearing him laugh--and making us care--the way he \ncared.\n  There is a wonderful anonymous quote which may well describe how we \nshould think of Jack's passing, especially since he served so \ncourageously in the Navy. It offers great comfort to those who grieve. \nAnd it goes something like this:\n\n       I am standing upon the seashore. A ship at my side spreads \n     her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue \n     ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength, and I stand \n     and watch her until, at length, she hangs like a speck of \n     white cloud just where the sea and sky come down to mingle \n     with each other. Then someone at my side says, ``There! She's \n     gone.''\n       Gone where? Gone from my sight--that is all. She is just as \n     large in mast and hull and spar as she was when she left my \n     side, and just as able to bear her load of living freight to \n     the place of destination. Her diminished size is in me, not \n     in her, and just at the moment when someone at my side says, \n     ``There, she's gone,''--there are other eyes watching her \n     coming, and other voices ready to take up the glad shout, \n     ``There she comes!''\n\n  Jack Bresch was a man whose optimism could overwhelm any doubter and \nwhose joy for life was wonderfully contagious and completely \nirresistible. The ancient poets tell us that ``one must wait until the \nevening to see how splendid the day has been.'' Our day with Jack \nBresch was splendid indeed.\n  As we prepare to honor Jack with the military honors due a decorated \nNavy Chaplain, I would like to end my tribute to Jack's life with a \ntraditional nautical blessing and wish my dear friend ``fair winds and \nfollowing seas.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Patti Page died on New Year's Day this \nyear. She was 85 years old. The Senate has not been in session for most \nof the time since then. I wanted to come to the floor to pay a \nTennessean's tribute to Patti Page. Patti Page is best known for our \nState song, the ``Tennessee Waltz.'' A few years ago, in 2007, when I \nmet her for the first time, she told me the story of the ``Tennessee \nWaltz.'' I knew some of it, but she completed the rest of it.\n  In 1946, a couple of Tennesseans, Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart, were \ndriving from Memphis to Nashville. That was before the interstate \nhighways. It took a pretty good amount of time to drive that distance. \nI don't know whether or not they were drinking a beer on the way from \nMemphis to Nashville but they were relaxed, and one of them said to the \nother, Why is it Kentucky and Missouri have a waltz and Tennessee \ndoesn't have a waltz? So on the way from Memphis to Nashville they took \nout a penny matchbox, which is one of these big boxes with wooden \nmatches in it, dumped out the matches on the floorboards of the car, \nand on the back of the penny matchbox, between Memphis and Nashville, \nin 1946, Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart wrote the ``Tennessee Waltz.'' \nThey sang it around a few places. Pee Wee King sang it at the Grand Ole \nOpry. Nobody paid much attention to it. Cowboy Copas sang it. They sang \nit on Red Foley's show in Missouri. Nothing much happened to the \n``Tennessee Waltz'' until 1950, and this is the story Patti Page told \nme. Mercury Records in New York had a new song they were sure was going \nto be a big hit. It was called ``Boogie Woogie Santa Claus.'' I don't \nknow whether it was a follow up to ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' \nbut the executives in New York were sure it was going to be a big hit \nso they wanted the hottest young female singer in America to record \n``Boogie Woogie Santa Claus'' so they hired Patti Page. She flew to New \nYork, recorded it for Mercury Records, and then in those days you \nalways had to put a record on the back of the main record. You had to \npick a song. It would be the ``B'' side. Just as a throw-away they put \non the back of it the song by Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart, the \n``Tennessee Waltz.''\n  We know the rest of the story. The ``Tennessee Waltz'' sold about a \nmillion copies. Nobody ever heard of the ``Boogie Woogie Santa Claus'' \nexcept those who bought the ``Tennessee Waltz.'' Mike Curb, who runs \nKerr Records in Nashville, told me it was the best selling record ever \nby a female artist. Patti Page eventually sold 100 million records. She \nwas the top selling female artist in record sales in history.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S203, January 23, 2013, the Record reads: Mike Kerr, who \nruns Kerr Records in . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Mike Curb, who \nowns Curb Records in . . .\n  Growing up I heard her songs, ``Mockingbird Hill,'' ``I Went To Your \nWedding,'' ``Old Cape Cod.'' In 1952 she had a song called ``Doggie in \nthe Window.'' It sounds like a silly little song, but it sold a lot of \nrecords and a great many Americans remember it. When I was Governor of \nTennessee I would travel to Japan, recruiting industry. In the evenings \nI would go to a restaurant bar with friends, and to my astonishment all \nof my Japanese friends, many of whom did not know much English, could \nsing every word of the ``Tennessee Waltz.'' When I inquired about it, \nit was because it was introduced during the time of the American \noccupation of Japan in 1950 or so, and according to them, the Asian \nmusic doesn't have the same kind of standard that American music has. \nWe get a phrase or a theme in our minds and we never forget it, such as \nthe ``Tennessee Waltz.'' So the ``Tennessee Waltz'' became a song that \nmost Japanese men of that age knew, remembered, and could sing from \nmemory.\n  I met Patti Page for the first time 6 years ago. It was 2007. She was \nabout 79 or 80 years of age at the time. She told me the story of the \nrecording of the\n\n[[Page S204]]\n\n``Tennessee Waltz'' for Mercury Records. It turned out it was her last \nrecording session. Mike Kerr, the owner of Kerr Records, had invited \nher to come to Nashville and record an album, ``Best of Patti Page.'' \nHe had invited me to come play the piano while she sang the ``Tennessee \nWaltz,'' which I did. It was a real thrill and she was very patient to \nput up with an amateur piano player for her very special song. She told \nme then it wasn't the first time she had performed with a Tennessee \nGovernor. In 1950 she had performed with Tennessee Governor Gordon \nBrowning at a Memphis theater. This was when she was all the rage, the \n``Tennessee Waltz'' was all the rage, and the Governor wanted to sing \nit with her.\n  I asked how it went. She said, ``Well, to tell you the truth, the \nGovernor wasn't a very good singer.''\n  I don't know what she said to others about my piano playing, but I \nthink that was probably about as harsh a verdict as Patti Page ever \nrendered of any other person.\n  According to the New York Times obituary, Patti Page once said:\n\n       But I don't think I've stepped on anyone along the way. If \n     I have, I didn't mean to.\n\n  Well, Patti Page is gone now, but her music is not. Whenever we \nTennesseans hear our State song, the ``Tennessee Waltz,'' played, or \nwhenever we sing it, we will remember the voice of Patti Page.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks that \nthe obituary about Patti Page from the New York Times be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the New York Times--Obituary]\n\n        Patti Page, Honey-Voiced '50s Pop Sensation, Dies at 85\n\n                            (By Anita Gates)\n\n       Patti Page, the apple-cheeked, honey-voiced alto whose \n     sentimental, soothing, sometimes silly hits like ``Tennessee \n     Waltz,'' ``Old Cape Cod'' and ``How Much Is That Doggie in \n     the Window?'' made her one of the most successful pop singers \n     of the 1950s, died on Tuesday in Encinitas, Calif. She was \n     85.\n       Her death was confirmed by Seacrest Village Retirement \n     Communities, where she lived.\n       Ms. Page had briefly been a singer with Benny Goodman when \n     she emerged at the end of the big band era, just after World \n     War II, into a cultural atmosphere in which pop music was not \n     expected to be challenging. Critics assailed her style as \n     plastic, placid, bland and antiseptic, but those opinions \n     were not shared by millions of record buyers. As Jon Pareles \n     wrote in The New York Times in 1997, ``For her fans, beauty \n     and comfort were one and the same.''\n       ``Doggie in the Window,'' a perky 1952 novelty number \n     written by Bob Merrill and Ingrid Reuterskiold, featured \n     repeated barking sounds and could claim no more sophisticated \n     a lyric than ``I must take a trip to California.'' It is \n     often cited as an example of what was wrong with pop music in \n     the early '50s, a perceived weakness that opened the door for \n     rock 'n' roll. But if that is true, and if the silky voice of \n     ``the singing rage, Miss Patti Page,'' as she was introduced \n     during her heyday, was mechanical or sterile, she had \n     significant achievements nonetheless.\n       ``Tennessee Waltz,'' from 1950, sold 10 million copies and \n     is largely considered the first true crossover hit; it spent \n     months on the pop, country and rhythm-and-blues charts.\n       Ms. Page was believed to be the first singer to overdub \n     herself, long before technology made that method common. \n     Mitch Miller, a producer for Mercury Records, had her do it \n     first on ``Confess,'' in 1948, when there were no backup \n     singers because of a strike.\n       The height of her career predated the Grammy Awards, which \n     were created in 1959, but she finally won her first and only \n     Grammy in 1999 for ``Live at Carnegie Hall,'' a recording of \n     a 1997 concert celebrating her 50th anniversary as a \n     performer. Her career was also the basis of recent, short-\n     lived Off Broadway musical, ``Flipside: The Patti Page \n     Story.''\n       In the early days of television Ms. Page was the host of \n     several short-lived network series, including ``Scott Music \n     Hall'' (1952), a 15-minute NBC show that followed the evening \n     news two nights a week, and ``The Big Record,'' which ran one \n     season, 1957-58, on CBS. ``The Patti Page Show'' was an NBC \n     summer fill-in series in 1956.\n       Ms. Page defended her demure, unpretentious style as \n     appropriate for its time. ``It was right after the war,'' she \n     told The Advocate of Baton Rouge, La., in 2002, ``and people \n     were waiting to just settle down and take a deep breath and \n     relax.''\n       She was born Clara Ann Fowler on Nov. 8, 1927, in \n     Claremore, Okla., a small town near Tulsa that was also the \n     birthplace of Will Rogers. She was one of 11 children of a \n     railroad laborer.\n       Having shown talent as an artist, Clara took a job in the \n     art department of the Tulsa radio station KTUL, but an \n     executive there had heard her sing and soon asked her to take \n     over a short country-music show called ``Meet Patti Page'' \n     (Time magazine called it ``a hillbilly affair''), sponsored \n     by Page Milk. She adopted the fictional character's name and \n     kept it.\n       The newly named Ms. Page broke away from her radio career \n     to tour with Jimmy Joy's band and was shortly signed by \n     Mercury Records. She had her first hit record, ``With My Eyes \n     Wide Open, I'm Dreaming,'' in 1950. Other notable recordings \n     were ``Cross Over the Bridge,'' ``Mockin' Bird Hill,'' \n     ``Allegheny Moon'' and her last hit, ``Hush . . . Hush, Sweet \n     Charlotte,'' which she recorded as the theme for the Bette \n     Davis movie of the same name. That song was nominated for an \n     Oscar, and Ms. Page sang it on the 1965 Academy Awards \n     telecast.\n       Ms. Page briefly pursued a movie career in her early '30s, \n     playing an evangelical singer alongside Burt Lancaster and \n     Jean Simmons in ``Elmer Gantry'' (1960), David Janssen's love \n     interest in the comic-strip-inspired ``Dondi'' (1961) and a \n     suburban wife in the comedy ``Boys' Night Out'' (1962), with \n     Kim Novak and James Garner. She had one of her earliest \n     acting roles in 1957 on an episode of ``The United States \n     Steel Hour.''\n       In later decades her star faded, but she continued to sing \n     professionally throughout her 70s. Early in the 21st century \n     she was performing in about 40 to 50 concerts a year. In 2002 \n     and 2003 she released an album of children's songs, a new \n     ``best of'' collection and a Christmas album.\n       Ms. Page married Charles O'Curran, a Hollywood \n     choreographer, in 1956. They divorced in 1972. In 1990 she \n     married Jerry Filiciotto, a retired aerospace engineer, with \n     whom she founded a New Hampshire company marketing maple \n     syrup products. He died in 2009. Survivors include her son, \n     Danny O'Curran; her daughter, Kathleen Ginn; and a number of \n     grandchildren.\n       Ms. Page's nice-girl image endured. In 1988, when she was \n     60, she told The Times: ``I'm sure there are a lot of things \n     I should have done differently. But I don't think I've \n     stepped on anyone along the way. If I have, I didn't mean \n     to.''\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have only been a Member of the Senate for \n2 years, but in that short period of time at least seven other \ncountries have taken actions that we have not taken to better support \nand attract entrepreneurs to their countries' economies. The map beside \nme shows those countries: the United Kingdom, Russia, Singapore, \nAustralia, Brazil, Chile, and Canada. Those countries have changed \ntheir rules, regulations, passed laws, changed their policies to make \ntheir country more friendly to startup businesses and to \nentrepreneurship.\n  I wish to focus on and visit with my colleagues about what is \nhappening in one of those countries--our neighbor to the north, \nCanada--and explain why it is in the interests of our own country to \nact quickly to retain highly skilled and entrepreneurial immigrants.\n  In 2002, Canada announced plans to create a new visa to attract \nforeign entrepreneurs to their country. Canada is developing a plan to \nadmit foreign entrepreneurs who have received capital from venture \nfunds to start businesses in Canada and to admit them to Canada within \nweeks. A spokesman for the Canadian immigration agency was quoted in \nSeptember as saying: ``Canada seeks young, ambitious innovative \nimmigrants who will contribute to Canada's job growth and further drive \nour economy.''\n  But Canada is not just changing its laws to attract entrepreneurs; it \nis advertising and trying to lure talent there. The ad we are now \nshowing--this is a full-page ad that appeared in a publication called \nFast Company. It is an American magazine dedicated to startups, to \ntechnology and innovation. The advertisement for Ontario highlights R \nincentives and innovative and dynamic business environment\n\n[[Page S205]]\n\nand the top talent needed to grow new businesses.\n  We in Congress and in the administration need to take note of this. \nOther countries, including our friends to the north, are aggressively \ncourting entrepreneurs and talented individuals and they are luring \nthem from here; they are trying to get them from the United States. \nCanadian Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said: ``We \nneed to proactively target a new type of immigrant entrepreneur who has \nthe potential to build innovative companies that can compete on a \nglobal scale and create jobs for Canadians.''\n  While we work in the United States to continue educating our children \nwith the skills for a 21st century economy and training the next \ngeneration of great American entrepreneurs, we also need to be \nwelcoming to those who want to create a business in the United States \nand employ Americans now. With respect to Canada, America is the \ncountry of entrepreneurs, a place where those with good ideas who are \nwilling to work hard can come and make something for themselves.\n  There is a global battle for entrepreneurial talent and the United \nStates is falling behind. A story I heard while visiting California, \nthe Silicon Valley, last year, illustrates this point pretty well. A \nlarge company that just a few years ago was a small startup told me \nthey had plans to hire 68 highly skilled immigrants but could not get a \nvisa for them to work in the United States. Rather than letting this \ntalent go, the company hired them but hired them at their location in \nCanada. It is certainly troubling that 68 jobs went outside the United \nStates. They were lost in our country because the United States does \nnot have a visa program that works. What troubles me even more is that \nsome of those 68 people hired in Canada will go on to start a business \nthat may result in significant job creation in Canada. Those jobs that \ncould have been in the United States are now in another country and \nthose individuals who may start a company are no longer in the United \nStates but are now in Canada. When we lose entrepreneurs and highly \nskilled immigrants, we lose the jobs they create.\n  The good news is there are steps we can take to attract and retain \nforeign entrepreneurs and highly skilled immigrants. In a bipartisan \neffort, Senator Warner, Senator Coons, Senator Rubio, and I introduced \nStartup Act 2.0 last year. Senators Blunt and Scott Brown of \nMassachusetts joined as cosponsors, and an identical bill was \nintroduced in the House of Representatives with an even number of \nRepublican and Democratic supporters. Again, this year, I am working \nwith those colleagues to reintroduce a bill very similar to that in \nvery short order.\n  Startup Act 2.0 makes changes to the Federal regulatory process to \nlessen government burdens on job creators, modifies the Tax Code to \nencourage investment in new businesses and capital formation, seeks to \naccelerate the commercialization of university research that can lead \nto new ventures and, most importantly, provides new opportunities for \nhighly educated and entrepreneurial immigrants to stay in the United \nStates where their talent and new ideas can fuel economic growth and, \nmost importantly, create jobs for Americans.\n  Startup Act 2.0 creates an entrepreneurial visa for foreign-born \nentrepreneurs currently in the United States--legally in the United \nStates. Those with good ideas, with capital, and the willingness to \nhire Americans would be able to stay in the United States and grow \ntheir businesses. In many instances, foreign-born entrepreneurs, here \nlegally, have an idea and want to begin a company that will employ \nAmericans but are told their visa does not allow them to remain in the \nUnited States.\n  Take the story of Asaf Darash. Asaf was born in Israel and came to \nthe United States in 2007 after being awarded a Fulbright scholarship \nto study at the University of California. After completing his doctoral \nthesis, he founded a software company called Regpack. Asaf raised $1.5 \nmillion in financing for the company and hired more than a dozen \nAmericans. His company has the potential to grow quickly and to further \ncreate additional jobs. But Asaf, the founder of this dynamic company, \nis no longer in the United States. My staff contacted him this morning \nand he said that because of the difficulty in obtaining a visa and the \namount of time and effort it was taking, he decided it was easier to \nmove to Israel and take the core of the company, including its jobs, \nwith him. As Regpack grows, new jobs are going to be created in \nIsrael--jobs that could have been in the United States if we had a visa \ndedicated to foreign entrepreneurs such as Asaf.\n  Sadly, his story is far from uncommon. Immigrants legally living in \nthe United States who have a good idea and want to start a business \nhave few options available to them. With very few ways to stay, these \nentrepreneurs, just like Asaf, are forced to move and take their \nbusinesses with them and take the jobs they have created and will \ncreate to other countries.\n  I wish to make certain America is the best place for entrepreneurs \nwho want to build America and hire Americans. Passing Startup Act 2.0 \nwill help make this happen.\n  Entrepreneurial immigrants have long contributed to the strength of \nour country by starting companies and creating jobs. Of the current \nFortune 500 companies, more than 40 percent were founded by first- or \nsecond-generation Americans. Today, 1 in every 10 Americans employed at \na privately owned U.S. company works at an immigrant-owned firm.\n  In our mobile world, entrepreneurs have a choice as to where they \nstart a business. For decades, there was no better place than the land \nof opportunity--the United States of America. But things are changing. \nOther countries are aggressively seeking the best and brightest, those \nwith entrepreneurial talent, as a way to grow their economy.\n  I believe most--in fact, I would say at least 80 percent--of my \ncolleagues in Congress agree with the visa provisions in Startup Act \n2.0. They understand that retaining highly skilled entrepreneurial \nimmigrants will lead to economic growth and new jobs for Americans. \nUnfortunately, there is an approach in Congress that has been here for \nthe last several years that says if we can't do everything, we will not \ndo anything. I urge my colleagues let's pass what we can agree on now \nand keep working to find common ground on issues that still divide us.\n  Canada and other countries are creating new opportunities for \nentrepreneurs, for startup companies, but the United States is still \nthe home of the American dream. We need to pass Startup 2.0 so \nindividuals can pursue their ambitions in America.\n\n  Millions of our citizens remain out of work. Our economy is barely \ngrowing. One would think, common sense would suggest we would work hard \ntogether to deal with the issues we have agreement on that would help \njump-start the economy.\n  Let's do that. Let's jump-start the American economy through \nentrepreneurship and allow those with talents and skills we need to \npursue the American dream in the United States of America and thereby \nstrengthen our economy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S205-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S205-S207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DYSFUNCTIONAL LEGISLATING\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we all know in the Senate and in the \nHouse of Representatives about the low grades Congress receives in \npublic opinion polling. Everybody knows what the public reports: \nCongress is partisan. Congress is divided. Congress is dysfunctional.\n  One recent survey that got a lot of media attention reported that \nCongress is less popular than a root canal. Across the country, people \nare fed up with Congress. Indeed, Members of Congress are fed up with \nCongress.\n  Americans want a Congress that can take on the tough challenges of \ntoday. But another recent poll by USA Today and Gallup showed that 77 \npercent of Americans feel ``the way politics works in Washington these \ndays is causing serious harm to the United States.''\n\n[[Page S206]]\n\n  Americans think Congress has a problem. Indeed, Americans think \nCongress is a problem. Well, if we want to fix a problem, we ought to \nbe specific about it. A doctor wouldn't try to fix a patient without a \nprecise understanding of the patient's problem. An engineer wouldn't \ntry to fix a system without a precise understanding of the system's \nproblem. A mechanic wouldn't try to fix your car without a precise \nunderstanding of your car's problem. So if we are going to fix what is \nwrong with Congress, we better have a precise understanding of what \nCongress' problem is.\n  Let's start with the Senate. We do have our share of dysfunction in \nthe Senate, I will confess. Undoubtedly, the filibuster is being \nabused. Certainly, nominees awaiting confirmation are unjustifiably \ndelayed. Indeed, they are held hostage. So everything is not all roses \nin the Senate.\n  But we did pass a highway bill, a bipartisan highway bill, that \npassed the Senate with 74 votes. We did pass a farm bill, a bipartisan \nfarm bill. Although I did not support that particular measure, it was a \nbipartisan measure that passed the Senate with 64 votes.\n  We passed the Hurricane Sandy emergency relief bill, also in \nbipartisan fashion, with 62 votes. We had open debate, we had \ndiscussions, we had amendments, and we passed legislation.\n  Particularly, we passed, by a powerful bipartisan vote of 89 to 8, a \nbill that avoided tax increases for 99 percent of Americans and \nextended emergency unemployment benefits for another year and protected \nus from the fiscal cliff. When it comes to legislating, the Senate \nactually has a pretty strong bipartisan record.\n  How did those Senate bills do on the House side? Well, the House \ncouldn't pass its own highway bill. Congress has been doing highway \nbills since the Eisenhower years. This isn't rocket science. The House \ncouldn't do one. The best the House of Representatives could do was to \npass a short-term extension that allowed some of their Members to get \nto conference on the Senate bill, but they took no bill into conference \nbecause they couldn't pass one. Even then, they delayed the conference \nnegotiations, putting thousands of jobs in jeopardy before they finally \ncame around and passed an amended version of the Senate bipartisan \nhighway bill. So their record on the highway bill is nothing to be \nproud of.\n  The House also couldn't pass a farm bill. Farm bills are pretty \nordinary legislative business too. We do them all the time, but the \nHouse has passed no farm bill. We passed a strong bipartisan Senate \nfarm bill. They can't even agree to call up the bipartisan Senate farm \nbill and pass it. With 80 percent of the agricultural land of the \ncountry in drought, there is no farm bill. It is trapped in the \nsinkhole of the House.\n  The House almost couldn't pass a disaster bill. If you go back to \nHurricane Katrina, when Katrina hit back in 2005, the House of \nRepresentatives then had emergency aid on its way to the 850,000 \ndamaged or destroyed homes of the gulf coast in 11 days. In 11 days aid \nwas on its way. This time, with this House of Representatives, the \nHouse balked at the bipartisan Senate disaster bill and, finally, it \ntook them 78 days after the landfall of Hurricane Sandy to send help to \nthe half million homes and businesses damaged or destroyed by that \nstorm.\n  The condemnation of the House of Republicans was bipartisan. The \nRepublican Governor of New Jersey blamed, and I quote, ``the toxic \ninternal politics,'' the toxic internal politics, of the House \nRepublicans for this fiasco. ``This,'' he said, and I will quote again, \n``is why the American people hate Congress.''\n  Is there a problem over in the House? You bet there is, to the point \nwhere one departing House Republican Member compared the Speaker of the \nHouse to the manager of an asylum and the Speaker's House Republican \ncolleagues to the asylum inmates. That is pretty strong criticism from \nwithin the Republican Party.\n  The reason I give this speech is to try to be precise about what the \nproblem is that has driven Congress's approval into the cellar, and \nwhat exactly is that problem? Well, I think the House votes on the so-\ncalled fiscal cliff bill and on the emergency Hurricane Sandy aid \nillustrate what the problem is. Those bills passed the House for one \nreason and one reason only: The Speaker of the House of Representatives \nwaived what is called the Hastert rule.\n  What is the Hastert rule? The Hastert rule is probably the most \nsignificant contributor to dysfunction in Washington right now. It is \nnot even really a rule, it is a policy, a political policy of \nRepublican Speakers. It began under former Republican Speaker Hastert, \nhence its common name as the Hastert rule. The rule is that the Speaker \nwill bring no bill to the floor of the House of Representatives without \na majority of his own party supporting the bill. It doesn't matter \nabout a majority of Congress; Democratic votes don't count. It is only \nwhen the Speaker has a majority of Republican votes supporting it that \nthe Speaker will allow legislation to come to the floor.\n  It has actually gotten a little bit harder under Speaker Boehner, who \nhas said, I don't feel comfortable scheduling any controversial \nlegislation unless I know we have the votes on our side first, which \nsounds like he is saying he has to be able to produce a majority of the \nHouse out of just the Republican caucus before bringing a bill. But \nwhether it is the original Hastert rule requiring a majority of the \nmajority before they will even bring a bill to the floor or what \nappears to be the Boehner rule, that they have to have the votes on \n``our side first,'' it is a rule of obstruction.\n  There are somewhere between 50 and 60 Members of the House Republican \ntea party caucus and a whole bunch more House Republicans who are \nscared of the tea party and scared of what might happen to them if they \nget a tea party primary challenger. So getting a majority of his party \ntogether for anything reasonable is a challenge for Speaker Boehner.\n  House Republicans could not get a majority of their conference to \nsupport a highway bill. So the Hastert rule kicked in and there was no \nHouse highway bill, none--they couldn't do one at all because they \ncouldn't get it through their conference under the Hastert rule. That \nis why there was no highway bill.\n  The House Republicans could not get a majority of their conference to \nsupport a farm bill, so under the Hastert rule there is no House farm \nbill. The Speaker won't bring up the stalled bipartisan Senate farm \nbill, because under the Hastert rule he can't get a majority of his \nparty to support even the bipartisan Senate farm bill.\n  We were headed for the exact same result on the fiscal cliff--we were \nheaded for the exact same result on the fiscal cliff. Speaker Boehner \ncould not get his party to support protecting America from the fiscal \ncliff. So, with literally minutes left to spare, and with the House \nRepublican Conference ready, willing, and about to pitch the country \noff the fiscal cliff, Speaker Boehner did what? He ignored the Hastert \nrule. He ignored the Hastert rule, and he let the fiscal cliff bill \ncome to the floor of the House without having the votes on ``our side \nfirst,'' to use the Speaker's language. Two-thirds of House Republicans \nactually voted to roll America off the fiscal cliff. Here is the vote \ncount. Republican ``yes'' votes on the fiscal cliff legislation were \nonly 85. Republican ``no'' votes on the fiscal cliff legislation were \n151. He wasn't even close to making the Hastert rule.\n\n  That fiscal cliff bill passed the House 257 to 167 because the \nDemocrats came out and voted for it, 172 to 16; 172 Democratic ``yes'' \nvotes, 16 Democratic ``no'' votes. Two-thirds of the ``yes'' votes that \nput the fiscal cliff bill across and saved America from a 100-percent \ntax increase and protected our economy from the fiscal cliff--two-\nthirds of those votes came from Democrats. If the Speaker had enforced \nthe Hastert rule, we would be over the fiscal cliff today.\n  What happened on Sandy? After nearly 3 months of stalling, while my \nState, while the Presiding Officer's State of New York, while the \nStates of New York and New Jersey, struck by Sandy, were waiting \nurgently for the relief that we got to the coast within 11 days, they \nstalled and they stalled because they could not get a majority of the \nRepublican caucus to support Federal relief for our hurricane-ravaged \nStates. Under the Hastert rule, they\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\ncouldn't get that bill to the floor. So Speaker Boehner once again \ndecided to forgo the Hastert rule. That is how they got the Sandy \nemergency aid bill passed. Look again at the votes. Republican ``yes'' \nvotes for the disaster bill, 49; Republican ``no'' votes for that bill, \n179. That bill was dead on arrival under the Hastert rule. The \nRepublican caucus couldn't support it, wouldn't support it, and we \nwould be without any help now if they had followed the Hastert rule.\n  On the Democratic side, what was the vote on the Hurricane Sandy \nbill--192 ``yes'' votes to 1 ``no'' vote. The final count was 241 ayes, \n180 nays. The bill passed, but about three-quarters of the support came \nfrom Democratic votes.\n  If the Speaker had imposed the Hastert rule, not only would we be off \nthe fiscal cliff, but we would have failed at providing disaster relief \nfor Hurricane Sandy. The only reason these critical pieces of \nlegislation avoided the fate of the highway bill and of the farm bill \nis that the Speaker didn't follow the Hastert rule. He couldn't follow \nthe Hastert rule because he wouldn't have been able to pass \nlegislation. If his tea party caucus had forced America off the fiscal \ncliff, he knew there would have been hell to pay, so he waived the \nHastert rule.\n\n  Now, of course, House Republicans are all in a fuss about having \nwaived the Hastert rule. One tea party lawmaker admitted that the New \nYear's Day tax vote left a lot of his fellow Republicans with a very \nbad taste in their mouth. So it is probably back to Hastert rule \nbusiness as usual on the House side, with death by tea party to any \nmajor bipartisan Senate legislation.\n  The tea party over on the House side wanted to vote for extreme \nthings, such as voting to repeal or defund ObamaCare over 30 times--\nover 30 times--or voting to turn Medicare into a voucher program. If it \nis extreme enough, then they will vote for it. But those are actions \nwhich are not supported by the American people, and they can't pass the \nSenate.\n  For the regular business of government, for the regular business of \npassing Senate bipartisan legislation, the tea party-Hastert rule \ncombination is deadly.\n  So back to where I began. If you are concerned about dysfunction in \nCongress, if you are wondering why we are less popular than a root \ncanal, if you are wondering why 77 percent of Americans look at \nCongress and think we are actually doing more harm than good, and if \nyou want an explanation of the dysfunction, take a look at the Hastert \nrule. If you look at this problem the way a doctor would look at a \npatient, the way an engineer would look at a system, the way a car \nmechanic would look at an automobile, and you look for what is broken, \nbe specific; it is the application by the Speaker of the Hastert rule \nthat prevents strong, bipartisan Senate legislation from going forward. \nWhen something moves, it is because the Hastert rule has been waived.\n  So if you want to see what is wrong, that quest takes you straight to \nthe House of Representatives, and there it leads you straight to the \nHouse Republican conference, and there it leads you to that toxic \ncombination of the tea party and the Hastert rule.\n  When you understand the problem, the cure is obvious: The House \nshould ditch the Hastert rule. Call things up for a vote. Let \neverybody's vote count. Don't refuse to proceed unless only your own \nparty will let you. It is the obvious and only solution. The fiscal \ncliff bill and the Sandy bill and the votes on those bills prove it.\n  With those tea party extremists dominating the House Republican \nconference and ready to pitch the country over the fiscal cliff and \nleave hurricane victims high and dry, the Speaker had to ditch the \nHastert rule. The only way the House can do bipartisan business on \nmajor issues is to ditch the Hastert rule.\n  As we saw, the Senate has its problems, but we are actually doing OK, \njust as our legislative record shows. Over and over, we pass real, \nsignificant, bipartisan legislation after a real process on the floor \nof argument and amendment. As the House's legislative record shows, the \nproblem is over there. More precisely, the problem is within the House \nRepublican conference. Still more precisely, again, the problem is that \ntoxic combination of the tea party and the Hastert rule.\n  If we want Congress to function effectively, if we want to succeed at \ndoing the work of the American people, such as the fiscal cliff bill \nand the hurricane relief bill, and if we don't want to see more \nimportant legislation, such as highway bills and farm bills, fail in \nthe House, unable to pass in the House, blocked in the House, the \nsolution for the problem is clear: We have to ditch the Hastert rule \nand let the House as a body work its will, just as the American people \nelected it to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S207-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I rise to encourage the Senate to seek \nquick action on the Sandy relief package that has been long overdue. I \nknow the majority leader is committed to bringing it to the floor as \nsoon as we can get some type of agreement with the other side of the \naisle, and I hope that agreement can come quickly because a recovery \nthat is delayed--as this has already been significantly delayed--is a \nrecovery that very likely can fail.\n  We cannot afford for one of the biggest engines of the national \neconomy, which is the Northeast, to fail in its recovery. This is not \nonly for the sake of the Northeast but for the entire country.\n  I appreciate the majority leader's steadfast commitment to provide \nthat relief as quickly as possible here in the Senate, but time is a-\nwasting. It is already Wednesday, and I am concerned we will lose \nanother week before we, in fact, seek passage and then go to the \nPresident. From there, it would move on so the resources could begin to \nflow to communities across the Northeast that have languished since \nSandy took its toll.\n  There is no excuse for delay. We already had the delay in the House. \nThey could have passed the package the Senate passed in a transparent \nprocess that had the Appropriations Committee--on both sides--scrubbing \nthe bill. It was brought before the Senate in a fashion in which we \nlike to see the Senate work. I believe there were 25-some-odd \namendments that were considered, a full vetting of the legislation, and \nthere was a strong bipartisan vote at the end of that process. It was \nthen sent to the House, and unfortunately it languished and died at the \nend of the last Congress.\n  Now the House has acted in a different fashion. So I am happy at this \npoint to accept the House's version--even though I do believe the \nSenate version is superior in a variety of ways--so it can be sent to \nthe President. Getting relief to the citizens in the Northeast is \ncritically important.\n  I look at the package the House has, and I say to myself that $50.7 \nbillion in resources, in addition to the flood insurance package that \nhas already passed, will allow our residents and small businesses that \nhave been waiting so long to recover and begin to rebuild. Finally, it \nwill show them that they have a strong partner in the Federal \nGovernment and that someone is there for them, as we have been whenever \nand wherever disaster has struck\n\n[[Page S208]]\n\nour fellow Americans throughout this Nation.\n  Obviously, I would have preferred the Senate bill, which was \nstronger, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We \nneed to get assistance to the victims of Sandy as quickly as possible. \nThis is a vehicle that gets us to that goal.\n  While the House bill significantly reduces assistance in a couple of \nareas--including fishery disasters and community development funding, \nwhich I think in that respect may stump the recovery of an important \nindustry along our coast and could potentially siphon off billions in \nCDBG funding that is badly needed right now in New York and New Jersey \nby amplifying what disasters are eligible for it--I am pleased to say \nwe protected the overall amendment of the CDBG funding from the Senate \nbill, which is about $16 billion.\n  While it is not everything we needed since it will now be spread even \nthinner across even more disasters, we can certainly help as many \ncommunities rebuild and recover as we can because time is of the \nessence. There is a fierce urgency right now. There are many business \nowners whom I have spoken to who said to me: Senator, I am at a \ncritical juncture. I don't know whether I can reopen. If the government \nis not going to give me assistance, then I likely won't open because \nadding more debt, even in terms of a long-term, low-interest loan, is \nstill debt. They say: I took out debt to start this business or: I took \nout debt to get through the great recession, but I don't really have \nthe option to take out more debt without some direct assistance, such \nas a grant. A grant would give the help I need to jump-start my \nbusiness so I can get those individuals I had employed reemployed once \nagain and create an opportunity for our community.\n  That decision right now for those businesses, which are life-and-\ndeath decisions, is pending and hanging by the will of the Senate to \nact.\n  I am also pleased that the package the House passed recognizes what I \nhave been saying all along--that funding the Army Corps of Engineers' \nefforts is critical to rebuilding coastal communities, particularly New \nJersey's weakened coastal defenses. We are at the lowest of our immune \nsystem as a coastal State, and we already see the biting cold. It is \ncold throughout the Capitol today, which shows how cold it is outside. \nThink about those residents who are fellow Americans and don't have a \nplace to call home because they don't have the wherewithal to get their \nhome back in a way in which they can once again be able to live there, \nraise their families there, and meet their challenges as a family in a \nwarm nurturing environment. That does not exist for many of our fellow \nAmericans because they don't have the wherewithal to decide whether \nthey are going to get the type of assistance to help them rebuild their \nhomes. All of that is pending.\n\n  Part of that is the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to reengineer \nour beaches in a way that ultimately provides not only for the \npotential of tourism, which is a $37 billion industry in our State, but \neven more importantly for the protection of lives, property, and \nprotection against repetitive losses. That is what is going to happen \nwhen we get this money to the Army Corps of Engineers so they can \nrebuild our coastal defenses. This package would give Jersey Shore \nresidents and businesses the comfort of knowing they would be better \nprotected in the future than they have been in the past.\n  It also includes $13 billion in critical funding I sought to help to \nrestore our transportation systems. For example, it would allow New \nJersey Transit to repair extensive damage from the storm and allow the \nagency to build facilities on higher ground to prevent future flood \ndamage, which is a commonsense option. When we think about fiscal \nresponsibility, why would we rebuild only to the very same status that \nwas allowed to be flooded in the first place and caused all of the \ndamage the government would pay for? The passage of this potential \npackage from the House would allow the port authority to finish \nrepairing the PATH station and harden electrical equipment to prevent \nfuture damages.\n  If we could get an agreement, the package that would come to the \nfloor would include necessary policy reforms that I have supported that \nwill streamline recovery efforts and improve FEMA's public assistance \nprograms, which is critical to a successful recovery. These reforms \nwould allow us to rebuild what is in place even stronger and better \nbefore there is another storm. Again, this is important in terms of the \nend results. It is important in terms of the fiscal responsibility to \nensure we rebuild in such a way that we don't end up with repetitive \ndamage, which would be more costly to the government.\n  It would allow a third-party dispute resolution process for major \nprojects. Some of the history we have, particularly with Katrina from \nSenator Landrieu's experience, is the reality of not having a dispute \nresolution process, which ultimately forestalled recoveries and \ncritical projects to that State and in those communities. Also, \ncoverage for childcare costs related to disaster recovery through FEMA \nindividual assistance is a critical element.\n  Without going through all of the provisions of the House bill, let me \njust say we need to pass this relief package. People are suffering. \nThey are desperately waiting for certainty so they can start rebuilding \ntheir lives, their businesses and communities. They are trying to get \nback on their feet. They need this aid even if it is late and even if \nit is ultimately longer than other disasters have had to wait. As I \npointed out in the past, I think it was 10 days or so when $50 billion \nflowed to Katrina victims. We are nearly 3 months since the worst \ndisaster on the east coast in terms of a natural disaster that has \ntaken place.\n  The people of the Northeast, the people of my State of New Jersey and \nour neighbors in New York desperately need this funding, and it is time \nto help these fellow Americans. It is time to do it now. It is time to \ndo it this week. It is going to take time for this recovery to take \nplace. The longer we delay, the greater the chance of failure we, in \nfact, create. I think we want success, not failure. I think we want to \nunderstand, as an institution, as I have said many times, that this is \nthe United States of America. That means we respond to the challenges \nand the disasters that take place in other parts of the country. We do \nit, hopefully, more expeditiously than this, and at the same time we \nstand by our fellow Americans so they can reclaim their lives, reclaim \ntheir commitments to their communities, reclaim the opportunity to \nreopen their businesses, to contribute to those communities, to our \nState, to this Nation, to our society.\n\n  So I strongly urge our colleagues who have some reticence to agree to \nmoving forward on a Sandy bill to come to common ground with us, to \ncome to agreement to move this relief package. No American should have \nto languish months after a disaster to get help. That should not be the \nstandard. The hallmark of our response should be an intelligent but \nexpeditious response to the consequences of a disaster that any \nAmerican faces. That is our tradition. It is a tradition we should \nmaintain. It is a tradition that, unfortunately, in this particular \ninstance has not been a reality. It is a tradition that I hope we can \nultimately embrace once again this week in finally pushing through a \nSandy package that can move to the President for signature and bring \nrelief to our communities.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S208-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S208-S209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KEN SQUIER\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate Ken \nSquier, of Stowe, VT, for his historic contribution to motor sports and \nto broadcasting, and for his deep and abiding commitment to the people \nof Vermont. On November 29, 2012, NASCAR presented Ken with the \nprestigious Buddy Shuman Award, given to ``an individual who has played \na key role in the continued growth and success of Cup racing.''\n  Most Americans know Ken Squier as the ``Voice of the Daytona 500.'' \nIn 1979, Squier convinced CBS Sports to broadcast the Daytona 500 in \nits entirety. This event was a seminal moment for stock car racing in \nthe United States, later described by ESPN as ``NASCAR's most \nrevolutionary event,'' the one that convinced the national networks\n\n[[Page S209]]\n\nthat NASCAR had a very wide following around the country.\n  When he was 14 years old, Ken Squier announced his first race at a \nsmall dirt track in northern Vermont--from the back of a logging truck.\n  In 1960, he opened Thunder Road SpeedBowl, a quarter-mile racetrack \nin Barre, VT. In summer, the track has hosted stock car races every \nThursday night for the last 50 years. These events have become fixtures \nin the culture of northern Vermont.\n  As NASCAR developed a national following, Ken Squier became one of \nits most celebrated personalities. He pioneered the use of in-car \ncameras during broadcasts, putting viewers right next to the driver \nduring the race. Ken's voice became inseparable from the sport, \nproviding turn-by-turn coverage of all CBS-broadcast races for almost \ntwo decades. This included the sport's most prestigious event, the \nDaytona 500.\n  Ken Squier is not at all defined solely by his importance to racing. \nHe has deep roots in northern Vermont. In 1969, he became president of \nRadio Vermont, Inc., a family business that is one of the only \nindependent, family-run radio companies left in the United States. \nRadio Vermont's stations provide a variety of music, sports, and news; \nin particular, they focus on local events, the happenings that bind \ncommunities together and give them identity. Over the years, Ken has \nstaunchly opposed corporate consolidation of the media because he \nbelieves, strongly, that radio stations should serve the community and \nprovide vital conduits for local information. He has practiced what he \npreaches.\n  Radio Vermont's immense value to the communities it served was proven \nduring the aftermath of Tropical Storm Irene in August 2011. Irene was \nthe most destructive storm to hit Vermont in decades. Torrential rains \nand Vermont's mountainous terrain brought flooding on a vast scale, \nwiping out houses, businesses, and historic downtowns. Roads and \nbridges were washed away, cutting dozens of towns around Vermont off \nfrom the outside world. Ken and his staff, Eric Michaels, Lee Kittell, \nTom Beardsley, meteorologist Roger Hill, and others kept the station on \nthe air 24 hours a day in the weeks after the storm to ensure vital \nemergency information reached Vermonters in towns that had been cut \noff. With the State of Vermont's emergency communications equipment \nwashed away, Radio Vermont proved that local radio stations are \nfundamentally important to their communities.\n  Ken Squier has helped change sports in America, but even more \nsignificantly, he has been a true exemplar of a good citizen. Vermont \nis, and will remain, deeply in his debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S209-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING CATHERINE O'NEILL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring Catherine O'Neill, the great advocate for refugee women \nand children who died in Los Angeles last month at age 70. Cathy was my \nfriend and neighbor, and I will miss her.\n  Catherine was born in 1942 in Queens, NY, the daughter of Irish \nimmigrants Patrick and Bridget Vesey. After graduating from St. \nJoseph's College in Brooklyn and teaching as a Catholic missionary in \nTexas, she earned master's degrees in social work from Howard \nUniversity and in international affairs from Columbia.\n  Cathy had an extraordinary career as a social worker, writer, \neditorial director, businesswoman, and director of the UN Information \nCenter in Washington, DC. She was also active in political life, twice \nrunning for office in California and serving as finance director for \nGovernor Jerry Brown's 1976 presidential campaign, but she is best \nknown for her groundbreaking and heroic efforts to help refugee women \nand children.\n  In 1989, after visiting refugee camps around the world as a board \nmember of the humanitarian International Rescue Committee, Cathy became \na founder of the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, now \nWomen's Refugee Commission.\n  As the Commission's board chair, Cathy traveled the world to listen \nto refugee women and children and learn about their most pressing \nneeds. She attracted prominent women journalists, academics, and \nphilanthropists to the Commission and became a leading advocate for \nrefugee issues on Capitol Hill, at the UN, and in the media. Under her \nleadership, the Women's Refugee Commission has shaped policies and \npractices in the U.S. and around the world to address the needs of \nwomen and children displaced by war, persecution, and natural \ndisasters.\n  On behalf of the people of California, I send my gratitude and \ncondolences to Cathy's husband, Richard Reeves, her daughter Fiona \nReeves, sons Colin and Conor O'Neill, Jeffrey Reeves, her \ngrandchildren, and her sister Mary Ann Garvey. Catherine O'Neill was an \namazing person who made our world a better and more compassionate \nplace, and we will miss her dearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S209-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING FRANCIS JOSEPH CHASE\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a proud \nveteran, a committed Marylander, a great American, and my good friend, \nFrancis Joseph ``Frank'' Chase. Frank passed away on December 11, 2012 \nin his Columbia, MD home after a brief illness. He leaves behind his \nbeloved family: his wife of 50 years, Carole, a daughter Amy, and a \ngranddaughter Grace.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S209, January 23, 2013, the Record reads: . . . a \ndaughter Margaret . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . a daughter \nAmy . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Frank loved his country dearly, and he showed it through years of \npublic service, which began in 1955, when he entered the Army for 3 \nyears. Frank then joined the civil service, beginning at the Social \nSecurity Administration and later moving to the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, both in Baltimore. When he retired in January 1993, \nFrank left government service with far more than his Federal pension. \nFor at SSA and HCFA, he had honed expertise that would for many years \nguide him to continue, as a volunteer, to improve the lives of \nretirees, persons with disabilities, and others.\n  A man of boundless energy, Frank was a valued confidant and a member \nof my health advisory group for the past 20 years. With nearly perfect \nattendance at meetings and conference calls, he could always be counted \non for a warm greeting, sage advice, and wisdom born of compassion and \nclear-sightedness.\n  A graduate of Dartmouth College, Frank maintained strong ties with \nhis alma mater, serving terms as president of the Dartmouth Alumni \nAssociation and president of the Dartmouth Club of Maryland. He also \nserved his community through volunteer work at Common Cause of \nMaryland, United Seniors of Maryland, and the National Association of \nRetired Federal Employees.\n  Through his involvement in Maryland politics, Frank fought tirelessly \nfor fair election practices, propelled by the belief that, regardless \nof their views, all Marylanders deserved to have their voices heard. \nThrough my many conversations with him over the years, I discovered a \nman who loved democracy and justice, and who felt compelled to live his \nlife in service to these causes.\n  In closing, when I think of Frank, I am reminded of the words of \nRobert Frost in ``Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening'':\n\n     The woods are lovely, dark and deep.\n     But I have promises to keep,\n     And miles to go before I sleep,\n     And miles to go before I sleep.\n\n  Frank could have led a comfortable, quiet life after retirement, but \nhe chose instead to keep going for many more miles, working for the \ncauses he believed in deeply and the Nation he loved. Like all who were \nprivileged to know him, I will miss my dear friend Frank Chase, and I \nask you to join me in celebrating his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S209-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S209-4", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S209-S210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S210]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S210-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:43 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 307.

A bill to provide incentives for States to invest in practices \nand technology that are designed to expedite voting at the polls and to \nsimplify voter registration; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, we are no longer in an election year, which \nmakes this the perfect time for this Congress to take action on real \nand meaningful election reform. Regardless of which candidates we voted \nfor last November, we can all agree that in the world's greatest \ndemocracy, in the year 2013 we should put in place systems which ensure \nevery voter will be able to cast their ballot without unnecessary \ndelays, redtape, or restriction in our next elections. That is why I am \nlooking forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate, with \nleaders in State and local governments across the country, and with \nfolks in the U.S. Department of Justice to discuss ways we can reform \nour election process to make voting more accessible for more Americans.\n  In his second inaugural address delivered just this Monday, President \nObama made a point to tie voting rights to civil rights. President \nObama spoke of the long American march toward justice. He said:\n\n       And the first steps of that march--of the journey toward a \n     better, fairer, more equal society, one where every American, \n     regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation or \n     economic status, has the same shot at success--has always \n     started at the ballot box.\n\n  President Obama mentioned Seneca Falls, a central moment in the \nmovement for women's suffrage, and Selma, the emotional heart of the \nfight for equal access to voting rights for African Americans. He said:\n\n       Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to \n     wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.\n\n  He is right.\n  The 2012 elections were a wake-up call to those of us who treasure \nthe right to vote. All over our country--in blue States and red \nStates--Americans saw their fundamental right to vote eroded by \nexceptionally long lines, confusing rules, and widespread voting \nmachine malfunctions. There were problems in more than a dozen States \ndocumented in the media.\n  There were voting machine irregularities in Pennsylvania and \nColorado; error-ridden voter rolls in Ohio; delays counting ballots in \nArizona; voters waiting in lines 5 hours long in Virginia and 8 hours \nlong in Florida. We have to do better than this.\n  As Americans, the right to vote is in our DNA. So just days after \nthese 2012 elections, which had such widespread problems, I introduced \nthe FAST Voting Act, the Fair, Accurate, Secure, and Timely Voting Act, \nalong with Senator Warner and colleagues in the House, Congressman \nConnolly and Congressman Langevin.\n  Our bill challenges States to implement commonsense changes well \nbefore the next election. It would provide incentives and competitive \ngrants to those States that can turn around their poorest performing \npolling places, improve the administration of their elections, and make \nvoting faster and more accessible to all voters.\n  As a former county executive myself, I know States and local \ngovernments are laboratories of democracy. When it comes to \nadministering elections, many States and counties are getting it right. \nWe can learn from them and replicate their successes elsewhere in the \ncountry to ensure these same problems do not plague the next national \nelections.\n  For example, Florida was one of many States with rampant election \nproblems in 2012. There were long lines, limited early voting, and \nother issues that may have disenfranchised as many as 49,000 \nFloridians, according to a study by Professor Theodore Allen of Ohio \nState University.\n  Floridians such as Richard Jordan waited more than 3 hours in a line \nthat just was not moving to try and cast his ballot on election day \n2012. He had already worked a 10-hour shift that day. He was exhausted, \nhis back hurt, he was hungry, and ultimately in anger decided he could \nnot wait anymore. He simply gave up and walked away. He was denied the \nopportunity to cast his ballot by an unprepared, underresourced, or \njust incompetent election system.\n  On behalf of voters across the State such as Richard, earlier this \nmonth Florida's elections administrators presented Florida's Governor \nRick Scott with a list of reforms they would like to see implemented to \nprevent these problems from happening again. Governor Scott admitted \nthat his own State's election process was clearly in need of \nimprovement. He said he agreed with some of the election supervisors' \nproposals. In my view, this is a very positive step forward, and one \nwhich should be undertaken in every State where there is documented \nneed for stronger, fairer, faster, and freer elections.\n\n[[Page S218]]\n\n  In my view, the government can and should play a role in \nincentivizing that process to ensure that election improvements are \nmade to last. It can help States move forward in using available \ntechnology, and it can ensure States do a better job of enforcing laws \nthat are already on the books.\n  For example, the National Voter Registration Act, commonly known as \nthe motor voter law, requires States to allow voters to register when \nthey renew their driver's license at the DMV or at other governmental \nagencies. Yet there are substantial and credible allegations that some \nStates all across this country--whether blue, red, or purple--are not \nfulfilling their obligations under this act.\n  In talking with elections administrators from around the country, it \nis clear to me that compliance with existing law is not complete. We \nhave to do more to ensure voters are afforded the rights given to them \nunder current law and that State agencies are doing what is required to \nsimplify the registration process to maintain uniform and \nnondiscriminatory voter rolls and provide widespread registration \nopportunities. Enforcing existing law is just part of the solution to \nthe voting problems we saw across our country in 2012.\n  We also have to look forward at ways to deliver the best and most \nefficient voting process to all Americans. There is still much more we \ncan do to meet that goal, and I think part of the solution is the \nmechanism of the FAST Voting Act.\n  Our legislation focuses on cost-effective reforms, such as making it \neasier to register online and ensuring citizens who move to a new \njurisdiction can easily transfer their voter registration. If we use \nmodern technology that we already have at our disposal, we can make it \neasier for all eligible American citizens to cast their ballot and \nensure every vote is counted.\n  President Obama was right to mention election reform alongside the \nmost essential civil rights struggles in our country's history in his \ninaugural address on Monday. Making it harder for citizens to vote is a \nviolation of their civil rights. Long lines are just another form of \nvoter disenfranchisement. Running out of ballots can be just another \nform of voter suppression. The fact is access to vote is denied when \nregistration is cumbersome or inaccessible and when early voter vote-\nby-mail options are just not available.\n  Let's do something now when we are no longer hamstrung by election \nyear politics in the Senate so that changes that last and make a \ndifference can be implemented well before the next election.\n  As someone who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and who \noften speaks with foreign heads of State, civil society leaders, and \nvoting advocates from around the world, it is an embarrassment that in \n2012 our Nation could not overcome the simple challenges to ensuring \nfair and accurate elections all across our country.\n  If we ignore these assaults on America's civil rights that we saw \nlast November, we are certain to have to endure them the next time \naround. We cannot stand by and allow that to happen. Our democracy \nneeds to be a model to the rest of the world for how to ensure that \nevery citizen gets to exercise the right to vote.\n  Let's find a way to come together to put meaningful election reforms \nin place now before we deny one more American their fundamental right \nto vote for the candidate of their choice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 85\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of P.S. 103 in West Baltimore, Maryland, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Justice \nThurgood Marshall's Elementary School Study Act. The elementary school \nthat Justice Marshall attended, known as PS 103, located in my hometown \nof Baltimore, is a place of national significance because it marks the \nsite where one of our Nation's greatest legal minds began his \neducation.\n  Thurgood Marshall is well known as one of the most significant \nhistorical figures of the American civil rights movement. By the time \nhe was 32, he was appointed the chief legal counsel for the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP. He served at \nthe NAACP a total of 25 years and was a key strategist to end racial \nsegregation throughout the United States.\n  Perhaps the greatest illustration of this effort was his victory \nbefore the Supreme Court overturning the Plessy doctrine effectively \nending school segregation with the landmark decision in Brown v. Board \nof Education of Topeka, KS, in 1954. Not only did this case open up \neducational opportunity and sparked the civil rights movement in this \nNation, it also marked the beginning of Thurgood Marshall's career, \nstill a young attorney from Baltimore, as one of the greatest legal \nminds in all the land. This case was just one of the 29 cases he won \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Fittingly, Marshall was the first African American confirmed to the \nSupreme Court. He was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967 \nand served 24 years, until 1991. On the high court, Marshall continued \nhis fight for the Constitutional protection of individual human rights.\n  But Thurgood Marshall was not always a legal giant. He was once a \nyoung boy growing up in West Baltimore. He received the first 6 years \nof his public education at PS 103. An apocryphal story goes that a \nyoung Thurgood Marshall studied the U.S. Constitution in the basement \nof the building while serving detention. Regardless of whether or not \nthis is true, the building powerfully tells the story of racial \nsegregation in America, PS 103 was a ``blacks only'' school when \nJustice Marshall was a student, and marks the academic beginning of one \nof the country's most brilliant legal thinkers and a pioneer of the \ncivil rights movement.\n  The building is located at 1315 Division Street in the Upton \nNeighborhood of Old West Baltimore. The building is part of the Old \nWest Baltimore National Register Historic District, and is listed as a \ncontributing historic resource for the neighborhood. The Old West \nBaltimore historic district is one of the largest predominately African \nAmerican historic districts in the country, and its significance is \ncentered on the African American experience in the area.\n  In Baltimore, we are fortunate to have the National Park Service \noperate two historical sites, Fort McHenry and the Hampton Mansion. \nAdding PS 103 is a unique opportunity for the National Park Service to \nwork in Baltimore's inner-city and to reach out and engage people about \nAfrican American history.\n  Needless to say, Thurgood Marshall's legacy is one that should be \npreserved. He was one of our country's greatest legal minds and a \nprominent historical figure of one chapter of our country's great \nhistory--the civil rights movement. This bill authorizes the Secretary \nof the Interior to conduct a special resource study of PS 103 to \nevaluate the suitability and feasibility of establishing the building \nas a unit of the National Park Service. Preserving the building that \nwas Justice Marshall's elementary school will give Americans insight \ninto Justice Marshall's childhood.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                 S. 103\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act and the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965 to require certain creditors to obtain \ncertifications from institutions of higher education, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce two pieces of \nlegislation: the Know Before You Owe Act and the Fairness for \nStruggling Students Act. These bills will take critical steps toward \naddressing the student debt crisis facing America.\n  Every week my office is contacted by young people and their families \nwho share with me their horror stories about student debt. Many of them \nare college students or graduates who are getting crushed by student \nloans the size of mortgages. All too often, these young people were \nlured into attending worthless, for-profit colleges that left them with \nworthless diplomas and mountains of debt. It is disgraceful. But it is \nnot only young people facing this debt crisis, it is their parents, \ntheir siblings, even their grandparents who did them a favor by \ncosigning on these loans. They, too, are being held responsible when \nthe loans go into default.\n  Many of these people contact my office because they don't know where \nto turn. Their debt loan leaves them feeling helpless. They are putting \noff major life decisions such as buying a home or even starting a \nfamily because of crushing student debt. We can't stand idly by any \nlonger and ignore this reality. We have to step up and recognize that \nthis student debt bomb is ticking away.\n  Student loan debt among college students surpassed $1 trillion last \nyear. The New York Fed reports that balances of student loans have now \nexceeded the balances on automobile loans and credit card debt in \nAmerica--student loans. That makes student loans the largest form of \nconsumer debt outside of home mortgages.\n  Last year, 37 million borrowers held student loan debt. That is more \nthan 10 percent of the population of this country. The average balance \nis $24,300. But, remember, that is an average. This is a massive amount \nof debt, and it is having a profound impact on the lives of students \nand their families across America.\n  The overall growth in student debt is troubling. The most pressing \nconcern is what is known as private student loans. If a student goes to \ncollege, they could qualify for a government-guaranteed loan with \ndramatically lower interest rates with accommodations based on their \nemployment and even some loan forgiveness. Not so when it comes to \nprivate student loans in most cases. Students who take out Federal \nloans receive affordable interest rates, a lot of protections and \nrepayment options. Private student loans are totally different. Private \nstudent loans often have high variable interest rates, hefty \norigination fees, lack of repayment options, and, unfortunately, \ncrushing penalties.\n  In 2012 the amount of outstanding private student loans exceeded $150 \nbillion. Students are being steered into these private loans while they \nare still eligible for the better government loans. Why? Because \nsomebody is making more money when they sign up for private student \nloans. As a result, many students are being saddled with debt they \ndon't have to be saddled with and sometimes debt they can never repay.\n  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year reported that at \nleast 850,000 individual private student loans were in default \namounting to more than $8 billion.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about one of those students. I have opened \non my official Web site a place where those who have student loans and \nwant to share their stories can come. Anna Wilcox, who is 31 years old, \ndid. She attended the Brooks Institute of Photography, a for-profit \ncollege owned by the Career Education Corporation.\n  Anna Wilcox saw a TV ad one day about this so-called Brooks Institute \nof Photography and decided she would call and inquire. The school \ncalled her twice a day until she finally enrolled. The recruiter at the \nschool--this Career Education Corporation School--told her that a \nBrooks degree would help her make $85,000 a year as a photographer. So \nAnna enrolled, and when she graduated in 2006, she had a debt of about \n$170,000, almost all of it in private student loans.\n  Anna was 24 years old with $170,000 in student debt from this for-\nprofit school. With a variable interest rate that went as high as 18 \npercent, her balance just kept growing. Her monthly payments on her \nprivate student loan now exceed $1,000 a month. Her Federal loans she \ntook out as well had low interest rates. She said those payments are \nreasonable, and she can handle them. Her parents decided to help her \nout and cosigned on the loans. Now her parents, in their sixties, are \non the hook as well. They have to change their life plans because they \nwanted to help their daughter, and now they are stuck with a debt of \n$170,000 for a worthless diploma from a for-profit school.\n  Well, Anna did find a job, but the job doesn't pay anywhere near \n$85,000 a year. She just can't keep up with these staggering monthly \nloan payments. She said she would like to file for bankruptcy, clean \nthe slate, and start over. She can't borrow money to go to a real \nschool. She has wasted her borrowing power on these for-profit schools.\n  It doesn't do her any good to want to file for bankruptcy. Private \nstudent loans are not dischargeable for bankruptcy. If a person signs \nup as a college student for one of these student loans, it is debt that \nwill follow that person for a lifetime. There is no way to escape it. \nIt is something to think about long and hard when students make that \ndecision.\n  Anna is very blunt and despondent. She said she made a big mistake \ngoing to the school. It was a waste. She thought she would get a better \nlife by going to college. She didn't realize these for-profit schools \nby and large are a waste of money and cause debt that most students can \nnever pay back. She has bad credit now and a mountain of debt to show \nfor it.\n  So what are we going to do about it? Are we going to say: Well, Anna, \nyou should have been a little bit smarter when you were 19 years old \nand sat across the desk from somebody who said: We want you as a \ncollege student. You made your mistake, girl. That is the way it works \nin America, and now you have to pay the price. Is that the answer? Is \nthat the answer when these for-profit schools depend on the Federal \nGovernment and taxpayers for 85 to 95 percent of all of the revenue \nthey take in?\n  These for-profit schools, if we took the Federal money we send their \nway--if these for-profit schools were a Federal agency, it would be the \nninth largest Federal agency in America. That is how much money we are \npouring into these for-profit schools.\n  Let me just put three numbers out for people to reflect on: 12 \npercent of the students out of high school go to for-profit schools. We \nknow their names. They are students who gather in Washington and come \nto the galleries. They know what I am talking about. Go on the Internet \nand try to escape an ad for a for-profit school: University of Phoenix, \nDeVry, Kaplan. Ring a bell? Well, I can tell my colleagues these are \nthe biggies, but there are hundreds of them. Twelve percent of the \nstudents after high school go to for-profit schools.\n  For-profit schools, though, account for 25 percent of all of the \nFederal aid to education. They just soak it up. Students borrow and \nturn it over to the for-profit schools. The student is stuck with the \ndebt. The for-profit school may never graduate you, but they have their \nmoney.\n  There is a third number to remember. The first is 12, the second is \n25. The third number is 47. Forty-seven percent of the student loan \ndefaults in America are students from for-profit schools, students \nbeing dragged into these schools that charge way too much for tuition \nand then the student either can't finish the school or gets out of \nschool and can't find a job and they are stuck.\n  I tell my students back home, if you are not sure, start at a \ncommunity college. It is affordable. It has a wide array of courses to \nbe offered to you. You will learn a lot about yourself, you will learn \na lot about what you want to\n\n[[Page S221]]\n\ndo in school, and you will not end up sunk in debt like these for-\nprofit schools want to do to you.\n  We have to do something about Anna Wilcox's plight and many others \njust like her.\n  I wish to commend especially one community college in my State, the \nElgin Community College. I have been visiting that school regularly and \nalways come home thinking: This college gets it. They have implemented \na financial counseling program that goes above and beyond anything I \nwould put into law. All of the students at Elgin Community College in \nElgin, IL, must submit a monthly budget detailing all their costs when \nthey are seeking financial aid. The student then has a mandatory, one-\non-one meeting with a counselor to review the loan balance, the \nrepayment options, and what happens if they default. This community \ncollege has implemented a workshop for students who will be graduating \nduring the upcoming semester to discuss repayment options and give them \na complete summary of every loan they have taken out.\n  These students are facing debt the likes of which they have never \nseen in their lives. They are motivated by all of the preaching they \nhave heard from their parents, like me, saying: Go to school. Get a \ndegree. They are ready to sign up because they want to do what they \nthink is the right thing. They do not know that the for-profit school \nis worthless, they do not know that the thousands and thousands of \ndollars of debt will never be able to be repaid, and they do not know \nthat debt will be with them for a lifetime. So here are some bills I am \nintroducing to address it.\n  I believe students will benefit more if they have the kind of loan \ncounseling we see at the Elgin Community College. I am joining Senator \nTom Harkin of Iowa, chairman of the HELP Committee, in reintroducing \nthe Know Before You Owe Private Student Loan Act of 2013.\n  The legislation requires colleges to confirm a student's enrollment \nstatus, cost of attendance, and estimated Federal financial aid \nassistance before any private student loan can be approved for that \nstudent. In other words, if you are eligible for the government loan, \nfor goodness' sakes, take that first. The private student loan is much \nmore expensive, and it is tougher to pay it back. So we want to make \nsure students who are eligible for government loans know that before \nthey sign up for the private student loans. Often, students have not \neven applied for Federal aid before they are encouraged by some of \nthese schools to apply for private student loans, or students have not \nexhausted their eligibility for Federal aid. Requiring school \ncertification would give the school the opportunity to make students \naware of Federal student aid options and the most affordable options.\n  The bill would also require schools to counsel the students about \ntheir loan options. Schools would be required to inform students about \nthe differences between Federal student loans and private student \nloans, and they are stark and dramatic. For students who decide to take \nout private student loans, the bill would require lenders to provide \nthem with quarterly up-to-date information about their balance and \ninterest accrued. It is not one of these deals where you just keep \nborrowing and borrowing and borrowing, and finally when you are about \nto finish school--or years later--they give you the total, and you look \nat it and say: My goodness, I did not realize I had signed up for all \nof that debt.\n  This legislation is supported by a large coalition of educational, \nstudent, and consumer organizations and has been recommended by the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  The other bill I am reintroducing today is the Fairness for \nStruggling Students Act. This bill, cosponsored by Senators Whitehouse, \nFranken, Harkin, and Jack Reed, would restore the Bankruptcy Code's \npre-2005 treatment of private student loans.\n  As I said earlier, since 2005 private student loans have enjoyed a \nprivileged status under the Bankruptcy Code. They cannot be discharged \nin bankruptcy except under the most extreme circumstances. Only a few \nother types of debt cannot be discharged in bankruptcy--criminal fines, \nchild support, taxes, and alimony. In contrast, nearly all types of \nprivate, unsecured debt--credit card debt, doctor bills--are \ndischargeable in bankruptcy, but not student loans.\n  There was no good reason for Congress to give such preferred \ntreatment to these financial institutions that are peddling these \nprivate student loans. It was a provision--a sweetheart provision--\ntucked into a massive bankruptcy reform bill with very little debate \nand even less justification. There is no evidence that private student \nloan borrowers were abusing the bankruptcy system before this law was \nchanged. In fact, the private student loan market has been growing--\neven before this measure was enacted into law. But the private student \nloan industry got a sweetheart deal out of Congress, and now we are in \na situation where many students have overwhelming private student loan \ndebt, and they cannot repay, and they cannot escape. This is \ndevastating for those students and a drag on our overall economy.\n  There was an article a few months ago in the New York Times, and it \ntalked about a grandmother who was having her Social Security check \ngarnished because she had signed on as a cosigner of her \ngranddaughter's student loan. Her granddaughter dropped out of college \nand could not pay back the loan, and now we are going after grandma's \nSocial Security check. That is how serious this can be.\n  A large coalition of student, educational, civil rights, and consumer \norganizations support this bill. I hope we can move forward with \nlegislation this year. It is time to restore fairness to our Bankruptcy \nCode when it comes to student debt.\n  Let me be clear: When used appropriately, student loans are valuable \nand important. I would not be standing here today if I had not borrowed \nmoney from the Federal Government to go to college and law school. I \nnever could have afforded it otherwise. It was called the National \nDefense Education Act. If I told you the numbers that I borrowed, you \nwould realize how old I am. But at the time, it was scary to have that \nmuch debt coming fresh out of law school. I paid it back just like I \nwas supposed to so the next generation could take over. But what I \nfaced, the debt I incurred to go to school and law school, does not \neven come close to matching what many students have to borrow in the \nfirst semester, and that, unfortunately, leads to a debt that some will \nbe crushed with for a lifetime. In many instances, student loans help \nAmericans get a quality higher education and the job skills they need \nto repay their loans and have a rewarding life and career. But, \nunfortunately, there are far too many Americans who have been steered \ninto high-cost private loans that will burden them for life and prevent \nthem from fully contributing to our economy.\n  It is about time we woke up to the reality of what students--millions \nof students--across America are facing, and their families. We have a \nresponsibility to them over and above the profits that are being earned \nby for-profit schools and the financial institutions peddling these \nprivate student loans with these outrageous interest rates and terms. \nIt is time for this Congress to listen to working families and their \nkids all across America to restore transparency, fairness, and common \nsense to private student loans. I urge my colleagues to support these \nbills.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                 S. 113\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to revise and extend provisions under the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nMurkowski, Durbin, Collins, Tom Udall, Murray, Lautenberg, Blumenthal, \nCoons, Klobuchar, and Stabenow in the introduction of the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act Reauthorization.\n  This legislation is named for the son of Senator Gordon Smith, our \nformer colleague, who took his own life at the young age of 22. After \nthis tragedy, Senator Smith rallied support from members across the \naisle and in both chambers to prevent other children from doing the \nsame with passage of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act in 2004. Since \nthen, it has retained its bipartisan support among Members of Congress \nand over 40 member organizations of the Mental Health Liaison Group.\n\n[[Page S223]]\n\n  However, the recent horrific mass shooting in Newtown, CT shows that \nmore work must be done to address the mental and behavioral health of \nchildren and young adults before they hurt themselves and others. \nIndeed, what is so clear now from this terrible tragedy is that we have \nyoung people who desperately need help. Parents also need help in \nidentifying early warning signs of mental illness and accessing the \nappropriate treatment before it is too late.\n  The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act authorizes critical resources for \nschools, elementary schools through college where children and young \nadults spend most of their time, to be able to reach at risk youth. \nCurrently, this law supports 40 States, 38 tribes and tribal \norganizations, and 85 colleges and universities in their efforts to \naddress mental health and prevent suicides among their youth.\n  The bill my colleagues and I are introducing today would increase the \nauthorized grant level to States, tribes, and college campuses for the \nimplementation of proven programs and initiatives designed to address \nmental illness and reduce youth suicide. It will enable more schools to \noffer critical services to students and provide greater flexibility in \nthe use of funds, particularly on college campuses.\n  Suicide is now the second leading cause of death for adolescents and \nyoung adults age 10 to 24, up from the third leading cause of death in \nthis population just a few years ago, and results in 4,800 lives lost \neach year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nAdditionally, the CDC reports that 157,000 young adults in this age \ngroup are treated for self-inflicted injuries annually, often as the \nresult of a failed suicide attempt.\n  We can play a role in helping these children and their families. I am \npleased that President Obama and Vice President Biden recognized this \nand included in their Plan to Protect Our Children and Our Communities \nby Reducing Gun Violence a recommendation to increase support for young \nadults ages 16 to 25, a population with high rates of mental illness, \nsubstance abuse, and suicide that is unlikely to seek help. Indeed, \npassing the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act Reauthorization is one way \nwe can better address the mental health needs of this population.\n  My colleague, Chairman Harkin, will be holding a hearing on the \nstatus of the mental health system in our country tomorrow. I look \nforward to continuing to work with him and others to act on the \nPresident's recommendations to improve mental and behavioral health \ncare services, particularly for children and young people. This should \nbe something that we do automatically when it comes to the welfare of \nour children but is even more urgently required in the wake of the \nterrible recent tragedies in Connecticut and elsewhere.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Coburn, \n        Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Moran, and Mr. Cruz):\n  S. 122. A bill to promote freedom, fairness, and economic opportunity \nby repealing the income tax and other taxes, abolishing the Internal \nRevenue Service, and enacting a national sales tax to be administered \nprimarily by the States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about our Tax \nCode as well as our economic future. There is a problem with our Tax \nCode, one that hits home with nearly all Americans; that is, its \ncomplexity. In the past few years I have met with hundreds of \nconstituents who are worried about this issue. Individuals, small \nbusinesses, farms, and large corporations alike struggle with meeting \ntheir obligations to the IRS because of the complexity of our current \nTax Code.\n  Earlier this month the IRS Taxpayer Advocate revealed some startling \nfigures in the Agency's annual report to Congress. It estimates that \nindividuals and businesses spend 6.1 billion hours each year complying \nwith the IRS tax filing requirements. The complexity of the Tax Code is \nso burdensome that 9 out of 10 taxpayers now pay a professional \npreparer or use often costly commercial software to assist in tax \npreparation.\n  Then there is the problem with our corporate taxes. The United States \nhas the highest marginal effective tax rate among the largest developed \nnations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \nAccording to recent studies by the Cato Institute, that rate for U.S. \ncorporations is almost 36 percent. In fact, only Argentina, Chad, and \nUzbekistan have higher tax rates than does the United States. While the \nU.S. corporate rates have remained high, other countries are lowering \ntheir rates. Sweden, for example, has become the latest country to \nannounce that it will lower corporate tax rates, in part to help \nattract more foreign investment. Our corporate tax rates continue to be \nhigher than they should, and we lose our competitive advantage to other \nnations in part because of that high tax rate.\n  I want to talk about a way to fix both these problems. Since joining \nthe Senate, I have introduced in each new Congress the Fair Tax Act. \nToday I am reintroducing this legislation because of my belief that the \nFair Tax Act can fix the problems built into our current Tax Code. The \nfair tax will promote freedom and economic opportunity by eliminating \nour current archaic and inefficient Tax Code and replacing it with a \nsimpler, fairer means of collecting tax revenue. It will repeal the \nindividual income tax, the corporate income tax, capital gains taxes, \nall payroll taxes, self-employment taxes, and the estate and gift tax \nin lieu of a 23-percent tax on the final sale of goods and services. \nElimination of these inefficient taxing mechanisms will not only bring \nabout equality within our tax system, it will also bring about \nsimplicity. It will provide tax relief for business-to-business \ntransactions. These transactions, including those for used goods that \nhave already been taxed, are not subject to the sales tax, so there \nwould be no double taxation.\n  Some of my colleagues have asked how the fair tax would affect our \nrevenue on our entitlement programs. Social Security and Medicare \nbenefits would remain untouched under the Fair Tax Act. There would be \nno financial reductions to either of these vital programs. Instead, the \nsource of the trust fund revenue for these two programs would be \nreplaced simply by the sales tax revenue instead of by payroll tax \nrevenue.\n  Another question I get is how the fair tax would affect impoverished \nAmericans. Under the Fair Tax Act, every American would receive a \nmonthly rebate check equal to the spending up to the Federal poverty \nlevel, according to Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. \nThis rebate would ensure that no American pays taxes on the purchase of \nnecessities.\n  We have made nearly 5,000 changes to the Tax Code since 2001--I have \nsupported some of them, and I have not supported others--all in the \nname of improvement and economic benefit. I believe we can do better \nthan simply lowering our taxes. I know we can make a bigger impact on \nour economic future by ridding ourselves of a tax structure that is \nholding us back.\n  Ronald Reagan once said:\n\n       I believe we really can, however, say that God did give \n     mankind virtually unlimited gifts to invent, produce and \n     create. And for that reason alone, it would be wrong for \n     governments to devise a tax structure or economic system that \n     suppresses and denies those gifts.\n\n  With that statement, I could not agree more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S223-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S223-S225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 8--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT CONGRESS \n HOLDS THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO BORROW MONEY ON THE CREDIT OF THE UNITED \n         STATES AND SHALL NOT CEDE THIS POWER TO THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Moran, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Johnson of \nWisconsin, and Mr. Cornyn) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I am rising to submit a resolution making \nit absolutely clear that Congress, and only Congress, has the authority \nand responsibility to set the Federal debt limit. I should not even \nhave to submit a resolution such as this, but I feel it is absolutely \nnecessary.\n  Raising the Federal debt limit--the limit we place on government \nborrowing--as everybody knows, has been a hot topic around Washington. \nIt is a key issue for the start of the 113th Congress. It is another \ncase where if we could just maintain regular order, regular authority \nto address our problems, that is the best way for us to approach the \ntask of getting our fiscal house in order.\n  I know there is a lot of dispute over what breaching the limit means. \nThere is a lot of talk about that. It is clear a great deal of the \npublic and our financial markets are extremely concerned about the \nFederal Government's ability to meet its financial obligations once we \ndo hit the limit.\n  The President has asked for a very large increase in the debt \nceiling, and some in the administration have called for no limit at \nall. Others of the administration and in the House are calling for \nCongress to give up its authority to set the debt limit--rather \namazing--thus giving the executive branch unilateral authority to \nborrow. This is not a good idea.\n  If the Federal Government does not collect enough revenue to pay for \nall its spending obligations, it must borrow to make up the shortfall. \nEverybody knows that. We are borrowing now about 42 cents of every $1 \nwe are obligated to spend.\n  This is clearly--I think everybody would agree on either side of the \naisle and the public--an unsustainable situation which will only get \nworse if we do not begin meaningful discussions over our spending \npriorities, including--including--entitlement spending to strengthen \nand preserve those programs for future generations.\n  The national debt is growing. Everybody has seen that chart. It is \nabout $16.4 trillion. The total public debt outstanding at the end of \nthe third quarter just passed was $16.07 trillion. That is up from \n$15.86 trillion reported in June 2012. We are on the wrong path.\n  The Federal debt is now equivalent to at least 73 percent of the \nNation's gross domestic product--nearly double the level as a \npercentage of GDP that we had back in 1990. That is not too long ago.\n  According to some measures, there has been a 60-percent increase in \nthe debt limit since 2009. At the rate we are going, in a few short \nyears we will be spending more to pay interest on the debt than we will \non all discretionary programs outside of defense. Even defense now is \ngoing through a very difficult time with the sequester and has already \nbeen cut about one-half trillion dollars.\n  Let me just say that means no money for education. That means no \nmoney for agriculture. That means no money for the environment. That \nmeans no money for health care. It all goes to pay off interest on the \ndebt.\n  The Federal debt is the accumulation of this borrowing, including all \nbills, notes, and bonds issued by the Department of the Treasury.\n  The current statutory debt limit is $16.394 trillion, which was \nestablished on January 28 of last year, 2012--about 1 year ago--under \nthe procedures of the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n  According to the Department of the Treasury, as of December 31--just \nlast month--total debt outstanding subject to the limit was only $25 \nmillion--million; it used to be a lot of money--below the current \nlimit.\n  Once the amount of outstanding debt reaches the debt limit, the \ngovernment can no longer issue additional debt to cover the cash \nshortfalls needed to fund government operations and meet legal \nobligations.\n  Similar to the power of the purse, Congress's powers over borrowing \nare firmly rooted in our constitutional traditions. The Founders \nunderstood the potential danger of permitting the executive branch to \nunilaterally incur new public debt. Article I of the Constitution \nempowers only--only--Congress ``to borrow money on the credit of the \nUnited States.''\n  The debt limit is the means by which Congress--Congress--exercises \nthis critical legislative responsibility.\n  I can remember well that lesson, that lecture, if you will, from \nRobert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the institutional flame of the Senate, \nwho would have repeated that Congress cannot give debt limit authority \nto the executive, should not, cannot. It is not constitutional.\n  To implement this congressional prerogative, the amount of money the \nFederal Government is allowed to borrow is subject to a specific \nstatutory limit.\n  From time to time, Congress considers and adopts legislation to \nchange this limit and has done so more than 100 times since the first \nmodern debt limit was set way back in 1939, and we will do so again \nshortly. We have to.\n  So preserving this role and establishing the debt limit is vital to \nencourage deficit reduction and to uphold our constitutional tradition \nof legislative control over borrowing. Not only does the debt limit \nprovide an essential check on executive borrowing, it provides public \naccountability--everybody is talking about transparency--for Congress's \nborrowing and debt management practices. We cannot duck that \nresponsibility. We cannot pass this debt limit simply to the Executive \nand duck our responsibility and the public accountability.\n  In other words, debates over the debt limit, as difficult and as \ncontentious as they are--and they are; I know that--shed the light of \nday on the overall financial condition of the Federal Government. \nPrecluding these discussions by removing Congress's authority over the \ndebt limit would lead to a less well-informed decisionmaking over \nfiscal policy. That is probably the understatement of my remarks. It is \na nice way to put it.\n  We can do this. In the past, legislation to raise the debt limit has \nfrequently been coupled with legislation to reduce the overall Federal \ndebt and deficit. That is the way we should do it. These extensions, \noften approved on a bipartisan basis, have been important catalysts for \nfiscal reform. In this respect, the debt limit is a strong mechanism, a \nstrong tool, a way for Congress to evaluate fiscal policy and to \nmaintain control over such policy.\n  Abdicating this role would fundamentally alter the checks and \nbalances embedded in the Constitution. This is a power that should not \nbe bargained away.\n  The necessary and critical battle to control spending is far from \nover. I view the debt ceiling debate as a critical means in what has to \nbe an ongoing effort to tighten the government's fiscal belt--if we can \njust do that. But we cannot settle our national finances by \nfundamentally altering the constitutional structure and processes \ngoverning those finances. We cannot cavalierly give up one of our most \nimportant tools in evaluating and reining in the Federal Government's \nrunaway spending.\n  Equally clear, we cannot keep spending what we do not have. We must \ncontinue to fight for spending cuts, for debt reduction, and against \ntax increases and, I might add, the tidal wave of regulations that \ncontinue to pour out of Washington.\n  In response to calls to give up this vital congressional authority \nover debt issuance, I am submitting today a simple resolution. Let's \nput the Senate on record.

Res. 9\n\n       Whereas mentoring is a longstanding tradition in which a \n     dependable, caring adult provides guidance, support, and \n     encouragement to facilitate the social, emotional, and \n     cognitive development of a young person;\n       Whereas continued research on mentoring shows that formal, \n     high-quality mentoring focused on developing the competence \n     and character of the mentee promotes positive outcomes, such \n     as improved academic achievement, self-esteem, social skills, \n     and career development;\n       Whereas further research on mentoring provides strong \n     evidence that mentoring successfully reduces substance use \n     and abuse, academic failure, and delinquency;\n       Whereas mentoring, in addition to preparing young people \n     for school, work, and life, is extremely rewarding for the \n     people who serve as mentors;\n       Whereas more than 5,000 mentoring programs in communities \n     of all sizes across the United States focus on building \n     strong, effective relationships between mentors and mentees;\n       Whereas approximately 3,000,000 young people in the United \n     States are in formal mentoring relationships due to the \n     remarkable vigor, creativity, and resourcefulness of the \n     thousands of mentoring programs in communities throughout the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, in spite of the progress made in increasing \n     mentoring, the United States has a serious ``mentoring gap'', \n     with nearly 15,000,000 young people in need of mentors;\n       Whereas mentoring partnerships between the public and \n     private sectors bring State and local leaders together to \n     support mentoring programs by preventing duplication of \n     efforts, offering training in industry best practices, and \n     making the most of limited resources to benefit young people \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the designation of January 2013 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'' will help call attention to the critical \n     role mentors play in helping young people realize their \n     potential;\n       Whereas a month-long celebration of mentoring will \n     encourage more individuals and organizations, including \n     schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith \n     institutions, and foundations, to become engaged in mentoring \n     across the United States; and\n       Whereas, most significantly, National Mentoring Month--\n       (1) will build awareness of mentoring; and\n       (2) will encourage more people to become mentors and help \n     close the mentoring gap in the United States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of January 2013 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'';\n       (2) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the \n     millions of caring adults and students who are already \n     volunteering as mentors; and\n       (3) encourages more adults and students to volunteer as \n     mentors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S225-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S225-S226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 10--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n   GOVERNMENT OF ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA AND ITS ACTIONS RELATING TO THE \n                     STANFORD FINANCIAL GROUP FRAUD\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 10\n\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda has committed \n     numerous acts against the interests of United States citizens \n     and operated the financial sector and judicial system of \n     Antigua and Barbuda in a manner that is manifestly contrary \n     to the public policy of the United States;\n       Whereas 20,000 investors, including many United States \n     citizens, lost $7,200,000,000 in an alleged Ponzi scheme \n     involving fictitious certificates of deposit from Stanford \n     International Bank, an offshore bank chartered in Antigua and \n     Barbuda;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda violated the \n     order of the United States District Court for the Northern \n     District of Texas regarding the receivership proceeding \n     initiated at the request of the United States Securities and \n     Exchange Commission (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Securities and Exchange Commission''), in which the court \n     took exclusive control of all the assets owned by Allen \n     Stanford and Stanford-affiliated entities around the world \n     and documents relating to those assets;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda challenged \n     the authority of the United States District Court for the \n     Northern District of Texas by--\n       (1) initiating a separate and competing liquidation \n     proceeding for Stanford International Bank; and\n       (2) appointing liquidators who have defied the orders of \n     the court in multiple jurisdictions around the world by \n     litigating for control of hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     bank accounts in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Canada;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda challenged \n     the authority of the United States Department of Justice by \n     seeking to obtain control of hundreds of millions of dollars \n     in bank accounts in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and \n     Canada that had been frozen at the request of the Department \n     of Justice in accordance with multilateral criminal asset \n     forfeiture treaties;\n       Whereas the courts of Antigua and Barbuda have denied \n     recognition of the United States district court-appointed \n     receiver for all assets of Allen Stanford and Stanford-\n     affiliated entities;\n       Whereas the Stanford International Bank liquidators \n     appointed by the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeals now seek \n     recognition of the Antigua and Barbuda liquidation proceeding \n     as a foreign insolvency proceeding under chapter 15 of title \n     11, United States Code, in the United States District Court \n     for the Northern District of Texas;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda acknowledged \n     in a statement in March 2010 that--\n       (1) Stanford International Bank ``was operating in Antigua \n     as a transit point and for purposes of registration and \n     regulation''; and\n       (2) ``[t]he business of Stanford International Bank, Ltd. \n     was run from Houston, Texas, and its books maintained in \n     Memphis, Tennessee'';\n       Whereas Allen Stanford, the Stanford Financial Group, and \n     the Government of Antigua and Barbuda enjoyed a mutually \n     beneficial business relationship involving numerous economic \n     development projects and loans to the government of at least \n     $85,000,000, and forensic accounting reports have identified \n     those loans as having been made from Stanford International \n     Bank certificate of deposit funds;\n       Whereas, in June 2010, the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission alleged that Allen Stanford bribed Leroy King, the \n     chief executive officer of the Financial Services Regulatory \n     Commission of Antigua and Barbuda, to persuade Leroy King \n     to--\n       (1) not investigate Stanford International Bank;\n       (2) provide Allen Stanford with access to the confidential \n     files of the Financial Services Regulatory Commission;\n       (3) allow Allen Stanford to dictate the response of the \n     Financial Services Regulatory Commission to inquiries by the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission about Stanford \n     International Bank; and\n       (4) withhold information from the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission;\n       Whereas, in June 2010, the United States Department of \n     Justice indicted Leroy King on criminal charges and ordered \n     Leroy King to be extradited to the United States;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda has failed to \n     complete the process of extraditing Leroy King to the United \n     States to stand trial;\n       Whereas Dr. Errol Cort, who served as the Minister of \n     Finance of Antigua and Barbuda from 2004 to 2009, allegedly \n     received more than $1,000,000 of fraudulently transferred \n     Stanford investor funds either directly or indirectly through \n     his law firm, Cort & Cort;\n       Whereas Cort & Cort, the law firm of Dr. Errol Cort, served \n     as the official registered agent for Stanford International \n     Bank until June 2009;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda, along with \n     the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank--\n       (1) seized control and possession of the Allen Stanford-\n     owned Bank of Antigua without compensation to the United \n     States district court-appointed receiver;\n       (2) renamed that bank the ``Eastern Caribbean Amalgamated \n     Bank''; and\n       (3) allocated a 40 percent ownership position to the \n     Government of Antigua and Barbuda and 60 percent ownership to \n     5 Eastern Caribbean Central Bank member banks;\n       Whereas, after the fraud that the Stanford Financial Group \n     allegedly perpetrated was made public, the Government of \n     Antigua and Barbuda expropriated numerous Allen Stanford-\n     owned properties in Antigua and Barbuda worth up to several \n     hundred million dollars, and the government has not turned \n     over those properties to the United States district court-\n     appointed receiver;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda expropriated \n     without compensation the property known as the Half Moon Bay \n     Resort, which is owned by a group of 12 United States \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda--\n       (1) has sought and obtained loans from the International \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International \n     Development Association (commonly known as the ``World \n     Bank'') and the International Monetary Fund; and\n       (2) is the recipient of other direct and indirect aid from \n     the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) provision of all further direct or indirect aid or \n     assistance, including assistance\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\n     derived from Federal funds, by the United States Government \n     to the Government of Antigua and Barbuda should be suspended \n     until the Government of Antigua and Barbuda provides complete \n     redress of the issues described in the preamble, including \n     through--\n       (A) the full cooperation of the Government of Antigua and \n     Barbuda and any appointee of that government, including the \n     joint liquidators of Stanford International Bank, with the \n     United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the United \n     States Department of Justice, the United States district \n     court-appointed receiver, and the United States district \n     court-appointed Stanford Investors Committee, in \n     investigating the Stanford Financial Group fraud and \n     marshaling the assets of Allen Stanford and all Stanford-\n     affiliated entities;\n       (B) an agreement by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda \n     to be subject to the jurisdiction and bound by the judgment \n     of any United States court that adjudicates the claims \n     relating to the Stanford Financial Group fraud;\n       (C) the transfer of the assets seized by the Government of \n     Antigua and Barbuda, or obtained by the joint liquidators of \n     Stanford International Bank, to the United States district \n     court-appointed receiver for the benefit of victims of the \n     Stanford Financial Group fraud;\n       (D) a contribution by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda \n     to the United States receivership estate for the benefit of \n     victims of the Stanford Financial Group fraud, in an amount \n     equal to the amount of any funds that Allen Stanford or any \n     Stanford-affiliated entity provided to the Government or \n     government officials of Antigua and Barbuda;\n       (E) a contribution by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda \n     to the United States receivership estate for the benefit of \n     victims of the Stanford Financial Group fraud, in an amount \n     equal to any payments that Allen Stanford or the Stanford \n     Financial Group made to Leroy King or any other official of \n     the Government of Antigua and Barbuda for the purpose of \n     subverting regulatory oversight of Stanford International \n     Bank;\n       (F) the fulfillment by the Government of Antigua and \n     Barbuda of its obligations relating to the expropriation of \n     the Half Moon Bay Resort;

and\n       (2) the Secretary of the Treasury should direct the United \n     States Executive Directors of the International Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development and the International \n     Development Association (commonly known as the ``World \n     Bank'') and the International Monetary Fund to use the voice \n     and vote of the United States to ensure that any future loan \n     made by the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund to \n     the Government of Antigua and Barbuda is conditioned on \n     providing complete redress of the matters, and satisfaction \n     of the requirements, described under paragraph (1).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/23/senate-section/article/S226-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 11--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR PRAYER AT SCHOOL BOARD \n                                MEETINGS\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following resolution;
