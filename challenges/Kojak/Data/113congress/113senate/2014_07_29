Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 488, \nS. 2648, the emergency supplemental appropriations act dealing with the \nborder crisis.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 488, S. 2648, a bill \n     making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2014, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Following my remarks and those of the Republican leader, \nthe Senate will be in a period of morning business until 12 noon, with \nSenators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, with the \nRepublicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the \nfinal half.\n  At 12 noon, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider \nRobert Alan McDonald to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. to allow for \nweekly caucus meetings.\n  At 2:45 p.m. there will be a rollcall vote for confirmation of the \nMcDonald nomination, followed by several voice votes to confirm the \nAndre, Hoza, and Polaschik nominations.\n  Upon disposition of the Polaschik nomination, the Senate will \nconsider the Highway and Transportation Funding Act. Senators should \nexpect five rollcall votes this evening in relation to Wyden-Hatch, \nCarper-Corker-Boxer, Lee, and Toomey amendments and on passage of H.R. \n5021, as amended, if amended. Senators will be notified when those \nvotes are scheduled.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Measures Placed on the Calendar--S. 2673 and H.R. 3393\n\n  Mr. REID. There are two bills at the desk due for second readings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bills by title for the \nsecond time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2673) to enhance the strategic partnership \n     between the United States and Israel.\n       A bill (H.R. 3393) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to consolidate certain tax benefits for educational \n     expenses, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \n     improvements to the child tax credit, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. I would object to any further proceedings of these two \nmatters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bills will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                             Veterans' Care\n\n  Mr. REID. Almost 2 years ago, within a few days 2 years ago, we were \nin Las Vegas to dedicate this beautiful new veterans facility. \nTaxpayers' money spent on it was about $700 million. It is beautiful. \nIt is the second one we have been able to do in southern Nevada. We \nbuilt a nice little hospital with a joint venture between the Veterans \nAdministration and the Air Force.\n  But with the wars in Iraq, and Afghanistan, we ran out of room to \naccommodate the influx of veterans.\n  It became very difficult for veterans. We have a huge veterans \npopulation in southern Nevada. We have all kinds of military bases \nthere that they are stationed in. They come, and they decide they want \nto live in southern Nevada.\n  So the veterans in southern Nevada found themselves in a difficult \nsituation. When this new hospital was dedicated--it took 7 years of \nwork to get this done. I worked hard, as did others, to obtain this \nmoney. It was a state-of-the-art facility, 100 inpatient beds, a \nnursing home unit, and an ambulatory care center. It was a state-of-\nthe-art facility. It was unquestionably, probably without exaggerating, \nthe finest veterans hospital in the country. It was brandnew. But, more \nimportantly, it was a precious resource to veterans throughout the \nState of Nevada.\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\n  We have a facility in northern Nevada. It has been there for many \ndecades. To the credit of Senator Mikulski from Maryland, she came and \nvisited it a number of years ago and said: This is wrong. In that \nfacility we couldn't get the modern equipment down the halls and into \nthe bedrooms. We had to renovate, so it is in good shape. So the \nveterans in northern Nevada had a facility long before southern Nevada.\n  But in spite of all this happy talk about what a wonderful facility \nthis is, veterans depending on VA care have been stunned. Why? Because \nthey are waiting 50 days. If you are a new patient, you call and they \nsay: Well, we will see you in a couple of months. Come on in. About \n2,000 patients have been waiting 90 days in order to even get an \nappointment. This is unacceptable.\n  It is not a problem only in Las Vegas, it is all over the country: a \nnationwide, systemic problem where these combat veterans and other \nveterans have been languishing on some nonexistent waiting list.\n  When I learned that Bernie Sanders from Vermont and Congressman \nMiller had worked out something, I was stunned. I was so happy. I got a \ncall from Senator Sanders on Saturday telling me: I think we have got \nit done. That is wonderful. That is truly remarkable, what they have \ndone.\n  I don't need to go through the bill, what it does, but it provides \nbillions of dollars for emergency funding to hire new doctors and \nnurses. It will authorize 27 new medical facilities around the country, \nallowing the VA to grow as it needs to grow.\n  That is wonderful news. That is the way we should be legislating. We \ncouldn't find two more politically different people than Bernie Sanders \nof Vermont and Chairman Miller. They are very different people; they \nhave very different views. But they know we have sent hundreds and \nhundreds of thousands of people to Iraq and Afghanistan, when these \nveterans come home, they need help. We took care of the war efforts, \nand rightfully so. The military needed every penny they have to fight \nthese wars, but we haven't been as generous in taking care of these \npeople when they come home from these wars.\n  The main point I want to make is that Chairman Miller and Senator \nSanders understand we owe America's veterans.\n  It is good we are talking about this, rather than an impeachment of \nthe President or suing the President. Look in the papers today. The \nAmerican people are totally opposed. We shouldn't be off on these \ntracks of impeachment, suing the President. We should be legislating. \nAn exemplary standard of that is what I hope will be completed this \nweek when the conference report comes to us from the House to complete \nthis legislation. It is truly a good day for the American veterans and \nthe American people.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. America makes a promise to every man and woman who \nputs on the uniform. In exchange for their service, our country pledges \nthey will be well trained, well equipped, and treated with the dignity \nand respect they deserve.\n  It is the least we can offer to the brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines who put everything on the line so we can live in freedom. \nIt is a solemn pact, and that is why the American people were so \nshocked to read some of the headlines we have seen over the past few \nmonths, headlines such as: ``Veterans languish and die on a VA \nhospital's secret list.'' Then, as the Obama administration tried to \ncover its tracks, a headline such as: ``Veterans Affairs spies, \nstonewalls on people investigating it.''\n  It is a national disgrace, ailing veterans being put off for months \nby a hospital system that should be rushing to their aid, and veterans \ndying while waiting for care.\n  According to the government's own report on these failures, we also \nknow these problems were so systemic that they spread to more than \nthree-quarters of the VA facilities surveyed, literally to every corner \nof the country, including Kentucky.\n  Kentuckians heard shocking news stories such as the one about a \nHarrodsburg veteran who was being treated at the VA facility in \nLexington. The staff there declared him dead. Yet when the veteran's \nwife came to say her final good-byes, she found her husband breathing--\nwith a pulse.\n  I was glad to hear this veteran is now back home with his family and \nrecovering. But no veteran and no spouse should ever have to go through \nsuch a horrific ordeal. Yet I continue to receive letters from Kentucky \nveterans who have been denied the care they deserve, such as this one \nfrom a disabled veteran in Gradyville. This is what he had to say:\n\n       I have had some of the most frustrating of times trying to \n     receive the quality of health care that anyone deserves.\n       Not only has it taken me months to be seen, but I have been \n     told by a primary care physician that ``He did not need to \n     see me until my 6 month checkup''. . . . I simply no longer \n     have the time and money to invest in the run around I receive \n     in trying to make an appeal. . . . I gave up 4 years of my \n     life and proper use of my right arm in this nation's defense. \n     I would have given my life without question to protect a \n     country that I love. It breaks my heart to no longer be a \n     part of an institution I so lovingly became a member [of]. \n     Our nation's veterans deserve so much more.\n\n  Well, he is certainly right. Thousands of Kentuckians have had to \nwait for more than a month at VA facilities in Louisville and \nLexington.\n  So the Obama administration needs to use every tool available to \naddress the systemic failures of the VA, and it needs to work with \nCongress on reforms that can help address these challenges too.\n  Initially, the Obama administration was slow to respond to the \ncrisis. The White House tried to treat it as some PR predicament to get \nbeyond rather than the true tragedy that it was--a tragedy that \nrequired bipartisan action to investigate and address.\n  Ultimately, pressure from Republicans and revulsion from the American \npeople forced the White House to take this crisis seriously. Audits \nwere conducted. Management changes were undertaken. And the necessity \nof serious reform was accepted--eventually.\n  I was proud to support bipartisan VA reform legislation that passed \nthe Senate last month, and I am encouraged by the progress of the \nconference committee toward completing a final compromise that can pass \nCongress and be signed into law. The compromise legislation would \nintroduce some much-needed accountability into the VA system and help \nincrease patient choice. In fact, the compromise appears to include two \ninitiatives I specifically pressed with the President's nominee to head \nthe Veterans Affairs Department when I recently met with him.\n  One, I said we need to make it easier to fire VA bureaucrats who fail \nour veterans; and, two, I said we need to allow veterans to seek care \noutside the VA if they face long wait times or if they do not live near \na VA facility.\n  The conference report, fortunately, appears to include both. I thank \nSenators Burr, McCain, and Coburn for steadfastly fighting for the \nveterans choice part of the conference agreement that will allow our \ndeserving veterans the option of accessing care in hospitals when VA \nfacilities are not available.\n  As for the President's nominee to run the VA Bob McDonald, we all \nknow he has a tough job ahead of him after his confirmation. I made \nclear my expectations for dramatic change when I met him. But if Mr. \nMcDonald is willing to work in a collaborative and open manner with \nCongress--and I expect he will--he will find a constructive partner on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  Look, we know there is much we can and should do to address this \ncrisis together. So I am hopeful because when veterans are denied care, \nit is a priority deserving of bipartisan attention, and the government \nneeds to start living up again to the promises it made to our veterans. \nWe certainly owe them no less.\n\n\n                  Emergency Supplemental Appropriation\n\n  Mr. President, Israel's military campaign against the terrorist \norganization Hamas has a clear-cut objective: to restore Israel's \nsecurity by eliminating rockets, shut down these infiltration tunnels \nfrom which Hamas is launching its attacks against Israel, and, indeed, \nto demilitarize Gaza. That is Israel's objective.\n  This is clearly justified in the face of more than 2,300 rocket \nattacks into\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\nIsrael from Gaza since early July. I strongly support Israel's recent \nefforts through Operation Protective Edge to defend itself and to end \nthe threat of additional rocket and infiltration attacks by Hamas. \nOperation Protective Edge also serves a larger purpose, and its \nresolution has broader implications for the future of the Palestinian \npeople.\n  If Hamas declares victory by keeping its weapons stockpile, by \ncontinuing to undermine Israel's security, and by turning away from \nEgypt's efforts to forge a reasonable cease-fire, the net result will \nbe a relative weakening of the Palestinian Authority and of those in \nthe West Bank who have worked toward a peaceful resolution of the \noverall conflict.\n  So I support any effort which brings this campaign to an end in a \nmanner that increases Israel's security. That means specifically that \nHamas cannot be left with a large stockpile of missiles and rockets and \ncannot be left with infiltration tunnels. They must be destroyed. Hamas \ncannot be allowed to aggressively rest, refit, and build up a weapons \nstockpile. That weakens Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\n  Here is what I oppose. I oppose any efforts--any efforts by the \ninternational community, especially the United Nations--to impose a \ncease-fire on Israel that does not meet these military objectives and \nthat therefore risks actually rewarding Hamas for a campaign of terror \nand that seeks to make additional concessions to Hamas such as easing \nsecurity along the borders of Gaza.\n\n  An unfavorable settlement, especially one that left the terrorist \ngroup Hamas with a stockpile of weaponry, would create incentives for \nHamas to continue smuggling arms from Iran and, of course, to return to \nviolence. An unfavorable settlement would also undermine the leadership \nof the Palestinian Authority, which has attempted to negotiate with \nIsrael through peaceful means.\n  So let's be clear. The terror tactics employed by Hamas show contempt \nfor human life, whether Israeli or Palestinian. By employing rockets \nand mortars as weapons of terror against Israel's civilian population \nor by using its own schools within Gaza as weapon depots, Hamas has \nshown a gross disregard for civilians.\n  The Prime Minister of Israel put it very well when he said: \n``[Israel] uses missiles to protect our people. They (Hamas) use their \npeople to protect their missiles.''\n  There is no moral equivalency--none whatsoever. These tactics should \nbe loudly and widely condemned, and Israel's right to defend itself \nshould be affirmed.\n  As I noted last week, Secretary Hagel wrote to the majority leader \nseeking urgent funding for components of the Iron Dome missile defense \nsystem. I and others support this request, as Iron Dome has afforded \nIsrael some real protection from these indiscriminate rockets.\n  This morning some of my colleagues will further explain the \nimportance of Iron Dome and the need for the Israeli Defense Forces to \npress on and finish the job in destroying the infiltration tunnels and \nweapons stockpiles. Republicans are united in our support of Israel's \ndefense, and this morning my colleagues will explain our opposition to \nany effort to force a cease-fire on Israel that does not further its \nsecurity objectives.\n  In a situation such as this, Israel only has one dependable friend. \nThe United States should not be trying to pressure Israel to make a bad \ndeal that leaves Hamas in a position to continue these attacks against \nIsraeli civilians.\n  No one has been more active on this issue than my colleague from \nSouth Carolina. I see him on the floor now. Therefore, I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5007-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will be \nin a period of morning business until 12 noon, with Senators permitted \nto speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, and the time equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with \nRepublicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the \nfinal half.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I return the compliment to Senator \nMcConnell from Kentucky, the Republican leader.\n  I have been here now since 2002. There is no better friend of the \nState of Israel than Mitch McConnell. He is the former chairman and \nranking member of the foreign ops subcommittee on appropriations that \ndeals with aid to the world--particularly Israel--and it was his idea \nto come to the floor today and have voices speak in support of Israel \nat a time when they need friends.\n  Friends are great to have. They are wonderful in good times. They are \na necessity in bad times. Israel is going through some pretty bad times \nand so are the Palestinian people.\n  I wish to clearly make myself known. I have nothing against the \nlegitimate hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people to have \ntheir own country, to live in peace and prosperity by Israel. But they \nhave to want it more than I do.\n  The Palestinian people are suffering. Children are being killed, and \nthe most innocent people on the planet are children. It breaks all of \nour hearts to see them as a casualty of war.\n  But now is the time to be clear-eyed and focused as to what the \nproblem really is. The problem is very simple in many ways. Hamas is a \nterrorist organization in the eyes of the U.S. Government. Hamas should \nbe a terrorist organization in the eyes of any decent person in the \nworld.\n  What did they do? They have as their goal not a two-state solution \nbut a one-state solution--the complete and utter destruction of the \nState of Israel. If you don't believe me, just check out their own \ncharter. They have as their tactics using their own people and children \nas human shields to win a propaganda war.\n  When Israeli children are killed, it breaks Israel's heart. When \nPalestinian children are killed, it breaks the heart of all decent \nPalestinians, but Hamas sees it as a victory. They literally try to put \nwomen and children in harm's way to marginalize the ability of Israel \nto defend itself against two things.\n  The tunnels are something new in this fight. Forty-one tunnels have \nbeen discovered that go from the Gaza Strip--some into Israel itself--\nand yesterday five Israeli soldiers were killed by an attack that came \nfrom Hamas fighters that penetrated Israel through the tunnels.\n  So Senator McConnell is not only speaking for Republicans when he \nsays the Senate stands firmly behind Israel's right to destroy the \nterrorist tunnels, but I think that is the body's view and Democrats' \nas well.\n  There is a resolution that is bipartisan in nature before the body, \nand I hope we can pass it before Thursday. In the resolved clause, it \nsays the Senate opposes any efforts to impose a cease-fire that does \nnot allow the Government of Israel to protect its citizens from threats \nposed by Hamas rockets and tunnels. That, I believe, is the view of the \nSenate in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Today, Republicans take the floor to clearly state where we stand in \nthis conflict. We stand with Israel's right to defend itself against a \nterrorist organization called Hamas. We stand with the Palestinian \npeople's legitimate aspirations to have a better life. But until that \nday comes, we are going to be firmly in the Israeli camp to defend \nthemselves, because what would we do as a nation if a neighboring \nnation dug tunnels under our border for the express purpose of \nkidnapping and killing our citizens. What would America do if one \nrocket coming from a neighboring nation fired indiscriminately to kill \nAmerican citizens? We would respond in the most aggressive fashion, and \nwe would have every right to do so.\n\n  As the minority leader stated, there is no moral equivalency. Israel \ntells you they are going to attack. Israel calls before the attack. \nIsrael gives notice about an impending attack. Hamas secretly fires \nrockets, caring less where they land. Their hope is that it hits a \nkindergarten. That is their desire. And the only reason they have not \nbeen successful is because of the Iron Dome program that has been a \ncollaboration between the United States and Israel for many years.\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\n  There has been discussion about appropriating additional dollars for \nIron Dome. That discussion needs to turn into a reality. We don't need \nto marry it with controversial topics. Israel is under siege. We are \nthe best friend of the State of Israel. They need this assistance. \nEvery Republican stands ready to work with every Democrat to pass--in \nthe next 5 minutes--additional money for the Iron Dome program.\n  In tough times, what is the smart thing and right thing for America \nto do? The smart thing for America to do is pursue a lasting peace, a \npeace with meaning, and not repeat the mistakes of the past. Insanity \nis doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. \nIsrael is beyond that moment. America needs to stand by Israel's \nlegitimate right to get to the heart of the problem and not face this \nthreat 6 months or 1 year from now.\n  The one thing I can tell you that is not a smart thing to do is to \ngive Hamas a bunch of concrete. They are not going to build schools \nwith it; they build tunnels. All the aid the international community \nhas been providing to the Gaza Strip, through the hands of Hamas, has \nnot gone into building hospitals, schools, and the economic improvement \nof the lives of Palestinians but to create tunnels of war. The tunnels \nare weapons of war. The thousands and thousands of tons of concrete and \niron that have been misappropriated to build these tunnels came from \npeople with a good heart.\n  How long does it take the international community to wake up to the \nfact that Hamas has a bad heart--an evil, wicked heart. They could care \nless about their own people. They want to destroy Israel.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We all remember that 10 or 12 years ago Israel--which \nhad previously occupied Gaza for the purpose of preventing these types \nof devastating attacks--left. They said: We are through. They made a \nsolid statement and said: We are uncomfortable occupying, and all we \nask in return for the removal of our occupation is a peaceful border.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has just outlined that periodically \nthis is what they have gotten in return for basically leaving Gaza \nalone and giving it a chance--if it chose to--to have a normal, \npeaceful existence. Yet they choose to continue the conflict, as the \nSenator from South Carolina indicated, because they are not in favor of \na two-state solution; they are in favor of a one-state solution.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Senator McConnell is dead on point--land for peace. Give \nthe Palestinians land and in return Israel gets peace. They gave the \nGaza Strip to the Palestinians, and what have they gotten in return? \nThey got 2,500 rockets in the last 3 weeks and terrorist tunnels.\n  The idea that leaving an area will lead to peace in the Middle East \nwith the Palestinians has not borne fruit. What to do? No. 1, pass more \nappropriations for Iron Dome because it is the right and smart thing to \ndo.\n  No. 2, pass a resolution saying we oppose any cease-fire that does \nnot allow Israel to get to the heart of the problem when it comes to \nterrorist tunnels and dealing with the rocket threat against their \ncountry.\n  No. 3, push back against the United Nations that has lost its moral \nway. The Human Rights Commission--which is a subcommittee, for lack of \na better term, of the United Nations--passed a resolution 27 to 1 about \nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Gaza, and I will read the first \nparagraph:\n\n       Deploring the massive Israeli military operations in the \n     Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, \n     since 13 June 2014 that have involved disproportionate and \n     indiscriminate attacks and resulted in grave violations of \n     the human rights of the Palestinian civilian population, \n     including through the most recent Israeli military assault \n     on the occupied Gaza Strip, the latest in a series of \n     military aggressions by Israel, and through actions of \n     mass closures, mass arrests and the killing of civilians \n     in the occupied West Bank.\n\n  This resolution is 1,600-and-something words, and it has a half \nsentence about rockets against Israel and nothing about the tunnels and \nnever mentions Hamas.\n  The third thing I would like this body to do, through a letter of \nresolution, is let the United Nations know we condemn this one-sided \nview of the conflict and that we find the Human Rights Commission \nreport objectionable and, quite frankly, immoral.\n  The vote was 27 to 1, and we were the only nation that objected to \nthis resolution, which I think should make every decent person in the \nworld feel the shame of the United Nations.\n  I thank our leader on the Republican side for creating this \nopportunity and allowing us to speak on this issue, and I thank him for \nhis longstanding support for the State of Israel.\n  I close with this thought: In times of trouble, try to do the right \nthing and the smart thing, and they both come together on this issue. \nThe right thing to do is to stand by your friends in Israel; the smart \nthing to do is to stand by your friends in Israel. The right thing and \nthe smart thing to do is to oppose Hamas, which has a wicked heart, and \nallow Israel, once and for all, to fix this problem by demilitarizing \nGaza and dealing with the tunnels and the rockets.\n  As Senator McConnell said, Israel has tried cease-fires time and time \nagain without dealing with the military threat they face. Not this \ntime. When Israel says never again, they are referring to the \nHolocaust. America needs to stand with Israel and Israel should say to \nHamas: Never again will we allow a cease-fire that allows you to dig \ntunnels under our borders to kidnap and kill our citizens, and never \nagain will we allow you to rearm and rain holy terror on our people \nthrough thousands of rockets being fired at innocent civilians.\n  Now is the time for the Senate to say with Israel, never again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, briefly before Senator Ayotte takes the \nfloor, I wish to commend Senator Graham for his suggestions. All three \nof those suggestions should be carried out this week. Time is of the \nessence.\n  In listening to the litany of actions by the Palestinians that he \nrecounted--and we all remember, going back almost to the founding of \nthe State of Israel--I am reminded of what one of Israel's early \nForeign Ministers once said about the Palestinians. He said the \nPalestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Sad but true.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Sad but true. I recall when Prime Minister Barak was \nin office at the end of the Clinton years. The administration brokered \na deal that Israel at that time was willing to offer and Palestine said \nno. It was a deal they probably could not get today.\n  We have seen a litany of opportunities wasted over the years, and the \npeople who suffered as a result of it have obviously been the \nPalestinian people.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely. With that, I will turn over the debate to my \ngood friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, Ms. Ayotte, who has been \none of the leaders on our side on foreign policy and is a steadfast \nally of our friends in Israel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleagues, the Senator from South Carolina \nfor his leadership and our leader, the Senator from Kentucky, for the \nincredible work he has done in supporting our great friend Israel and \nalso leading this body in terms of the issues he has brought forward, \nnot only in supporting important protections, such as the Iron Dome \nprogram, but also by ensuring America remains safe and strong. I thank \nSenator McConnell very much for his leadership.\n  I rise because I had the privilege in March of traveling to Israel. I \nwent there not only to meet with the leadership in Israel but I had the \nopportunity to meet with some of the Palestinian leadership as well.\n  I went to Sderot, which is a town in Israel. I was very much struck \nby what the Israelis are facing every day and the threat they face from \nHamas, a terrorist organization. Go to a town such as Sderot and \neveryone in their household has a bomb shelter. I met with mothers \nthere whose children feel traumatized because they never know when the \nnext potential rocket may be coming toward their town, and it has very \nmuch affected their children. It has affected them so much so that when \none\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\ngoes to the playground where the children play, the playground itself \ncontains a bomb shelter. There is a caterpillar which looks like \nsomething your kids would play in, but it is actually a bomb shelter \nbecause this town in Israel has been facing rockets from Hamas. That is \nwhat we need to understand in this conflict: Hamas, a terrorist \norganization, has not only used its own civilians, the Palestinians, as \nhuman shields but they have also continued to threaten the children of \nIsrael so much so that their playgrounds have bomb shelters.\n\n  What is happening right now in this conflict is that Israel is trying \nto defend itself against the threat of rockets from Hamas which \nthreaten their children and the Palestinian children, who unfortunately \nhave been put in harm's way by this terrorist organization, Hamas.\n  They are facing a new threat. Can you imagine if we were faced with a \nthreat where terrorists could pop up through a tunnel and suddenly \nterrorize the people in this country? Can you imagine what we would do \nunder the same circumstance? That is the threat the Israelis are facing \nright now. They need to eliminate these tunnels to ensure that their \npeople can be protected from this threat.\n  How did they build these tunnels? They actually built some of these \ntunnels by using concrete the Israelis let the Palestinians have for \nbuilding places such as schools, and instead Hamas has taken this \nconcrete and used it to build terror tunnels to allow them to either \nkidnap or kill Israeli citizens.\n  We stand with the people of Israel and their right to defend \nthemselves against this terrorist organization Hamas and the terror it \nhas brought upon not only the country of Israel but also the terror it \nhas brought to the Palestinian people and how Hamas stands in the way \nof peace in the region overall.\n  We also stand against the hypocrisy we have seen on many levels, and \nthat hypocrisy and double standard has been most apparent in the U.N. \nHuman Rights Council and the recent resolution passed by that council. \nI have to wonder why that council exists in the United Nations because \nthey have countries such as China, Cuba, Russia, and Venezuela issuing \na resolution condemning Israel for what is happening in this conflict \nbut in no way even mentioning Hamas or what Hamas is doing to use \ncivilians as shields and basically as targets so they can try to get \nsupport from the international community.\n  The opposite is happening in terms of what Israel is doing. There is \nsuch a contrast. Israel is taking steps to notify civilians if there is \ngoing to be a missile launched in their area. They have warned \ncivilians to leave areas. They have taken extraordinary steps to \nprotect civilian lives in contrast to what Hamas is doing; they are \nusing civilians as shields.\n  We condemn in this body very clearly what the Human Rights Council \nhas done. The notion that we are going to follow what China, Cuba, \nVenezuela, and Russia tell the world, which is their view on human \nrights--and they don't even mention the actions of a terrorist \norganization that is at the root of the conflict we see right now in \nGaza--talk about the situation where the fox is watching the henhouse. \nThat is what has happened with this human rights council. Frankly, this \ncouncil, in my view, should be eliminated because it is the opposite of \nstanding for human rights; it is for standing for terrorist \norganizations such as Hamas.\n\n  I stand with the recommendations of my colleague from South Carolina \nand our leader that we need to absolutely condemn the human rights \ncouncil. We need to reaffirm in this body this week before we leave our \nsupport for Israel's right to defend itself and to eliminate the threat \nthese tunnels present to the Israeli people, and, frankly, also to the \nPalestinian people as well, and to allow them to finally address this \nthreat from this terrorist organization Hamas.\n  Until this threat is eliminated, there can be no peace in this \nregion. There cannot be peace for the Israeli people and there cannot \nbe peace for the Palestinian people. So it is my hope that we will take \nthis up this week and make sure we clearly send a message to Israel; \nthat we stand with Israel, that we clearly send a message to the U.N. \nthat we are not going to accept the hypocrisy of the human rights \ncouncil; that we clearly send a message to Hamas: We know who you are. \nYou are a terrorist organization. Stop using civilians to try to \naccomplish your purpose and we stand with you.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may before Senator Ayotte leaves \nthe floor, I commend her on her contribution to this discussion and \nparticularly with her stories with regard to Israel, and I would also \nadd that I am sure the Senator from New Hampshire agrees with me that \nthe last thing the American Government needs to do right now is try to \npressure Israel into a bad cease-fire that doesn't allow this terror to \nbe stopped.\n  At times it appears to me that the American administration is trying \nto push the Israelis into stopping before they have finished the job. \nWe all know, based on past history, that unless this operation is \ncompleted, these challenges will continue.\n  I wanted to see if the Senator from New Hampshire shared my view.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would fully share the Senator's view. In order to end \nthis threat we need to support Israel and its right to eliminate the \ntunnels, to address the missiles and eliminate missiles and the stash \nthat Hamas has that they are targeting Israel with--which, by the way, \nwould have had many more civilian casualties but for the Iron Dome \nsystem that we have supported and worked with Israel on.\n  Finally, we need to get to a point where Gaza is demilitarized and \nthey are put in a position where this threat cannot continue. That is \nwhat we need to get to thinking about. But we need to allow Israel to \ndeal with the threat of these tunnels and the missiles so the children \nin Sderot will not continue to be targeted, so children--not only \nIsraeli children but also Palestinian children--can live in peace in \nthe region. That cannot happen when Hamas continues to be a terrorist \norganization that threatens all children in the region.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to end on what my colleagues, the \nSenator from Kentucky and the leader, Senator McConnell, say. Senator \nGraham, Senator Ayotte, and I appreciate Senator McConnell's leadership \nin making very clear what is at stake here, pushing hard to make sure \nthat the Senate is doing its job in support of Israel, making sure they \nare able to defend themselves and the funding for the Iron Dome which \nhas been so effective as a defense mechanism against these rocket \nattacks is done in a way that allows them to continue to use it in that \ncapability.\n  As you look at the situation in Gaza, I want to start by taking a \nstep back and looking at this conflict in both the historic and \nregional context. In Israel we have the only functioning democracy in \nthe Middle East. Israel is a nation that emphasizes human rights and \ntolerance. Its population includes religious, ethnic, and cultural \ndiversity. In Jerusalem you can hear the Muslim call to prayer, the \nbells from Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, and the prayers of the \nJews at the Wailing Wall all at the same time. There is no other place \nlike this on Earth.\n  This democracy, however, is situated in a region of intense brutality \nand extremism. Historically that has meant seemingly endless conflicts \nwith Israel's neighbors, intentionally targeting civilians in order to \nmaximize casualties. One need only look across the border into Syria to \nget a glimpse of this brutality. When Syrians made the first attempt at \nstriving for democracy, the Assad regime began systematically \nslaughtering opponents, including gassing civilians with chemical \nweapons. As that violence spread into Iraq, radical terrorist \norganizations such as ISIS began killing not only Shia opponents but \nalso other Sunni clerics who would not swear allegiance to ISIS. \nCommunities with ancient traditions such as the Christians in Mosul, \nwho just 10 years ago numbered 60,000, have been forced to flee for \ntheir lives. Mosul has been completely emptied of Christians for the \nfirst time in 1600 years.\n  It is in this context the people of Israel have built their nation. \nIt is in this context that we now view the conflict in Gaza. The \ncurrent conflict in\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\nGaza is one that Israel did not start. It started with Hamas firing \nover 2300 rockets from Gaza into Israel, specifically targeting \ncivilian populated areas to maximize potential casualties. In response, \nIsrael has conducted a methodical and enforceable response, as you \nwould expect any nation to do. First Israel locates the source of the \nrocket. Then an attempt is made to call the residents by phone to tell \nthem to evacuate. In many cases a flare is sent onto the roof as a \nwarning that the location is about to be hit, before that location is \nultimately destroyed.\n  In a region where neighboring leaders indiscriminately drop barrel \nbombs on residential areas for the sole purpose of slaughtering \ncivilians, Israel goes out of its way to save lives. These are not just \ncivilian lives Israel is saving, because they know that by their \nefforts they are giving the aggressors a chance to escape as well.\n\n  After Hamas continued to launch rockets into Israel, even when Israel \nagreed on multiple occasions to cease fire, tunnels were used to insert \ncombatants near Israeli settlements. Israel responded with a ground \nassault to destroy the tunnels and eliminate Hamas's stockpiles of \nweapons. As the attacks and rocket launches continue, it is \nunderstandable that Israel would want to seek out and destroy \nstockpiles of weapons to keep the cycle from being repeated a few \nmonths from now.\n  Like all of my colleagues on the floor today, I want to see peace in \nthe Middle East. Specifically I want to see peace in the Gaza and West \nBank. I want to see peace in such a way that the Palestinian people can \nlive with the prospect of a better life. But as we have seen, peace is \nnot possible when a terrorist organization continues to pursue its \ncause of annihilating Israel. Peace cannot be achieved while Hamas \nrejects cease-fire agreements and continues to fire rockets. As violent \nas the current conflict in the Gaza strip is, it would be far worse--it \nwould be far worse--if Israel did not have the Iron Dome. In any \nconflict, civilian casualties are a tragedy and if Israel did not have \nthe sophisticated, purely defensive weapons system that allows it to \nshoot these rockets out of the sky, the number of civilian casualties \nwould be far greater.\n  Hamas does not drop leaflets telling civilians to evacuate. Hamas \ndoes not send flares to warn residents to get out of harm's way. If not \nfor Israel's Iron Dome, civilian casualties in Israel would be \nstaggering. The United States must continue to support Israel by \nensuring that Iron Dome missile defense systems remain an effective \ndeterrent to even greater civilian casualties. For as long as Israeli \nmen, women, and children need to run to bomb shelters ahead of Hamas \nrocket attacks we must support Israel's ability to defend itself.\n  The United Nations Council on Human Rights and other countries around \nthe world continue to do things that are consistently at odds with the \nfacts and with reality. Here in the United States we need to do as my \ncolleague from South Carolina said, the right thing and the smart \nthing, and in this case, the right thing and the smart thing are one \nand the same. So I hope my colleagues in the Senate will make a \npriority providing the necessary funding for Iron Dome and in standing \nunited--united--behind our ally and our friend Israel as they defend \nthemselves from these attacks.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Texas is on the floor, and I \nwould simply ask him what role he sees the United States playing in \nboth supporting Israel and providing support for the Iron Dome.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I am pleased and saddened to stand here in \nsupport of my colleagues as we stand united in support of the Nation of \nIsrael.\n  In the last several weeks over 2500 rockets rained down over the \nNation of Israel. Eighty percent of the population had to flee what \nthey were doing and run to bomb shelters to hide--moms, dads, children. \nWhen the alarm goes off they have sometimes 10, 15 seconds to get to a \nbomb shelter.\n  I want you to imagine if the same situation were happening in \nAmerica. Imagine if 80 percent of this country in the last several \nweeks had run to a bomb shelter. Imagine if 240 million Americans in \nthe last several weeks had been sitting at work or in the doctor's \noffice or having breakfast and had to grab their children and run in \npanic toward a bomb shelter. Imagine what our country would be doing in \nresponse.\n  In recent weeks we have discovered that Hamas has opened a new \nchapter in the annals of terrorism. It is not just raining rockets down \nfrom on high, but it is now attacking from below. Some 32 full-scale \nterror tunnels have been discovered dug under the ground under the \nborder and coming up in kibbutzes inside Israel along Gaza. Some of the \ntunnels come up inside kindergartens. We have discovered in recent \nweeks a terrifying plot that was underway for Hamas terrorists on Rosh \nHashanah to come through those tunnels--hundreds of them--to emerge in \nkindergartens to kidnap and murder vast numbers of young Jewish \nchildren.\n  Imagine right now if enemies of this country had dug tunnels into \nthis country and were coming up into our schools. Imagine if Iran or \nChina or some other hostile foreign nation had tunnels from which your \nchildren and my children were at risk of being kidnapped or murdered. \nToday in Gaza we see massive civilian casualties that are the direct \nconsequence of the violence of Hamas.\n  You see, the human casualties are not an unintended side effect of \nthe conflicts. They are the objective that Hamas seeks--dead \nPalestinian children and women and men. We know this because Hamas is \nengaging in a war crime right now, not that the United Nations Human \nRights Council would ever say anything about it. But Hamas is engaging \nin a war crime of using human shields--deliberately using human \nshields. Where do they place their rockets with which they are raining \ndown death and destruction upon Israel? They place them in schools. \nThey place them in private homes. They place them in mosques. \nDeliberately they surround their rockets and their terror tunnels with \ninnocent civilians.\n  Israel right now is engaged in something unprecedented in the annals \nof modern warfare. It is undertaking more humanitarian effort to spare \ncivilian deaths than any military has in recorded history. Before \nattacking, Israel sends out texts. When they discover a rocket battery \nthey need to take out because it is firing rockets targeting innocent \ncivilians, they send texts saying: Clear out of the area. They try to \nsave the Palestinian civilians. They drop from the sky pamphlets on an \narea that is about to be bombed to take out the rockets that are coming \nfrom that area. The pamphlets say to the civilians: Get out. Get out \nbecause we are going to take out the rockets and you are in harm's \nway. Not only that, they have a practice of sending an initial knock \nbomb. What does that mean? It means the first bomb lands on the roof \nand makes a knock. It doesn't explode; it just makes a loud knock. They \ndo that for a reason: So the people inside the building can look up, \ncan hear the knock, and can flee the building so the second missile can \ntake down the building and the rockets that are housed inside and being \nused to try to murder innocent civilians.\n\n  A few weeks ago Prime Minister Netanyahu summed it up very powerfully \nwhen he said: Israel uses missile defense to defend our citizens. Hamas \nuses its citizens to defend its missiles.\n  Israel has tried to warn Palestinian civilians: Don't be located \nwhere the missiles are because we are going to respond as any sovereign \nnation will to protect our citizens.\n  What does Hamas say? Hamas tells the Palestinians: Stay there.\n  Picture that for a second. Israel is warning civilians to clear the \narea because they are going to take out the rockets and they are going \nto take out the tunnels. The response from Hamas is: No. Stay there.\n  Why? Because what they want to see is Palestinian children, \nPalestinian women killed so they can put the pictures on the Sunday \nnight news because they know the world--many at the United Nations, \nmany in the media--will behave like useful idiots. They will point to \nthe civilian casualties that are Hamas's fault. When you put rockets on \ntop of children, when\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\nyou tell the children ``do not leave,'' when you know the rockets are \ngoing to be taken out--it is Hamas, the terrorists who are responsible \nfor those children's deaths. Yet the international community puts the \npictures on the evening news and blames the nation of Israel.\n  I am proud this week to have joined my colleague, Senator Gillibrand \nfrom New York, in filing a bipartisan resolution in this body \ncondemning Hamas's use of human shields, condemning it as a war crime, \ncondemning it as an outrage, condemning it as the direct reason we are \nseeing so many civilian deaths.\n  I have to note that one of the reasons civilian deaths have been \nmitigated in Israel is because of the incredible success of the Iron \nDome missile defense system. Ronald Reagan's ``Star Wars'' is today's \nIron Dome.\n  We see unfolding in recent weeks in Israel the product of President \nReagan's vision when he proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative, or \nSDI, on March 23, 1983. Critics at the time dismissed it as ``Star \nWars.'' The Presiding Officer will recall--we were both teenagers at \nthe time, and we recall learned experts, so to speak, going on \ntelevision saying SDI was a fool's errand; it was a dream. The analogy \nthat was given was you cannot hit a bullet with a bullet; it can't \nwork. Well, run the clock forward three decades, and we see an Iron \nDome, the strategic vision of President Reagan, playing out in real-\ntime.\n  There is a wonderful video on YouTube that I encourage anyone who is \ninterested to Google and watch. It is a video called ``Iron Dome \nWedding.'' If people Google it, they will discover a video from a \nwedding in southern Israel. It is an ordinary wedding video, just like \nI suspect the Presiding Officer and I both had from our weddings. But \nin the midst of it, rockets begin coming through the night sky. We see \nrockets come across the sky, and then we see Iron Dome interceptors \ncome up and explode the rockets. One after the other is hit and \nexplodes, and the whole thing looks like fireworks. In the background \nwe hear the wedding music and the sound of celebrating, and we think, \nwere it not for these Iron Dome interceptors, those missiles might be \nlanding on that wedding and causing carnage and death and destruction. \nBut because of the potential, the power, the actuality of missile \ndefense, instead they are intercepted.\n  There are indisputable differences between the intercontinental \nballistic missiles that SDI was designed to target and the low-tech \nmissiles Hamas is firing over Israel that Iron Dome is intercepting. \nThat is why Iron Dome is one part of a three-tiered system that \nincludes David's Sling and the Arrow 2 and 3 systems, which are \ndesigned to guard against more sophisticated weapons, such as the \nlonger range missiles being provided to Hamas by Syria and Iran, and \nthey would also defend against nuclear ballistic missiles of the sort \nbeing developed in Iran.\n  It is worth underscoring, even as the fighting in Gaza grabs the \nheadlines, that we have to keep our eye on the far more serious danger \nof a nuclear Iran. The threat of a nuclear-armed Iran would make Hamas \nand their rockets seem like child's play. And our support for Iron Dome \nshould be understood in the context of support for the continued \ndevelopment of these systems, which not only protect our friend and \nally Israel, but they protect us. There is a reason why Hamas and Iran \nrefer to Israel as the ``Little Satan'' and the United States as the \n``Great Satan,'' because their intention with both is the same terror, \nthe same murder, the same death and destruction.\n  Israel is currently working to carry out the grinding work to \neradicate these terror tunnels that have been built under schools and \nkindergartens designed to kidnap and murder young children. I would \nnote that it is an enormously difficult task, one that might prove \nimpossible were it not for the success of Iron Dome limiting the \neffectiveness of those rockets.\n  I encourage this body to stand together, united as one, Republicans \nand Democrats. There may be issues on which we disagree--there may be a \ngreat many issues--but we ought to be able to stand together as one and \nspeak in unison that we support the nation of Israel and that we will \nwork with the nation of Israel immediately to replenish their Iron Dome \nsupply so they can protect the citizens there and so they can do what \nis necessary to eradicate the Hamas rockets and terror tunnels being \nused to commit war crimes. There should be a unified, bipartisan voice \nin this body, and it is my hope that by the end of this week that is \nexactly what it will be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period of morning business.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. May I proceed or does the other party wish to--how much \ntime is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 3 minutes remaining, the \nmajority has 47 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. With the concurrence of the minority party, I wish to \nproceed. I know they haven't yielded back their time. If that is \nagreeable, and hearing no objection, I will proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today as the chair of the \nAppropriations Committee to talk about several challenges facing our \ncountry.\n  First, I wish to respond to the comments made by many of the Senators \nthis morning on the compelling need to pass supplemental appropriations \nto help Israel replenish the rockets it has used in its Iron Dome \nmissile defense system. I am an unabashed, unrelenting supporter of \nthat effort.\n  For many years, as a U.S. Senator on the Appropriations Committee, on \nthe Defense Subcommittee, as well as as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, I know how important the Israeli missile defense system is, \nincluding Iron Dome, David's Sling, and others that are absolutely \ncrucial. I worked hands-on with Senator Inouye--the late great Senator, \na Congressional Medal of Honor winner--to make sure we funded the \nmissile defense system for Israel and to work on a bipartisan basis \nwith Senator Stevens and Senator Cochran. We worked together, and thank \nGod it worked. We also implemented an agreement signed by President \nBush with the Government of Israel that we would always help Israel \nmaintain its qualitative edge. We have done it, and I am proud of it.\n  Now more than ever an antimissile defense system that has worked \nneeds to continue operation. We know the technology works, but they \nneed to make sure they have the tools to make the technology work--\nthese additional rockets.\n  We know Israel is under attack. It has always been under attack since \nits very founding. This is not an existential threat; this is not an \nabstract threat; it is a daily threat. We know Israel is trying to \ndefend itself against the grim, unrelenting attacks by Hamas--a self-\navowed terrorist organization that has sworn in its documents not to \nallow Israel to continue. They absolutely oppose an independent Israeli \nState.\n  This month we are commemorating the Warsaw uprising. The Presiding \nOfficer is a member of a group we affectionately call the Polish \nCaucus--those of us who have a relationship with the Polish Government, \none of our greatest supporters in the NATO alliance. We recall that 70 \nyears ago people were willing to fight back against the Nazis, rising \nout of the sewers of the Warsaw ghetto to be able to fight them off \nwith sticks and stones and out-of-date weapons, working to liberate \nPoland from Nazis oppression.\n  Miles away, in places such as Dachau, Auschwitz, and others, there \nwere the death camps. We are 1 year away from commemorating the \nliberation of the death camps. We know that as those people marched out \nof those death camps, they made their way into Palestine, which became \nthe State of Israel.\n  We were the first Nation to recognize the necessary and rightful \nplace for Israel to exist as an independent government and forever and \na day the homeland for the Jewish people so they would be safe from \nterrorism and what occurred.\n  I am for this whole Iron Dome supplemental, and we need to do it, but \nit cannot be the only thing we put in this supplemental. We have \nneighbors right now hurting in our own country--our \n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\nWestern States with wildfires raging over hundreds of thousands of \nacres, land being depleted, local resources for first responders being \nexhausted, local funds being worn down. We have to--we have to--be able \nto respond to the Western border.\n\n  Then there is the crisis at our border, and the crisis is at our \nborder because of the crisis in Central America.\n  So when we move on the supplemental, let's look out for the great \nState of Israel, let's look out for our neighbors who are facing \nwildfires, and let's look out for what is going on at our border.\n  But, Mr. President, I came to the floor, first of all, to compliment \nSenator Sanders for the outstanding job he did working on a bipartisan \nbasis to pass the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of \n2014. What a great job they did, out of a scandal--a terrible scandal--\naffecting our Nation's veterans, where they had to stand in line simply \nto see a doctor in the very country they fought to defend.\n  Now they have found they have had to defend themselves against VA \nbureaucracy and in some places duplicitous action.\n  Well, the Sanders bill goes a long way, again, working on both sides \nof the aisle and both sides of the dome. Gosh, when we do this, this is \nwhy I wanted to be a Senator. I know this is why many others wanted to \nbe a Senator: coming here, working on concrete problems, shoulder to \nshoulder, on a bipartisan basis, hands across the aisle, hands across \nthe dome. And they did it. When this bill is passed, we will reduce the \nlong wait times for veterans, we will increase doctors and nurses and \nspecialty providers. It will allow veterans to see local providers if \nthey have been on a wait list for an extended period of time or have to \ndrive 40 miles to be able to get to a VA clinic.\n  Boy, do I know that when I look at some of the rural areas.\n  We are going to pay for it with $10 billion in mandatory emergency \nfunds. Mandatory emergency funds, that is the way to do it.\n  The Sanders bill will go a long way in increasing personnel and also \nin expanding a number of clinics--27 new clinics. So I think it is \ngreat.\n  But as important as that bill is--and it is an important step--it \ncannot be the only step we take this week. I am so excited that \nshoulder to shoulder, again, if we work together, we can do a trifecta \nfor our veterans. We can pass the Veterans Access, Choice, and \nAccountability Act--new opportunities for health care, where veterans \ndo not have to stand in line. Also, we are going to vote today on \nRobert McDonald to give the VA a new Secretary, a new CEO, new \nleadership, hopefully new energy, new vitality, and new ways of doing \nbusiness, bringing the practical know-how of the private sector to \nmeeting our mission. But as important as those two are, I also come as \nthe chair of the Appropriations Committee to say, why don't we take a \nthird step that really will do the job? Let's pass the VA MILCON \nappropriations bill so we can actually put next year's funding in the \nFederal checkbook rather than just putting VA on autopilot? We can \nactually make a big difference with the new accountability, expansion \nof care bill, but that will take days, weeks, months to put in \noperation. Right this minute we could pass the VA MILCON bill as well \nas giving new leadership.\n  I come here because I really do want to move the VA MILCON bill.\n  The Appropriations Committee works through its subcommittees. And, \nwow, I have two great leaders on the VA MILCON Subcommittee, the \nchairman and ranking member, two outstanding Senators: Senator Tim \nJohnson of South Dakota and Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois. They have \nworked so assiduously on coming up with a bill for funding our veterans \nfor fiscal year 2015. It is an outstanding bill. But right now we are \nout there in the wilderness. We have moved it through the subcommittee. \nWe have moved it through the full committee. It passed unanimously. We \nare out in the ethers waiting to come to the floor. Johnson and Kirk, \nMikulski and Shelby, we are like people with our noses pressed against \nthe glass. We see it within our grasp but we cannot get through. All we \nwant to do is help to complete the job we are trying to undertake \ntoday.\n  As much as the bill will be that Senator Sanders worked on, without \nthe VA MILCON appropriations bill, the veterans will lack key tools to \nexpand care, important support personnel that allows the doctors and \nnurses to do their job, important technology to run contemporary \ninstitutions. By the way, the bill we are going to be working on, the \nSanders bill, is focused on health care, but we on the Appropriations \nCommittee dealt not only with aspects of that but also the terrible \nbacklog on veterans disability.\n  Mr. President, veterans disability--not only do you have to stand in \nline to get health care, but you are standing days, weeks, months to \nget your disability claim. You have lost an arm or a leg or you cannot \nbreathe or you have PTSD and we cannot get your disability processed. \nThis is unacceptable. What we do in the VA bill is come up with the \nfunds to really modernize the VA.\n  First of all, just in terms of health care, to complement the Sanders \nbill, we have money in there to develop state-of-the-art technology so \nthe doctors can provide medical health care, to make sure we have the \nmodern equipment and the modern IT systems.\n  Right now, we need to be able to have DOD talking to the VA because \nveterans come from DOD. But we have an interoperable system. We work to \nfix this. We also deal with this backlog. You have no idea, Mr. \nPresident. My State of Maryland and my office in Baltimore have not had \na good track record. I vowed to my veterans that I would try to break \nthat backlog. And you know what. Working together we have been able to \ndo this.\n\n  In the fiscal year 2015 bill, we fund an appeals process, we train \nadditional claims processors, we require the management at the Veterans \nBenefit Administration to deal with the backlog, working with the new \nAdministrator. We have not only great ideas, but we actually put the \nmoney in the Federal checkbook. Johnson-Kirk did it. Do you know how \nthey did it? Yes, talking to the VA, reviewing tons of GAO and \ninspector general reports, and guess what else they did. They talked to \nthe veterans. They talked to these wonderful volunteer service \norganizations.\n  So I am going to propose something later on today or later on this \nweek. I do not want to be the chair of a committee who has her face \npressed up against the glass looking longingly at the Senate floor with \na bill I know will help the Veterans' Administration with the heavy \nlifting to deal with the health care and disability backlog. Because I \nbelieve in no surprises and no stunts, later on today or later on this \nweek, I will ask unanimous consent to bring up the VA MILCON on third \nreading to be able to compliment what we are doing here today. I want \nto be able to do that and I hope no Senator will object to it.\n  Now, just again, in the spirit of full disclosure--because I truly \nhave pledged to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle I would never \nbe a surprise chair and I would never be one to pull gimmicks or \nstunts--I am going to ask that consent. I want people to know about it \nso they can discuss it, chew on it, talk at their respective luncheons.\n  When I ask unanimous consent, I am going to ask that it be brought up \non third reading. Why am I doing that? Because under the rules of the \nSenate, if you bring up a bill on third reading, there are no \namendments. So the question would be: Senator Mikulski, are you trying \nto stiff-arm again? No. I am trying to get the job done. I am not \ntrying to stiff-arm the opportunity to offer amendments. But we have 72 \nhours left before we take this really long break--really long, long, \nlong, very long--did I say ``long''--break. I do not think, when you \nneed health care for veterans, when you need to modernize technology, \nwhen you need to crack the backlog--while we are kind of basking in the \nSun somewhere--I do not want them in line.\n  So either this afternoon or sometime tomorrow, I will ask unanimous \nconsent. I will turn to my 99 colleagues, and in the spirit of really \nmeeting compelling needs of our veterans, I will ask that bill come up \nso that as we move through the other two aspects that we are going to \ndo to help veterans, we can do the VA MILCON bill.\n  So I wanted to come to the floor today to talk about how we support a\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\ntreasured ally, how we look out for our neighbors in the West fighting \nour wildfires, and how we deal with the crisis in Central America, \nwhere children are being victimized and brutalized every day so they \nare making the long march across that terrain and territory to come to \nthe United States of America.\n  So I hope in the short time the Senate is going to be in session this \nweek and this month and even this year we could use this week to meet \nthe needs that are confronting us, but, most of all, I would hope we do \nnot just do part of the job for our veterans; we do this trifecta that \nI am recommending: passing the Veterans Accountability Act, the health \ncare act; give us a new CEO; and have a chance to pass the VA MILCON \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks of the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, my \nchairwoman, Senator Mikulski.\n  I would add perhaps one particular point; that is, this Senator will \nbe basking in the Sun in Illinois during the recess, and I invite the \nSenator from Maryland to come join us any time she would like to. But \nit will not be in ordinary vacation climes; it will be in my home \nState. I am sure the Senator is going to be spending a lot of time in \nhers as well.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If I could respond to the Senator from Illinois, yes, I \nam staying in Maryland because I had hoped we would even be working on \nconference reports and so on. But while the Senator is in Illinois and \nI am in Maryland, most of all, we do not want our veterans standing in \nline for their health care or their disability benefits. So shoulder to \nshoulder, forward together.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank Senator Mikulski.\n  Mr. President, this supplemental appropriations bill is important. It \nis timely. One of the provisions in it is an additional $225 million \nfor the Iron Dome defense. The Iron Dome defense is a joint effort by \nthe United States and Israel to protect Israel from rocket attacks. \nImagine you are living in your hometown and a neighboring State or \nneighboring town just fired 2,000 rockets into your hometown. These are \nnot Fourth of July rockets; these are deadly rockets that kill. You \nwant some protection. The Iron Dome provides protection for Israel.\n  This joint effort by the United States and Israel has been \nsuccessful. Despite 2,000 rocket attacks, the casualties on the Israeli \nside have been minimal, relatively minimal, and it is because of the \nIron Dome defense.\n  What attacks does Israel face today? Well, they face Hamas attacks \nfrom Gaza. Hamas is an organization which the United States \ncharacterized as a terrorist organization almost 20 years ago. We know \nHamas. We know their tactics. What they are doing is putting rocket \nlaunchers in civilian neighborhoods near hospitals and apartments and \nhomes, and they are launching these missile attacks on Israel and \ndaring them to fire back into civilian populations.\n  Iron Dome protects the Israeli population from the missiles being \nshot by Hamas in Gaza. Now the Israelis have invaded Gaza to go to the \nsource to stop these rocket attacks.\n  Sadly, during the course of this effort in Gaza, there have been \ncasualties--some on the Israeli side, of course; but hundreds, maybe a \nthousand on the side of the civilian population in Gaza. This is \nbecause the strategy of Hamas is to put their armaments smack-dab in \nthe middle of civilian populations. As has been said, in Israel, they \nuse weapons to protect civilians; and in Gaza, they are using civilians \nto protect weapons. That has to come to an end. We have to have an end \nto the hostilities between Gaza and Israel. No nation--no nation on \nEarth--would sit still for 2,000 rocket attacks into their population. \nThat is what Israel has faced over the past several weeks. But the \npeople of Gaza also need much better than they are receiving when it \ncomes to Hamas.\n  Hamas, sadly, is engaging in tactics using human shields at the \nexpense of the civilian population. When they are told about the \ncivilians that are dying in Gaza, leaders in Hamas say: Well, they are \nmartyrs for the cause. I will have to tell you, it would be very \ndifficult for me to understand and explain to a family that has lost a \nchild they love that their child has just become a martyr.\n  This has to come to an end. The hostilities between Gaza and Israel \nhave to end, I hope, in some negotiation and peaceful resolution. Maybe \nit is wishful thinking, but I do believe we need to make the effort. I \ncommend Secretary of State Kerry for his effort at trying to engage \nEgypt and others in this conversation.\n  The supplemental bill before us today provides more money for \ninterceptor missiles for Iron Dome--to protect Israel--money requested \nby our Secretary of Defense, money which I support. As chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, we added some $350 million for \nIron Dome defenses in the next fiscal year which begins October 1. This \nmoney is needed now because of the hostilities between these two \ncountries. I certainly support it.\n  A second part, the major part of this supplemental appropriation, \ndeals with the humanitarian refugee crisis we have on our border. It is \nnot often the United States faces a refugee crisis. Think back in \nhistory. The only refugees who come to our shores are usually from \nnearby countries: Haiti, Cuba. Occasionally, we have refugees coming \nsuch as after the Vietnam War, the Hmong people who were our allies in \nthat war.\n  But we are not like most countries in the Middle East, for example, \nthat have a steady stream of refugees. The United States does not \nengage in refugee crisis alleviation because of our location and \ngeography and our history. Seldom have we been challenged. But today we \nare challenged. We are challenged because in the first 6 months of the \nyear 57,000 unaccompanied children--children--presented themselves at \nthe border with Mexico. They were not trying to sneak in. They \nliterally walked across the border and presented themselves to the \nfirst person in uniform.\n  They were told to do that by their families. Why did they make the \ntrip to the border as kids--by themselves--to present themselves? \nBecause in three countries in Central America there is a state of \nlawlessness: Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. Eighty percent of the \nchildren who have come to the border came from those three countries. \nThey are not just coming to the United States, incidentally. There has \nbeen a 700-percent increase in refugees to adjoining Central American \ncountries from those three countries.\n  This has been going on for some time. But for the past 2 or 3 years, \nit has gone from bad to dramatically worse. We met last week with the \nAmbassadors from these three countries, and we talked about what \ncreated this. A lot of it has to do with the drug gangs--drug gangs \nthat are transporting drugs through those countries for sale largely in \nthe United States. These drug gangs have become powerful and rich, well \narmed and notorious for their barbaric tactics.\n  They recruit young people into their drug gangs at the point of a \ngun. They mutilate those who even hesitate to join the drug gangs. God \nforbid it is your daughter, because they have a reputation for raping \nyoung girls. If they are not satisfied with their response, they kill \nthem on the spot and leave them in plastic bags by the highway. That is \nwhy many families are sending their kids away from this deadly \nviolence.\n  Two weeks ago I went to a shelter in Chicago. This was a transitional \nshelter where 70 children from the border are being held until they can \nbe placed with their families in the United States or with some \ntrusting family that takes up foster care. I saw these kids firsthand. \nYour image of them may be different than what you actually see.\n  My wife said to me: Well, why do they not show pictures of these \nkids? Well, they try to protect their identity and confidentiality by \nnot showing photos. But if you could see them, you would see children \nof all ages. There were five women who walked into the dining hall at \nthis transitional shelter.\n  They did not seem to me to be 14 years of age. Each one was carrying \na baby. They were the victims of rape in Honduras. They were carrying \nthese newborn infants in their arms, as they\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\nhad done during the 8-day bus journey to get to the border. I asked \nsome of the staff at this transitional shelter--I had been told that \nmany of the families, before they send their young girls on this \ndangerous and sometimes deadly journey, give the girls birth control \npills because they anticipate they will be attacked during the course \nof this journey. They said: It is true.\n  What desperation would you have to reach before you turned your \ndaughter loose under those circumstances? These families are literally \ntrying to escape a burning home and sending their kids to the only safe \nand secure place they can think of.\n  What do we need to do? First, we need to get to these countries and \ntell them: Stop. Stop these deadly journeys, these journeys which, \nsadly, lead to harm and even death for some of these children. Do not \nlet this happen any more. We have to work with the governments of those \ncountries to make it clear this is the wrong thing to do. It is wrong \nbecause once these kids get into America, they are not entitled to \nstay. They are not entitled to be citizens, unless, perhaps, they \nqualify for asylum. They are going to be sent back.\n\n  After they are sent back to these countries, if they ever try to \nreenter the United States they can be found guilty of a felony. This is \nserious. So the notion that they can just come to America and stay here \nif they wish is not true. That is the first thing we need to do.\n  The second thing we need to do is to stop the smuggling and the \ncoyotes that are bringing these kids into the United States. They are \ncharging these poor families in Central America thousands of dollars \nthey do not have to bring these kids to the border. We have to work \nwith Mexico to hold these coyotes and smugglers accountable.\n  Third, I want to tell you, I think this really is key to our \ndiscussion. This is a test of who we are as a country. How many times \nin our history has the United States rallied for families and children \naround the world?\n  Do you remember just a month or two ago in Nigeria when 300 girls \nwere kidnapped by Islamic extremists? Members of the Senate from both \nparties came to the floor to protest outrage that 300 young teenage \ngirls would be kidnapped by these extremists. We engaged at every level \nto let the world know America cared. It was not the first time. There \nis a long history of it. We have stood for families and children around \nthe world for humanitarian purposes throughout our history. Look back \nto the refuseniks, the Russian Jews who were being discriminated \nagainst in the Soviet Union. The United States was one of the leading \nnations in the world to stand behind those families and those children, \nbringing them to the United States so that they could escape \nantisemitism and Communism.\n  When you look at the victims of the Haitian earthquake, the United \nStates was providing foreign aid to those families and children because \nwe are, in fact, a caring nation. That is who we are. Throughout our \nhistory we have shown it. We need to show it again with these children. \nSome extreme American politicians have said: It is not our problem. Put \nthem on a bus. Put them on a plane and dump them back wherever they \ncame from--not our problem.\n\n  God forbid that is the verdict of history, that the United States, \nwhen it saw vulnerable, helpless children, did not care. I think more \nhighly of this country. I think we have proven over and over that we do \ncare. There have been some extraordinary statements made about this \ncrisis by many people. The one that caught my eye was from a friend who \nhappens to be the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Deval \nPatrick was born in Chicago. Maybe that is why I am partial to him. But \nDeval Patrick spoke about Massachusetts and its feelings toward these \nchildren.\n  He recalled moments of history. Here is what he said: My inclination \nis to remember what happened when a ship full of Jewish children tried \nto come to the United States in 1939 and the United States turned them \naway. Many of them went back to their deaths in Nazi concentration \ncamps.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       I think we are a bigger hearted people than that as \n     Americans.\n\n  I agree with Governor Patrick. President Obama has asked for \nresources to care for these children, to place them, to give them the \nright of seeking asylum if they can make that established legal claim \nand, if not, to return them, humanely, to the countries they came from. \nTwo of the three Ambassadors we met with, incidentally, said they could \nnot guarantee the safety of those children in Honduras or El Salvador, \nif they came back. Let's do the right thing and pass this supplemental \nappropriation. Let's provide the resources so these children are \ntreated humanely, ultimately given their hearing, ultimately returned, \nin most cases, to the country they came from.\n  How will history judge us? How will we be judged if, when these \nrefugee children came to our border, they were turned away and sent \nback to harm, violence or even death?\n  We do not want that to happen. That is not who we are as Americans. \nWe care. We show it. Our government should show it as well. The Senate \nwill get an opportunity to do that very soon--we hope maybe this day or \nthis week--as we wind down the session.\n  The last point I want to make is a tribute to two of my colleagues \nwho have done an extraordinary job when it comes to the Veterans' \nAdministration. I am referring to John McCain, my friend who came to \nCongress with me many years ago, the former Republican candidate for \nPresident and a conservative from Arizona. He teamed up with--of all \npeople--Bernie Sanders of Vermont, self-styled independent socialist \nDemocrat. How about that? Sanders and McCain sat down to solve the \nchallenge facing the VA. God bless them. They did it. They are \nreporting a bill to us which is a dramatic improvement over the current \nVA system.\n  We are now overwhelmed with the Veterans' Administration disability \nclaims. Forty-five percent of the veterans coming home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan have filed a claim. We have tens of thousands of these \nclaims pending, many of them for post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  We have said, incidentally, that we are going to help all veterans. \nSome 400,000 veterans from other wars are making PTSD claims. In \naddition, we have those who served in Vietnam, exposed to Agent Orange \nand with nine different diseases being treated. We have those who were \nvictims of Gulf War Syndrome being treated. We have homeless veterans \nwho are now being brought in and counseled so they can get their lives \nback on track. It is an overwhelming responsibility which the VA has \ntoday.\n  The Sanders-McCain veterans bill is going to address them by \nproviding more resources for our veterans and more medical \nprofessionals, which we need. Remember--we all should every single \nday--that we said to the men and women who enlisted in our military and \nwho volunteered: If you will raise your hand, swear allegiance to this \ncountry and risk your life, we will stand by you when you come home.\n  We are going to keep our word. We promised. We are going to keep our \nword. This bill--this veterans bill that is going to come before us \nthis week--does exactly that. Sanders and McCain met with the House \nconferees and worked out an agreement--an agreement which is going to \nbenefit the Hines VA in Chicago with an additional facility which they \nneed. There is an amendment which is going to help facilities all \nacross this country serving our veterans--an amendment which says: If \nyou happen to live too far away from a veterans hospital, we are going \nto find a way to make sure you get timely care that is near your home. \nI think it is the least we can do. We owe it to our vets.\n  I tip my hat to my colleagues, Republican and Democrat alike, who put \nthis together. I am looking forward to voting for it this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with my distinguished colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Illinois. I think Senator Sanders and Senator \nMcCain showed that things can get done around here. I think of the \ntremendous work the Senator from Illinois did last year and helped us \nget an immigration bill through this body. We had a large majority of \nthe Senate vote for it--Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\n  How I wish the leadership in the House had allowed them to vote on \nit. I think we would be in a far better position to deal with these \nproblems with the DREAMers and with those seeking to come into our \ncountry. I applaud the Senator from Illinois for never giving up.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Vermont would yield for just one \nmoment. I want to thank him personally. As chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, he has made a point of making sure the DREAM Act, \na bill which I introduced 13 years ago, has had a fair hearing before \nthe committee on more than one occasion and has been reported by the \ncommittee. It was part of that comprehensive immigration bill. I thank \nhim for bringing it up.\n  I just want to say for the record that one Republican Senator has \nsaid he wants to deport all of the DREAMers. He is in for a fight \nbecause these young men and women are proving over and over they can \nmake a valuable contribution to this country. I thank the Senator from \nVermont.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 2658 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FRANKEN.

Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \nwill be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, as the chairman of the Senate Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I rise today in strong support of the nomination \nof Robert McDonald to serve as Secretary of Veterans' Affairs.\n  I also thank Majority Leader Reid for moving this important \nnomination forward as quickly as he has, and I very much hope that \nlater this afternoon, with a very strong vote, the Senate will vote to \nconfirm Robert McDonald as Secretary of the VA.\n  Before I talk about Mr. McDonald's qualifications, I wish to take a \nmoment to express my sincere thanks to GEN Eric Shinseki for his \ndedicated service to our Nation, first as a soldier and then as head of \nthe VA, working tirelessly to provide for those injured during war and \nthe families of those who perished on the battlefield. He set very \nambitious goals, and under his leadership VA made significant strides \nin reducing veteran homelessness and transforming a paper-based claims \nsystem to one fit for the 21st century. I thank him and his family very \nmuch for his service.\n  It is my strong belief that Robert McDonald will bring two very \nimportant qualities to the position of Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  First, he is familiar with the military as well as the needs of \nveterans and their families. Mr. McDonald and his family have a history \nof service to our Nation. Mr. McDonald began his service as a cadet at \nthe United States Military Academy at West Point. He graduated in 1975 \nin the top 2 percent of his class with a degree in engineering and went \non to serve as an infantry officer in the Army's 82nd Airborne, earning \nAirborne and Ranger qualifications during his military service. His \nfather served in the Army Air Corps after World War II. Additionally, \nhis wife's father was held as a POW after being shot down over Europe. \nHer uncle served in Vietnam and still receives care at the VA. Also, \nMr. McDonald's nephew is currently serving and deployed with the U.S. \nAir Force. In other words, Mr. McDonald and his family have a deep \nunderstanding and service with the U.S. military.\n  Upon hearing Mr. McDonald at the hearing we held in our committee for \nthe confirmation process, I was convinced that he has a deep passion to \ndo everything he can to protect our veterans.\n  The other quality Mr. McDonald brings to this job is that he has been \nthe CEO of one of America's leading corporations, a company which has \ntens of thousands of employees. His more than 33 years with Procter & \nGamble gives him the tools to create a well-run and accountable VA. In \nother words, he will bring the tools of a CEO and a private corporation \nto the VA--a huge bureaucracy that needs a significant improvement in \naccountability and in management.\n  As we begin debate on Mr. McDonald's nomination, I believe it is \nimportant that my colleagues understand the realities he will face in \nleading the VA.\n  The VA operates the largest integrated health care system in the \nUnited States, with over 1,700 points of care which include 150 \nhospitals, 820 community-based outreach clinics, and 300 vet centers. \nIn fiscal year 2013 the VA provided 89.7 million outpatient visits each \nday--today, tomorrow, yesterday. The VA conducts approximately 236,000 \nhealth care appointments. In other words, it is a huge system.\n  VA's problems, which Mr. McDonald will have to address immediately, \nhave been widely reported in recent months. In my view, Acting \nSecretary Sloan Gibson has done an excellent job in taking a number of \ncritical steps to address the problems confronting the VA, but clearly \nthere is much more to be done.\n  We now know, among other issues, there is a significant shortage of \ndoctors, nurses, and mental health providers within VA, as well as the \nphysical space necessary to provide timely access to quality care. This \nis a major problem because at the end of the day, no matter how well \nrun the VA is or any health care system is, we are not going to be able \nto provide quality, timely care unless there are the doctors, nurses, \nand other medical personnel available to do that work. As a result of \nthe shortages, we know that we have tens of thousands of veterans today \nin many parts of this country on lists that are much too long in order \nto gain access to the VA. We also know that hundreds of thousands of \nveterans who have appointments scheduled are waiting too long to be \nseen and receive care.\n  I think it is important that everybody recognize that as a result of \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, in the last 5 years 2 million more \nveterans have come into the VA. This is on top of an aging population \nof VA patients who served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam--patients \nwho often need a whole lot of care as they age. So combine new people \ncoming into the VA, often with very serious problems--including some \n500,000 veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan with PTSD and \nTBI--and an aging population with difficult problems, and that is where \nwe are, and those are some of the issues the VA is going to have to \naddress.\n\n  While I am on the subject, let me say that most people understand--\nand that includes many of the veterans I talk to every day in Vermont, \nveterans across the country, and the national veterans organizations \nthat represent millions of veterans--that once people get into the VA \nsystem, in general the quality of care is good. That is not just what \nveterans and their organizations say; that is what a number of \nindependent studies show. Our problem right now is how to figure out a \nway that when people apply for VA health care, they get into the system \nquickly and that once they are in the system, they get the appointments \nthey need in a timely manner. That is our job. It is not going to be an \neasy job, but that is the job we face.\n  My hope is that tomorrow or Thursday the House and the Senate will be \nvoting on a comprehensive piece of legislation authored by Congressman \nJeff Miller, chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and me. \nI think it is terribly important that we pass that bipartisan \nlegislation with a strong vote in both Houses because\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\nthat legislation will give the new Secretary the tools he needs to go \nforward aggressively in addressing many of the problems facing the VA.\n  I hope every Member of the House and Senate understands it is \nunacceptable that veterans in this country are on terribly long waiting \nlines and cannot get the health care they need in a timely manner.\n  This legislation, which I hope will be passed this week by the House \nand the Senate, provides $10 billion for emergency health care so that \nif a veteran can't get into the VA, that veteran will be able to go to \na private physician, a community-based health center, a military base, \nor whatever but will be able to get timely care.\n  In addition, the legislation puts $5 billion into the VA so that they \nwill be able to hire the doctors, the mental health counselors, nurses, \nand other medical personnel they need so that as soon as possible, when \nveterans apply for VA health care, they will get not only quality care \nbut timely care.\n  In addition, this legislation addresses an issue many veterans around \nthe country, especially in rural areas, are worried about--that if they \nlive long distances away from the VA, they will not have to travel 100 \nmiles to get the health care they need; that if they live 40 miles or \nmore away from the VA facility, they will be able to go to a doctor of \ntheir choice in that community. This is an important step forward.\n  This legislation will also do some terribly important work in making \nsure that widows--women who lost their husbands in battle--will be able \nto get the education they should be entitled to under the post-9/11 GI \nbill.\n  This legislation deals with an issue passed by the House; that is, \ninstate tuition for veterans who today may not be able to take \nadvantage of the post-9/11 GI bill.\n  This legislation also addresses a very serious crisis within the \nmilitary today; that is, the issue of sexual abuse and providing women \nand men who have been abused sexually in the military with care at the \nVA.\n  We are at a very important moment in terms of the Veterans' \nAdministration. We will have new leadership at the VA after Mr. \nMcDonald is confirmed. We have a significant piece of legislation that \nI hope and expect will be passed this week to give the new leadership \nthe tools it needs to start addressing the problems facing our \nveterans.\n  It seems to me that if this Nation stands for anything, it must \nprotect and defend those who have protected and defended us. When \npeople put their lives on the line and they come back wounded from \nwar--either in body or in spirit--it seems absolutely immoral if we \nturn our backs on those men and women.\n  The legislation we will pass this week begins to address those \nconcerns, and I hope we will do so under the new leadership Mr. \nMcDonald will provide.\n  Madam President, I yield my remaining time to Senator Brown to hear \nhis comments on the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I applaud Senator Sanders for his work on \nthe veterans conference report.\n  I spoke at a breakfast today. I was with the Presiding Officer from \nNorth Dakota at the Air Force Caucus. As important as the Air Force is \nin North Dakota, it is equally important at Wright-Patterson Air Force \nBase in Dayton, OH--outside of Dayton.\n  One of the things I talked about at this breakfast is how proud I am, \nwhen it looks as if the Senate does not get as much done as we would \nlike, that Senator Sanders and Senator McCain--with a supporting cast \nbut principally the two of them--were able to negotiate with a \nsometimes reluctant, sometimes erratic House of Representatives on some \nof these issues. They were able to negotiate a very good veterans bill \nthat will primarily do three things: first, make those accountable at \nthe VA actually accountable; second, take care of those veterans who \nhave had to wait longer than 30 days for their care in the VA, veterans \nwho have earned this care; and third, will scale up the VA--the most \nimportant parts--so there will be enough doctors and nurses, mental \nhealth therapists and occupational therapists, and enough beds and \nenough capacity at the VA centers and at the community-based outpatient \nclinics. If you are in the system, you get good care. It is just that \ntoo many haven't been able to get into the system, partly because when \nwe went to war a decade-plus ago, the people running the administration \nin those days and the Congress said: This war will be short. We don't \nneed to bother with scaling up the VA.\n  That was shameful. They were dead wrong. Unfortunately, far too many \nveterans have paid the price. That is why this legislation is so \nimportant. The timing is perfect to get this reform at the same time \nthat we have an opportunity this week to confirm Robert McDonald, a \nfellow Ohioan from Cincinnati who ran a company that had more than \n100,000 employees, one of the world's biggest, most prestigious \nconsumer companies.\n\n  He went to West Point. He served veterans before. He understands \nveterans' issues. I talked with him a number of times, as has Chairman \nSanders, and Mr. McDonald, as the soon-to-be--I hope the new Secretary. \nI ask my colleagues to support him--new Secretary will have these new \ntools because of this conference report which I am hopeful we pass this \nweek\n  Mr. McDonald understands the importance of VA health care. He knows--\nhe said this to me in my office and a couple of other times--that the \nVeterans' Administration has a hospital system unlike any other in the \ncountry. It knows how to treat unique illnesses and unique injuries--\nunique mostly to veterans--various kinds of brain trauma, various kinds \nof physical injuries, other kinds of treatment. That is why it makes \nsense for Mr. McDonald to be the new Secretary of the VA. That is why \nthis veterans conference report is very important.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield for my distinguished friend from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I want to commend Chairman Sanders for \nhis leadership. Last night at 9:30 p.m., I came back to the Capitol and \nexecuted a conference agreement that he has worked very hard on, and \nranking member Senator Burr worked very hard on, and pulled together \ndisparate factions to address the needs of our veterans in a bill that \nis going to be a toolkit for Robert McDonald, who I hope will be \nunanimously approved as the next Secretary of the VA in the President's \nCabinet.\n  I rise to talk about Mr. McDonald, but before I do, I want to talk \nabout that conference report.\n  Our veterans have been abused in the last 10 to 12 years because of a \nveterans' medical service that has not performed the services they need \nto perform for our veterans in America. One of the reasons they did \nthis is, Admiral Shinseki, who was the former Secretary, was actually \ninsulated from a lot of the information that was going on in his own \nDepartment by the senior leadership at the VA who had become \ncomfortable and passive and not active in terms of the operation of VA \nmedical services.\n  The bill we signed last night that the Senate will vote on in the \nnext few days is the bill that gives Mr. McDonald and the next \nSecretary to come the tools they need to enhance the VA and to make it \na responsive organization to the 22 million veterans, 6.5 million of \nwhom use veteran medical services, and to the 774,000 veterans in my \nhome State of Georgia who deserve and demand, if you will, the services \nthey were promised when they went into the U.S. military.\n  Bob McDonald is an outstanding American. He was president, CEO, and \nchairman of the board of one of the most respected companies in \nAmerica, Procter & Gamble.\n  He is the father of two, grandfather of two additional children. He \nis an outstanding American and his wife Diane is an outstanding lady in \nsupport of him and his job at Procter & Gamble. He is going to need \nthat support now as he heads to the VA.\n  He was a captain in the U.S. military. He graduated from West Point, \nwas trained in airborne warfare, desert warfare, and subtemperature \nwarfare, and he is going to need those talents at the VA in each and \nevery case because it is a mess.\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\n  The conference committee report we have passed gives him two tools \nthat are essential. It gives him the authority to hire and fire title \n38 and title 5 employees. Title 5 employs the senior leadership and \ntitle 38 the next step in leadership down, which is what the VA needs. \nThe VA is an organization of 340,000 people which in the last 3 years \nhas averaged 3,000 disciplinary actions a year. Each of those \ndisciplinary actions meant people were moved from one job to another \nwithin the VA and did not lose pay. There is no accountability in the \nVA and there really has not been. That is why the systemic problems on \nappointments and veterans services and everything else going on in the \nVA has not happened. By giving him the opportunity to hire and fire, he \nwill have the respect and attention of those who work in the VA to \nunderstand full well they are going to have to carry out the game plan \nof this leader.\n  He understands metrics. He understands accountability. He understands \nleadership. He has taken a job he didn't have to accept, a job he \ndidn't need to have to do at this time in his life, but a job he wants \nto do to give back to the country he loves and the country he served in \nthe military.\n  I am confident Bob McDonald will be an outstanding Secretary of the \nVeterans' Administration, and I commend him to my fellow Senators with \nmy highest recommendation in the hopes that he will be approved \nunanimously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I stand today also with high hopes that the new leadership at the VA \nwill bring much needed changes to a department that is clearly, quite \nfrankly, in a shambles, failing our Nation's veterans. During his \ncommittee hearing, the nominee Robert McDonald promised to bring a high \nlevel of accountability and transparency to the VA, two characteristics \nthat are sorely needed. This is extremely important in an agency where \nunder the leadership of the previous Secretary it would often take \nmonths to get answers to routine questions--or in many cases you would \nnever get answers at all.\n  By the end of this week I am also hopeful that besides confirming the \nnew Secretary, we will send to the President the Veterans Access Choice \nand Accountability Act. This important legislation includes many needed \nreforms to the VA, including bringing that accountability to the \nDepartment and actually providing our Nation's veterans with choices \nabout where they can receive care.\n  The bill also, perhaps most importantly for Louisiana, finally \nauthorizes much needed community-based clinics around the country, \nincluding two which have been long delayed in Louisiana by pure \nineptitude and bureaucratic screw-ups at the VA--clinics and expanded \nclinics in Lafayette and Lake Charles. For 4 years I have been fighting \nthe Washington bureaucracy tooth and nail to get these new expanded \noutpatient clinics. They are vitally important to Louisiana veterans \nwho now sometimes have to drive up to 4 hours to receive services that \nhave been promised to them much closer to their community.\n  The current clinics in Acadiana are overcrowded and don't offer the \nfull range of services that these new clinics will. As I said, VA \nineptitude delayed the clinics in the first place. If it weren't for \ntheir mistakes, these clinics would actually already be built. When \nthey were finally teed up and ready to go, then the Congressional \nBudget Office made a ridiculous decision that again threw these clinics \ninto limbo because of a scoring issue out of the blue. Finally in \nDecember, the House was able to pass a bill that dealt with these CBO \nconcerns that passed 346 to 1.\n  Normally when a bill passes with that sort of margin the Senate will \nquickly pass it by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, that didn't \nhappen.\n  First we needed to attach an amendment to address some marginal \nconcerns. Then even after we had done that--even after that received \nfull agreement in the Senate, unfortunately Senate Democrats, led by \nthe Chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, held up the legislation \nbasically as a hostage to try to get a broader VA package. Actually I \nhad to come down and ask unanimous consent for the House clinics \nlegislation six times on the floor. Unfortunately, six times Senator \nSanders denied that unanimous consent. It was only after the VA scandal \nbroke that momentum shifted and, thankfully, it looks as though we will \nfinally pass this into law, the clinics legislation, along with this \nimportant reform bill.\n  When the authorization occurs, I strongly urge Mr. McDonald and the \nVA to streamline the process to get these two clinics built as soon as \npossible, given the long and arduous history of VA delays and screw-\nups. The veterans of Louisiana have waited patiently, literally for \nyears. These clinics are overdue. Let's get on with it. Louisiana \nveterans have had to wait for numerous delays caused by VA mistakes. \nThe least the Department can do is to make sure these clinics are now \nbuilt with the utmost haste and efficiency.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for approximately 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          McDonald Nomination\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I have been a Member of Congress in both \nthe House and in the Senate, and in my entire time as a Member of \nCongress I have served on either the House or Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. Over that time I have worked with nine Secretaries of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  Today I am here to add my support and ask for the confirmation of \nsomeone who I believe will be the next Secretary of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, Mr. Bob McDonald.\n  I had believed--I do believe--that a change at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs was necessary. I made clear that we needed to change \nthe leadership at the top, and I believe this change is a good thing \nfor the Department--the management of the Department, but, most \nimportantly, for the veterans whom the Department is to serve.\n  I also know a change in the leadership of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs in and of itself is insufficient to solve the problems our \nveterans are facing in access to health care and in the long time our \nveterans are required to wait to receive their benefits.\n  I have met with Mr. McDonald in my office. I also, as a member of the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee, had the opportunity to listen to \nhim testify and to ask him questions in the confirmation process, and I \nwas completely impressed by his candor, his sincerity, and certainly \nhis commitment to serving our Nation's veterans. He is a leader in the \ntradition of the 82nd Airborne Paratroopers who are well regarded as \nthe first to be called when there is a military emergency. As they say, \nwhen the President calls, the 82nd Airborne will answer. In my view, \nthat is exactly what we have in Mr. McDonald. When the President \ncalled, he answered that call. He answered the opportunity to serve the \nveterans of this country.\n  When the President needed help, he found someone, in my view, who \nwill dutifully fulfill the responsibilities of being a Cabinet \nSecretary and work on behalf of our Nation's veterans.\n  It seems to me there is no certainty in this world in which we know \npeople for brief amounts of time, but it certainly seems clear to me \nthat Mr. McDonald is the right person to lead the VA. He is willing and \ncapable of restoring hope in veterans so they can trust the agency and \nthe Department that was created for their benefit.\n  I asked the President--I don't know that he ever saw my request or \ncertainly never probably listened to my request, but the plea was \nplease nominate someone from outside the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. This gentleman, Mr. McDonald, while having\n\n[[Page S5018]]\n\nmilitary experience, has a significant background of being the CEO of \nProctor & Gamble, and in that position he was well-known for his value-\nbased leadership, believing that ``the best companies and leaders \noperate with a clear purpose and consistent set of principles or \nvalues.''\n  What the VA must do right now is to dismantle the bureaucracy, break \ndown the culture of indifference, and review its commitment to the core \nvalues of the Department. There is no higher calling than to take care \nof the men and women who served our country.\n  Mr. McDonald shares that dedication to making certain our veterans \nhave access to quality care--the best our Nation can offer--and he is \nfocused and ready to take on the challenges that lie ahead. At least he \nconvinced me that is the case.\n  There is now, fortunately, compromise legislation poised to pass both \nthe House and Senate this week that will soon offer veterans more \naccess to the quality care they deserve. Although this legislation is \nsignificant, it is impossible for Congress to mandate a change in \nattitude. Leaders can change attitudes at the Department. Congress does \nnot have the power to control or develop a workforce that treats \nveterans like patriots, deserving care from a grateful nation, rather \nthan to make them feel as though they are a burden.\n  Leadership throughout the institution, starting with Bob McDonald at \nthe top, must command the VA to head down a new path of redemption and \nhope. We must create an agency that is more cost-effective, more \ncompassionate, and more caring toward the veterans it serves. The VA \nmust become an agency that is worthy of the service and sacrifice of \nour Nation's veterans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5018-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 2:45 \np.m. will be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, before I begin I do want to take a \nmoment to commend the chairmen of the Veterans' Affairs Committees in \nboth the House and the Senate for their commitment to reaching a deal \nthat puts our veterans first and gives the VA the tools they need to \naddress immediate challenges.\n  More importantly, I really applaud their work to build and strengthen \nthe VA system in order to continue to deliver the best care for our \nNation's heroes over the long term.\n  The deal they announced yesterday is a very important step toward \naddressing a lot of issues that we know exist within the VA system, but \nit cannot be the final step. As transparency and accountability \nincrease at the VA, so will the investigations and reports of \nadditional concerns, requiring even more action from the VA, from the \nadministration, and from this Congress.\n  However, as Chairman Miller said yesterday, we cannot legislate good \ncharacter here in Congress. It is going to be up to the leadership at \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs to truly enact those reforms.\n  So I have come to the floor today in support of the nomination of \nRobert McDonald, someone I believe has the skills necessary to make \nthese necessary changes as the next VA Secretary.\n  As I told Mr. McDonald last week, he is faced with a truly monumental \ntask. Even as we pass comprehensive legislation to bring significant \nreforms at the VA to reduce wait times, to improve accountability, \nthere are still many serious challenges the VA must address.\n  Twenty-two veterans still take their own lives each day. Thousands of \nveterans are alone, coping with sexual assaults. And while the \nDepartment has made commendable progress, it will be an uphill battle \nas we work to eliminate veterans homelessness and the claims backlog. \nMr. McDonald will have to grapple with these and many more issues--all \non day one.\n  When I met with Mr. McDonald in my office a few weeks ago, he told me \nhe was one of the veterans who was lost in the system during his \ntransition from military life to civilian life. So I trust--I trust--he \nunderstands what a critical moment this is for the VA and why we must \nfinally fix many of these systemic and cultural challenges.\n  We have all made a promise to those who have signed up to serve. So I \nencourage my colleagues to support this nomination. I am hopeful the \nsteps we are taking here this week on behalf of our Nation's heroes \nwill finally ignite the much-delayed reforms our veterans have been \ndemanding and they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I stand today not to rehash with my \ncolleagues the crisis that exists at the Veterans' Administration or to \nshare it with the American people. They know the story, and especially \nour Nation's veterans, who have been given the runaround.\n  I am here to highlight a success in the Senate. See, my colleagues, \non July 7, 2014--not even a month ago--we received the nomination for \nthe new VA Secretary from the President.\n  On July 22 of this month, we had a confirmation hearing on that \nnomination. On July 23--the next day--Robert McDonald was passed \nunanimously out of the committee. Today--before the end of July--we are \non the Senate floor to confirm Robert McDonald as the next VA \nSecretary.\n  I rise to urge my colleagues to support this nomination. The VA needs \na confirmed Secretary in place to begin a long, arduous process of \nreform and cultural change.\n  By now, our colleagues probably know that Bob McDonald is a veteran \nhimself. He is a graduate of West Point. He served 5 years in active \nduty, and served most of that time at Fort Bragg, NC. So I consider him \none of ours.\n  He spent more than 30 years working for Procter & Gamble--I think the \nmost competitive manufacturing company in the world. His work led him \nacross the globe. But he also had prominent roles at a number of other \norganizations--Xerox, United States Steel Corporation, and the Business \nRoundtable.\n  Mr. McDonald has frequently lectured to groups on leadership skills, \nand his leadership philosophy was highlighted in the book ``The \nLeader's Compass.'' He is the type of leader we need at the VA at this \nvery crucial time.\n  Bob McDonald clearly has the experience to run an organization as \nlarge and as diverse as the Department of Veterans Affairs. Perhaps \nmore importantly, he has selflessly agreed to take the challenge of \nleading the VA at its most critical time--something many people might \nhave passed on.\n  I hope this week, in addition to this nomination, we will pass \nlegislation to help the VA and its next leader address the systemic \nproblems with access to VA health care and a corrosive culture that led \nto this crisis. But that legislation would be just one step. An \nenormous amount of work must be done from within the VA to rebuild its \nreputation and to turn it into an agency that will live up to the \nexpectations of our veterans and a nation grateful to them for their \nservice. We need a strong leader to do that, and I am glad Robert \nMcDonald has agreed to serve his country once again in this important \nrole.\n  The nomination received the unanimous support of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee. I urge my colleagues: Confirm Robert McDonald as the \nnext Secretary of the VA, and let's get on with the important work of \nreform at that agency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, my colleague from North Carolina has \njust spoken on behalf of the nomination of Robert McDonald to be the \nSecretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and I will do \nlikewise. He has also spoken of his background as a graduate of West \nPoint, as an Army officer, and as the CEO of one of the largest \ncompanies in the world.\n\n[[Page S5019]]\n\n  I had the occasion to meet with Mr. McDonald, and he could be the man \nof the hour. I hope he will be. He looks that way now.\n  With that in mind, I rise today in support of Robert McDonald's \nnomination for Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is \nmy hope that Robert McDonald will bring a renewed commitment, energy, \nand acumen to address the Department's systemic problems that we all \nknow exist.\n  The allegations against the Department of Veterans Affairs are \nincredibly serious. Therefore, I rise in defense of our Nation's \nveterans. Our veterans have put themselves in harm' way to defend us, \nand I think it is only right that we do everything in our power to \ndefend them and their interests when they return home.\n  Allegations that veterans were not only denied timely access to care \nbut that scheduling delays, secret waiting lists, and lost records may \nhave led to veterans' deaths are totally unacceptable. These \nallegations of mismanagement and cover-up at the Veterans' \nAdministration are beyond disturbing; they are sickening, they need to \nbe corrected, and they need to be corrected immediately.\n  Our veterans deserve better. Our veterans have earned these benefits \nthrough their dedicated service and sacrifice to our Nation, and the VA \nmust correct these problems, not just study them. It is my hope that \nRobert McDonald will actively work to address these tremendous \nchallenges.\n  But according to the VA's recent nationwide audit, new patients using \nthe Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System waited an average of \nover 74 days to see a primary care doctor. That is totally \nunacceptable. That is nearly three times greater than the national \naverage of 27 days for new patient wait times. I look forward to \nworking with the new VA Secretary to review the Department's plan to \ninitiate corrective action, both in Alabama and across the Nation.\n  While the VA's wait time statistics are certainly disturbing to all \nof us, the problem does not end there. Allegations that VA employees \nmay have submitted false records to justify their own receipt of \nperformance bonuses suggest the possibility that the deceit and \nmistreatment I have described may also have been compounded by a lot of \nfraud.\n  In May, Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski and I \nwrote a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and called on the \nDepartment of Justice to begin appropriate criminal and civil \ninvestigations into allegations of misconduct at the Veterans' \nAdministration. We have also recommended that the Commerce-Justice-\nScience appropriations bill--and we serve as the chair and ranking \nmember of that committee--provide the resources for these \ninvestigations. The Veterans Affairs and Military Construction \nappropriations bill provides an additional $5 million to investigate VA \nscheduling practices. And legislation introduced this week requests an \nadditional $17 billion to improve the VA over the next 3 years.\n  While I commend these efforts to initiate corrective action, I \nbelieve it is only a starting point. A lack of funding is not the \nmainspring of the VA's troubled past. I look forward to working with \nthe Presiding Officer and others--with the new VA Secretary--to ensure \nthese problems at the VA are rectified as soon as possible before any \nmore veterans are adversely affected.\n  Solving the issues at the VA has never been more imperative than it \nis today, as American service members continue to risk their lives \nevery day for our Nation. Support for our Armed Forces must never \nwaiver, and it must be just as strong when they return home. Who will \nfight our wars in the future if we do not prove that we respect our \nveterans today?\n  Veterans have risked their lives for the freedoms we all enjoy and \nthus should receive the care they most assuredly deserve and have \nearned. Defending veterans' access to timely medical care today is the \nvery least, I believe, we can do because they defended us first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                                 Israel\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, a part of the appropriations \nsupplemental bill we will consider tomorrow is approximately $245 \nmillion--I think I have that figure right--for the additional \nassistance to the Israeli Government for the Iron Dome system.\n  The United States has been assisting Israel in order to be able to \nbuy this system. To the credit of the scientists and the military \nplanners in Israel, they developed this system, and it is a very \nsophisticated system. As a matter of fact, when you watch the rockets \ngo off, you will see an incoming round coming, in this case from Gaza, \noften without any precision guidance.\n  That is an interesting thing, that they are shooting at urbanized \nareas where the general civilian population is, and they have incoming \nrounds that no one knows where they are going; thus, the need for a \nsophisticated radar that can track it and distinguish first if it is \ngoing to fall in an area where there is nobody, where there is nothing \nin the way of equipment that would be harmed and, therefore, save the \nordnance that otherwise would be shot. But the radar is so \nsophisticated that within seconds and fractions of seconds it can \ndetermine that, and then shoot off the round that will intercept the \nincoming round.\n  It is a sight to behold to see this Iron Dome rocket go upward and \nthen change its trajectory, almost at a 90-degree angle, to home in on \nthe incoming warhead, and they have a 90-percent success rate.\n  When this system was first produced, it was so successful that the \nIsraeli people, who had been bombed from outside their territory and \nhad been accustomed to running to bunkers, to shelters, to places where \nthey could be safe, with the institution of Iron Dome, often would come \noutside and see this aerial fireworks display because it had such a \ntremendous success rate.\n  Now things have changed because in the latest conflict with Hamas--\nand this is just in the course of the last 3 or so weeks--over 2,300 \nrockets have been fired into Israel. Hamas continues to fire more \nrockets.\n  Each night, if you turn on your television news shows, you see \nanother display of all of this going on over on that side of the \nplanet. Thus the need to supply more of the Iron Dome system and the \nordnance that goes with it. And thus there will be this item that will \nbe part of the supplemental appropriations request. I commend it to our \ncolleagues to vote for it. It is a system that consistently the U.S. \nhas helped to fund. It has saved a lot of lives.\n  Remember, the ordnance that is being shot into Israel is usually not \na guided system. That is part of the terror that is being aimed at \nIsrael, because it is to inflict casualties upon a civilian population. \nYet, with this sophisticated system, 90-percent effective, it is saving \na lot of lives. That is what I wanted to share with the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent that the time during \nquorum calls be charged against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I rise today filled with anguish and \nheartbreak that is shared by so many Americans who have been watching \nover the past week as countless innocent children and innocent \ncivilians have been killed and live in states of great fear or even \nterror. Millions are running for bomb shelters time and time again. We \nare seeing people in Gaza killed or maimed and seeing people in Israel \nlive under the terror in the sky and terror coming from below.\n  I want to stand resolute and clear about the true cause of this \ncrisis. That lies squarely with Hamas, a terrorist organization whose \nends do not start and finish with the well-being of the Palestinian \npeople. Their primary focus and their clear agenda is not peace for \ntheir people. Written into their very charter is the firm determination \nto eliminate the State of Israel. They have proven this evil \ndetermination to do everything necessary to achieve their goal. They \nare willing\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\nto kill Israelis. They are willing to kill Americans. They have killed \nthem both. Even worse, they are willing to put innocent Palestinians in \nharm's way, causing death and destruction within their own communities, \nto their own children, to their hospitals and to their schools.\n  They are in the interests of wracking up casualties to add what they \nconsider, in a warped way, moral force for their terrorist aim. I \nbelieve clearly in the evidence that this terrorist organization is \nwilling to stop at no end in order to build their tunnels and to \nadvocate and advance their independence.\n  They are willing to deny their people food. They are willing to deny \ntheir people construction materials that could be building schools and \nbuilding infrastructure. They are willing to deny medical supplies. \nThey are willing to deny a higher standard of living in order to \nsupport clearly terrorist activities.\n  This is unacceptable. This is unacceptable. This is unacceptable. We \nas Americans cannot advocate for or in any way accept a false peace \nthat will allow Hamas, a terrorist organization, to continue their \neffort to destroy the State of Israel. Hamas is not seeking peace. \nHamas is not seeking the peaceful coexistence between two states. What \nthey are simply doing is they are willing to cause death and \ndestruction to destroy Israel. Hamas is not a democratically elected \norganization. They are a terrorist organization. They do not speak for \nthe Palestinian people. Hamas speaks for Hamas.\n  Their history of killing Americans and Israelis and putting countless \nof their own people in harm's way, causing their destruction and their \ndenial of the basics, must be stopped. For the sake of the Palestinian \npeople and for the sake of the Israeli people, we as a Nation cannot \nsupport any measure or any agenda that gives this terrorist \norganization harbor or support, that gives this terrorist organization \nany advantage in trying to achieve their end.\n  We cannot in this Nation advocate for that kind of false peace that \nallows Hamas to go back to tunneling, to firing rockets, to hiding \nmissiles in schools and in hospitals, and putting more innocent \nchildren in harm's way. We as Americans must advocate for a true peace \nwhere two sides clearly recognize the right for peaceful coexistence \nand where both sides pledge to a true cessation of aggression, not a \npeace that allows one side to go back to its evil end, to tunneling, to \nplotting, to preparing just for the next attack. We have seen this \nbefore in recent history. We cannot allow it again. Right now we are in \na state of crisis. America's voice must be resolute.\n  We stand with our allies. We stand with the democratic State of \nIsrael. We stand against terrorism.\n  This is why today I come before you in support of the $225 million in \nadditional funding requested by the Department of Defense to ensure \nthat the Iron Dome in Israel remains equipped to protect civilians from \nHamas-fired rockets.\n  Hamas has fired over 2,500 rockets at Israel over the past 3 weeks, \nwhile putting innocent Palestinians at risk to protect their stockpiles \nand their evil ends. Yesterday alone 51 rockets and mortar shells were \nfired at Israel.\n  In this time of crisis, America must stand for a true peace for the \nPalestinian people and for the Israeli people. Now, as a terrorist \norganization has evil ends to destroy the State of Israel, we must \nstand with our ally. We must stand with the State of Israel. We must \nstand for peace. Therefore, I support this expenditure and continue a \nresolute, unwavering, and unequivocal support of the continuance of the \nState of Israel.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking \naction this week on two extremely important measures for our Nation's \nveterans. First, Congress is poised to pass the Veterans Access, \nChoice, and Accountability Act. This compromise, bipartisan legislation \nwill, for the first time, provide our Nation's veterans who cannot \neasily get into a Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, health care \nfacility, the ability that most Americans already have: to choose their \nown doctor. I am also extremely pleased that the legislation allows \nsenior managers of the VA to be fired if they fail to do their jobs.\n  The Senate is also set to approve the nomination of Mr. Robert \nMcDonald to head the VA. As important as our legislation is for fixing \nthe VA, we cannot legislate a change in culture. Only the head of an \nagency can reform a toxic culture that allowed veterans to die on wait \nlists while senior officials lied in order to collect their bonuses.\n  I have met with Mr. McDonald and we see eye to eye on the massive \nproblems that need to be fixed and the challenges that lie ahead. I am \nconfident he is the right person with the right experience to lead the \nVA during this challenging time. He is a veteran himself but also has \ndecades of private sector management experience that will serve him \nwell in implementing the Veterans Choice Card and repairing the culture \nof the VA to focus on the veteran and restore honesty and \naccountability to that workforce. I thank him for accepting this \nchallenge to serve the Nation again and look forward to working with \nhim in the days ahead.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as we have learned over the past several \nmonths, there has been a clear and inexcusable lack of well-earned \nquality care and timely service provided to many veterans who depend on \nit from the Department of Veterans Affairs. I hope that the \nconfirmation of Robert McDonald as VA Secretary will be the next step \nforward in ensuring that our veterans and their families receive the \nbenefits, compensation, and support services they rightfully deserve. \nWhile I continue to recognize the hard work and commitment of the many \nmen and women working in the VA system, the broader organizational \nculture has failed to harness and strengthen individual efforts in \norder to fulfill our promises to men and women that serve and their \nfamilies.\n  When he assumes his new post Robert McDonald will have his work cut \nout for him at the VA, and he must lead the Department's deep soul-\nsearching. It is my hope that his management experience at Procter & \nGamble, including his experience addressing inefficiencies in a \ncorporate entity, will make him the right man for the job. The \nreplacement of a Cabinet Secretary alone does not increase \naccountability, nor does it reform the underlying problems that enabled \nthe environment we now find ourselves in. These foundational reforms \nmust take place throughout the management of the VA system, and they \nmust address long-term, as well as short-term, challenges.\n  I was also pleased to hear that after many rounds of negotiations, \nSenator Sanders and his counterpart in the House have finally reached a \ncompromise that addresses many of these needed reforms. I commend them \nboth, and I hope this legislation will be swiftly brought to the Senate \nand House floors and then signed by President Obama, so we can get back \non track in serving our veterans as they so honorably have served our \nNation. I look forward to working with the future Secretary McDonald to \nensure that timely access to quality care for our veterans and their \nfamilies is the ultimate priority of the VA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Robert Alan McDonald, of Ohio, to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander) and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. \nRoberts).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, July 23, 2014, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the amendment that has just been offered is \nan amendment the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and \nI have worked on for many weeks. It is a bipartisan agreement on \nemergency transportation funding that the Senate Finance Committee \nreported virtually unanimously 2 weeks ago.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this amendment as a replacement for \ntitle II of the House legislation. I will briefly describe why.\n  As the Senate debates transportation funding, it is abundantly clear \nthat all sides agree on the need for a long-term plan to rebuild the \nNation's infrastructure. A number of our colleagues, led by Chair \nBoxer, a number of Republicans, Senator Corker, and Senator Carper have \nmade that point repeatedly, and it is one I share.\n  We cannot have a big-league economy with little-league \ntransportation, and the chair of the Environment and Public Works \ncommittee, Senator Boxer, has consistently been on target, calling for \na long-term plan to rebuild the Nation's infrastructure. The reality is \nthat every Member of this body has constituents who are driving on \nhighways full of potholes and ruts, and our citizens end up having to \nwrite a big check for car repairs because of it.\n  The best way to fix America's transportation system is with a long-\nterm plan. The reality, however, is that to get to the long-term plan, \nwhat is needed first is a short-term path so we do not have the \ntransportation equivalent of a government shutdown where we don't have \nthe contracts being let and thousands of our people are put out of \nwork, and a big set of economic dominos starts to fall. We need a \nshort-term solution to prevent that from happening. That is what the \nSenate has before us today under a proposal from the Senate Finance \nCommittee which\n\n[[Page S5022]]\n\nSenator Hatch and I developed in a bipartisan fashion, working under \nthe regular order. This bill is before the Senate under regular order \nand it includes with Democratic proposals and Republican proposals. \nSenator Hatch and I worked with every member of the committee to draft \nour bill.\n  The House has offered its own plan, and Senator Hatch and I agreed to \nincorporate to the greatest extent possible House ideas in drafting our \nalternative, including adopting a measure of customs user fees and some \npension smoothing as revenue sources.\n  I would like to take a moment early on to highlight three major \ndifferences between what the Senate has done and what the House has \ndone because I think they are at the heart of the bipartisan case for \npassing this amendment.\n  First, I think the other body simply overuses pension smoothing. I \nwas struck in conversations with Senator Hatch and conversations with \ncolleagues--one of our colleagues said: What is really striking about \nwhat the House is talking about today is that instead of having one \nproblem, we would have two. We already know we have a huge challenge in \npaying for transportation long-term, as Senator Boxer has noted, but if \nyou go with the House approach, it overuses pension smoothing. You are \ngoing to have two challenges--one, to pay for transportation, and \nsecond, what are you going to do with the hopes and aspirations of all \nthose workers who are depending on their pensions?\n  The second is the House ignores the whole concept of tax compliance--\nsomething else that has had a strong bipartisan tradition here in the \nCongress. Tax compliance is not increasing taxes. It is not tax hikes. \nIt is not somebody jacking up people's taxes in the dead of night. This \nis about collecting taxes owed under current law. Let me emphasize \nthat. It is taxes owed under current law. Grover Norquist--somebody who \nis not exactly soft on taxes, and I probably wouldn't quote him on \neverything--makes that point as well, agreeing that what is in the \nSenate finance bill involves collecting taxes that are owed.\n  Finally, the House bill again ignores some of the important \nbipartisan legislation that Senator Hatch and I have included on \nmatters that are of great interest to many Senators, including the \ndistinguished President of the Senate.\n  Our bill promotes natural gas vehicles--natural gas, 50 percent \ncleaner than the other fossil fuels. Senator Bennet and Senator Burr \ncame together with some very good ideas on that. Senator Isakson and \nSenator Nelson also came up with an approach to strengthen pensions and \nhow they are accounted for. And I was very pleased that Senator Crapo \nwas very involved with Senator Bennet in improving water \ntransportation--something hugely important for the West, particularly \nright now when it is so dry back home and in all of the Western States.\n  So these are major differences between the House and the Senate \nefforts, and, again, each of those ideas I describe is a sensible, \nbipartisan approach that comes about because we used our regular order. \nFor example, the Bennet-Burr amendment adjusts tax laws to treat liquid \nnatural gas and diesel fuel on an energy-equivalent basis. That is \ngoing to reduce the tax on liquefied natural gas. That is going to help \nus encourage more use.\n  What Senator Isakson and Senator Nelson did clarifies pension rules \nand ensures that workers receive their earned benefits. Many of these \nindividuals took their jobs in their teens and put in three decades of \nwork by their late forties. When I look at what the House did in terms \nof pension smoothing, this raises real questions in my mind about \nwhether the Congress, without really thinking through an alternative \nset of pay-fors, is going to cause those young workers additional \nproblems.\n  Finally, as I have touched on, Senator Crapo and Senator Bennet have \ndone very good work. As we all know--particularly the chairman of the \nEnvironmental Public Works Committee--it is dry, dry, dry in the West, \nand what Senator Crapo and Senator Bennet did was come up with a \nbipartisan proposal that Senator Hatch and I have included that is \ngoing to help deliver water to farmers across the West.\n  With those bipartisan initiatives, we were able to pick up support \nfrom such important groups as America's Natural Gas Alliance, the \nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association, and the Western \nAgriculture and Conservation Association. They know that the only way \nto advance these important ideas is by adopting the amendment the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah and I have offered.\n  We have had some talk about how there is just not enough time to send \na Senate amendment back to the House. I heard that statement made \nearlier today. I have made it clear to all concerned and I will state \nit again: This work is going to be done this week. This is non-\nnegotiable. The Congress is going to get this resolved this week, and \nin no way, shape, or form are we going to have the transportation \nequivalent of a government shutdown. But the idea that the other body \nsays, ``Hey, it is our way or no highway,'' I don't think is a way to \nadvance the kind of bipartisan, bicameral approach that is going to \nhelp us deal with the big challenges.\n\n  I have already indicated, as Senator Boxer, the chair of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, has said so eloquently, we are \ngoing to have to deal with the long term. There are a lot of good ideas \nfor the long term. I think Senator Paul from Kentucky deserves to have \nhis ideas on repatriation addressed. We have a number of colleagues who \nare interested in the innovative approach used in Virginia. So we are \ngoing to have a variety of ideas to look at transportation funding for \nthe long term, but we have to get the short-term patch resolved in \norder to get to the long term.\n  That is why I think for the House to just say, Our way or no \nhighway--I think for us to accept it today would simply be to abdicate \nour responsibilities. I don't think we are sent here to just wring our \nhands and say, Oh, my goodness, we can't do anything. There is no time.\n  We are going to get this done this week. I believe the approach we \nhave built in the Finance Committee is a more responsible approach. \nThere certainly is time to compromise. The reality is our staff--and \nSenator Hatch and I have had a number of conversations with Chairman \nCamp on this, as I indicated earlier--Senator Hatch and I have agreed \nto adopt many of the House proposals. There is no reason this body \ncan't quickly come to agreement with the House. The Congress has \naddressed much bigger pieces of legislation and differences between the \nSenate and the House on tight timeframes in the past. The reality is \nthe Senate has to act first or we are sending a message--and I will \nclose with this because my colleague from Utah has been very patient \nand the distinguished chair of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee has been very patient. If we simply say all we are going to \ndo today is accept this House approach, this ``our way or no highway'' \nkind of approach, we are going to advance a bill that overuses pension \nsmoothing, and we are going to move away from an approach both \npolitical parties have felt very strongly about, which is that tax \ncompliance should be an ongoing part of our work. It should be a part \nof our work today and it should be part of the bipartisan efforts for \ntax reform that Senator Hatch and I are pursuing. It is not in the \nHouse bill. It is in the Senate bill. We would be walking away from \nthat provision by accepting the House approach, and we also would, as I \nhave indicated, be walking away from bipartisan efforts that are going \nto promote cleaner natural gas vehicles, bipartisan efforts that will \npromote water use, and the good work done by Senator Isakson and \nSenator Nelson on pensions at a time when we are very concerned about \ntheir future. We shouldn't do that today.\n  I am going to yield to my colleagues who have been doing very good \nwork on this issue. I think our plan is now Senator Hatch will make \nremarks on behalf of the bipartisan efforts in the Finance Committee. \nSenator Boxer, the chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nwill speak after Senator Hatch. It is my intention to stay here \nthroughout the afternoon. I think both sides would like to get this \ndone expeditiously, and I hope we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S5023]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to allow Senator Boxer to go first.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, not at all. Please proceed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my \ndistinguished colleague, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Today the Senate will vote on a short-term extension of funding for \nthe highway trust fund.\n  While it remains to be seen what shape that extension will take, \nCongress appears to be poised to pass legislation that will ensure that \nthe trust fund will not face a shortfall and that States will be able \nto continue to plan and implement their transportation projects. This \nis important. As many have noted, passing this extension will preserve \nthousands of jobs and prevent disruption of a number of different \nhighway projects that are currently in existence.\n  It has taken a lot of work to get to this point. It has required the \ncollective good will of Members of both parties and it has meant \ncompromise on both sides.\n  In the Senate Finance Committee, both Chairman Wyden and I worked \ntogether for weeks on a bipartisan Federal highway funding extension. \nAt the outset of these negotiations, I stated that I hoped any \nagreement to extend the solvency of the highway trust fund would \ncontain spending cuts and reforms to go along with any revenues. I \nfought hard on that point, but in the end that particular goal of mine, \nwith one exception, had to be set aside in order for an agreement to be \nreached. Of course that is how we pass legislation. If everyone got \neverything they wanted out of a deal, it would not be a compromise. \nWhile I maintain that a deal to extend funding for the highway bill \nshould include reductions in spending, I am willing to continue that \nparticular fight on another day.\n  After weeks of negotiations--some of which were very hard fought--we \nwere able to come to an agreement on a funding bill that I believe both \nparties can support. That, in my view, is more important than any \nindividual demand I may have had going into the discussions.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to speak about the specifics of our \nproposal. Overall, our bill would provide nearly $11 billion in funding \nfor the highway trust fund, which is enough to extend its life until \nthe middle of next year. Of that total, $2.7 billion would be provided \nby pension smoothing. I do have to say I am not a fan of using pension \nsmoothing as a pay-for on the highway bill or in any other context for \nthat matter. We stated as much on the record numerous times. However, \nwe do face a funding emergency with regard to the highway trust fund. \nThat being the case, I was willing to compromise on that point.\n  Next, the bill provides an additional $2.9 billion by extending \nCustoms user fees. Once again, in other contexts, I have been skeptical \nof using this tactic as a pay-for, mostly because it diverts necessary \nfunding away from national trade priorities. However, we drafted the \nbill to ensure that enough money was left in future extensions to pay \nfor things such as the Generalized System of Preferences, the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act, and the miscellaneous tariff bill, all of \nwhich are important to our Nation's trade agenda.\n\n  Our compromise bill also transfers $1 billion from the leaking \nunderground storage tank trust fund--called LUST--to the highway trust \nfund. The remaining funds would be raised through a variety of tax \ncompliance measures, all designed not to raise taxes but to realize \nrevenues already owed to the Treasury.\n  The Finance Committee bill does include a provision designed to claw \nback orphan earmarks. The provision deals with earmarks included in \nprevious highway bills. I wish to thank Senator Coburn for the idea \nthat was the basis of this provision, though in the end we didn't go as \nfar as he or I would have liked.\n  As I said, all told, our bill will provide nearly $11 billion in \nfunding for the highway trust fund and prevent the funding crisis that \nis on the horizon if Congress does not act. Once again, this \nlegislation represents a bipartisan agreement between Chairman Wyden \nand myself. It was reported out of the Finance Committee by a voice \nvote, so it is an agreement by both sides.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Wyden for his willingness to reach across \nthe aisle in this effort. He has been a particularly good partner with \nwhom to work. The Finance Committee has a long tradition of working on \na bipartisan basis to provide funding for the highway trust fund, and I \nam glad we have been able to continue that tradition with this \nlegislation.\n  My only regret is that we were not able to reach an agreement with \nChairman Camp of the House Ways and Means Committee, whom both the \nchairman and I highly respect. He has a tough job over there, and we \nhave nothing but great respect for him.\n  The two committees met over the July 4 recess, and I believe both \nChairman Camp and Chairman Wyden acted in good faith to try to reach an \nagreement, but in the end, it did not end up happening. In my view, \nthis is unfortunate. Had we been able to reach a bipartisan, bicameral \nsolution on this issue at the outset, it would have helped to speed \nthis process along. Still, if we take a look at the bill the House \npassed earlier this month, we will find it is similar in many respects \nto the legislation Chairman Wyden and I have put together. They provide \nvirtually the same level of funding, so there is not a substantive \ndifference in the amount of time they would extend the trust fund. The \nmajor funding pieces--pension smoothing, Customs user fees, and the \nLUST transfer--are all the same. The primary difference is that the \nHouse bill does not include the tax compliance provisions.\n  Neither the House bill nor our bill is perfect, in my opinion, but \nthey both accomplish the same goal and they do so in a way that under \nthe circumstances I think both Democrats and Republicans can and should \nsupport.\n  So while some would say we failed to reach an agreement on the \nhighway bill, I think it is pretty clear there is a lot of agreement on \nthese matters and that one way or another we are going to get a \nsolution soon.\n  In the end Chairman Camp produced what I think is a good bill. I \nthink Chairman Wyden and I have done the same. I would vote for either \napproach because, as I said, they aren't all that different from one \nanother. I reiterate that the funding levels in the House bill and the \nFinance Committee bill--and therefore the length of the two \nextensions--are virtually the same. That point is important, as there \nis an effort, as evidenced by another amendment we will be voting on \ntoday, to put an artificial deadline on the extension. I gather from \nthe statements made by proponents of this approach that they hope this \namendment will somehow force Congress to reach an agreement on a long-\nterm extension before the end of this year. This effort is, in my view, \nmisguided, and I would hope, given the fact that both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate Finance Committee have reached virtually \nthe same conclusion on the length of the extension, Senators will think \ntwice before voting to shorten it.\n  Ultimately, we all want to get to a long-term deal when it comes to \nthe highway trust fund. That desire is shared across both Chambers and \nboth parties. I think we can get there. I don't think we need to impose \nan artificial timeline or deadline--one that would create a similar \ncrisis to the one we are facing now just a few months down the road--in \norder to do it.\n  There are other efforts out there that would seriously alter the \ntrajectory of this bill. I wish to stress that what we are working on \nis a short-term extension. Once the highway trust fund has been funded \nby this bill, we will need to start working on a long-term bill that \nwill give the transportation community stability and predictability, \nand I believe both the chairman of the committee and myself truly mean \nwe will do so. We will need to be thoughtful in our approach and must \nconsider every option to ensure that our Nation's infrastructure will \nbe safe, efficient, and reliable well into the future. But before we \ndiscuss any fundamental changes to the structure of the highway trust \nfund, we need to get this step out of the way first.\n  As I conclude, I wish to take a moment to once again commend our \nchairman, Chairman Wyden, for his efforts on this legislation. From the \noutset he was willing to reach across the\n\n[[Page S5024]]\n\naisle on this bill and as a result the Finance Committee produced a \nviable, bipartisan product. His leadership in getting us to this point \nhas been essential.\n  We are very close to solving this problem and avoiding a crisis. We \njust need to get a bill over the finish line, and I hope we can do that \nin short order. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take my time off the \ngeneral debate time; is that appropriate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I am so pleased to be on the floor \nbecause the Senate has to be heard on this issue of the highway trust \nfund and our whole transportation system for that matter. I do wish to \npraise Senators Wyden and Hatch for coming together across party lines \nand making some real improvements in the pay-fors that are associated \nwith this extension. I am very much in favor of the way they handled \nthis bill, and I am also very much in favor of the way the pension \nsmoothing was handled in the Carper-Corker-Boxer amendment because that \ndoes away with it altogether, because we shorten the timeframe so we \ndon't need any pension smoothing in there.\n  Before I speak specifically about the wisdom of what the Finance \nCommittee did and my hope that we can get it over the finish line \ntoday, I want to give kind of an overview of where we are in general.\n  For 2 years we have known that our Transportation bill expired \nSeptember 30. We have known this for 2 years. Yet, and still, here we \nare at the 11th hour with an extension.\n\n  This is probably, I think, the 12th extension in a few years. I think \nthat is so unfair to the people of this great country who rely on their \nbridges and their highways and their transportation systems. It is so \nunfair to the thousands of businesses that work to rebuild our \ninfrastructure, and it is very unfair to the millions of workers who \nwork in construction.\n  We still have 700,000 unemployed construction workers. When we do a \npiecemeal bill like this, of course, it is better than doing nothing--\nthere is no doubt about that; I would not argue that--but it still \nsends a message of indecision and, frankly, I think of incompetence on \nour part, and I step to the plate on that.\n  But I am very proud to say that my committee--100 percent bipartisan; \nwe did not have a dissenting vote--passed the 6-year transportation \nbill. When we did that, I went to my colleagues and said: I know you \nhave the hard job. You have to figure out the long-term funding. I want \nto help you. I came forward and I said: Why don't we look at several \nproposals. One is what they are doing in Virginia. This was a \nRepublican idea. It is to do away with the gas tax completely and \nreplace it with a fee at the refinery level. That would be a more \nbroad-based tax. We would do away with the gas tax. No more Federal gas \ntax at the pump. That would solve our problems. You set it at a rate \nwhere it floats, and we would have 100 percent certainty. Senator Wyden \nwas quite open to it. He took a look at it. I know he floated it. \nClearly, we did not have the type of support we would need.\n  Then the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO said: Do you know what. \nWe have not raised the gas tax in 21 years. Mr. President, we have not \nraised the gas tax in 21 years. I did a little reading and found out \nthe first President to initiate the gas tax--and I say to Senator \nHatch, he might be interested in this--the first President to formulate \na gas tax--and it came in at a penny--was Herbert Hoover. The next \nPresident who raised it was President Eisenhower, who had that great \nvision to then put it into a trust fund for highways, and he raised it \na couple of cents. So it was about 3 cents. The next President to raise \nit was President Reagan. And the next President to raise it was George \nHerbert Walker Bush. They were all Republican Presidents. Then \nPresident Clinton raised it.\n  Clearly the Congress supported it each and every time because it is a \nuser fee. So that is an alternative. There are many other ideas. I know \nSenator Wyden and Senator Hatch have a number of ideas, and I know \nSenator Hatch prefers a user fee. It makes sense. But because of the \ntime crunch--because of, because of, because of--we did not get it \ndone.\n  I am proud. Senator Vitter is proud. We got it out of our committee, \na 6-year bill. It is not a great, massive bill. It just takes the \ncurrent program, adds inflation, and extends it for 6 years. I can tell \nyou, if Senator Vitter and I can agree, if Senator Carper and Senator \nBarrasso can agree, if Senator Cardin can agree with Senator Sessions, \nand Senator Sanders with Senator Fischer--I could go on. Our committee \ngoes from left to right, and everybody agreed we should have the 6-year \nbill.\n  So as I stand here today, I am distressed that we do not have that \nbefore us, but I am still grateful to my friends for doing what they \ncould politically do. But I feel it is a sad day for us, and I know and \nI hope we pass this Wyden-Hatch substitute. It is a much-improved way \nto pay for the extension. But we are extending all the way to May, \nright up against the next construction season. Now, if you are a \nState--whether it is Utah or California or West Virginia or Maryland or \nOregon; it does not matter--you are not going to enter into any \nagreement. No businessperson is going to take this on where you do not \nknow what the future holds.\n  So we are putting it off again, and it is sad we are doing it, and we \nhave 60, 70, 80 groups out there, which I will list later, that are \nsupporting our shortening the timeframe.\n  Now, my friend says artificial deadlines are bad. But let's face it. \nTheir bill raises--I think it is $11 billion. Am I right on that? So we \nknow it takes it to May 31. That is their deadline. Our bill, in the \nCarper-Corker-Boxer rewrite, takes it to December. We cut it back. We \ntotally eliminate pension smoothing--totally eliminate it--and we take \nit back to $8 billion, and that forces us to do the job in December.\n  Look, this Congress has to do its work. The trust fund expires during \nthis Congress. Now we are kicking it down the road to the next \nCongress.\n  Whatever the Senate wishes, I will go along with it. If the Senate \nsays, no, we are going to go with that longer term extension, so be it. \nI will fight just as hard to move forward with a 6-year bill, I say to \nmy colleagues, when we get back or in a lameduck.\n  I want to close by talking a little bit about pension smoothing for \njust a minute because I so agree with Senator Hatch when he says this \nis not his favorite thing. It is not my favorite thing either, and we \ncome from different sides of the aisle.\n  So just to be clear, what we are saying to companies is, you can set \naside less money for your pension requirements to your employees. Now, \nI have to admit in the light of day, I voted for that the last time \nwhen Senator Baucus brought that forward. I did. But it also was a \ncompany buy, an increase in the amount of money companies had to pay \ninto the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. If a company goes broke \nand they cannot pay their pensions because they have not set aside \nenough--and with our help they are not having to set aside enough--what \nhappens then? The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp kicks in, and that is \nfunded by the companies. But if that does not have enough--and my \ninformation is it is short $34 billion, as we speak--the taxpayers will \nhave to bail it out. So this pension smoothing is really, really \ndangerous. It is an offset that is not a good one.\n  Now, the Wyden-Hatch proposal is much, much better than the House \nproposal because it cuts it basically in half. The Carper-Corker bill \ncuts it out completely. So we just have to step to the plate. I think \nSenator Wyden is right. Here we are bailing out--if I could use those \nterms--the highway trust fund until May, while we set up another \npotential weakness in our pension system. It is not smart. It should \nnot be done. We had 2 years to figure this out.\n  But no question--no question--the Wyden-Hatch proposal is a far \nbetter proposal. Just making sure people pay their taxes, that is \nsomething we should all believe in, and, for the first time, the two \nSenators brought that issue forward to a successful conclusion. I am \nvery, very grateful to them for that. So I very strongly support this.\n  I hope we will see a lot of support for the amendment that Senators \nCarper,\n\n[[Page S5025]]\n\nCorker, and I brought forward because we do away with pension \nsmoothing. So if you do not like pension smoothing, vote for that one; \nand we cut back the money so we can take this whole thing up in \nDecember and give some certainty to all the groups out there, whether \nit is the Chamber of Commerce or the general contractors or the cement \npeople or the gravel people or the AFL-CIO or the laborers. All these \nfolks want to make sure we are not just doing a little cut and paste \nand get us up against the next thing.\n  I keep saying ``in closing,'' but I really mean it now. What you are \ndealing with here, if you want to use an analogy, is: You find a house \nyou really like, so you go to the bank, and the bank looks at you and \nsays: Well, you are a good risk. Yes, we will definitely give you a \nmortgage, but it is only for 9 months. Nobody is going to take that \nmortgage. Our States are not going to enter into 3-year contracts when \nthey know they only are going to get the funding for 9 months. We have \nan amendment by Senator Lee which would cut the Federal Government's \nability to help the States and wind up with an 80-percent cut in \nfunding. So it is very risky moving out with all these things hanging \nover our head.\n  But I am still pleased with what the Finance Committee did. I thank \nSenators Reid and McConnell for allowing us to have this time on the \nfloor and all of my colleagues for agreeing, because this is a debate \nthat has to start somewhere. So it is starting today. We know whatever \nhappens, we are just doing a patch, and we are going to have to sit \ndown together with good will and good ideas and solve this problem for \nthe good of our country.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Carper, Corker \nand Boxer amendment to the highway trust fund extension Bill before us \ntoday. This amendment will provide certainty and a guaranteed funding \nstream that our State departments of transportation and the \nconstruction industry desperately need. It provides a short-term \nextension through December 19, 2014, which will allow Congress to \ncomplete its work on a multi-year bill this year. The underlying bill \nonly prolongs uncertainty by extending the solvency of the trust fund \nto May of 2015.\n  In the last transportation authorization bill, I fought for a Federal \nformula that gives the State of Maryland approximately $780 million \nannually from the highway trust fund: $580 million for highway funding \nand $200 million for transit funding. The Maryland Department of \nTransportation's, MDOT, average weekly expenditure of these Federal \nfunds is $10 to $12 million. Right now during construction season, MDOT \nis submitting reimbursements to the U.S. Department of Transportation \nfor $20 million a week.\n  Without this extension, the Federal highway trust fund will go \nbankrupt in a matter of weeks. What does this mean for my home State of \nMaryland? I am advised that MDOT will not meet its commitments. The \nDepartment would be unable to begin new projects. It would be forced to \nfocus on safety and system preservation instead of putting shovels into \nthe ground. Existing projects will slow down or stop. The State of \nMaryland would have to find bond or State revenues to pay existing \ncontracts. Most importantly, over 9,000 construction jobs will be in \njeopardy.\n  This is why MDOT, other State departments of transportation, and the \nconstruction industry support a multi-year bill. Enacting a long-term \nbill this year will provide certainty with a guaranteed funding stream, \nallow MDOT to plan for the future, and provide stability to the \nconstruction industry. Projects take time and thoughtful planning \naveraging approximately 10 years to complete through construction.\n  In addition, a multi-year bill will strengthen our transportation \nnetworks improving safety and reducing congestion. It also will create \n3 million jobs and support our economy.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote for the Carper, Corker and Boxer \namendment. I also ask unanimous consent that the op-ed Senator Cardin \nand I wrote in the Baltimore Sun be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Time To End the Gridlock That Takes Its Toll on Maryland's Highways\n\n   (By U.S. Senators Barbara A. Mikulski and Ben Cardin (Both D-Md))\n\n       It is now peak construction season and without \n     congressional action the federal highway trust fund will go \n     bankrupt (expenditures will exceed receipts) in August--next \n     month. As the Senators for Maryland, we are fighting for a \n     multi-year transportation bill to provide planning and \n     funding certainty to our state.\n       Federal gas and diesel taxes paid at the pump are the \n     primary revenue streams for the highway trust fund, which \n     provides formula funding to states for both highway and \n     transit projects.\n       We fought for a formula that provides Governor Martin \n     O'Malley and Maryland Transportation Secretary Jim Smith \n     approximately $780 million annually to spend across the \n     state: $580 million in highway formula funding and $200 \n     million in transit formula funding.\n       The cause of the Highway Trust Fund's insolvency is \n     threefold: big improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency; \n     reduced driving; and inflation. The last time Congress \n     increased the gas tax was in 1993 from 14.1 cents per gallon \n     to 18.4 cents per gallon. These three factors have resulted \n     in lower gas tax revenues, reduced purchasing power, and \n     trust fund receipts not keeping up with demand.\n       A bankrupt Highway Trust Fund means the Maryland Department \n     of Transportation (MDOT) would stop receiving $80 million a \n     month in reimbursements from the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation. As a result, MDOT will have to use state \n     money obligated for other project to cover its federal \n     expenditures. In other words, MDOT will be forced to rob \n     Peter to pay Paul. New projects will not be initiated and \n     existing projects will slow down or stop. The Department also \n     will be forced to focus solely on system preservation instead \n     of new construction needed to improve safety and modernize \n     our transportation network.\n       Maryland needs a multi-year bill that ensures the solvency \n     of the federal highway trust fund. A multi-year \n     transportation bill is estimated to create two million jobs \n     nationwide and transportation loans and grants create another \n     million. Doing nothing is utterly unacceptable, and short-\n     term extensions do not provide the planning and funding \n     certainty states need to put those three million workers on \n     the jobs necessary to maintain and improve our nation's \n     essential transportation assets. In an uncertain economic \n     climate, investments in transportation infrastructure creates \n     jobs in construction, engineering, and manufacturing right \n     here in the United States.\n       A multi-year transportation bill will help businesses \n     succeed by making sure goods and products get to where they \n     need to go. U.S. trade is expected to double in the next \n     thirteen years and our national transportation assets must \n     serve the growing economic demands for U.S. goods and \n     services. We must modernize and maintain our infrastructure \n     or we risk diminished profits and falling behind our \n     international competitors in the global marketplace.\n       It also creates certainty for commuters and families. \n     Traffic congestion wastes over 2.9 billion gallons of fuel \n     each year. Maryland commuters have the longest commutes in \n     America.\n       Unfortunately, the gridlock in Congress only leads to more \n     gridlock on our nation's roads. When it comes to funding our \n     nation's infrastructure, we've suffered from roadblocks and \n     standstills. Despite our calls for more funding our roads, \n     highways, bridges and railways are in dire need of repair.\n       That's why we work hard as Maryland's one-two punch for \n     transportation funding Senator Cardin serving on the \n     Environment and Public Works, and Finance Committee creates \n     the policy and authorizes the programs that guide \n     infrastructure investments for Maryland and the nation. \n     Senator Mikulski as Chairwoman of the Appropriations \n     Committee puts the funds in the federal checkbook to keep \n     Marylanders moving.\n       We know strong transportation infrastructure is a key \n     ingredient to economic growth. It protects the safety and \n     reliability of travel and transportation. It also supports \n     our economy with investments in the highways, public transit, \n     airports, passenger rail and ports. This money creates \n     engineering and construction jobs today and prepares us for \n     jobs tomorrow bringing growth to our economy. The $13.1 \n     billion Maryland spent in transportation over the last five \n     years has generated $29.3 billion in business output, \n     including $12.9 billion in wages and nearly 35,000 jobs per \n     year.\n       We also know that infrastructure projects don't just happen \n     but they require smart planning. It's why we are united with \n     the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Society of Civil \n     Engineers, and the American Association of State Highway and \n     Transportation Officials in fighting for a multi-year \n     transportation this year.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, our tight knit communities in Vermont are \npart and parcel of my State's culture of neighbors helping neighbors. \nOur neighbors are not just next door; they are often in the most rural \nparts of the State, which can be difficult to reach. Our roads and our \nbridges connect us in a most basic way, and Hurricane Irene was a stark \nreminder that our infrastructure connects us not only in commercial \nways, but in practical social ways that are integral to the spirit of \nVermont communities. After Irene, with some of our roads and bridges \ncompletely destroyed, we saw, felt and lived what it truly meant to be \ncut off and isolated from our surrounding communities.\n  As Congress faces a deadline in the Highway Trust Fund, we are facing \nyet another artificial, made-in-Congress crisis for our States, their \npeople, and for the Nation. Congress is senselessly imposing these \nstrains and lost opportunities on this country. There are\n\n[[Page S5026]]\n\nthose in Congress in recent years whose approach to governing is ``my \nway, or the highway.'' This time, even the highway is not safe from \ntheir obstructionism. This is a crisis we can avert if we would only \nwork together to agree on a long-term funding plan for the Nation's \ntransportation programs. I commend the Committee on Environment & \nPublic Works for their hard work on legislation to reauthorize the \nMoving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, MAP-21, and I \ncommend the Committee on Finance for its hard work in trying to solve \nthe funding issues we face in developing and improving our country's \ninfrastructure.\n  However, I had hoped the Senate would have responsibly agreed to a \nlong-term plan to give State and local governments the certainty and \nstability they need to plan. Unfortunately, that was not the case. And \nwhile a short term fix avoids a transportation catastrophe this summer, \nit will also increase costs of transportation projects, limit the \nability of State and local governments to plan infrastructure \nimprovement, and ultimately result in the degradation of our country's \ninfrastructure. Start-and-stop highway construction is even more \nwasteful than start-and-stop driving is on our roads. It is wasteful, \nit hurts our communities and our economy, and it is needless.\n  The Highway Trust Fund is a critical asset for Vermont, as it is for \nevery State. It provides millions of dollars to repair our roads and \nbridges and creates jobs for thousands of Vermonters. According to the \nState of Vermont, every $1 million of transportation funding supports \nabout 35 jobs in Vermont, directly and through the maintenance of the \nState's transportation infrastructure. Construction companies, sign-\nmakers, State employees, and every citizen will suffer the consequence \nof the inability to make progress on this vital issue.\n  While this short-term fix has become necessary, we must acknowledge \nwhat long-term funding for infrastructure represents: opportunity. \nLarge, long-term investments in infrastructure have paid off in the \npast. President Eisenhower's ``grand plan'' for the Interstate Highway \nSystem was an ambitious project that many questioned at the time. \nToday, it is indisputable that the vision of President Eisenhower and \nthe foresight of the legislators in Congress who authorized the \nInterstate Highway System have strengthened our economy in every corner \nof the Nation, providing the opportunity for the American people and \ntheir families and businesses to grow, travel, and invest in the \nfuture. There are many Vermonters, and citizens all across the Nation, \nwho are counting on us to provide a comprehensive, long-term solution \nto this problem. By coming together, we have an incredible opportunity \nto invest in the wellbeing of future Americans, and of our country. Let \nus not continue this latest made-in-Congress crisis. Let us pass the \nreauthorization of MAP-21 before the new December deadline.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer very much and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3585\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending amendment so I may call up my amendment No. 3585, \nwhich is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Toomey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3585.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To ease Federal burdens on State and local governments \n                  recovering from catastrophic events)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 10__. EMERGENCY EXEMPTIONS.\n\n       Any road, highway, railway, bridge, or transit facility \n     that is damaged by an emergency that is declared by the \n     Governor of the State and concurred in by the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security or declared as an emergency by the \n     President pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief \n     and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) and \n     that is in operation or under construction on the date on \n     which the emergency occurs--\n       (1) may be reconstructed in the same location with the same \n     capacity, dimensions, and design as before the emergency; and\n       (2) shall be exempt from any environmental reviews, \n     approvals, licensing, and permit requirements under--\n       (A) the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.);\n       (B) sections 402 and 404 of the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342, 1344);\n       (C) the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 \n     et seq.);\n       (D) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.);\n       (E) the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et \n     seq.);\n       (F) the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661 \n     et seq.);\n       (G) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n     seq.), except when the reconstruction occurs in designated \n     critical habitat for threatened and endangered species;\n       (H) Executive Order 11990 (42 U.S.C. 4321 note; relating to \n     the protection of wetland); and\n       (I) any Federal law (including regulations) requiring no \n     net loss of wetland.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, let me start by complimenting my \ncolleagues, the chairman and the ranking member of this committee, for \na genuine, sincere effort at a bipartisan solution to a difficult \nproblem. There are provisions I like in this legislation. There are \nprovisions I do not like. But I do like the fact that at least with \nrespect to this legislation at the moment the Senate is functioning. \nThe committee was functioning and had a vigorous debate and discussion \nand came up with a reasonable approach. I thank Chairman Wyden and \nRanking Member Hatch for their cooperative effort to do this.\n  But I want to address this particular amendment, amendment No. 3585. \nI thank my cosponsor on this amendment, Senator McConnell. What this \namendment does, in short, is it allows communities that are recovering \nfrom a natural disaster to rebuild damaged infrastructure without \nhaving to acquire--or maybe I should say reacquire--Federal \nenvironmental permits.\n  Now, there is no question we all agree it is vitally important we \nprotect our environment. I should point out there is nothing in my \namendment that would change Federal environmental permitting \nrequirements for any new construction--nothing at all. We should also \nrecognize that States have their own very substantial standards in \nplace to protect their environments, including during the construction \nof transportation infrastructure projects. There is nothing in my \namendment that would weaken in any way or change in any way any State \nenvironmental laws or regulations.\n  The fact is our Federal environmental permitting process for \ninfrastructure is broken. It is too cumbersome. It takes too long. It \nis too costly. It is a huge problem. I think the most damming statistic \nI can think of--that I am aware of anyway--is from the Federal Highway \nAdministration itself, which in fiscal year 2011 estimated that on \naverage transportation projects required 79 months to complete the \nNational Environmental Policy Act review process, the NEPA review \nprocess--79 months. That is 6\\1/2\\ years to get permission from the \nFederal Government to build a road or a bridge or to rebuild an \nexisting road or bridge that has been damaged--6\\1/2\\ years. That is \noften longer--sometimes a lot longer--than it takes to actually do the \nconstruction, and that is a problem. It is a problem because it just \ndrives the costs up dramatically and unnecessarily.\n  Two weeks ago, constituents of mine in Northampton County, PA, \nreported to my office that just one environmental survey for a small \nbridge repair--we are not talking about some massive, new ``Golden Gate \nBridge'' here; we are talking about a little bridge that is just going \nto be repaired--just one of the environmental surveys was $21,000 \nalone.\n  Senator Rob Portman reports that in Ohio Federal environmental \npermitting alone increases project costs on average by 20 percent.\n  The reason these delays are so expensive is all of these delays, all \nof these permitting requirements, require consultants to carry it out, \nand there are all kinds of engineering and consulting fees that get \npaid, often on retainer over time; it also means that while\n\n[[Page S5027]]\n\nwaiting for a road or a bridge to be rebuilt or restored, there are \nlonger commutes, there is a big detour, there is more consumption of \ngas. That is all a waste of time and money. The bottom line is that \nprojects cost more the longer they take. That is the reality. The fact \nis, recovering communities do not need to have to incur this extra \ncost.\n  I will give you an example, again in Pennsylvania. Since 2010, \nFederal environmental permitting has delayed nine projects by over a \nyear. The Cherry Creek Bridge in Monroe County, PA--this is an area \nthat is flood prone; it was struck by Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane \nIrene in 2011--the reconstruction for the damaged transportation \ninfrastructure should have started pretty much right away, but Fish and \nWildlife review delays alone cost us 2 years before construction could \neven begin. Senator Ben Nelson recognized this problem--a Democrat from \nNebraska who served in this body--and offered a bipartisan amendment to \nthe last highway bill, MAP-21.\n\n  What his amendment would have done would have been to exempt roads \nand bridge repair projects from Federal environmental permitting if the \nroads and bridges were destroyed by a declared emergency, such as \nSuperstorm Sandy, for instance, and provided that the reconstruction \nwould occur entirely within the footprint of the existing structure, \nthe original footprint.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Nelson never got his vote. He was denied a \nvote. Instead, he got a watered-down provision put into the final bill \nthat allows the Department of Transportation, under certain \ncircumstances, to exclude certain repair projects from this whole \nprocess. But they cannot make that exclusion if the project is deemed \nto be ``controversial.'' Undefined. I do not know what that means. The \nexclusions do not apply to the Army Corps of Engineers or the Fish and \nWildlife Service, the reviews of which constituents tell me are the \nmost time consuming, cumbersome, and costly to comply with.\n  The result is that recovering communities today, after they have been \nhit hard by a natural disaster, after they have incurred damage to \ntheir roads, their bridges, their infrastructure, do not know what \nenvironmental standards are going to apply to them, except that some \ncertainly will, and others may or may not be exempted.\n  It still leaves them subject to a lengthy, costly, and unnecessary \nprocedure. Because, once again, let me emphasize, we are talking about \nroads and bridges that are already there. We are not talking about new \ninfrastructure, new capacity. We are talking about rebuilding what was \nthere already and what was damaged.\n  This amendment I am offering is almost identical to the Nelson \namendment. The difference is, at the request of SPTA, which is the \nSoutheast Pennsylvania Transit Authority, it has been expanded to \ninclude not just roads and bridge but also rail and transit facility \nrepair projects. That is it. So it simply says: These existing \ntransportation infrastructure facilities, if they are damaged or \ndestroyed by a declared natural disaster, the rebuilding, the identical \nrebuilding in that very same footprint should not be subject to going \nthrough the whole environmental permitting process all over again. That \nis all it says.\n  I am glad to have the endorsement of a number of organizations and \ngroups: Associated General Contractors, National Association of \nCounties, Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste.\n  I argue this is just common sense. This is a modest, narrow \namendment. As I say, it does not in any way, shape, form, or fashion \nchange any regulations or permitting requirements for any new \nconstruction. It says nothing whatsoever about the extensive State \nrequirements. It is silent about all of that. It simply says: With \nrespect to Federal environmental permitting, if you are rebuilding an \nexisting road or bridge because it has been damaged in this way, you do \nnot have to go through this costly, lengthy process that is costing us \ntime, money, jobs, and infrastructure.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania for his comments and the manner in which we are \nproceeding.\n  I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania, and for many reasons.\n  First, let me compliment Senator Boxer and the leadership on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. Because when we approved MAP-\n21, we took up this issue. We dealt with it. It was not without \ncontroversy. We had strong views on both sides of this issue. Because \nwhat the Senator from Pennsylvania is doing is removing completely \nreplacement facilities from any--not just the NEPA procedures, but also \nfrom the Endangered Species Act, from the Clean Water Act--basically \nputting a dome over the process so anything goes, basically. Anything.\n  We debated that issue in the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nThere were different views. Quite frankly, Senator Boxer was extremely \naccommodating to the legitimate concerns the Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas raised. That is why there is an expedited procedure already in law, \npassed in MAP-21, that deals with this issue. The Senator talks about \nusing the proper legislative process. We did that. The committee of \njurisdiction debated it. We had difficult compromises, but we reached \nthese compromises.\n  Let the process work, because the process is working. Let me point \nout, I was one of those who was not excited about giving up any of our \nenvironmental protections on replacement facilities, because I pointed \nout the fact that when we had a bridge collapse in Minnesota, that \nbridge was replaced within a matter of a very short period of time, \nbefore we did our compromise, which now expedites the process. My point \nis, in emergencies we seem to work things out. But in order to deal \nwith the concerns the Senator has raised, we put into the law this \nexpedited procedure for replacement facilities. It is in MAP-21. It is \nthe law.\n  This amendment would open it to significant abuse. It is very \nconceivable that when you give this type of an exemption, you basically \nare exempting a geographical spot so that anything goes. It could be a \ntotal ending of the protections that we have in the Federal Clean Water \nAct. It could be eliminated.\n  I would urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. It is \nunnecessary. It certainly opens it to tremendous abuse. We have a \nprocess in place. It was negotiated. I would urge my colleagues to \naccept it.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to thank Senator Wyden. I want to \nthank Senator Boxer and Senator Hatch--I see them on the floor--and \nSenator Carper for their incredible work on this bill. I agree with \nSenators Boxer and Wyden. It is very important that we pass a bill \nbefore we leave this week so that there is no delay in making sure the \nFederal Government pays its bills to our State and local governments on \ntransportation projects.\n  I strongly support Senator Wyden and Senator Hatch's effort in our \ncommittee to get a better funding flow for the patch so we deal with \ncollecting the taxes that should be paid, rather than causing a \ndisruption in some of the revenue sources that are in the House bill. I \nstrongly support Senator Wyden and Senator Hatch's efforts in our \ncommittee.\n  I certainly support Senator Carper's amendment that would say it is \nour responsibility to act in this Congress.\n  Let me point out, we have 5 months left before this Congress goes out \nof business. It would be wrong for us to pass just a patch and not to \ndo the 6-year reauthorization. The Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, by unanimous vote, recognized that we could get a 6-year \nbill done. We have already talked about from where revenues can come. \nThere are bills we could take up dealing with supplemental ways to fund \ninfrastructure, infrastructure banks, using the Tax Code. I am sure we \ncan get bipartisan agreement on some of these issues.\n  The Carper amendment says we are going to get our job done in this \nCongress and we are not going to subject our States to the uncertainty \nof just a patch. In my State of Maryland, we have many long-term \ncommitments that we are trying to get funded. A short-term patch will \nput us in a hole.\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\nWe are okay to the end of the year, but let's make sure we enact a 6-\nyear bill before this Congress leaves.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I would be glad to yield to my colleague from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I wanted to ask him a question. \nBecause I think the way the Senator responded to the Toomey amendment \nwas exactly right on point. It was almost a deja vu as I listened to my \nfriend from Pennsylvania, because he is not on the committee of \njurisdiction. But we had this debate, as my friend pointed out. As a \nmatter of fact, I started to get a little stressed as he related what \nwe went through to get to the point where we have an expedited \nprocedure that takes care of the problems my friend from Pennsylvania \ntalks about.\n\n  But we do not throw out every landmark environmental law. That would \nbe a disaster. I can give you an example and ask my friend if he agrees \nwith this example.\n  I also want to point out the American Public Health Association \nstrongly opposes Senator Toomey's amendment, because they know the \nhealth of the people is at stake.\n  But let's say you had a situation where you brought in a contractor \nto clean up after there was a disaster, collapse, let's say, of a \nhighway. There was a body of water nearby. The contractor came in. \nInstead of having a good clean operation, he started dumping his fuel \nand chemicals and everything else into this waterway. Mind you, under \nour law he has already got an expedited permit, he is ready to roll. \nBut he or she, they have to be good citizens and not make matters \nworse.\n  Does my friend not agree that these landmark laws, such as the Clean \nWater Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, should be respected, and the \nToomey amendment throws them out the window, and we can endanger the \nhealth of the people?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I say to Senator Boxer, through the Chair, she is \nabsolutely right. It is even worse than that, because the contractor \ncould be using a subcontractor whose principal work may not even be \ndirectly related to the replacement. It would be virtually impossible \nto detect what they are doing on the replacement site as to what they \nare doing on other sites. So it could be absolutely used as a shield in \norder to avoid the laws that we have to protect public health, protect \nour clean waters, our drinking water, et cetera. It opens a huge \npotential abuse. It is throwing out the laws, rather than making the \nlaws work. That is exactly what our committee did after a very lengthy \ndebate and which, quite frankly, we did certain things that make it a \nlot easier for a replacement facility to be done in an expedited \nprocess.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I would like to address another issue \nconnected to this debate. Before I do so, I would yield a moment of my \ntime to my distinguished colleague, the junior Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah. Let me \nrespond to my colleagues from Maryland and California briefly.\n  First of all, I am perfectly glad that the committee of jurisdiction \naddressed this. One of the great things about the Senate is when it is \nactually functioning, Members who are not on a particular committee \nstill have the opportunity to weigh in on an issue and have that debate \non the Senate floor. That is exactly what we are doing today. I am glad \nwe are doing that.\n  I would also observe that my colleagues seem to have very little \nfaith in the ability and willingness of States to protect their own \nenvironment. They should spend some more time in Pennsylvania. We care \na lot about our environment in Pennsylvania. We have a Department of \nEnvironmental Protection that takes that responsibility very seriously.\n  Finally, I would point out that the so-called fix in MAP-21 is \nextremely incomplete. It is incomplete because, first, it occurs at the \ndiscretion of the Department of Transportation. They can simply choose \nnot to have an expedited process. If they deem the project to be \n``controversial''--undefined. Who knows what that means.\n  Secondly, the Department of Transportation is not permitted to \nexclude from this process compliance with the Army Corps of Engineers \nor the Fish and Wildlife Service reviews, which altogether are \nextremely time consuming and expensive and costly. Again, we are just \ntalking about repairing existing infrastructure. We are not talking \nabout waiving these requirements for new capacity, for new \ninfrastructure.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3584\n\n(Purpose: To empower States with authority for most taxing and spending \n            for highway programs and mass transit programs)\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending amendment so I can call up my amendment No. 3584, \nwhich is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Lee] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3584.\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of July 23, 2014, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, we are here today because our Federal highway \npolicy status quo is not working, and it hasn't been working for a long \ntime. This is the sixth time American taxpayers have been asked to bail \nout the highway trust fund since 2008--the sixth time since 2008.\n  None of those patches, $52 billion worth of bailouts in 7 years, \nfixed the problem, and neither will the $10.8 billion authorized by the \nbill that is before us today. It will buy us only a few months before \nwe are right back in the same place once again, the same place where we \nare now.\n  Indeed, this debate is itself the dysfunction of Washington, DC, in \nminiature. Here--as in health care, higher education, assistance for \nthe poor, energy, and so many other areas--the Federal Government has \ncreated a permanent structural problem, and it responds with duct tape. \nWorse, this bill solves only Washington problems, only the problems of \nWashington, DC, not those of the American people.\n  Under the broken status quo this bill not only protects but also \nextends, in 6 months--and in 6 years--our roads will still remain \ncongested. Too many single moms will still live on a knife's edge \ntrying to make it to their second jobs all the way across town. Too \nmany dads will still have to leave for work before breakfast just to \nmake it to their job and then do the same thing again as they try to \nmake it home for dinner. Children will still look in vain into the \nempty seats at their piano recitals and at their Little League games. \nCommuters will still squeeze onto overcrowded subway cars, hold their \nbreath, and hope they don't break down again. Young families will still \nbe unfairly priced out of neighborhoods near the best jobs and the best \nschools, and diverse communities will still be subject to the \nmonotonous inefficiency of an outmoded Federal bureaucracy.\n  But it doesn't have to be this way. There is a better way. The \nInterstate Highway System is one of the greatest achievements not only \nin the history of the Federal Government but in all of American \nhistory. It unified a sprawling continental nation by investing in our \ncommon destiny. It simultaneously met the economic, social, cultural, \nand security needs of an emerging superpower. It was and it remains a \nwonder of American innovation and self-government.\n  More than that, the Interstate Highway System was the daring, \naudacious work of a young nation literally on the move, bristling with \nconfidence in its future and in its people. With the Federal-Aid \nHighway Act of 1956, Congress threw off the yoke of the status quo and \nit met the emerging needs of a new generation.\n  Yet today, some 58 years later, in a new century with new needs, new \ntechnologies, and a new economy, Congress anxiously clings to that \nexact same policy like some kind of a tattered security blanket.\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\n  Six decades ago, Federal highway policy represented a triumph of \nimagination. Today, our refusal to modernize that same policy \nrepresents a failure of imagination. So we are here with the duct tape \nand WD-40 trying to keep this 20th century bureaucracy in place, rather \nthan embracing the worthy challenge of building a new mobility policy, \none that is well suited for the 21st century. That is exactly what my \namendment, the Transportation Empowerment Act, would do.\n  In 1956, it made sense for the Federal Government to collect the \nmajority of gas taxes from around the country and then coordinate the \nconstruction of a national system. We needed it. But with the \ninterstate system now largely complete and most transportation issues \nthat we see today existing at the local level, there is no longer the \nsame need for Washington to serve as the central coordinator. We have \nbecome an intrusive middleman. We need to refocus the Federal \nGovernment solely on interstate priorities and to empower a diverse, \nflexible, open-source transportation network controlled by the States.\n  My amendment would empower States and communities to customize their \nown infrastructure according to their own needs, their own values, and \ntheir own imagination.\n  It would, over 5 years, gradually transfer funding and spending \nauthority over local transportation infrastructure projects to the \nStates.\n  Today the Federal gasoline tax stands at 18.4 cents per gallon. My \namendment would lower it by 2019 to 3.7 cents per gallon.\n  In the interim, we would gradually send States more of their \nallotment without strings to prepare them for the eventual transfer of \nthis differential. After this gradual transition, Congress would retain \nenough revenue to continue to maintain the Interstate Highway System, \nwhich rightfully, properly remains a Federal priority and a core \ncompetence of our government at a national level, but States and \ncommunities would be newly empowered to launch a new era of local \ninvestment and local innovation.\n  The idea behind this plan is not only that there is a better way to \nimprove America's infrastructure, there are 50 better ways and even \nthousands of better ways. In our increasingly decentralized world, \nthere are as many ideal transportation policies as there are \ncommunities across this great country.\n\n  Washington is standing in the way, imposing obsolete conformity on a \nvibrant, diverse society. For if we truly love local transportation \ninfrastructure--and who doesn't--we should set it free.\n  Under the Transportation Empowerment Act, Americans could finally \nenjoy the local infrastructure they want. More environmentally \nconscious States and towns could finally have the flexibility to invest \nin more green transit projects and bike lanes. Regions reaping the \nbenefits of America's recent energy renaissance could accelerate their \nown infrastructure and their own buildouts to keep up with their \nexplosive growth. Dense cities could invest in more sustainable public \ntransit networks. Meanwhile, surrounding counties could reopen the \nfrontiers of the suburbs to a new generation of far more livable \ncommunities. State and local governments will also be free to \nexperiment with innovative funding mechanisms not necessarily tied to \nthe unreliable, unpredictable, gasoline tax. By cutting out the \nWashington middlemen, all of those States, communities, and taxpayers \nwill be able to get more for less.\n  My amendment would not reduce America's investment in infrastructure \nany more than Uber reduces America's investment in car services. In the \nreal world, value is not a cost. Rather, my plan would empower a nation \nhungry for greater mobility to spend its infrastructure dollars on \nsteel and on concrete instead of on bureaucracy and special interests.\n  Some of my colleagues oppose this plan. Some will offer Washington's \neternal promise. The status quo will work, it just needs more money. \nThat is all it needs, and it will work. The Federal gasoline tax has \nnot changed since 1994, they will say. We are starving the trust fund, \nthey will add.\n  But it is not true--at least it is an inaccurate and incomplete \npicture. For in the 12 years prior to 1994, the gasoline tax \nskyrocketed by an alarming 460 percent from 4 cents per gallon to 18.4 \ncents per gallon.\n  Put another way, since 1982, the Federal gasoline tax has grown by an \nequivalent of 6.1 percent per year. Chasing ever more money will not \nsolve this problem. That is what we have been doing, and the bill \nbefore us today is incontrovertible proof that it hasn't worked.\n  Others argue that reducing Washington's role in local transportation \nwould invite economic and infrastructural catastrophe. This makes two \nvery peculiar assumptions.\n  First, it assumes that Washington is uniquely competent in the area \nof local transportation, even as a long train of abusive boondoggles \nand bridges to nowhere tell us exactly the opposite.\n  Even more bizarrely, this argument assumes that the 50 States of our \nexceptional Republic, many of which would rank among the wealthiest \nnations in the world on their own, are unstable banana republics \nnursing the development of primitive hunter-gatherer societies whose \nonly transportation services involve the clearing of woodland paths for \ntheir pig-drawn carts.\n  State and local governments already pay for 75 percent of all surface \ntransportation infrastructure projects in this country.\n  In my home State of Utah, one of the best run in the country, only 20 \npercent of our transportation money comes from Washington. The other 80 \npercent we raise ourselves. Of course, we raise most of that 20 percent \ntoo. It is just that under the broken status quo, Washington middlemen \ntake their cut before sending that back to us.\n  Why not just leave that extra 25 percent to the States and \ncommunities who need and use it in the first place?\n  The States already own and maintain the highways and local transit \nprojects that are inherently local. So why not let the Federal \nGovernment focus on interstates and let Oregonians plan, finance, and \nbuild their bike paths; San Franciscans their green energy transit \nexperiments; and Texans their eight-lane expressways, in their own way, \ntailored to their local needs and their own local values? All we add to \nthe process in Washington, DC, is unnecessary overhead and self-\ncongratulating press releases, trying to take credit for it all.\n  Finally, many who admit that the status quo is unsustainable \nnonetheless support it because they believe their particular State \nbenefits by receiving more money back from the highway trust fund than \nit puts in. Washington perpetuates the myth that transportation money \nis free, especially for these so-called net donee States. But as in \nevery other middleman arrangement, the status quo policy ensures that \nStates actually get less value back than they should.\n  Federal regulatory strings not only make infrastructure projects \nunnecessarily expensive, they specifically divert resources away from \nactual infrastructure and waste it on special interests and \nbureaucratic redtape.\n  The Federal Davis-Bacon Act, for instance, costs States an additional \n10 cents for every single dollar they spend on infrastructure \nconstruction projects.\n  Numerous regulations under the National Environmental Policy Act--or \nNEPA, as it is frequently called--collectively cost State governments \nan additional 9 cents on the dollar. No wonder the trust fund needs to \nbe bailed out every year. Washington is charging taxpayers a 20-percent \nprocessing fee off the top.\n  I encourage my colleagues to work out the math for their own States.\n  But for Utah, that means that of the $335 million we receive annually \nfrom the highway trust fund, nearly $64 million goes to political \noverhead instead of steel and concrete.\n  Everything in our economy and our society today is moving away from \nrigid, centralized, bureaucratic control and toward flexible, open-\nsourced community and individual empowerment. This is a simple question \nof old versus new, of bold versus unimaginative.\n  The Interstate Highway System met a crucial need in its time and \nrepresented a wonder of innovation, but so did Borders bookstores at \none time, so did Blockbuster Video at one time, so did record stores, \nand so did rotary telephones.\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\n  America still needs books, movies, music, and communication, and it \nstill gets those things. Today those goods are just delivered more \nefficiently, more affordably, through flexible models customized to the \nneeds of individual customers. In the very same way Americans still \nneed highways, bridges, subways, and bike paths. Indeed, we need them \nnow more than ever, but Federal policy hasn't kept up with the \ntimes. That is why, even without my amendment, more than 30 States have \nbegun or are considering their own transportation modernization \nprograms.\n\n  This is just one more piece of evidence that the transportation \nrenaissance America needs is one that our centralized bureaucratic \nstatus quo cannot deliver--not with another $10.8 billion or 10 times \nas much.\n  After six decades and historic successes, the time has come for a new \nFederal transportation policy--one that taps the creativity of our \ndiverse Nation. Today, Americans are unnecessarily stuck in traffic, \nstuck in overcrowded subway cars, missing their kids' games and \nrecitals, priced out of neighborhoods close to their jobs, and they \nspend almost a full 40-hour workweek per year stuck in gridlock. They \ndeserve better than what Washington is offering--which is just the \nstatus quo, plus a little more money. A new era demands a new approach.\n  The Interstate Highway System is a success, and the people who \ncreated it deserve our great admiration and gratitude. But the way to \nhonor their legacy is to stop imitating them and start emulating them \nby investing in an innovative transportation network for our own era, \njust as they did for theirs. Just as it was in 1956, the status quo is \nonce again no longer good enough. We need to transcend it.\n  The future of America's mobility is not a rigid, monolithic, \ncentralized bureaucracy frozen in amber; it is a flexible, organic, \nopen-sourced network of empowered individuals and communities as \ndiverse as the Nation itself.\n  My amendment would empower Americans to start to build that future \ntogether, and I respectfully ask my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is really almost hard to know where to \nstart in my opposition to this amendment, but let me say that some \npeople call it devolution, meaning you devolve all responsibility for \nthe highways and transits to the States. I call it not devolution but \ncomplete and utter destruction of a system that has been in place that \nthe States have grown to count on. That is why the States that my \nfriend speaks from, the States' point of view--they oppose this \namendment strongly. AASHTO--they represent not one State but every \nsingle State.\n  There are so many things my friend said that we can't refute--that a \nState should have the right to spend whatever they want. Sure, they \ncan. They can spend anything they want right now. But they count on the \nbasic bread and butter of these grants.\n  If we look at history, it has been Republican Presidents who have \nstepped to the plate on this all through history. That is why I think \nthis is so radical. It is shocking to me. It is shocking to me because \nsome of the biggest proponents of the Interstate Highway System and aid \nto the States have been Republican Presidents.\n  Let's be clear. If, God forbid, this were to become the law, \nimmediately the States would see a cut in their transportation funding \nof 80 percent. That is my friend's answer to gridlock--cut the funding \nto the States by 80 percent.\n  The last time I heard and listened, we were one nation under God, \nindivisible. That is why the visionary Dwight Eisenhower saw this. He \nknew we had to be able to move equipment. He knew logistics because he \nwas a general. He knew we were one Nation, sea to shining sea. And my \nfriend would have us lose that.\n  I really wish my colleague Senator Inhofe would come to the floor \nbecause I think he has a voting record that is as conservative as any, \nand he feels transportation is a basic function, along with defense.\n  I think it is important to note that counties and cities and States \ndepend on this program, and they have for years. Again, this is a \nnational interest, to have this one Nation.\n  If we really want to see Republicans and Democrats united around the \ncountry, look at who is opposing the Lee amendment: the American \nTrucking Association, the American Road and Transportation Builders \nAssociation, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American \nHighway Users Alliance, the National Stone, Sand, and Gravel \nAssociation, the general contractors, the Associated Equipment \nDistributors, and the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. And if \nthey agreed with Senator Lee--set us free; set us free; we are going to \nbuild so much--I don't know what he is talking about, set us free. Set \nus free with 80 percent less money? That is really great. What are we \ngoing to build? Nothing. We are going to have to raise taxes. I was a \ncounty supervisor. That doesn't work.\n  Proponents of this amendment weakly claim that with the completion of \nthe interstate system, we don't need a Federal role in transportation. \nWell, guess what. We have to maintain our Federal highways even though \nthey have been built. We have to maintain our bridges even though they \nhave been built.\n  I said on a TV show the other day: I know I have gotten a little \nolder. I need more maintenance. That is just the way it is. I am not \nhappy about it.\n  Stop laughing. But that is a fact of life.\n  So don't tell me ``we are free at last; do away with this'' and then \nthink the States are going to be happy when the very States my friend \nsays he speaks for are totally against his amendment. We would be \nmassively cutting transportation infrastructure spending.\n  Let's talk about the impact on thousands of businesses and millions \nof workers. I don't know if we have the picture of the stadium. I wish \nto show my friend--when he comes here and makes an ideological speech, \nI like to talk about the real world. Here is the real world. This is a \nSuper Bowl game. This is a stadium that holds 100,000 people. We have \nseven stadiums full of unemployed construction workers. He wants to cut \nthe Federal involvement by 80 percent. Just don't see some of these \nworkers. It started out that we filled 20 of these stadiums in the \nheight of the recession. Now we have got it down to seven, and we still \ndon't have enough work.\n\n  And this isn't make work. This is work our American businesspeople \nwant. This is work our American workers want. This is work that can't \nbe outsourced. This is work that pays a good wage. What a time to cut \nback our investment by 80 percent and sock it to the workers.\n  The same people who vote for this amendment won't raise the minimum \nwage--support this pension smoothing that is taking away dollars from \nour employees' pensions.\n  So I am at my wit's end to understand. My friend is a nice man, and I \nknow he believes this. But don't come on the floor and say let's forget \nabout Eisenhower's vision and have a new vision, which is that there is \nno more Federal role.\n  Some will get up and say: Maybe it is better to do this than to do \nnothing. Maybe this is better.\n  No. We have to do our job around here, and that is a multiyear bill. \nWe are faced with a short-term extension because we haven't done our \nwork.\n  Senators Carper and Corker and I are going to put forward an \namendment that is going to force us to do our work in December if we \nare lucky enough to have it passed. We hope it will pass because if we \nvote for that amendment, we are cutting back the short-term money we \nhave to pay, and we are cutting back the time. And that is good. But we \nare not walking away from the responsibility we have as a nation, one \nnation under God, indivisible, from sea to shining sea, a vision of \nAmerica that my friend's amendment would destroy. It is not devolution, \nit is destruction, and I hope we will vote no.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I strongly, respectfully disagree with the \ncharacterization my distinguished colleague from California has made \nsuggesting that this somehow represents an 80-\n\n[[Page S5031]]\n\npercent cut in the transportation funding. That simply is not true. The \nidea here is to transfer both the revenue collection authority and the \nspending authority back to where most of it belongs, which is at the \nState and the local level.\n  There isn't a State in the Union that wants to do away with \ntransportation infrastructure spending. Quite to the contrary, our \nStates and localities and those who assist the contractors, who provide \nthe services, provide the gravel and other materials that go into these \nroads and bridges and transit projects--they want to get to work, but \nthey want to put this money into steel and concrete in the ground \nrather than spending so much of it on lobbying, rather than spending so \nmuch of it on things that have nothing to do with steel and concrete in \nthe ground.\n  I also wish to refer to something my colleague said with regard to \nthe fact that it costs money to maintain the Interstate Highway System. \nI absolutely agree--I could not agree more--which is exactly why I \nwrote this amendment so as to retain a 3.7-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax \nthat would be collected and spent better to make sure we would maintain \nthe Interstate Highway System. That is exactly what we do.\n  A reference was made to my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma, Mr. \nInhofe, expressing remorse over the fact that he is not here with us at \nthis moment to have a discussion and wondering what he would say about \nit. To respond to my colleague's point, Senator Inhofe has voted for \nthis provision in the past. In fact, in the past Senator Inhofe himself \nhas introduced a version of this very piece of legislation.\n  My colleague also referred to groups that happen to oppose this \nlegislation. I would encourage those groups to learn more about it and \nalso point out that there are lots of groups that support my \nlegislation, including Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Tax \nReform, Heritage Action, Club for Growth, National Taxpayers Freedom, \nFreedom Works, and the list goes on and on.\n  It is also important to remember that our Federal gasoline tax did \nincrease substantially between 1992 and 1994, increased from just 4 \ncents per gallon to 18.4 cents per gallon. During that time period we \nwere told that if the gasoline tax was increased at the Federal level, \nwe would be backing up the highway trust fund, that we would make sure \nit was secure.\n  Did that happen? No. What happened instead was the Federal Government \noverreached. The Federal Government started getting more and more \ninvolved in surface streets and things that have nothing to do with our \nInterstate Highway System. That is why we are here today.\n  I therefore yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know my colleagues \nwant to present the Carper-Corker-Boxer amendment. I will just say that \nwe just did the math. The Senator cuts the gas tax to such a degree \nthat the States would get an 80-percent cut. The Senator can do the \nmath himself, but I am happy to work with the Senator on it.\n  It is not convenient--it is not right to speak about another Member \nwhen they are not here, but my understanding is Senator Inhofe does not \ncurrently support this. I could be wrong. We will find out in a couple \nhours. One of us can apologize. But I will apologize if I misstated his \nobjection to this.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3583\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that our \namendment, the Carper-Corker-Boxer amendment 3582, be made pending and \nthat it be reported by number at this time.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper] for himself, Mr. \n     Corker, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 3583.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, July 23, 2014, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I will make some comments to lead off and \nthen will yield to Senator Corker and back to Senator Boxer, and we \nhave others who would like to speak on behalf of this amendment.\n  I wish to start off by saying to the Senator from Tennessee who is \nhere with us, the lead Republican on the amendment, how grateful I am \nto have this opportunity to work with you on an important issue. Thank \nyou for your courage. One of the definitions of leadership is the \ncourage to stay out of step when everyone else is marching to the wrong \ntune. In this case, not everyone else is marching to the wrong tune, \nbut a few people are. I thank you for showing that courage and standing \nup to do what we believe is the right thing to do.\n  I would like to give a big shout-out to Senator Boxer. She chairs the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee on which I serve as the \nsubcommittee chair for transportation and infrastructure. She and \nSenator Vitter and Senator Barrasso and I worked to fashion a 6-year \ntransportation plan for our country that is a very well thought out, \nexcellent roadmap for the future of transportation in America, and what \nwe now need to do is to fund it. It is great to have a plan. How about \nsome money to make it happen? That is what this is all about.\n  This is the question: At the end of the day, how do we best ensure \nthat we actually fund the 6-year plan Senator Boxer and others helped \nus develop?\n  I thank not just Senators Corker and Boxer for their great support \nand for their leadership, I also thank the Democrats and Republicans \nand even an Independent or two for their support of our amendment.\n  I will yield the time now to Senator Corker and Senator Boxer, and I \nwill take some time out. Senator King is welcome to speak as well.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order with \nrespect to H.R. 5021 be modified to allow for 2 minutes equally divided \nin the usual form between the votes and that all after the first vote \nbe 10-minute votes, with all other provisions of the previous order \nremaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from \nCalifornia for going ahead with this amendment. I thank Senator Carper \nfor this leadership not just on this issue but other issues. I know we \nare working with other long-term issues that need to be resolved, and I \nthank him for the way he is going about doing that.\n  If I could just lay out what is happening today, a House bill is \ncoming over here today that is a short-term extension. Mr. President, I \ndon't know if you know this, but this will be the 11th short-term \nextension since 2008. Let me say that one more time. This will be the \n11th short-term extension that has occurred since 2008.\n  This is the fifth time we have taken money out of the general fund--\ntaken money out of the general fund--to fund the highway trust fund, \nwhich is supposed to be funded through user fees. So what I would like \nto say to my friends on this side of the aisle is that this is the \nfifth time for the highway trust fund, which builds highways and \nbridges around our country, that we are engaging in generational \ntheft--generational theft--where we take money out of the general fund. \nEveryone knows it is not paid for. We use gimmicks to pay for something \nthat the Constitution says we are actually supposed to deal with.\n  The House sent over a bill, and there has been a lot of consternation \non the floor about that. They used $6.4 billion worth of pension \nsmoothing. Everyone in this body knows it is not a real pay-for. All it \ndoes is move revenues up a decade. And because it uses $6.4 billion \nworth of pension smoothing, it has a $5 billion budget point of order \nagainst it. Let me say that one more time--a $5 billion budget point of \norder against the House bill that is coming over. So there has been \nsome consternation.\n  People say: Well, if you don't take up the House bill, the road \nprogram is going to fall apart, and we are going to go home for the \nAugust recess and everybody is going to be blamed.\n  Well, fortunately--fortunately--today Speaker Boehner said: No. If \nthe\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\nSenate sends something over, we are going to send something right back.\n  So everybody ought to be relieved. So it doesn't matter today that \nmany of our Finance Committee members who serve with Chairman Wyden--\nthey have made commitments to him that we are going to get on the \nSenate Finance Committee, and they should all know it is not a problem \nnow. The House today said they are going to send something right back.\n  So the first vote that is going to take place today is a vote to \nstrip out the House bill, which has $6.4 billion worth of pension \nsmoothing--a total gimmick. Everyone knows it is not a pay-for. It \nloses money--loses money. And the Senate Finance Committee bill is \ngoing to--the first vote is to replace the House bill with the Senate \nFinance Committee bill--by the way, which was done under regular order, \ndone the way bills are supposed to be done. Unfortunately, it also is a \nshort-term fix. I have never voted for a short-term fix for the highway \ntrust fund because it is so simple for us to resolve. The only issue is \nwe haven't been willing to address it. There are no new ideas that I am \naware of.\n  I am going to have to vote against a short-term extension. But we \nhave an amendment to improve it, and what that amendment does is it \ntakes out all of the pension smoothing that unfortunately is in the \nFinance Committee bill. I thank them for doing their work, but it has \n$2.9 billion worth of pension smoothing, which, again, is a gimmick. In \nother words, it moves up revenues. It weakens, by the way, the pension \nsystem in our country. You ought to know that. It weakens our pension \nsystem. It moves money into this decade, but from then on it loses even \nmore money. It is absolute--no offense to those who put it in place--\ngenerational theft. So what this amendment does is it takes pension \nsmoothing out of the Senate finance bill and leaves everything else in \nplace.\n  The secondary benefit is that it means the highway trust fund will \nnot have funding except to make it through this year. What that means \nis that this body in 2014 will have the opportunity to actually deal \nwith this issue.\n  I have to tell you, seriously, I am embarrassed. I have been here in \nthe Senate 7\\1/2\\ years--7\\1/2\\ years--and we have yet to deal with one \nof our long-term issues. I cannot remember a single issue this body has \ncome together on to deal with one of our long-term structural issues. \nIt is an embarrassment. They really aren't new ideas around here; there \nhas just been a lack of willingness to deal with it.\n  I thank the Senator from California, the Senator from Delaware, and \nothers who will join in this amendment. And all we are doing is one \nthing: We are taking a gimmick out of the Senate finance bill and \nforcing this body to act responsibly before year-end. That is all.\n  I would urge my colleagues to come to the floor and say: Look, it has \nbeen a long time, 11 short-term reauthorizations.\n  By the way, think about the economic issues that come with this. We \ndo these reauthorizations, and departments of transportation around the \ncountry have no idea whether there is going to be funding in place. \nWhat do the contractors do? They don't hire people long-term. They \ndon't buy equipment. Yet we come and do this 11 times since 2008. Five \ntimes, again, transferring money out of our general fund--the greatest \ngenerational theft that can occur--taking money out of the general fund \nand spending it over a 6-month period, paying for it over 10 years.\n\n  To my Republican friends who railed against the President over the \nhealth care bill because he was using 6 years' worth of costs--by the \nway, I was one of those railers--6 years' worth of costs, 10 years' \nworth of revenues--we couldn't get off of it because it was so \nirresponsible. Yet in this bill we are going to spend the money over 6 \nor 7 months and pay for it over 10 years. It is an order of magnitude \nworse.\n  I know that a lot of people have worked and they have said: No, there \nis no way we can come up with a solution by year-end.\n  You have got to be kidding me. How could we not come up with a \nsolution to such a simple issue--a trust fund that has been funded by \nuser fees. How could we not figure out some way in 5 days? The Senate \nFinance Committee has some of the smartest people in the Senate on it. \nThey know there are no new real options. The chairman has floated some \nideas as to how to get there, and I applaud him for it.\n  By the way, I know that the Senate Finance Committee is only doing \nits job today. In other words, you have to come up with a short-term \nsolution. I got it. I cannot support it. I cannot support it. I cannot \nsupport another kicking of the can down the road on one of the simplest \nissues we have to deal with in the Senate because elections are coming. \nLet's face it. Every time it is the election. We can't deal with this \nissue, so what we said is: OK. We got it. We realize that during \nelections people don't really want to show their cards, apparently. So \nwe are saying, hey, let's strip the gimmick that is in this bill--the \npension smoothing that we all know is not a pay-for. It is a gimmick. \nLet's strip that and let's force the Congress before the end of this \nyear to actually deal with an issue that is very important to our \nNation.\n  I hope people will support it. I have heard people say: Well, I just \ndon't see how we can figure out a solution.\n  You have got to be kidding me. I mean, how many new ideas are there \nrelative to this?\n  So, look, I thank my colleagues for joining in this amendment. I hope \nwe will have support. Again, this amendment lessens the kicking of the \ncan down the road. It takes out a gimmick. It forces us to deal with a \nlong-term solution, which we should have done a long time ago.\n  I thank all of those Senators who support this amendment. I hope \nothers will consider it before they come down to the floor. I hope this \nSenate will have the opportunity--and the House--before year-end to \nactually deal with this issue.\n  Again, let me say this: The kick-the-can down-the-road that is \noccurring takes us into next May and June. Think about it. So we are \ngoing to have a Presidential race underway. So then people are going to \nsay: Oh, we can't deal with this issue. We don't want our nominees to \nhave to deal with this issue.\n  Remember, the primaries this year are early. So our Republicans will \nsay: Well, we don't want to deal with this issue in May or June because \na Presidential race is coming up. And the Democrats will say the same \nthing: We don't want our candidate to have to talk about this issue. So \nagain and again we will kick the can down the road. We will engage in \ngenerational theft. We will weaken our economy. We won't do the things \nwe should be doing with our infrastructure. It is the wrong thing to \ndo.\n  Please support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Corker for his \nremarks because I have been here a while, and I haven't heard a more \nhonest speech in my life on the Senate floor. I haven't heard a more \npassionate speech, a speech in which the Senator just spoke from his \nheart and with his brain, which is quite competent. I thank the Senator \nfor it because there are some times when you do feel like shouting. I \nguess that was a movie, ``I Can't Take It Anymore.''\n  It is ridiculous that we are where we are. We knew for 2 years--2 \nyears--that the highway trust fund was going to run out of money. We \nknew it for 2 years. That is why in May Senator Vitter and I, Senator \nCarper, Senator Barrasso, and others on both sides of the aisle passed \na 6-year bill. We knew it was coming. We wanted to wake up our \ncolleagues. And we did wake them up but, sadly, to a short-term fix \ninstead of a long-term fix, a multiyear bill.\n  I so agree with my friend. It is the political will that is lacking. \nThere is always an excuse followed by an excuse. The next thing we know \nthey will say: The dog ate my homework. We have heard every excuse. And \nthe Senator is so right. We will be in Presidential races, and then we \nwill start with more Senate races and more congressional races, and \npeople won't want to take a tough vote again.\n  This is the greatest Nation on Earth, but we have to reflect the \ngreatness in our work here, and we are not.\n\n[[Page S5033]]\n\n  The one thing I disagree with my friend on--he said we are only doing \none thing in this amendment. We are actually doing two things in this \namendment. One is we are getting rid of that gimmick called pension \nsmoothing. I have kind of studied it over the last few weeks to really \nunderstand what we are doing, which is when you use this pension \nsmoothing, you are saying to companies: Don't put any money into your \npension obligations. And through some smoke and mirrors--because then \nit means they get to pay a little more income taxes--by the way, some \ndon't pay more income taxes--it comes out a plus. The fact is, it is in \nessence telling companies they don't have to set aside money for their \nworkers' pensions. That is not something that is good, especially since \nthe pension guaranty corporation is short $34 billion.\n  I don't know if my friend knows this. The last time we used pension \nsmoothing for a short-term fix, at least we had in the committee a \ncomparable measure that ensured that companies gave more to the pension \nguaranty corp. So although they had a chance not to put the money into \nthe pensions, they did have to pay more to the pension guaranty corp. \nIf the pension guaranty corp. isn't there--the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorp. is broke--the taxpayers have to pick up the tab. I am looking at \nmy friend in the Presiding Officer's chair, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Ms. Warren, who knows what happens when everybody is \nbroke and the Federal Government says: Oh my God. That is too big to \nfail.\n  So this attack that you make on smoothing as a gimmick--it is worse \nthan a gimmick because it has real-life impacts, and those real-life \nimpacts are that the companies aren't putting aside enough money. So \nlet's think about what we are saying. We are saying the highway trust \nfund is going broke, so to fix it we are going to endanger another \nfund, the pension funds of our workers. That is terrible.\n\n  That is why I love the Carper-Corker-Boxer amendment, and I thank my \nfriends for their leadership on the pay-for. It does two things, this \ngood amendment. It says we are not going to use the smoothing; we are \ngoing to protect our pensions. Secondly, we are going to attack the \nlong-term issues of the highway trust fund in December, in the \nlameduck, after the elections, and everybody knows that is the best \ntime to do it.\n  So I stand proudly with my friends. I hope we pass this. I don't know \nwhat happens or what the House will do, but my dad used to say you can \nonly control what you can control. We can't control them, but we can \ncontrol us.\n  So I hope anyone listening to this debate--I am going to support the \nWyden amendment because it does strip some of the pension smoothing. I \nam going to oppose the Toomey amendment and the Lee amendment because I \nthink they are dangerous, and I am going to strongly support the \nCarper-Corker-Boxer amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues. I know there is some very important business \nabout to come to the floor, so I will yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren.). The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                       MILCON--VA Appropriations\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, we have just listened to a very lively \ndebate on the highway trust fund, which is certainly a great issue \nconfronting our Nation because our infrastructure is crumbling.\n  But we also know another great infrastructure has really been \ncrumbling, and that is our VA infrastructure, including the ability to \ndeliver health care to our veterans as promised, as well as to meet \ntheir claims when they file for their benefits, particularly those \npoignant, compelling claims around disability benefits.\n  I come to the floor today to see if we can't do a trifecta this week \nby passing the serious reform bill advocated by Senators Sanders and \nMcCain----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators will take their conversations out of \nthe Chamber.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. These are excellent Senators whose voices are heard and \nheard and heard, as is mine.\n  In addition to the Sanders-McCain bill that comes as a result of the \nconference, really what that bill does is focus primarily on the health \ncare issues facing us. What concerns me is also the fact that we need \nto eliminate the VA disability claims backlog for which there is also a \ncompelling need.\n  Now, what I am advocating is that we do a trifecta this week; that \nis, we pass the conference report that has been advocated by Senator \nSanders and Senator McCain that will deal with the important reforms, \nincluding adding new personnel. We have given the VA a new chief \nexecutive officer to bring about the reforms with the know-how of \nbusiness. I also wish to bring to the floor the VA-MILCON \nappropriations bill.\n  This is a fantastic bill that moves from the subcommittee, led by my \nvery able subcommittee chairman, Senator Tim Johnson, with the help of \nthe ranking member, Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois. They have done such \nincredible diligence on how we can use the taxpayers' dollars wisely to \nreally provide the services we promised the veterans--yes, health care, \nbut also that veterans shouldn't stand in line for health care and \nveterans also shouldn't stand in line and wait in line and then hope \nthe line gets smaller for disability benefits.\n  What the VA-MILCON bill does this year, under the very able \nleadership of Senator Johnson, with the cooperation of Senator Kirk, is \nto implement these very important reforms, and the committee responded. \nI wish the Presiding Officer could have been in the full committee that \nday. We passed it on a bipartisan basis of 30 to 0.\n  Now I want to be able to bring this bill to the floor so this week we \ncould do all three of these and make sure that the Sanders-McCain \nconference report bill is not on a weak foundation. We need to \nmodernize our VA infrastructure.\n  There is over $10 billion of backlog in crumbling physical \ninfrastructure at the VA. Its technology is dated. We want them to have \ngreat technology. Most of all, we finally want to crack this veterans \nbacklog.\n  So I am going to propound shortly a unanimous consent request. I \ntalked about it earlier. But before I make this request--I have spoken \nabout this bill--I would like to yield to my colleague and my very able \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Tim Johnson, who has spent more than a \ndecade working on these issues, and now, on a bipartisan basis, we have \nsuch a splendid bill--so wise, so prudent, so effective--that I wish we \ncould do it.\n  I yield the floor for Senator Johnson and then I will reclaim the \nfloor for my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, I thank the chairwoman \nfor her strong leadership on the Appropriations Committee and her \nunfailing dedication to our Nation's vets. She is absolutely right in \npointing out that passage of the fiscal year 2015 MILCON-VA bill is \ncrucial to implementing the Sanders bill. The Sanders bill provides \nfunding and expanded access for medical care for vets, but the MILCON-\nVA bill provides a far broader range of funding and oversight that \ncovers every aspect of VA operations.\n  By a unanimous vote, we just confirmed Robert McDonald to be \nSecretary of the VA. He is assuming the leadership of an agency in \ncrisis, and he will need every resource available to him if he is to \nsucceed in turning the VA around.\n  The Senate has given him the job, and the Senate should now give him \nthe resources to accomplish that job. This is no time to delay or \nshortchange VA funding.\n  For the sake of the Nation's vets, we must keep our focus on the full \nscope of VA operations, including but not limited to access to medical \ncare. The disability claims backlog is a perfect example. In the past \nyear, with the resources and oversight provided in the fiscal year 2014 \nMILCON-VA bill, VA has made great progress in reducing the backlog. The \nfiscal year 2015 bill provides additional resources for claims \nprocessing to sustain this momentum. The move to paperless claims was \nkey to streamlining and expediting claims processing, and it was made \npossible by improvements to VA Information Technology systems--\nimprovements which were funded in the MILCON-VA bill.\n  IT is the backbone of virtually every program the VA administers. An \nantiquated and cumbersome electronic scheduling system was a key factor \nin the patient scheduling scandal. The VA\n\n[[Page S5034]]\n\nis in the midst of an entire overhaul of its electronic health record \nsystem to make it more accessible to patients and to exchange \ninformation with DOD. This effort is crucial to the VA's ability to \ndeliver timely care and benefits to vets.\n  The MILCON-VA bill also provides the funding to implement a wide \narray of programs that are crucial to the health and well-being of \nvets. Many of these aren't the kinds of programs or initiatives that \nmake splashy headlines, but they are essential in delivering timely \ncare and benefits. For example, the fiscal year 2015 MILCON-VA bill \ncontains $7.8 million for a centralized mail system at the VA. The VA \nestimates that once the centralized program is implemented, it will \ntake as many as 10 to 15 days off the time it takes to process a \ndisability claim. The bill also provides increased funding to expand \nthe Access Received Closer to Home program for vets in rural areas. \nThese are just a few of many examples I could cite.\n  The Sanders bill and the MILCON-VA bill are separate components of a \nsingle requirement and they should move forward at the same time. I \nhope we can pass these bipartisan bills before we adjourn for recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4486\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am really eager to bring at least \none appropriations bill to the floor. There are only 72 hours left \nbefore we break for August.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 400, H.R. 4486, the \nMilitary Construction-VA appropriations bill; that the Committee-\nreported substitute amendment be agreed to; that there be no other \namendments, points of order or motions in order to the bill other than \nbudget points of order and the applicable motions to waive; that there \nbe up to 1 hour for debate equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill, \nas amended, be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on the \npassage of the bill, as amended; that if the bill, as amended, is \npassed, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with \nthe House, and authorize the Chair to appoint conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Reserving the right to object, our side is eager to \nschedule floor consideration of appropriations bills with a full and \nopen amendment process, and the MILCON-VA bill would be at the top of \nour list.\n  Would the Senator from Maryland agree to modify this consent request \nas follows: that following disposition of the highway bill this \nevening, the motion to proceed to S. 2648, the Senate border \nsupplemental bill, be withdrawn and the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 4486, the MILCON-VA bill; I further ask that the \nfirst amendment in order be offered by the Republican leader or his \ndesignee, and that the two sides then offer amendments in alternating \nfashion; that following the disposition of all amendments, the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Maryland so modify her \nrequest?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The answer is no, I will not modify my request. But my \nresponse should not be interpreted as a pugnacious rejection.\n  I appreciate the civil and courteous way the Senator from Alabama has \nresponded. But in a nutshell, what the Senator from Alabama is \nrequesting is that we not pick up the supplemental, we bring up the VA-\nMILCON instead. I would like to bring up both bills, which is why I am \nasking that there be no amendments on VA-MILCON. They are practically \nidentical between the House and the Senate. There were no amendments \nexcept a few perfecting ones in the Senate. We could get this done in \nan hour. So, therefore, I will not modify my request.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I object to my distinguished chair's \nmotion to consider and pass the MILCON-VA appropriations bill. This is \nnot because I oppose the underlying bill, as I have said. This a bill \nthat has wide bipartisan support. Its support is predicated upon the \npremise that we will engage in what we call ``regular order'' here. \nRegular order, by its very nature, includes the ability to offer, \nconsider, and to vote on amendments.\n  If we were to agree to this unanimous consent request by the Senator \nfrom Maryland, we would be trading away every Member's prerogative on \nboth sides of the aisle to offer and to vote upon amendments. I would, \ntherefore, encourage the chair and the majority leader to revise their \nunanimous consent request to allow for an open amendment process. Until \nthen, we will be compelled to object.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I know my friends Senator Mikulski and \nSenator Shelby are doing everything they can to work the will of the \nSenate. I know how they both want to get something done on this \nappropriations bill.\n  I simply want to say that I looked at the modification of my \nRepublican friend--and he is my friend--that he offered, and I think \nfor the good of America, who could be watching, I want to make a couple \nof points that will take me 30 seconds.\n  First of all, there is no limit on the number of amendments. We do \nnot know if it will be 5, 10, 20 or 1,000 or 2,000 or 1 million. We \nhave no idea. They would not even have to be related to the bill at \nhand, and they will not tell us what this list of amendments is.\n  I have looked back at some recent requests, and I want to be very \nhonest with my friend. The recent requests I have seen before have been \nattacks on the Clean Air Act, attacks on the Clean Water Act, attacks \non the Safe Drinking Water Act, attacks on women's health care. \nFrankly, that is not something I can agree to.\n  So I just want to say I am so saddened that we cannot seem to take up \nthe most popular bill. I know how hard everybody has worked on MILCON-\nVA, and my friend, Senator Shelby, said: Our side is eager to schedule \nfloor consideration of appropriations bills. Well, if they are really \neager, they should work together with Senator Mikulski. You could not \nfind anyone more fair. Get a finite list of amendments. If they are \ncontroversial, we have the 60-vote threshold. We know how to do our \nwork around here.\n  So I am sorry it has come to this, and I appreciate the leadership of \nboth Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, first of all, I thank all of those \nadvocating the highway bill for their courtesy in letting us bring this \nto the floor. Senator Johnson and I are deeply appreciative.\n  I think we have just had a very good discussion. We have stated what \nwe would like to do to move VA-MILCON in the most time-efficient way \npossible--with the least controversial bill. I am not going to have \nanything more to say about this tonight, but now that we have kind of \nput a lot of ideas out there, we have heard what the expression is of \nthe vice chairman of Appropriations, I would hope that over the next 36 \nhours perhaps we could find a way forward to do the trifecta I am \nhoping for to serve America's veterans: pass the conference report that \nhelps improve veterans health care--we have done one part of that now \nby approving Mr. McDonald--and all we would have to do before Thursday \nnight is to finish VA-MILCON.\n  So I intend to reach out across the aisle, and I appreciate the \neffort and courtesy and the cooperation of the highway Senators, who \nare moving this bill forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I know we have a number of colleagues who still want to speak, and we \nwant to get to votes tonight, so I want to be very brief speaking in \nopposition to the Lee amendment and in support of the amendment of my \nfriends Senator Carper, Senator Boxer, and Senator Corker.\n\n[[Page S5035]]\n\n  Madam President, I want to quickly tell you about the Norwalk River \nBridge, which is a bridge in the State of Connecticut, which is pretty \nimportant to the transit of people and goods throughout the Northeast \nbecause it spans the Norwalk River and allows for trains--Amtrak \ntrains, Metro-North trains--to be able to transit millions of people \nover millions of trips up and down the Northeast Corridor. Without the \nNorwalk River Bridge, you cannot get from New Haven to New York, but \nyou also cannot get from Washington, DC, to Boston.\n  That bridge is 118 years old, and it is a miracle that it opens at \nall. It needs to open in order to allow maritime traffic to go up and \ndown the Norwalk River. It is a miracle that it opens at all. But, in \nfact, on 16 of its 271 openings last year, it did not open and it \ninterrupted Metro-North service 175 times.\n  The result for not just Connecticut but the entire region is hundreds \nof thousands of dollars in lost productivity. Our inability to pass a \nlong-term transportation bill means that big projects like the \nreplacement of the Norwalk River Bridge cannot get done. Why? Because \nwhen you only budget for 12 months or 24 months at a time--or in this \ninstance only 6 months or 4 months at a time--there is no way for a \nState to be able to plan to do that kind of massive work.\n  So I am here on the floor to beg my colleagues to support the \namendment from Senator Boxer and Senator Carper because it is time we \nstarted to get some political courage and admit that the emperor has no \nclothes when it comes to Federal transportation policy. Yes, it is \npolitically difficult to make the choices necessary to come up with the \nfunding to fill that gap.\n  Senator Corker and I have one particular idea, but we would love to \nhear others. But it is time for us to sit down and have that honest \nconversation because you cannot do projects like this if you do not.\n  But to Senator Lee's amendment, this is exactly why you need a \nFederal commitment to transportation funding. The idea that you are \njust going to devolve all of these projects down to the local level is \npreposterous. Why? Because this is a regional asset. The Norwalk River \nhappens to be located in the State of Connecticut. But if all \ntransportation funding came from the States, and Connecticut, for one \nreason or another, decided not to spend money on replacing the Norwalk \nRiver Bridge, it is not just Connecticut that is affected by that; \ntransit stops in Massachusetts, in New York, in New Jersey, in \nDelaware, all the way down to Washington, DC.\n  So the reason we have made a robust commitment to Federal funding for \nboth highways and mass transit is because the benefits accrue to all of \nus.\n  Senator Lee said that this is just an innovation in the way we fund \ntransportation, like, as he said, the innovation in the way in which \npeople buy books. That analogy speaks to our imperative for Federal \nfunding because the way that books have been sold is different. It used \nto be that you just used the local roads to drive down and buy your \nbook from the local bookstore. Today, you buy at amazon.com, and it is \nthe Interstate Highway System, the interstate rail system that is used \nto get your book from a warehouse somewhere out in the Midwest to you \nafter you ordered it online in Connecticut. If you want to talk about \nthe great innovations of the last 20 to 30 years, they all buttress the \nidea that we live in an interconnected, interstate world in which we \nneed a Federal commitment to highway funding--one that does not just \nparse out funding one month at a time.\n  My State is particularly dependent on this kind of funding. \nConnecticut only survives if we are able to unlock the congested \nhighways and byways and rail lines that connect my State to New York \nand to Boston in particular. But this Nation as a whole will not \nsucceed, will not survive economically if we do not grapple with the \nfact that as China spends 12 percent of its GDP on infrastructure, \nEurope spends 6 percent of its GDP on infrastructure, even if we just \nheld the line, we would still only be spending 3 percent of our GDP on \nthe most important asset to the future of America's economy.\n  So I hope we reject the Lee amendment. I hope we pass the Carper-\nBoxer-Corker amendment. I am glad to join them in support of it this \nevening.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, just for purposes of making a unanimous \nconsent request, I ask unanimous consent that the only remaining time \nbe 5 minutes each for the following Senators and the Senate then \nproceed to vote on the amendments and the bill as provided under the \nprevious order: Senator Carper, Senator Flake, Senator Wyden, and \nSenator King. The unanimous consent request is for 5 minutes each, and \nthen the votes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, will we \nstill have 2 minutes before each amendment then? It will be in between?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, we will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I understand in the unanimous consent \nagreement I have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. CARPER. I yield 1 minute of that to Senator King. Oh, great, he \nhas 5 minutes. I would like to have 4 of his minutes.\n  I will start by saying my thanks to Senator Wyden for his leadership \nas well. I am pleased to be able to support his amendment. I am \ngrateful he is supporting ours.\n  I say to some of our Republican colleagues, I have talked to most of \nyou in the last several weeks about this approach that Senator Boxer \nand Senator Corker and I are proposing; that is, to lower from $11 \nbillion to $8 billion the amount of money that would go into the \ntransportation trust fund. That would force us to come back and make a \ndecision by the end of this calendar year. That would force us to do \nsomething real, do our job during the lameduck session.\n  One of the reasons Republicans have said to me is: We can't do that \nbecause then that would force the bill to go back to the House from \nwhich it has emanated. Well, let me just say the bill is going back to \nthe House. The Wyden amendment is going to pass. So get over it. The \nbill is going to go back to the House. It is not going to die there. \nThey will do something with it. They may send it back to us in that \nsame form or some different form. But for Republicans who have said: I \nunderstand the importance of doing something in a lameduck session, and \nwe know we need to be compelled to do that but I just can't do it, \nwell, you can.\n  For the folks, our Republican friends who say: I don't like that \npension smoothing at all, the idea of mucking with people's pensions in \norder to fund something entirely unrelated--and that is building roads, \nhighways, bridges, and transit systems--well, you do not have to do \nthat. You can use an honest pay-for, an honest set-aside, and feel good \nabout doing that.\n  We are going to be here, maybe, Friday night, December 19, and if we \nhave provided $11 billion to carry us to fund programs through the end \nof next May, I promise you, if we have not worked out a 6-year \ntransportation funding plan by December 19, that Friday night, we are \ngoing to be gathered right here and people will say: What are we doing \nhere? It is almost Christmas. I want to go home or go somewhere to be \nwith my family. We have money to run these programs until the end of \nMay, so let's just kick the can down the road and come back a little \nbit before May and we will do it then.\n  One problem with that: We did something like that 5 years ago, and we \ndid it again and again and again and again--11 times. This will be the \n12th time we do it.\n  Why am I concerned we will do it again?\n  I say to Senator Durbin, let me ask, what did Albert Einstein say \nabout the definition of ``insanity''? He said: It is the notion that we \nare going to do things the same way we have always done them and we get \na better result or a different result. We will not. We will do it \nagain.\n  All over this country, State and local governments, mayors, \nGovernors, people who build roads, people who run contracting \ncompanies, the truckers,\n\n[[Page S5036]]\n\nall kinds of people are saying to us one message: Do your job. Our job \nis to provide transportation infrastructure. Do it in a time-\nresponsible way so that States and local governments that have these \nprograms, that have them on the drawing boards can build them or the \nones that are underway, they want to complete them.\n  We can help them do that. We can do that by voting for the Carper-\nCorker-Boxer amendment.\n  Let me close with another great quote from another great guy who used \nto criticize this place, Mark Twain. He was always saying bad things \nabout the Congress, even then when he was around. But one of the things \nhe said is relevant today. Here is what he said: When in doubt, do what \nis right. You will confound your enemies and amaze your friends.\n\n  I will just say to my Republican colleagues, especially: We love you. \nWe want you to join us in doing what is right, and you will confound \nyour enemies and you will amaze your friends, and not only that, you \nwill do the right thing for our country, strengthen our economic \nrecovery, do what we are supposed to do, providing strong \ntransportation infrastructure for this Nation.\n  The people of this country are counting on us. Let's not let them \ndown.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in just a short time we are going to have \nsome votes--five--and we have been very lackadaisical. We have waited \nfor people to come here to vote for up to 25, sometimes 30 minutes. We \nare not going to do it. We have first a 15-minute vote, and then we \nhave four 10-minute votes, and we are going to cut off the time. We \nwill have the 5-minute period we always have at the end of these votes, \nbut, everyone, there is no excuse. It is not fair to everybody to wait \naround here while you are doing whatever you are doing. It is impolite, \nand it is not courteous, and we need to move things along. People have \nthings to do tonight. So when we finish the speeches, we are going to \nmove to the voting, and we are going to stick to the times. So, \neverybody, there are no excuses. Everybody should understand that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I will be brief in support of the \namendment by the Senator from Utah to devolve highway trust fund \nspending to the States. I want to correct something that was said \nearlier. It was said that all money would be devolved to the States and \nit would be up to the States to maintain the Interstate Highway System. \nThat is not the case.\n  This amendment is similar to many that have been submitted over the \nyears, myself included. I have submitted some in the House to do this \nvery thing.\n  I think we can all agree that the highway trust fund is in need of a \nmajor overall. Since 2008, we have taken, I think, $53 billion from the \ngeneral fund to replenish the highway trust fund because cars have \nbetter gas mileage, and when we have recessions, less driving is done \nand less money goes into the trust fund, and we are trying to make that \nup now.\n  In the future, it simply is not going to meet the need out there. So \nwe have got to do something to make sure we get more bang for the buck \nfor highway spending. One way to do that is to allow States greater \nflexibility to use these moneys and give the States those \nresponsibilities as well. When you do that, you can increase the bang \nfor the buck. When you look at what a lot of the money is now spent \non--the Federal money--instead of putting it toward highways, it is \ndiverted to mass transit, bike paths, ferry boats, streetscaping, and \ncountless other projects that are, at best, very local in nature and, \nat worst, very wasteful.\n  The States generally have a better idea of what their needs are and \nare better stewards of taxpayer money in that respect. I have been told \nthat if you build two bridges--if a State has two bridges to be built, \nthey are next to each other across the same river and about the same \nlocation, if you build one with Federal funds and one with State funds, \nthe one with Federal funds will cost you about 20 percent more, when \nyou take into account the Davis-Bacon requirements and other mandates \nand lengthy approval processes. So States simply get a lot more bang \nfor the buck. If we want highway dollars to go farther, we ought to do \nthis.\n  In an issue brief by Common Good, it states, ``The environmental \nreview process has grown onerous and expensive, adding years to the \nlength of infrastructure projects without improving environmental \noutcomes.'' That is another thing that Federal laws require oftentimes \nis lengthy environmental reviews.\n  We can correct a lot of this by devolving some of these \nresponsibilities to the States. I think the Lee amendment goes a long \nway toward doing that.\n  I want to say that I appreciate some of the amendments that are being \nbrought forward today. Some of them are a lot less gimmicky than we are \nused to dealing with on the highway trust fund. But the Lee amendment \nis one that actually deals with the highway trust fund long term and \noffers a long-term solution to the problem of not enough money in the \nfund and misplaced priorities with some of the spending.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Lee amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise to address the highway funding \nissue we are discussing today. Four or five years ago, Tom Brokaw wrote \na book called ``The Greatest Generation.'' He was talking about the \ngeneration that sacrificed--I repeat sacrificed--on our behalf. They \nstruggled through the Depression, they fought World War II. Then when \nit was over, they paid the debt from World War II and built the \nInterstate Highway System. I hate to think what Tom Brokaw would call \nthe book written about our generation, which has, in effect, rebuilt \nthe World War II debt, which we are passing on to our children. We \ncannot even keep the Interstate Highway System fixed. This is shameful.\n  I am here to support the Carper-Boxer-Corker amendment, because it \nforces us to deal with it in this Congress. It is not going to be any \neasier to deal with next May. Let's get it done. We have the answers. \nWe know what we have to do. The highway system is a pay-as-you-go \nsystem. The problem is, now we are going more than we are paying. The \ngasoline tax has not been raised since 1993, 21 years ago. But the cost \nof maintaining the highways, of course, has been raised precipitously.\n  Not fixing infrastructure is debt. A lot of people around here talk \nabout debt, and we are worried about the debt we are passing on to our \nchildren. I am worried about it too, but I want to make the point that \nif you do not fix a bridge or do not fix a highway or do not fix an \nairport, that is debt too because our children are going to have fix \nthem. When they get around to it, they are going to have to pay more \nfor it.\n  Senator Corker used the term ``generational theft.'' That is what it \nis. Our generation is giving ourselves tax cuts borrowing the money to \npay for those tax cuts, and our kids are going to have to pay it. That \nis not a tax cut, that is a shift of a tax from us to our children and \nour grandchildren. It is wrong.\n  To think that generation went through the Depression, fought World \nWar II, paid for World War II, and then built the Interstate Highway \nSystem in the 1950s and 1960s, and then we cannot even keep it paved, \nand we have rebuilt the debt from World War II with nothing much to \nshow for it, is unconscionable.\n  There are a lot of problems we deal with here that are hard and \ncomplicated. I deal with, on Armed Services and Intelligence, some very \ncomplicated problems that are troubling and difficult to figure the \nright thing to do. This one is simple: Pay your bills. It could not be \nmore straightforward. Pay your bills. If you want to drive on the \nhighways, have the potholes filled, we have to pay for it. To delay \nthis into next May is just that much easier, and then we are going to \nstart talking about Presidential campaigns and other campaigns and 2016 \nis going to be coming up. There are always reasons not to do it.\n  This is the 11th time we have punted on this issue. This is what the \nAmerican public is sick and tired of. They are sick and tired of us not \ndoing our basic job. There could not be a more\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\nbasic job than fixing and paying for and maintaining your \ninfrastructure. So I hope we can pass this amendment.\n  Yes, it is going to go back to the House. The House has said: Well, \nwe are not going to accept it. But let's see. Let's put something good \nover there, shorten the time, get to it this year, in December, \nNovember or December, and let's solve it. It is not going to be any \neasier to solve in May. I would argue it would probably be harder.\n  I think it is time for us to start talking straight to the American \npeople and say: We have to pay our bills. That is what this amendment \nand that is what this bill is all about. I want that book to talk about \nanother greatest generation, not the worst generation that just passed \nall the bills on to our kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, this debate has shown the urgency of \nmoving on both a short-term patch for funding transportation and a \nlong-term solution. Senator Hatch and I, with the first amendment, \noffer a bipartisan path forward. We take ideas from the other Chamber. \nWe take ideas from both parties. We take ideas that both sides can \nbuild on for the long term, as Chairwoman Boxer has recommended.\n  There are important differences between the other body and the \nSenate. The other Chamber overuses pension smoothing. That creates two \nproblems rather than solving one: They ignore the issue of tax \ncompliance. That has always been bipartisan--paying taxes on taxes \nowed. Not tax hikes, not increases, not jacking revenues through the \nstratosphere, paying taxes on what is owed.\n  The other body abandons important bipartisan initiatives, initiatives \nfrom Senator Burr and Senator Bennet to promote natural gas vehicles; \nfrom Senator Isakson and Senator Nelson to protect earned pension \nrights; and Senators Bennet and Crapo to make sure we can deliver water \nto farmers across the Nation. The American Farm Bureau has endorsed \nthis amendment.\n  The other body is saying: It is our way or no highway. I would ask \ncolleagues, is that what we are sent here to the Senate to do, that we \naccept every dotted I and every crossed T from the other body and say \nthat is just fine?\n  Colleagues, we talk about regular order. How is it regular order to \nbe a rubberstamp for the other body?\n  This is going to be done this week. That is nonnegotiable. This bill \nwill be finished this week. What should be negotiable is that the \nSenate and the other body should have a chance to work out differences. \nWorking that out is as much a part of regular order as voting on \namendments. So let's vote to be the Senate, and not have the other body \ndictate that it is either their way or no highway.\n  I urge my colleagues strongly to support the first amendment. It is a \nbipartisan amendment from Senator Hatch and me. It passed with virtual \nunanimity in the finance committee.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Have the votes been set for a certain time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired except for the 2 minutes \nbefore the vote on the Wyden amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, if Senator Wyden would like this time, I \nthink that would be really appropriate to sum it up in the 1 minute we \nhave. If there is an opposition person, they can speak. I think the \nSenator should sum it up in 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as Senator Hatch and I--very briefly--\noffer a bipartisan amendment, it is a bipartisan amendment based on the \nideas from both bodies. It reflects the fact that we have tried to come \nup with an approach we can finish this week that does not overuse \npension smoothing, that ensures we comply with our tax laws, and \nincludes bipartisan initiatives that promote natural gas vehicles, help \nour farmers, and ensure that earned pension rights are protected.\n  The other body offers what amounts to our way or no highway. We offer \na bipartisan alternative. I hope all of my colleagues will support it. \nIt is the first vote at hand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 3582.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, let me say to our Republican colleagues, \nthis bill is going back to the House. We can send it back to the House \ncorrecting what I think is a misguided approach on pension smoothing. \nWe can knock out that $3 billion pension smoothing. We can set a \ndynamic that will ensure we do something this year--that we do our jobs \nthis year and get it done.\n  Across the country, AAA, American Trucking Associations, Governors, \nSenators, want us to do our job and finish it this year. Let's vote yes \non the Carper-Corker-Boxer amendment and do our job this year.\n  I yield for the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, to my colleagues, we are now on the \nSenate Finance Committee bill. There is one major flaw in this bill. It \nhas $2.8 billion worth of pension smoothing. This amendment does away \nwith that. What it means is it would be a better bill, but we would \nalso have to solve this problem.\n  We have had 11 short-term reauthorizations of the highway bill. It is \nunbelievable. We have had five general transfers such as this, which is \nnothing but generational theft. So what this amendment will do is cause \nus to do our job by year-end.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.

There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Lee amendment.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, the amendment we are about to consider \nwould empower States to collect and spend on the transportation \ninfrastructure they need. We have a desperate need within our \ntransportation infrastructure system that is not being satisfied by our \ncurrent Federal system, one that has been bloated over the years and \nhas centralized too much power within Washington, DC. This has resulted \nin gridlock within our transportation infrastructure projects. We \nincreased the Federal gasoline tax by 460 percent between 1982 and \n1994. Instead of using that to back up and secure the Federal highway \ntrust fund, we instead overreached. We instead expanded dramatically \nthe power of the Federal Government and the expenses we incur.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support this measure which would \nreempower States and move our interests further in the 21st century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to speak to Senators for a minute \nand tell Members this amendment is the end of the Federal highway \nsystem. The States oppose it.\n  My friend from Utah gave a very impassioned speech earlier in which \nhe essentially said: Free the States. Let them be free. But the States \noppose this amendment. The American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation Officials strongly oppose it and so does the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the American Trucking Associations, American \nSociety of Civil Engineers, the National Stone, Sand, and Gravel \nAssociation. The fact is it would result in an immediate 80-percent cut \nto our States at a time when we still have 700,000 unemployed \nconstruction workers and thousands of businesses that are waiting--just \nwaiting--to rebuild the infrastructure.\n  I hope Members will vote no on this radical amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in 2011 the Federal Highway \nAdministration estimated the average transportation project in America \ntakes 79 months to go through the National Environmental Policy Act \nreview process--6\\1/2\\ years to get permission to build a road or a \nbridge. Ben Nelson, a Democrat from Nebraska, recognized the problem \nand suggested an amendment. The amendment simply says if a bridge or a \nroad is damaged or destroyed by a declared natural disaster or \nemergency and we rebuild the bridge or road in the exact same place, \nwith the same footprint, the same dimensions--everything is the same--\nthen we don't have to go through the entire environmental permitting \nprocess again. This would save a lot of time and money and allow us to \nmaintain our roads and bridges.\n  I know my friends on the other side think this problem was solved. It \nwas not solved. The Department of Transportation can exclude certain \nprojects, but can choose not to, and does not have the discretion to \nprovide an exclusion for the Army Corps of Engineers or the Fish and \nWildlife Service--the very reviews that take the most time and cost the \nmost money. So I urge my colleagues to vote yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, this issue was dealt with in MAP-21 in \nthe committee. My friend from Pennsylvania talks about using regular \norder, and we did. We had a very serious debate and we had many \ndifferent views and we compromised, and there is an expedited process \nto deal with replacement facilities. It is in MAP-21. It deals with a \nway to get this done.\n  The problem with the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania is it \ntotally eliminates all of the protections that are in the law. It \neliminates all of the protections under the Clean Water Act and under \nthe NEPA process.\n\n[[Page S5039]]\n\n  We handled this in the committee. It was bipartisan. It was done. \nThere is no need for this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  Mr. SCOTT. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this resolution is sponsored by me, the \nRepublican leader, Senator Menendez, Senator Corker, and others.\n  I want the record to reflect that Senator McConnell and I have talked \nabout this personally and we have agreed, without any hesitation, about \nthis legislation.\n  I have always been a supporter of the United Nations my whole career.\n  What I saw last week disgusted me. As the U.N. Human Rights Council \nin Geneva voted to adopt a resolution accusing Israel of human rights \nviolations in the ongoing Gaza conflict, the resolution was so \nincredibly one-sided and anti-Israel biased that it makes zero--none--\nmention of Hamas and the atrocities Hamas has committed by \nindiscriminately barraging Israel and using Palestinian civilians as \nhuman shields.\n  Hamas perpetrated this conflict. They wantonly fire rockets, and they \ndon't care where the rockets go. Hamas has fired almost 3,000 missiles \nduring a 3-week conflict.\n  In fact, the very day the U.N. Human Rights Council exonerated Hamas, \nit fired dozens of rockets into Israel the same day.\n  These aren't firecrackers. These are very violent, powerful weapons. \nThey\n\n[[Page S5040]]\n\nhave a number of rockets. It is estimated they have 10,000 of them.\n  They have something called WS-1E. It is a Chinese rocket, but they \ngot the blueprints--Iran did from the Chinese--and, of course, they \nshipped these surreptitiously into Gaza. They will travel some 30 miles \nand they carry about 40 pounds of explosives.\n  They have another one called the Fajr-5. This is an Iranian rocket. \nIt is the most prestigious weapon of Hamas.\n  The Iranian Revolutionary Guard gave Hamas the technology to \nmanufacture those. They carry a warhead of 400 pounds. They will travel \nabout 55 miles. I repeat, these aren't firecrackers.\n  They have another missile in their arsenal. It is called a Khaibar M-\n302. It is a Syrian-made missile with a range of some 12 miles. They \ncarry a 300-pound warhead and, of course, it goes far enough that they \nbelieve that with the Fajr and this one, Tel Aviv is within their \nsights.\n  The one they have the most of is called the Qassam-1 manufactured in \nGaza, with no guidance system, a 3-mile distance, and a 10-pound \nwarhead; the Qassam-2 has 9-mile distance and a 20-pound warhead.\n  They have something called a Grads. They have lots of weapons--lots \nof them--and they indiscriminately fire into Israel. These aren't \ngrenade launchers; these are missiles, huge weapons. These rockets are \nprofessionally engineered from Iran, Syria, and other countries. They \nare smuggled into Gaza. They manufacture a few of their own, as I have \nindicated. These are serious weapons of war.\n  Hamas also continues to try to construct and use its sophisticated \ntunnels into Israel, which as one Member of Hamas recently bragged, \nallow Hamas fighters to invade Israel and kill Israelis.\n  Hamas's responsibility in the Gaza clash is a fact, but the U.N. \nHuman Rights Council didn't make a single mention of this \nterrorist organization.\n\n  How many of these nations, such as Venezuela, China, Vietnam, and \nother nations--I wonder how this organization feels about their human \nrights. How many of these nations which condemned Israel would allow \ntheir own citizens to suffer through endless rocket fire--endless \nrocket fire.\n  I talked to one American doctor who goes to Israel, as he does often, \nand all night long there was one air raid siren after another. It has \nbeen going on there for weeks. This U.N. resolution that was passed \ndoes not mention a single word, nothing.\n  What is Israel supposed to do?\n  We all lament the loss of life. It is heartrending. But what else is \nIsrael to do after rocket after rocket after rocket plunges into its \nterritory.\n  I met with a man today who owns an oil company, oil exploration. They \ndo oil exploration in Nevada. It is called Noble Energy. They are the \nones who helped develop gas and oil fields in Israel. This is \nrelatively new, but they say there are rockets dropping all over.\n  As I mentioned earlier this morning, Iron Dome doesn't protect all of \nIsrael. They need more Iron Domes. Everyone, no matter what they are \ndoing, they can be out in Gaza working in the oil fields and missiles \nare flying all over from Hamas.\n  I condemn Hamas's terrorism. We should. Their terrorism is not only \nagainst Israel; it is against their own people. As I heard the \nRepublican conservative columnist in the New York Times David Brooks \nsay in the NewsHour--I am paraphrasing, but this is what he said: This \nis the first conflict I have known where the enemy says: Kill more of \nus.\n  I join my friend the Republican leader in doing what other nations \nrefuse to do: condemning the United Nations Human Rights Council's \nbiased resolution. We in this resolution condemn Hamas. The countries \nthat have voted for this are Venezuela, Cuba, China. I repeat, how \nwould they like to look at their human rights violations?\n  In this resolution, we as a country support in this conflict a \nlasting peace which can only be realized through the demilitarization \nof Gaza.\n  They talked about tunnels. These are not tunnels; these are major \noperations costing millions of dollars to dig a hole in the ground.\n  Why? To go into Israeli settlements and kill innocent people.\n  In offering the resolution before the Senate we stand with Israel and \nits right to defend itself, its security, and most importantly its \npeople.\n  I said earlier I am disgusted--as someone who has been a supporter of \nthe United Nations ever since I have been in government--and the United \nNations better take a look at this organization. This is \n``disgusting''--I use it for the third time, as I mean it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5040-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5040-S5042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMAKING EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING \n            SEPTEMBER 30, 2014--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I rise today to address a topic that is vital to seniors \nin Oregon and to seniors across our Nation, and that is our Medicare \nprogram.\n  I know how important Medicare is because I grew up in a blue-collar \nworking family. My dad was a millwright and a mechanic. He believed in \nhard work. He took a lot of satisfaction from his job. A millwright is \nthe individual who does all the mechanical work to keep the mill \nrunning. He said if he did his job right, the mill was open, the \nworkers had a payday, the company made money, and everyone was happy.\n  Meanwhile, my mother managed the finances, and she stretched a dollar \nas far as anyone possibly could. She shopped for bargains. She used \ncoupons. She collected Green Stamps, and they were able to save, to buy \na home, and to have a foundation for raising their children.\n  I benefited from that enormously.\n  But despite the foundation they had, their prospects in retirement \nwere dependent upon two critical programs: Social Security and \nMedicare. Social Security and Medicare--a basic pension and affordable \nhealth care--are simply essential for millions of working families in \nretirement. They are the difference between poverty and stability. The \nway I see it, Medicare is a covenant with our seniors. It is a covenant \nwith the 650,000 Oregonians who are on Medicare now. It is a covenant \nwith the hundreds of thousands who will utilize Medicare in the years \nto come. It is certainly a covenant with the millions across America \nwho depend on it--families. Those working families across America are \nfamilies like my parents, who worked hard their whole lives, paid into \nMedicare, and expect Medicare to be there for them when they retire. We \ncannot break that covenant.\n\n  The first step in keeping faith with our seniors is this: protecting \nwhat works. Pretty simple. We would think that is a no-brainer. But in \nfact, in Washington, a simple proposition like this--a no-brainer--is \nsometimes enormously controversial.\n  For several years now, many in Washington here, and including this \nChamber, have been pushing to privatize, to voucherize or to just plain \nweaken Medicare. They don't understand how important this program is \nfor the secure retirement of our seniors. They don't understand how \nimportant this covenant is between each working generation and our \nretirees. In fact, the House of Representatives has repeatedly voted to \neffectively end the Medicare Program that Americans know and love and \nto stick our seniors with an enormous financial burden in their \nretirement years. This is just a simple way to describe that, and that \nis to say it is simply wrong.\n  Others have said: Let's raise the Medicare retirement age to 67 or \nperhaps 70. I think, when I hear that, about my townhalls. In my \ntownhalls--and I hold one in every county in every year--people come \nand talk about whatever they would like. I recall a woman coming to a \ntownhall and she said: Senator, I am in my early sixties. I have \nseveral major health problems. She went on to describe them, and she \nsaid: I am just trying to stay alive until I can make it to age 65 and \nhave access to Medicare.\n  I have heard that theme of just trying to make it until they can \nreach that Medicare age in townhall after townhall.\n  Sometimes those who work in offices, in company circumstances, don't \nrealize how much actual physical labor takes a toll on the body. If \nsomeone is working in a post office and moving bags of mail day in and \nday out, as one\n\n[[Page S5041]]\n\ngood friend of mine has done throughout his career, it is very likely \none would have a bad back and so on and so forth. Then of course there \nare the diseases that strike like lightning.\n  Yes, those who happen to have jobs with corporations that provide a \nwonderful health care program are in a little better shape. But for our \nseniors, Medicare is a gem--a gem they have contributed into their \nentire lives, and it needs to be there for them.\n  So for some who see the difference between 65 and 67 as some modest \nadministrative change, for working Americans it is a monumental chasm \nand they fear falling into it.\n  The good news is there is a very simple action the Senate could take \nright now to protect our covenant with our seniors. The Medicare \nProtection Act, which I have cosponsored along with Senator Pryor and \nothers, makes three modest but important changes to our law: It \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that the Medicare eligibility age \nshould not be increased. It expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nMedicare Program should not be privatized or voucherized. Third, it \namends the Congressional Budget Act so that any attempt to reduce or \neliminate guaranteed benefits or to restrict eligibility criteria, such \nas raising the eligibility age, cannot be passed through the budget \nreconciliation process. This is particularly important since the House \nhas made repeated attempts to end Medicare as we know it, and to do so \nusing the budget process--the Ryan budget--rather than through stand-\nalone legislation.\n  It is time to ensure that we keep our covenant with our seniors. It \nis time to bring this bill to the floor, to debate it, and to pass it.\n  Tomorrow happens to be the anniversary on which Medicare was signed \ninto law 49 years ago. Maybe a great way to celebrate the 49th birthday \nof Medicare would be for this Chamber to debate this bill tomorrow and \npass it. If not tomorrow, I would like to see it done in this work \nperiod. And if not in this work period, let's come back and address \nthis in September.\n  The days that are left in this 2-year cycle of the Senate are rapidly \ndisappearing, and our seniors are concerned about this constant attack, \nthis constant effort to undermine these programs such as Social \nSecurity and Medicare that they have paid into throughout their life \nand that they expect to be honored when they are retired.\n  Let's bring this bill to the floor. Let's ensure that American \nseniors can stop worrying about these assaults on their retirement--\nretirement security they so much deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  (The remarks of Mr. HELLER pertaining to the introduction of (S. \n2658) are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HELLER. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, first let me express my thanks to Senator \nGrassley for letting me step ahead of him and I thank the Senator as \nwell for a number of courageous votes today. I also express my \ngratitude to him and to the Presiding Officer.\n  I understand earlier on the vote on final passage of the \ntransportation funding legislation 79 Senators voted for the bill as \namended. That is a resounding majority of Democrats and Republicans.\n  The year when Senator Grassley--longer ago than the Presiding Officer \nand I combined--came here, the idea was for Democrats and Republicans \nto work together to try to find the middle, to find principled \ncompromises. It has been a while since the Senate actually did that. I \nfeel as though today we were the Senate again. It is gratifying to me, \nand I just want to thank everyone who voted for the Corker-Boxer-Carper \namendment, for Senator Wyden's support, for everybody who helped to \nmake that amendment part of the bill and supported it in final passage. \nI hope it sends a message to our friends in the House that will not be \nlost on them. I hope before they just reject it out of order they will \nsleep on it and when they wake up in the morning maybe we can have a \ngood conversation. That is not why I rose tonight, but I wanted to get \nthat off my chest and appreciate the chance to do that.\n  I rise this evening in support of the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill introduced, I believe, last week by Senator \nMikulski.\n  The bill as you will recall will provide some $2.7 billion in order \nto address the humanitarian challenge that is playing out in recent \nweeks on our southern border with Mexico. This money will ensure that \nthe agencies charged with securing our borders don't run out of money \nthis summer. More importantly, it will address some of the underlying \nroot causes of the problems we face along our southern border.\n  As we all know, we are facing an unprecedented surge in migration \nfrom three countries. They are El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. A \nlarge number of migrants from these countries are families. Some of \nthem are unaccompanied children. Some of those unaccompanied children \nare as young as 4, 5 and 6 years old. Let me be clear. These children \nand these families are not slipping past our borders unprotected. They \nare being apprehended in large numbers by the Border Patrol almost as \nsoon as they touch U.S. soil. Some of them, many of them actually, turn \nthemselves in voluntarily to our Border Patrol.\n  Although the influx has slowed in recent weeks, the sheer number of \nchildren and families coming across our southern border in South Texas \nearlier this summer overwhelmed the Border Patrol--overwhelmed Health \nand Human Services and other Federal agencies. The administration and \nSecretary Jeh Johnson, Secretary of Department of Homeland Security, \nhave responded to this situation with what I will describe as an ``all \nhands on deck'' approach.\n  The Federal Emergency Management Agency is coordinating the DHS-wide \nresponse to the problem. The Department of Defense has provided space \non some of its military installations to house unaccompanied minors \nuntil Health and Human Services can find a placement for them. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement has greatly expanded its ability to \ndetain and remove families, and we have surged Border Patrol agents, \nimmigration judges, and other personnel to the border to help process \nthese people.\n  These measures have been working. For example, the amount of time \npeople are detained before they are removed has decreased significantly \nin recent weeks, but these emergency measures are expensive and none of \nthe Federal agencies involved have the money they need to sustain the \naggressive steps they are taking to deal with this situation.\n  The consequences of not moving forward with this legislation are \nsevere. Let me give some examples of what failing to act will mean. \nWithout this emergency funding, Immigration and Customs Enforcement \ncould be forced to release thousands of people currently being detained \nand to stop operating repatriation flights. Health and Human Services \ncould be forced to cut back on the number of children it can care for. \nChildren would be forced to stay longer at Border Patrol stations and \nBorder Patrol agents would spend more of their time taking care of \nchildren and less time pursuing the smuggling networks operating along \nour borders.\n  Some of my colleagues are suggesting that we will not be able to pass \nthis supplemental until September and that the administration can just \nmove money around until then to make up for the shortfall. That may \nhave been more feasible earlier in the fiscal year, but doing so now \nwill likely have some significant unintended consequences. For example, \nit would impair our border security because DHS may have to reduce \naerial support for the Border Patrol or stop replacing the badly needed \nx-ray machines at our ports of entry. Our ability to respond to natural \ndisasters could also be harmed.\n  I also understand my colleagues in the House introduced a bill today \nthat would provide $659 million to deal with this crisis. That is \nroughly one-quarter of what Senator Mikulski has introduced, and $659 \nmillion is just a drop in the bucket from what is needed. Incredibly \nour friends in the House are offsetting this funding by raiding other \ncritical operations which is what Senator Mikulski's bill is trying to \navoid.\n\n[[Page S5042]]\n\nFailing to move an emergency supplemental this week would be in my view \nunconscionable. I urge all my colleagues to do the right thing and make \nsure we deal with this before we leave for 5 weeks.\n  Dealing with the challenge we are facing on the border is, rightly, \nour main focus right now. However, we cannot lose sight of the root \ncauses that are driving the surge in migration in the first place. In \nthis country all too often we focus so much of our attention on dealing \nwith symptoms of problems and not enough attention on addressing the \nunderlying causes. This is particularly true on our borders. Listen to \nthis. Since 2003 we have spent $223 billion--that is almost one-quarter \nof a trillion dollars--enforcing our immigration and customs laws, \nstrengthening our borders, strengthening the security of our borders--\nalmost one-quarter of a trillion dollars. We have spent a small \nfraction of this--a very small fraction--actually less than 1 percent \nhelping El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras improve conditions for \ntheir citizens.\n  I commend the President and Chairman Mikulski for including $300 \nmillion in this emergency supplemental request aimed at addressing what \nI am convinced are the root causes of this problem. What are they? The \nlack of economic hope, lack of jobs in Central America, combined with \nincreasing violence and insecurity in the region. I know. I have been \nthere. I have been to two of those three countries, Guatemala and El \nSalvador. This year down to Mexico, down to Colombia, which 20 years \nago was just about a failed nation. Remember in Columbia roughly 20 \nyears ago when a bunch of gunmen rounded up the Supreme Court judges in \nthe country and took them out and shot them to death? That was Colombia \n20 years ago. They are no longer a failed nation. They came back from \nthe brink. They are a strong partner of ours, along with Mexico, to \nturn this situation around in these three Central American countries \nwhich are the source of all this migration to our country.\n  Based on my recent conversation with Central American leaders as \nrecently as last week, the Ambassadors of these three small countries \nas well as the Ambassador to Mexico, and based on trips to the region, \nI believe one of the critical needs is to foster economic growth and \ncreate jobs. How might we do that? One, by helping restore their rule \nof law. In those countries we have police who don't police. We have \nprosecutors who don't prosecute and we have judges who don't \nadjudicate. We have prisons that either don't rehabilitate or punish. \nWe have kidnappings and extortions. We have people who are scared to \nstay there and live there and they are bailing. They are voting with \ntheir feet. We need to help them restore the rule of law, much as we \nhelped other countries such as Colombia from the last two decades.\n  Their energy costs are roughly three times what they ought to be. \nMost of their energy from the electricity grid comes from petroleum. \nThey could use natural gas and spend half of what they spend for \nenergy. They need to improve their education and workforce skills and \naccess to capital. Those are some of the ways to strengthen their \neconomy.\n  I am not suggesting any of this will be quick or easy to do. It will \nrequire a sustained investment and focus on the region by the United \nStates and also by a number of others. This is not our job alone. This \nis a shared responsibility, and we need to keep that in mind. But it \ncan be done. In fact, we have already done it with two of our most \nimportant allies in Latin America, as I mentioned Colombia and more \nrecently with Mexico, where the economic situation was so bad that more \nthan 1 million Mexicans were traveling across our borders every year--\nmore than 1 million. Today both countries have vibrant democracies and \nvibrant economies and their citizens have hope for their future. Now \nthere are more Mexicans leaving this country going back to Mexico than \nare coming this way.\n  I will say again what I just said. We cannot and we should not do \nthis alone. This is not all on America. This needs to be a shared \nresponsibility with the governments of these three countries, with all \nthe partners in the region, including Mexico and Colombia, with all the \nprivate sector nonprofits and institutions of faith. Three hundred \nmillion dollars as an emergency supplemental is a downpayment on what \nwill need to be a long-term commitment to our neighbors in the region. \nThis cannot be one and done. If we are serious about addressing the \nsurge, we will need to do more, and frankly so will others--and I would \nunderline ``so will others.''\n  Based on what I have seen, this crisis requires a holistic approach \nand one that tackles the underlying causes that are pushing people out \nof Central America and the factors that are pulling them to our \nborders.\n  If we turn our backs on these countries I am convinced we will be \nback 10 years from now dealing with another expensive humanitarian \ncrisis on our border. We don't need that in any of these countries.\n  I urge all my colleagues to put politics aside and pass this \nemergency supplemental.\n  I yield the floor. Thank you so much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Senate \nstaffer who is retiring after 36 years of service. Nancy Pittore \nOlkewicz began her Senate career in February 1978 working for Senator \nPaul Sarbanes of Maryland, who was her home State Senator. She remained \non his staff for 23 years, which included the birth of her three \nchildren. She values her time with Senator Sarbanes and is especially \ngrateful for the opportunity to work part-time while her three \nchildren, Jenny, Brian and Eric, were small.\n  After leaving Senator Sarbanes' office in 2001, Nancy joined the \nstaff of the Senate Appropriations Committee, where she worked for me \non the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee. She later joined the \nLegislative Branch subcommittee and served as clerk under Senators \nDurbin, Landrieu and Ben Nelson. During that time she represented \nAppropriations Committee chairman Robert C. Byrd on the Capitol \nPreservation Commission and was instrumental in many high-level \ndecisions regarding the construction and operation of the Capitol \nVisitor Center. Nancy joined the staff of the Senate Sergeant at Arms \nin 2011 as the legislative liaison to then-Sergeant at Arms Terry \nGainer.\n  I wish Nancy the best of luck in all of her future endeavors. She \nwill be greatly missed by many in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5042-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5042-S5043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I previously filed budgetary aggregates \nand committee allocations for budget year 2015 pursuant to section 116 \nof the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Today I am adjusting those levels \nto account for three reported bills from the Appropriations Committee.\n  Section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \nof 1985 establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and \nallows for various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and \n314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act allows the chairman of the \nBudget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, \naggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. The Committee \non Appropriations reported three bills that are eligible for an \nadjustment under the Congressional Budget Act:\n  1) The State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct, which includes $8.625 billion in budget authority and $2.5 billion \nin outlays that is designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) \nfunding.\n  2) The Homeland Security Appropriations Act, which includes $213 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S5043]]\n\nin budget authority and $170 million in outlays that is designated as \nOCO funding and $6.438 billion in budget authority and $322 million in \noutlays that is designated as disaster funding.\n  3) The Defense Appropriations Act, which includes $59.719 billion in \nbudget authority and $28.368 billion in outlays that is designated as \nOCO funding.\n  Consequently, I am revising the budgetary aggregates for 2015 by a \ntotal of $74.995 billion in budget authority and $31.360 billion in \noutlays. I am also revising the budget authority and outlay allocations \nto the appropriations committee for 2015 by $16.416 billion in revised \nnonsecurity budget authority, $58.579 billion in revised security \nbudget authority, and $31.360 billion in total outlays.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following \ntables detailing the changes to the allocation to the

HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Corporal Gary L. Moore\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Army CPL Gary L. \nMoore. Corporal Moore died March 16, 2009 of injuries sustained when an \nimprovised explosive device blew up next to his vehicle in Baghdad, \nIraq.\n  Gary was born on January 18, 1984 in Del City, OK and graduated from \nWestmoore High School in Oklahoma City, OK in 2003. After graduation, \nhe worked as a mall security guard before enlisting in the Army in \nJanuary 2007.\n  Starting his career at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, Gary was reassigned to \nthe 978th Military Police Company, 93rd Military Police Battalion in \nFort Bliss, TX, where he deployed to Iraq in June 2008 to help provide \ntraining and oversight of the Iraqi police force.\n  BG David Phillips, the chief of the military police corps, praised \nGary's unit for their service and accomplishments in Iraq. He said \npeople in Baghdad are beginning to experience normal lives again \nbecause of the work of Moore and others. ``This past fall, when the \nelementary schools reopened, young girls were able to go to school,'' \nPhillips said.\n  Engaged to be married on November 14, 2009, his fiancee Randi Ivie \nsaid, ``He loved life. He wasn't a stranger to anyone. He always had a \ngood smile and a strong handshake.''\n  Funeral services for Gary were held on March 24, 2009 and he was laid \nto rest with full military honors in Sunnylane Cemetery in Del City, \nOK.\n  At the funeral service, Sam Davison, the church's head pastor said \n``Gary was 38 years younger than me, but he was one of my heroes. I'm \nproud of the service that he rendered. I'm proud of his bravery. I'm \nproud of Gary.''\n  Today we remember Army CPL Gary L. Moore, a young man who loved his \nfamily and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                      Corporal Stephen S. Thompson\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to remember the life and sacrifices \nof CPL Stephen S. Thompson who died on February 14, 2009 of injuries \nsustained from small arms fire in Baghdad, Iraq.\n  Stephen was born on July 14, 1985 in Tulsa, OK and was a 2004 \ngraduate of Memorial High School in Tulsa, OK. After enlisting in the \nArmy on June 27, 2006, he attended boot camp at Fort Sill, OK. He was \nthen assigned to the 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade \nCombat Team, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Hood, TX. The unit had \ndeployed to Iraq in March 2008 and was set to return home within weeks.\n  BG Ross Ridge, the deputy commander of Fort Sill, said Stephen \n``constantly exuded enthusiasm'' and always sought more responsibility \nto lead men. To his fellow soldiers, he ``was an instant friend and \nconfidante,'' the general said.\n  Corporal Thompson was buried at Floral Haven Cemetery, in Broken \nArrow, OK. Army pallbearers from Fort Sill escorted his flag-draped \ncoffin to the gravesite and an honor guard fired rifle volleys and a \nbugler played ``Taps.''\n  ``I am so proud of my son. Stephen became a man the day he joined. \nThis young man changed overnight. I remember when I went to his \ngraduation from boot camp, I couldn't hardly believe who the person \nthat was standing in front of me,'' his father Philip Thompson said.\n  Stephen is survived by his mother Tresa, his father Philip, and two \nbrothers, Austin and Christopher of Tulsa, OK.\n  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Stephen's family \nand friends. He lived a life of love for his family and country. He \nwill be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of \nour Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who \nvolunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice for \nour protection and freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5043-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5043-S5044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CHINESE DRYWALL\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, there has been an important development in\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\nthe effort to bring fairness for the victims of poisonous drywall that \nwas imported from China. Drywall sourced from China was found to emit \ndangerous chemicals that make people sick and damage metal components \nof air conditioning and other electronics, among other effects. In \nLouisiana, the defective drywall came at a particularly troubling time. \nJust as we were starting to rebuild after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, \nthe defective Chinese drywall was imported in large quantities. Many \nhomeowners returned after their houses were rebuilt only to soon find \nthem to be inhabitable yet again. We are still fighting today almost 9 \nyears after the storm to bring justice to the affected families.\n  Some other companies, specifically German-owned entities, that \nsupplied defected drywall from China have participated in the legal \nprocess and made settlements that have been helpful to homeowners. \nHowever, the Chinese company Taishan, a state-owned entity, refuses to \ntake responsibility for its harmful products and continues to disregard \nU.S. law and our court system. If the homeowners' contractors got \ndrywall from Taishan, they have thus far been out of luck in seeking \nfair compensation as Taishan continues to ignore our court system.\n  In February 2014, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New \nOrleans upheld a $2.7 million default judgment requiring Taishan to \ncover the cost of removing its defective drywall. Even after losing the \nappeal, Taishan let the deadline pass for an appeal to the Supreme \nCourt, meaning the case was back in the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Louisiana and Judge Eldon Fallon. Earlier this \nmonth, Taishan disregarded our legal system and refused to appear in \ncourt proceedings in this case. Judge Fallon ruled that Taishan was in \ncontempt of court for failing to appear to address the default judgment \nentered against the company. He ordered Taishan to pay $15,000 in \nattorney's fees of the plaintiffs and $40,000 in penalties. Most \nimportantly, his ruling banned Taishan and any of its affiliates or \nsubsidiaries from doing business in the United States unless and until \nit participates in the court's process on this ongoing case. To help \nensure enforcement of the order, the court sent notice of its ruling to \nthe Federal Government.\n  I applaud the court's effort to protect the integrity of our legal \nsystem in taking action to force the Chinese company to comply with the \nlaw and the court's orders. If state-owned Chinese companies such as \nTaishan want to do business in the United States, they must follow the \nlaw and must honor our legal system. If they will not honor commitments \nand work to resolve claims, how can we expect any Americans to trust \nany business relations with or products from Chinese government \ncontrolled companies? Our government must insist that Taishan return to \nthe table and participate in the legal process.\n  To help stop this situation from happening again, I worked to pass \ninto law bipartisan legislation to stop unsafe drywall from entering \nU.S. markets by ensuring that the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nfollows a voluntary consensus health and safety standard. Enacted in \n2013, this law also ensures that unsafe drywall will not be reused by \nrequiring that it be labeled and that its manufacturers are identified. \nI specifically offered an amendment to focus the emphasis of the \nlegislation on high sulfur content, the main damaging element emitted \nfrom the defective drywall, and to make the origin of the drywall \ntraceable to the manufacturer. This law protects homeowners going \nforward, but it cannot help the homeowners still looking for justice \nnow. We know that the harmful drywall came from China, and the remedy \nfor these homeowners is for Taishan to follow the court's order, come \nto the table, and reach a fair settlement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5044-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, due to family commitments in Florida, I was \nunable to vote on the confirmation of Pamela Harris to the Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Had I been present, I would have voted \nagainst Ms. Harris's confirmation.\n  The Senate has few responsibilities more important than providing \nadvice and consent on the President's judicial nominations. These are \nlifetime appointments with great power, whose decisions directly impact \nthe life, liberty, and property of the parties who come before them.\n  Americans deserve a judiciary staffed by lawyers who are not just \nhighly capable but who are also men and women of a particular \ncharacter. We rightfully expect judges to understand their important \nbut properly limited role to say what the law is, without bias, without \nagenda. As passionately as a judge may feel about a particular issue, \nwhen he or she puts on that black robe, all personal views must be set \naside.\n  No one can deny Ms. Harris has a first rate mind or that she has \nbuilt an impressive career. Unfortunately, many of her statements \nduring that career suggest that her mind is better suited to academia, \nor elective office, than it is to the bench. She has identified herself \nas ``profoundly liberal'' and said she views the Constitution as \n``profoundly progressive.'' These types of statements, along with \ntroubling interpretations of the First Amendment among other issues, \npaint a picture of a nominee more likely to become a liberal activist \njudge than one who neutrally applies the law.\n  For those reasons, I would not have supported granting Ms. Harris the \nprofound power that comes with lifetime tenure on the Federal bench.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5044-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5044-S5045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BRYSON BACHMAN\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Bryson Bachman, who \nhas served as a critical member of my staff for nearly 3 years, and as \nmy chief counsel for the past year.\n  Bryson Bachman is an extraordinary judicial talent. His legal \npedigree began at Harvard Law School and continued in his clerkship \nwith the Honorable Thomas B. Griffith on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe DC Circuit and later as an associate at Sidley Austin. Bryson's \ntalent and contribution do not come solely from his impressive \nbackground and experience but from his personal commitment to making a \ndifference and adding value in everything he does.\n  I have valued and benefited greatly from his deep understanding of \nthe law and his ability to approach each issue in a thoughtful, \nrespectful and insightful way. Above all I have come to admire and \ntrust him as a person of unmatched integrity. As a member of the \njudiciary committee Bryson's assistance and guidance have been \ninvaluable. When he briefs an issue I know he has done the often unseen \nand unrecognized work of truly understanding the issue from all angles. \nHis willingness to do the heavy mental lifting on a wide range of \nissues always provided me great confidence going into important \njudiciary hearings or voting on difficult legislation.\n  The test of a great leader and a great lawyer is not found simply by \nwhat they do in a given role, but more importantly, how they do it. \nSome walk into a room and people recognize them as the smartest person \nin the room. True leaders, such as Bryson Bachman, walk into that same \nroom, as the smartest person in the room, but leave everyone in the \nroom feeling smarter and better as a result of how the dialogue and \ndiscussion were fostered. Creating space for every member of the team \nto participate in and contribute to a discussion, while still driving \nthe most salient points to consider and evaluating an array of \nscenarios, is the hallmark of Bryson's time as a member of my staff.\n  Bryson will be sorely missed in our office but we wish him, his wife \nDestiny and son Hamilton continued success in their next season of life \nand work. This Congressional Record is but a small note in history of \nBryson Bachman's impact on the important work done in the Senate. \nHowever, his more important work and longer lasting impact is found in \nthe imprint he has made on the hearts and minds of those with whom he \nhas worked. I count myself as one of those deeply influenced by Bryson. \nI admire him for his talent, I acknowledge him for his loyal service \nand thank him for his friendship.\n\n[[Page S5045]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5045-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         RECOGNIZING MOOREMART\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I recognize and commend \nMooreMart, an outstanding charitable organization based in Nashua, NH, \nthat is devoted to supporting America's servicemen and women. For more \nthan 10 years, MooreMart has shipped care packages to American soldiers \nin Afghanistan and Iraq--lifting the spirit of our brave military \nmembers serving in harm's way.\n  What began in February 2004 as a family project started by Paul Moore \nand Carole Moore Biggio to support their brother--New Hampshire Army \nNational Guard SSG Brian Moore, who was deployed to Iraq--has developed \ninto a major volunteer effort. Over the past decade, MooreMart has sent \nmore than 63,000 care packages to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nTheir effort came to be known as ``MooreMart,'' because the soldiers \nreceiving the packages remarked that the boxes ``carry more supplies \nthan WalMart.'' It's a clever nickname that is now well known in the \nGranite State\n  Once word spread about MooreMart's wartime effort, hundreds of New \nHampshire citizens, and dozens of organizations and businesses, gave \ntheir support to this very special organization. At packing events held \nseveral times throughout the year at the Nashua National Guard Armory, \nvolunteers have assembled packages containing goods that make \ndeployments a little easier--including candy, toothpaste, dental floss, \nenergy bars, trail mix, lip balm, playing cards, puzzles, white tube \nsocks, crackers, and notes of encouragement. At Christmas, MooreMart \nhas sent Christmas stockings filled with candy canes, Christmas lights, \nand cookies. In addition to sending these goodies to our troops, they \nhave also treated veterans in New Hampshire and remembered our wounded \nwarriors at Walter Reed.\n  MooreMart's generosity has also extended to children in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, sending them school supplies and toys. Through these \ndonations, Afghan and Iraqi children have seen the warmth and \ngenerosity of the American people.\n  The Moore family and all the MooreMart volunteers represent the very \nbest of New Hampshire and our Nation: patriotic Americans coming \ntogether to support our troops. This exemplary organization has touched \nthe lives of our brave soldiers serving on faraway battlefields--making \nsure they know they're not forgotten during tough deployments.\n  As MooreMart celebrates its 10th Anniversary, I join citizens across \nNew Hampshire and the Nation in commending Paul Moore and Carole Moore \nBiggio, the Moore family, and all the tremendous MooreMart volunteers \nfor the inspiring work they have done supporting our troops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5045-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING STEWART'S 96 RANCH\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 150th \nanniversary of the founding of Stewart's 96 Ranch in Paradise Valley, \nNV, which serves as an example of the rich and prosperous history that \nmakes the Silver State so unique.\n  This year commemorates a very special year--not only for Stewart's 96 \nRanch, but also in Nevada's history--during which we celebrate 150 \nyears of statehood. From those days of bitter conflict, Nevada forged a \nState dedicated to preserving liberty and bettering America. Our \ndramatic entrance is why our State calls itself Battle Born and why \nNevadans, over the past 150 years, have been entrepreneurial, fiercely \nindependent, and as diverse as our terrain. It is an honor to recognize \nStewart's 96 Ranch in conjunction with our great State's \nsesquicentennial here today.\n  Founded in 1864 by William Stock, a German immigrant, Stewart's 96 \nRanch is one of Nevada's most iconic ranching operations. Over the past \n15 decades, the ranch has faced many obstacles, from aiding our country \nin World War II efforts to constantly maintaining and modernizing the \noperation to keep up with the current demands. Due to the ranch's long \nand fascinating history, it was chosen as the subject of a 1980 Library \nof Congress project called ``Buckaroos in Paradise.'' It is considered \nto be one of the most iconic cattle ranches in the West and one of the \nlast true ``old time outfits'' still in original family ownership. Over \nthe years, the ranch has grown and changed, but the original love of \nParadise Valley and commitment to agriculture has never wavered.\n  What started as a simple homestead has grown into a thriving ranch \nwith a new cattle herd that has grown to nearly 800 mother cows and is \ncontinuing to flourish. Today, the ranch is still owned and operated by \nthe fourth and fifth generations of William Stock's direct descendants. \nFred Stewart, with the help of his wife Kris and daughter Patrice, \ncurrently manages the ranch. Fifth generation Patrice Stewart is now a \nyoung woman who owns and manages her own small herd of top commercial \nbeef cattle on the ranch, actively helps her parents on the ranch and \nis involved in all ranch decisions.

Mr. President, it is proper that we note the \ndeath of an American patriot who served the U.S. government with \ndedication for many years. The Nation lost Wayman Gray Sherrer, 86, on \nMarch 12, 2014. He graduated from the fine Howard College, now Samford \nUniversity, where he was senior class president, and the University of \nAlabama School of Law in the class of 1956. Before college, he served \nin the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  Following law school, he served 6 years with the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, after which he was elected county solicitor (district \nattorney) for Blount County, AL. In 1969, he was appointed U.S. \nattorney for the Northern District of Alabama and served ably in that \nposition for 8 years. During that time, I served as an assistant U.S. \nattorney for the Southern District of Alabama and came to know him. We \nmaintained contact over the years and were able to talk over those \nspecial times. He served his county and country with distinction, was \nactive in community and civic affairs, and as a member of the Lester \nMemorial United Methodist Church.\n  Wayman loved his country and served her with fidelity. I was proud to \nknow him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5045-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5045-5", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  In executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate a \nmessage from the President of the United States submitting a nomination \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5045-6", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5045-S5046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13441 WITH RESPECT TO LEBANON--\n                                 PM 52\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo The Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\nfor the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 \ndays prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nreinstate the financing for the Hazardous Substance Superfund, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my \ncolleagues Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Senator Barbara \nBoxer of California, the Superfund Polluter Pays Restoration Act of \n2014. This bill reinstates an expired excise tax on polluting \nindustries to help fund the cleanup of Superfund sites and restore \ncommunities back to health.\n  Across our Nation we have far too many un-remediated and dangerous \nSuperfund sites sitting in our neighborhoods--properties that are \nliterally poisoning our residents. This problem is particularly acute \nin my State of New Jersey, which is both the most densely populated \nState and the State with the most Superfund sites.\n  Nationwide, there are more than 1300 Superfund sites on the National \nPriorities List, NPL, which require long-term cleanups. The sites \nlisted on the NPL are the most heavily contaminated in the country and \nare the sites that pose the greatest potential risk to public health \nand the environment. In the past five years, 94 new sites have been \nadded to the NPL, but an average of only 7 have been removed each year.\n  Cleanup has not even begun at hundreds of these NPL sites. Officials \nat the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, state that the reason why cleanup is not \nstarting at hundreds of sites, and taking so long at others, is because \nof the limited funding available for cleanup activities.\n  There are more than 11 million Americans who live within one mile of \na Superfund site, and of that, 3 to 4 million are children. Studies \nshow that children are particularly susceptible to the health hazards \npresented by Superfund sites. Researchers have found increased autism \nrates, and recently researchers found that babies born to mothers \nliving within 1 mile of a Superfund site prior to cleanup had a 20 \npercent greater incidence of being born with birth defects.\n  The need for more funding could not be clearer.\n  When Congress created Superfund in 1980, it established the Superfund \nTrust Fund from which the EPA receives annual appropriations for \nSuperfund cleanup activities. For 15 years, the Trust Fund received a \nsteady source of revenue from excise taxes on crude oil and certain \nchemicals. Those taxes expired at the end of fiscal year 1995. The \nSuperfund program is now operating at 40 percent of 1987 levels, which \nis unsustainable according to a 2010 GAO report which found that \ncurrent funding levels would likely not be sufficient to meet the \nfuture needs of the Superfund program EPA officials estimate they will \nneed 2 to 2.5 times more funding to effectively and efficiently cleanup \nunremediated sites.\n  It is unfair for the taxpayer to shoulder the burden of cleanup costs \nfor these Superfund sites. To meet the need for additional funding and \nto protect the health of our families and children, Senator Menendez, \nSenator Boxer, and I have come together to introduce this act, aimed at \nholding polluting industries accountable, reducing the need to spend \ntaxpayer dollars, and providing a steady flow of funds to the Superfund \nprogram.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Lee, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Heller, Mr. \n        Franken, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. \n        Coons, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Markey, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 2685. A bill to reform the authorities of the Federal Government \nto require the production of certain business records, conduct \nelectronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, \nand use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, \ncounterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes; read \nthe first time.\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to speak on another issue. I see \nmy distinguished colleague from Utah Senator Lee is on the floor. It is \nan issue he has worked with me on. We have tried to join together. It \nwas more than a year ago that not only here in the United States but \nthe whole world learned some very startling details about the massive \nscope of the National Security Agency's surveillance programs.\n  Since then the American people, and actually, all three branches of \ngovernment have been debating the same fundamental questions about the \nextent of government power that the Framers considered when they \ncrafted the Constitution. Many of us had been arguing those same \nissues, whether in the Judiciary Committee, the Intelligence Committee, \nor others. But it was hard to get anybody's attention.\n  Suddenly the whole world was listening.\n  The obvious question is, when and how should the government be \npermitted to gather information about its citizens? How do we protect \nour country while we preserve our fundamental principles and our \nconstitutional liberties? These questions are even more relevant and \nmore complex as technology develops rapidly, and as more data is \ncreated every second.\n  Nobody questions that the government cannot just walk into our \nhouses, rifle through our drawers, our filing cabinets, and our \ncupboards, to see what we might have there. But that is not where we \nkeep our data anymore. It is on computers. By the same token, they \nshouldn't have the right to rifle through our electronic files either. \nIf they collect all this data, should the government be allowed to \ncollect and use all of it?\n  To what extent does this massive collection of data improve our \nnational security and at what cost to our privacy and free expression? \nIf we pick up everything, do we actually have anything?\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee considered these and other important \nquestions during the course of six public hearings held over the past \nyear. During this deliberative process, the Committee considered \nwhether the bulk collection of Americans' phone records has been \neffective in preventing terrorist attacks, the privacy implications of \nthe program, and the effect on the U.S. technology industry. Those \nhearings helped to demonstrate the need for additional limits on \ngovernment surveillance authorities.\n  As these hearings continued, the call for an end to bulk collection \nunder Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act grew louder and more \npersistent. The President's own Review Group on Intelligence and \nCommunications Technology testified before the Judiciary Committee to \ncall for an end to bulk collection, concluding that ``[t]he information \ncontributed to terrorist investigations by the use of section 215 \ntelephony meta-data was not essential to preventing attacks and could \nreadily have been obtained in a timely manner using conventional \nsection 215 orders.'' The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board \nalso called for an end to bulk collection, concluding that the program \n``lacks a viable legal foundation under Section 215.'' Technology \nexecutives, legal scholars and privacy advocates called for an end to \nbulk collection. These witnesses also proposed meaningful reforms to \nother government authorities, such as Section 702 of FISA, the pen \nregister and trap and trace authorities under FISA, and the national \nsecurity letter statutes.\n  Then, earlier this year, President Obama himself embraced the growing \nconsensus that the bulk collection of phone records should not continue \nin its current form.\n  Just this week two new reports highlighted the costs of not placing \nreasonable limits on government surveillance, not just the significant \neconomic cost if you don't put limits but the impact of journalistic \nfreedom and also our right to counsel--our right to counsel--something \nwe assume is an unalienable right, and it is, but it is being \nundermined.\n  That is why the technology industry, the privacy and civil liberties \ncommunity are unified in support for this bill. It is actually now time \nfor Congress to act.\n  That is why I am introducing the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014. It builds \non the legislation that was passed by the House of Representatives in \nMay, as well as the original bicameral, bipartisan legislation I \nintroduced with Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner 10 months ago--last \nOctober.\n  I continue to prefer the original version of the USA FREEDOM Act, but \nwe are running short on time in this Congress. Since passage of the \nHouse version in May, I have been working to address concerns that the \ntext of the House bill--though clearly intended to end bulk \ncollection--did not do so effectively. I have worked with both \nRepublicans and Democrats, House Members and Senators.\n  I spent the past several months in discussions with the intelligence \ncommunity and a wide range of stakeholders, other Senators, privacy and \ncivil liberties groups, and our U.S. technology industry.\n  The bill I am introducing today is the result of those hundreds of \nhours of negotiations and meetings.\n  First, and most importantly, this bill ensures that the ban on bulk \ncollection is a real ban on bulk collection and that it is effective. \nIt ensures the government cannot rely on section 215 of the USA PATRIOT \nAct--the FISA pen register and trap-and-trace device statute or the \nnational security letter statutes--to engage in the indiscriminate \ncollection of Americans' private records: yours, mine or anybody else's \nwho may be watching this debate.\n  Under this legislation, when the government uses these authorities to \ncollect information, it has to narrowly limit its collection based on a \n``specific selection term'' that identifies the focus of the \ncollection. ``Specific selection term'' is carefully defined. For \nSection 215 and the pen register statute, the definition ensures that \nthe government must use a term that is narrowly limited to the greatest \nextent reasonably practicable consistent with the purpose for seeking \nthe information. The bill specifies the term cannot be a broad \ngeographic area, such as city or State or ZIP Code or area code, nor \ncan it simply be a service provider. For national security letters, the \ngovernment must specifically identify the target about whom it seeks \ninformation. These provisions preclude the government from seeking \nlarge swaths of information that it does not need--and that might very \nwell include private details about the lives of law-abiding Americans.\n\n  As a backstop, the bill also mandates additional minimization \nprocedures when the government's collection under Section 215 is likely \nto be overbroad. It requires the government to destroy data unrelated \nto its investigation within a reasonable time frame.\n  Second, the bill enhances transparency regarding the government's use \nof surveillance tools. That is one of the best checks on a runaway \ngovernment. FISA and other national security laws provide law \nenforcement with an extraordinary amount of power. The American people \nhave a right to know how that power is exercised.\n  Among other things, this bill requires the government to report to \nthe public key information about the scope of the collection under a \nrange of national security authorities, including the number of queries \nabout Americans that it conducts in databases collected under Section \n702. It also allows private companies more leeway to disclose the \nnumber of FISA orders and national security letters they receive.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Franken, on the \nfloor. I thank him in particular for his leadership and helping to \ndraft these transparency provisions.\n  Likewise, I thank Senator Blumenthal for his work on the bill's key \nreforms to the FISA Court. The bill requires the FISA Court and the \nFISA Court of Review, in consultation with the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board, to appoint a panel of special advocates who \ncan advance legal positions supporting individual privacy and civil \nliberties--in other words, it will not be just one voice that is heard, \nwe will actually have dissenting voices--and improve judicial review.\n  The FISA Court would be required to appoint one of these advocates \nwhenever it confronts a significant or novel issue of law, or it must \nissue a written finding that appointment of an advocate is not \nappropriate. The bill also requires the FISA Court to report the\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\nnumber of times that it appoints or declines to appoint an advocate \nwhen confronting a novel or significant issue of law. This bill \nadditionally provides a certification mechanism for appellate review of \nFISA Court decisions when the government prevails, and it provides a \ndeclassification process for significant FISA Court decisions.\n  Finally, this bill improves the judicial review procedures for \nnondisclosure orders that accompany Section 215 orders and national \nsecurity letters. These have been so overused. This legislation \nresponds to decisions by Federal courts that found these provisions \nviolate the First Amendment.\n  While this bill contains significant reforms and improvements, it \ndoesn't fix every problem, and we know there is more work to be done--\nin particular, with regard to Section 702 of FISA and other broad \ngovernment surveillance authorities that implicate the privacy rights \nof Americans.\n  We could spend the next 20 years waiting to get 100 percent of \neverything we need. I would like to get most of what we need and then \nwork on the rest.\n  The bill provides for public reporting on Section 702. That will help \nset the stage for reform, but transparency alone is not enough. I will \ncontinue to work with both Republican and Democratic Senators and other \noutside experts to work on these issues.\n  For developing the legislation, I consulted closely with the Office \nof the Director of National Intelligence, the NSA, the FBI, and the \nDepartment of Justice--and every single word of this bill was vetted \nwith those agencies. I am grateful for their receptiveness to the \npublic's concerns and for their constructive participation in this \nprocess. Together, we worked hard to ensure that this bill enacts \nsignificant and meaningful reforms to protect individual privacy, while \nproviding the Intelligence Community with operational flexibility to \nsafeguard this country.\n  The Intelligence Community will still have the ability to safeguard \nthis country--nobody is suggesting they shouldn't, but collecting \neverything is the same as having nothing. That was the mistake we had \nbefore 9/11, where we had the information that could have stopped the \nattack on 9/11, but we failed to look at it all.\n  I am pleased the executive branch supports our bill. I am pleased the \nPresident agrees it should be enacted as soon as possible. But \nultimately we--Senators and our colleagues in the other body--have the \nresponsibility of the American people to do what is right and to \nprotect the privacy of the American people. That is why we have worked \nhard with everybody to ensure the bill enacts meaningful reforms.\n  This is the most important thing to remember: We can enact this bill, \nget it signed into law, and it would represent the most significant \nreform of government surveillance authorities since Congress passed the \nUSA PATRIOT Act 13 years ago. It is a historic opportunity. We would be \nderelict in our duty to this country if we passed up that opportunity.\n  I think if people such as Senator Lee, Senator Durbin, Senator \nHeller, Senator Franken, Senator Cruz, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Tom \nUdall, Senator Coons, Senator Heinrich, Senator Markey, Senator Hirono, \nSenator Klobuchar, and Senator Whitehouse have joined, this is not a \npartisan bill, this is not a Democratic or Republican bill, this is a \ngood bill that protects America.\n\n  I also note the particular contributions over many years of Senator \nWyden and Senator Mark Udall. They have worked tirelessly to protect \nAmericans' privacy from their posts on the Intelligence Committee.\n  I am introducing this revised version of the USA FREEDOM Act today \nbecause we cannot afford to wait any longer to end the bulk collection \nof Americans' records. I am concerned that we are running out of time \non the legislative calendar. Typically, my strong preference would be \nto take up the bill in the Judiciary Committee and mark it up. But \ngiven the need to act quickly, I am willing to forego regular order and \ntake this bill directly to the Senate Floor.\n  We cannot let this opportunity go by. This is a debate about \nAmericans' fundamental relationship with their government, about \nwhether our government should have the power to create massive \ndatabases of information about its citizens or whether we are in \ncontrol of our own government, not the other way around.\n  I believe we have to impose stronger limits on government \nsurveillance powers. I am confident that most Vermonters, and most \nAmericans, agree with me. We need to get this right, and we need to get \nit done without further delay.\n  I close with one very quick story I have used before. About the only \nthing I have actually saved from a newspaper that was written about me, \nand I liked it so much I framed it. As the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer knows, I live on a dirt road, a place where my wife and I \ncelebrated our honeymoon 52 years ago. The adjoining farmer has known \nme since I was a little kid.\n  The whole story in that paper goes like this: A man in an out-of-\nState car on a Saturday morning drives up, sees the farmer on the \nporch, and says:\n  Does Senator Leahy live up this way?\n  He says: Are you a relative of his?\n  Well, no, I am not.\n  Are you a friend of his?\n  Well, not really.\n  Is he expecting you?\n  No.\n  Never heard of him.\n  We like our privacy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2685\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

First, I thank my distinguished colleague, the senior \nSenator from Vermont, for his leadership on this issue. I am pleased to \njoin him as a cosponsor of this legislation. As the lead cosponsor of \nthis bill, I attest to the fact that this is an issue that is neither \nRepublican nor Democratic, it is neither liberal nor conservative, it \nis simply American.\n  It is a fundamental concept of liberty that we have to control the \ngovernment. The government and the immense power of government has \nexpanded over time with advances in technology. Our country certainly \nhas changed to an enormous degree over the centuries since James \nMadison penned our Bill of Rights. But the protection of liberty \nafforded by the Fourth Amendment has only become more important, not \nless important, as the government's ability to collect information has \nadvanced.\n  This legislation, which has broad-based bipartisan support, is \nabsolutely necessary. It can be implemented in a way that will still \nallow the government to protect us. It will also protect us from the \nrisk of overreach by the government.\n  We have to remember it is not just the government that we have in \nplace today, even if we assume, for purposes of this discussion, that \neveryone who works for the government, every government agent who \nparticipates in the collection of this information is doing what is \nright. We can't always assume that will be the case in the future.\n  I see my time has expired. I once again thank my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, for his sponsorship of this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the transparency \nprovisions in the USA FREEDOM Act. I am a proud cosponsor of Chairman \nLeahy's bill, and I am particularly proud to have written the key \ntransparency provisions with my friend Senator Dean Heller of Nevada.\n  Senator Lee is right. This is not a Republican bill or a Democratic \nbill. This isn't a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. I thank \nSenator Lee for his leadership. Of course, we are all indebted to \nSenator Leahy for his leadership on this issue.\n  Because of time constraints, I am not going to be able to give the \nspeech I wanted to, so I will try to ask for time for tomorrow. I know \ntoday's floor is very busy.\n  I wish to say it is very important that there is enough transparency \nin our NSA surveillance that Americans can judge for themselves if we \nare striking the right balance between national security and our civil \nliberties.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today my colleague Senator Leahy, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, introduced legislation that would \namend the PATRIOT Act. This new legislation reflects a bicameral and \nbipartisan compromise that ends the bulk data collection practices \ncurrently being used. It also gives our intelligence officials specific \nrules to follow so they can keep the operational capabilities necessary \nto protect the United States from a terrorist attack without \ncompromising the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. I thank Senator \nLeahy for his work, and I am grateful for his partnership.\n  This important step is necessary for restoring Americans' privacy \nrights which were taken by a well-intended but overreaching Federal \nGovernment in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n  The expanded authority given to the National Security Agency through \nexecutive action and the PATRIOT Act was intended to prevent another \nattack on America. While I was not a Member of Congress on 9/11, I \nshared the horror all Nevadans felt watching the murder of thousands of \ninnocent Americans, and the profound sadness as buildings in New York \nand Washington, DC, sat smoldering. I understand as well as anyone here \nthe reason behind the actions our Nation's leaders took to ensure that \nanother attack on America never materialized, and why our leaders felt \nthat no limits should be imposed. No matter what the cost, Americans \nhad to be protected against another attack.\n  Viewing the situation from that lens, it is easy to understand how \nthe Fourth Amendment was brushed aside as the Senate expanded law \nenforcement surveillance capabilities with just one dissenting vote.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation then used section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act to expand the scope of surveillance far beyond even what \nsome of the authors believed they were authorizing. The FBI argued that \nsection 215 provided authority to collect phone data of law-abiding \ncitizens without their knowledge. Specifically, they could use the \nbusiness records provision to force phone companies to turn over \nmillions of telephone calls when there is a reasonable ground or \nrelevance to believe that the information sought is relevant to an \nauthorized investigation of international terrorism.\n  As a result, we now have a bulk collection program in existence where \ntelephone companies hand over millions of records to the NSA as part of \na massive pre-collection database.\n  As someone who voted against the PATRIOT Act time and time again, I \nbelieve such data collection practices are a massive intrusion of our \nprivacy, which is why I partnered with the senior Senator from Vermont \nto end these programs. Our legislation tightens the definitions of \n``specific selection term'' for section 215 of the PATRIOT Act and FISA \npen register trap-and-trace devices so that the information requested \nis limited to specifically identifying a person, account, address, or a \npersonal device.\n  With this legislation, bulk collection will be eliminated and the \nrecords will stay with the telephone companies. The massive information \ngrabs from the Federal Government based on geography or email service \nwill no longer be permissible. And of the information that is \ncollected, the legislation imposes new restrictions on its use and \nretention. These reforms will help shift the balance of privacy away \nfrom the Federal Government and back to the American people.\n  I am proud that this bill also includes the Franken-Heller \nSurveillance\n\n[[Page S5066]]\n\nTransparency Act of 2013. I was pleased to join Senator Franken on this \nlegislation because, at the very least, Americans deserve to know the \nnumber of people whose information is housed by the NSA. For the first \ntime in American history, the government is forced to disclose to the \nAmerican people roughly how many of them have had their communications \ncollected.\n  Our provision calls for reports by the Director of National \nIntelligence detailing the requests for information authorized under \nthe PATRIOT Act and the FISA Amendments Act. The reports would specify \nthe total number of people whose information has been collected under \nthese programs and how many people living in the United States have had \ntheir information collected. They would also permit the intelligence \ncommunity to report on how many Americans actually had their \ninformation looked at by the NSA or any other intelligence agencies.\n  Furthermore, these provisions would allow telephone and Internet \ncompanies to tell consumers basic information regarding FISA court \norders they receive and the number of users whose information is turned \nover.\n  The principles outlined in this bill to increase transparency for \nAmericans and private companies would clear up a tremendous amount of \nconfusion that exists within the programs. And our private companies \nneed the added disclosure. The Information Technology & Innovation \nFoundation estimates that American cloud computing companies could lose \n$22 billion to $35 billion in the next 3 years because of concerns \nabout their involvement with surveillance programs. The analytics firm \nForrester put potential losses much higher, at $180 billion.\n  I want to be clear: I share the concerns of all Americans that we \nmust protect ourselves against threats to the homeland. I believe \nterrorism is very real and the United States is the target of those \nlooking to undermine the freedoms we hold as the core of our national \nidentity. If the bulk collection programs in existence were bearing so \nmuch information to protect the homeland, it would change my opinion on \nthe need for the USA Freedom Act. However, the bulk collection program \nhas simply not provided the tangible results that justify a privacy \nintrusion of this level. We know this because on October 2, 2013, the \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, asked NSA \nDirector Keith Alexander the following question:\n\n       At our last hearing, deputy director Inglis stated that \n     there's only really one example of a case where, but for the \n     use of Section 215 bulk phone records collection, terrorist \n     activity was stopped. Was Mr. Inglis right?\n\n  To which Director Alexander responded:\n\n       He's right. I believe he said two, Chairman.\n\n  Congress has authorized the collection of millions of law-abiding \ncitizens' telephone metadata for years and it has only solved two \nongoing FBI investigations. Of those two investigations, the NSA has \npublicly identified one. In fact, that case could have easily been \nhandled by obtaining a warrant and going to the telephone company. It \nis the case of an individual in San Diego who was convicted of sending \n$8,500 to Somalia in support of al-Shabaab, the terrorist organization \nclaiming responsibility for the Kenyan mall attack. The American phone \nrecords allowed the NSA to determine that a U.S. phone was used to \ncontact an individual associated with this terrorist organization. I am \nappreciative that the NSA was able to apprehend this individual, but it \ndoes not provide overwhelming evidence that this program is necessary. \nThe Obama administration has come to the same conclusion and so has the \nintelligence community.\n\n  The operational capabilities the intelligence community relies on to \nconduct their mission to keep us safe will not be impacted by the USA \nFREEDOM Act. If it were, the Intelligence Community and the \nadministration would not have brokered this compromise legislation. \nEnding the bulk collection programs and giving Americans more \ntransparency so they can determine for themselves whether they believe \nthese programs should exist is an obligation we have to all of our \nconstituents.\n  We have a bill introduced today that would give our law enforcement \nauthorities the tools they need to keep us safe and also stay true to \nthe Fourth Amendment. I encourage my colleagues to support these \nimportant reforms and I hope it can quickly be considered by this \nChamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5066-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5066-S5067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 526--SUPPORTING ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF \n                 AGAINST HAMAS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Corker, Mr. \nCardin, and Mr. Graham) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to.:\n\n                              S. Res. 526\n\n       Whereas Hamas, an organization designated as a Foreign \n     Terrorist Organization by the United States Department of \n     State since 1997, has fired over 2,500 rockets \n     indiscriminately from Gaza into Israel;\n       Whereas Israel has a right to defend itself from Hamas's \n     constant barrage of rockets and to destroy the matrix of \n     tunnels Hamas uses to smuggle weapons and Hamas fighters into \n     Israel to carry out terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas the Government of Israel has taken significant \n     steps to protect civilians in Gaza, including dropping \n     leaflets in Gaza neighborhoods in advance of Israeli military \n     attacks, calling Palestinians on the phone urging them to \n     evacuate certain areas before the military strikes targets, \n     and issuing warnings to civilians in advance of firing on \n     buildings;\n       Whereas Israel's attacks have focused on terrorist targets \n     such as Hamas's munitions storage sites, areas sheltering \n     Hamas's rocket systems, Hamas's weapons manufacturing sites, \n     the homes of militant leaders, and on the vast labyrinth of \n     tunnels Hamas's fighters use to penetrate Israel's territory \n     and attack Israelis;\n       Whereas Hamas uses rockets to indiscriminately target \n     civilians in Israel;\n       Whereas Israel has accepted and implemented numerous \n     ceasefire agreements that Hamas has rejected;\n       Whereas Hamas continued to fire rockets into Israel during \n     a 24-hour truce that Hamas had itself proposed;\n       Whereas Israel embraced the Egyptian-proposed ceasefire \n     agreement, which Hamas resoundingly rejected on July 27, \n     2014;\n       Whereas Hamas intentionally uses civilians as human \n     shields;\n       Whereas Hamas refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist;\n       Whereas Israel's Iron Dome has protected Israel's civilian \n     population from the over 2,500 rockets that Hamas has \n     indiscriminately fired into Israel since July 7, 2014;\n       Whereas, without Iron Dome's ability to intercept and \n     destroy Hamas's missiles, Israeli neighborhoods would have \n     been significantly damaged and Israeli casualties would have \n     been much higher;\n       Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Council voted to \n     accept a biased resolution establishing a Commission of \n     Inquiry to determine if Israel violated human rights and \n     humanitarian law during the ongoing conflict with Gaza; and\n       Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution \n     makes no mention of investigating Hamas's indiscriminate \n     rocket attacks against Israel, nor Hamas's policy of using \n     Palestinian civilians as human shields: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) laments all loss of innocent civilian life;\n       (2) condemns the United Nations Human Rights Council's \n     resolution on July 23, 2014, which calls for yet another \n     prejudged investigation of Israel while making no mention of \n     Hamas's continued assault against Israel, and also calls for \n     an investigation into potential human rights violations by \n     Israel in the current Gaza conflict without mentioning \n     Hamas's assault against innocent civilians and its use of \n     civilian shields;\n       (3) supports Israel's right to defend itself against \n     Hamas's unrelenting and indiscriminate rocket assault into \n     Israel and Israel's right to destroy Hamas's elaborate tunnel \n     system into Israel's territory;\n       (4) condemns Hamas's terrorist actions and use of civilians \n     as human shields;\n       (5) supports United States mediation efforts for a durable \n     ceasefire agreement that immediately ends Hamas's rocket \n     assault and leads to the demilitarization of Gaza; and\n       (6) supports additional funding the Government of Israel \n     needs to replenish Iron Dome missiles and enhance Israel's \n     defensive capabilities.\n\n[[Page S5067]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/29/senate-section/article/S5067-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 527--CONGRATULATING THE MEMBERS OF PHI BETA SIGMA \nFRATERNITY, INC.

Mr. President, today I come to the floor to speak about \nthe unconscionable way in which the Drug Enforcement Administration \ntreated Daniel Chong, a San Diego college student, back in 2012. \nUnfortunately, the American people still do not know all the facts. \nThey do not know what lasting changes are being made to make sure \nsomething like this never happens again. And they do not know what is \nbeing done to hold the DEA agents involved accountable because if \npeople are not held accountable, there are not going to be any changes \nmade. Most of the time, for people to be held accountable, heads have \nto roll, and there is no evidence that is the case in this particular \ncase. But here is what we do know. It is a story that you might expect \nto hear set in some Third World country but never in the United States \nof America. So here it is.\n  Back in April 2012, Daniel Chong, a college student at the University \nof California, San Diego, was arrested by law enforcement conducting a \nsweep for drugs at a college party. He was taken into custody by the \nDEA and transported to the local DEA field office. He was questioned by \nthe agents who had arrested him, and the agents apparently concluded \nthat there was no basis to charge him with a crime. The young man may \nwell have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n  The agents told him he was going to be released. But Daniel Chong was \nnot\n\n[[Page S5071]]\n\nreleased. Instead, he was taken back to a holding cell in handcuffs, \nand he was left there for dead for 5 days--5 days without food, 5 days \nwithout water, 5 days without sunlight, 5 days without any basic \nnecessities of life, in a holding cell not much larger than a bathroom \nstall. He cried out for help. He kicked and banged on the door of the \ncell but to no avail. He became so desperate and dehydrated that he \neven drank his own urine in an effort to survive. Incredibly, the one \nthing Daniel Chong found in his cell that he tried to live on turned \nout to be some methamphetamine. That is right, he found an illegal drug \nin the DEA's own holding cell. Apparently, it was never searched before \nMr. Chong was tossed inside. It got so bad that this young man tried to \nkill himself. He tried to carve the words ``sorry Mom'' into his own \nskin. He intended it to be the last message for anyone to pass on who \nmight one day discover his lifeless body in that DEA holding cell.\n\n  After 5 days someone finally responded to Daniel Chong's call for \nhelp. He was taken immediately to the hospital. He was found to be \nsuffering from extreme dehydration, hypothermia, kidney failure, and \ncuts and bruises on his wrists. It took 4 days to nurse him back to \nhealth.\n  This all occurred in April 2012. Soon after I learned of it, I sent a \nletter to the DEA Administrator demanding to know what could have led \nto such a calamity. I asked how, in a modern age of computers and \nsurveillance cameras, it was possible that an innocent person could be \nleft for dead in a DEA holding cell. I asked about the DEA policies and \nprocedures in place to help prevent this from ever happening again. And \nI asked whether those responsible for what happened to Mr. Chong were \ngoing to be held accountable.\n  It took the DEA more than a year to respond to my questions--more \nthan a year. In June 2013 the DEA trotted out the familiar response we \nso often hear from bureaucrats when they do not want to tell you what \nreally happened. They said at that time the DEA could not comment on \nmany aspects of the matter because the Department of Justice's own \ninspector general was conducting a review. The DEA assured me that, in \ntheir words, an ``interim'' policy had been adopted to make sure no \nother innocent people would be abandoned in a prison cell and left for \ndead. But the American people would have to wait for a permanent policy \nchange and a full accounting until after the inspector general finished \nits investigation.\n  Just a month later, in July 2013, the DEA announced it would be \nhanding over $4.1 million to Daniel Chong to settle his lawsuit. Mr. \nPresident, $4.1 million of taxpayer money--almost $1 million for each \nday he spent forgotten and also ignored in that dark and drug-infested \nDEA holding cell.\n  Now, up to date, finally, just this month and more than 2 years after \nthis debacle, the Department of Justice's inspector general finally \nissued its report of the investigation. We still do not know the full \ntruth about what happened to Daniel Chong. In many ways the inspector \ngeneral's report raises more questions than it answers, and what the \nreport does tell us is quite disturbing.\n  According to the report, Daniel Chong was not just forgotten by the \nagents who arrested him; he was ignored by other DEA employees who knew \nhe was there but assumed he was somebody else's problem.\n  And the report suggests the DEA may have tried to cover up the whole \nevent.\n  According to the report, there were three DEA agents and a supervisor \ndirectly responsible for making sure this young man was not abandoned \nin that holding cell. So it is obvious these four agents failed \nmiserably in their responsibilities. But it gets even worse. According \nto the report, at least four other agents passed in and out of the \nholding cell area during the 5 days Daniel Chong was imprisoned. These \nfour agents admitted they had either seen or heard Chong in his cell, \nbut they simply assumed someone else was going to take care of him--in \nother words, he was somebody else's problem.\n  Daniel Chong was arrested on a Saturday. One of those agents saw him \nin the cell on Sunday, and one saw him there on Monday, and another two \nagents either saw him or heard him on Wednesday, but nothing compelled \nthese law enforcement officers to address his plight because they did \nnot believe anything was amiss.\n  I hope to all my colleagues that what I just told you is very \ndifficult to believe.\n  In addition, Daniel Chong's holding cell was near a workspace area \nused by dozens of DEA personnel. According to the report, anyone in \nthat workspace could have clearly heard banging and yelling from inside \nthe cell.\n  But not a single one of the 25 DEA employees interviewed by the \ninspector general who worked this area could recall hearing any unusual \nnoises during the time Daniel Chong was imprisoned there. So this is \nvery difficult to believe. It defies all common sense. It contradicts \nwhat Daniel Chong says he did by crying out for help and banging on his \nholding cell door. It contradicts what his injuries tell us he did. It \ncontradicts what anyone left in a holding cell without the basic \nnecessities of life for days would do.\n  Why did no one respond to Daniel Chong's cries for help? The report \ndoes not even attempt to answer that question.\n  These eight DEA agents were in some way responsible for this young \nman's wrongful captivity. The report does not say what happened to \nthese agents. This is where you get into accountability. Who is \nresponsible? Are heads going to roll so this behavior changes? Are \nthese agents still working for the DEA? Have they been disciplined? Are \nthey still arresting other people, tossing them behind bars and leaving \nthem for dead?\n  The problem does not stop here. According to the report, the DEA may \nhave tried to cover up this entire event. The inspector general learned \nabout what happened to Daniel Chong from an anonymous whistleblower who \ncalled one of its field offices.\n  This is another example of the value of whistleblowers, heroes who \nstand up for what is right, sometimes at great personal risk. According \nto the IG's report, the whistleblower indicated that the DEA ``was \ntrying to contain this matter locally.'' That is another way of saying, \nessentially, that a coverup could be in the works.\n  Incredibly, as it turns out the DEA office in San Diego assigned the \nvery agents who were responsible for Daniel Chong's captivity to \nprocess the holding cell area where Chong was held for days. That is \nright. The agents who left Chong behind bars for 5 days were assigned \nto investigate their own egregious mistakes--kind of like the fox \nguarding the chicken house.\n  DEA management also decided that it was going to conduct its own \ninternal management review of the incident; that is, it would conduct \nit is own interviews and investigations before DEA notified anybody \nelse. DEA management justified this decision by telling the inspector \ngeneral that it assumed the conduct ``which resulted in Chong's \ndetention did not amount to misconduct and was not criminal.'' But, of \ncourse, as the inspector general found, it should have been readily \napparent to DEA management that this was not true. Of course, DEA \nmanagement may have calculated that undertaking its own investigation \ncould head off an independent outside review; indeed, perhaps the \ninvestigation could even be contained ``locally.'' How many other DEA \nmisdeeds have been similarly contained?\n  So it is obvious what happened. It is outrageous. How it was handled \nis outrageous. We need to know more about why the inspector general was \nnot called in immediately--that is, even as DEA policy requires--rather \nthan having people who conducted the wrongdoing investigating, in a \nsense, themselves. We need to know if indeed this was a deliberate \nattempt to sweep this dereliction of duty under the rug.\n  The DEA is entrusted with a lot of responsibility and authority. We \nask the DEA to enforce our drug laws. We ask the DEA to protect our \ncommunities. The DEA has a very tough job. The Obama administration is \nnot making that job any easier because this administration is \nundermining the DEA by turning a blind eye to illegal marijuana \ntrafficking. It is trying to release convicted drug dealers from our \nprisons. It is trying to reduce the criminal penalties and minimum \nmandatory sentences for drug dealers who are still on the streets \npeddling death in our communities. So I understand\n\n[[Page S5072]]\n\nthese are very challenging times for the DEA.\n  When the DEA or any law enforcement agency neglects its \nresponsibilities and then possibly even covers up wrongdoing, then \nthose who are responsible must be held accountable. So I have to ask, \nif the employees at DEA are not held accountable, what needs to happen \nin order for action to be taken? Do we need to wait until someone dies?\n  The DEA's conduct in this case is inexcusable. After 2 years and more \nthan $4 million of taxpayer money, the DEA owes the American people \nmore answers. The American people deserve answers to the questions I \nposed in my letter to the DEA back in May of 2012, so, not getting a \nproper answer, I will be writing to the DEA again this week to pose \nadditional questions, including about the possibility of a coverup.\n  Most importantly, the American people deserve to know that those \nresponsible for the detention and the mistreatment of Daniel Chong will \nbe held accountable for this horrendous event.\n\n\n                        Constitutional Amendment\n\n  I come to the floor also to discuss a constitutional amendment the \nJudiciary Committee has just reported to the Senate. The amendment \nwould amend the Bill of Rights for the first time. Let me repeat that. \nThe amendment would amend the Bill of Rights for the first time. I \nthink that is a slippery slope. It would amend one of the most \nimportant of those rights--the right of free speech.\n  The first amendment provides that Congress shall make no laws \nabridging freedom of speech. The proposed amendment would give Congress \nand the States the power to abridge free speech. It would allow them to \nimpose reasonable limits--whatever the word ``reasonable'' might mean \nat a particular time--on contributions and expenditures. By so doing, \nthat has to be putting limits on speech, particularly speech that is \nvery valuable in this country--political speech; in other words, trying \nto influence the direction of our country through elections. It would \nallow speech by corporations that would influence the elections to be \nbanned altogether.\n  This amendment is as dangerous as anything Congress could pass. Were \nit to be adopted--I believe it will not be adopted--the damage done \ncould be reversed only if two-thirds of both Houses of Congress voted \nto repeal it through a new constitutional amendment. Then, of course, \nthree-fourths of the States ratify that new amendment.\n  I would like to start with some basic first principles. The \nDeclaration of Independence states that everyone is endowed by their \nCreator with unalienable rights that governments are created to \nprotect. Those preexisting rights include the right to liberty.\n  The Constitution was adopted to secure the blessings of liberty to \nAmericans. Americans rejected the view that the structural limits on \ngovernment power contained in the original Constitution would \nadequately protect the liberties they had fought the Revolution to \npreserve. So when the people came to the conclusion that the original \nConstitution would not protect their liberties, the people living in \nthe States at that time insisted on the adoption of this very important \nBill of Rights.\n\n  The Bill of Rights protects individual rights regardless of whether \nthe government or the majority approve of their use. The first \namendment in the Bill of Rights protects freedom of speech. That \nfreedom is basic to self-government. Other parts of the Constitution \nfoster equality or justice or representative government, but it is the \nBill of Rights--that Bill of Rights is only about individual freedom. \nFree speech creates a marketplace of ideas in which citizens can learn, \ndebate, persuade fellow citizens on the issues of the day. At its core \nit enables the citizenry to be educated, to cast votes, to elect our \nleaders.\n  Today freedom of speech is threatened as it has not been in many \ndecades. Too many people will not listen and debate and persuade. \nInstead, they want to punish, intimidate, and silence those with whom \nthey might disagree.\n  A corporate executive who opposes same-sex marriage--the same \nposition that President Obama held at the very time--is to be fired. \nUniversities that are supposed to foster academic freedom cancel \ngraduation speeches by speakers some students find offensive. \nGovernment officials order other government officials not to deviate \nfrom the party line concerning proposed legislation.\n  This resolution filed by the Judiciary Committee, S.J. Res. 19, is \ncut from the same cloth. It would amend the Constitution for the first \ntime to diminish an important right of Americans; that is, a right \ncontained in the Bill of Rights. In fact, it would cut back on the most \nimportant of these rights--core free speech about who should be elected \nto govern us.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment would enable government to \nlimit funds contributed to candidates and funds spent influencing the \nelection. That would give the government the ability to limit speech. \nThe amendment would allow the government to set the limit at low \nlevels. There could be little in the way of contributions or election \nspending. There could be restrictions on public debate on who should be \nelected. Incumbents would find that outcome--well, you guessed it--to \nbe very successful because it protects incumbents. They would know that \nno challengers could run an effective campaign against them.\n  What precedent would this amendment create? Suppose Congress passed \nlimits on what people could spend on abortions or what doctors or \nhospitals could spend to perform them? What if Congress limited the \namount of money people could spend on guns or limited how much people \ncould spend of their own money on health care?\n  Under this amendment Congress could do what the Citizens United \ndecision rightfully said it could not--make it a criminal offense for \nthe Sierra Club to run an ad urging the public to defeat a Congressman \nwho favors logging in the national forest or for the National Rifle \nAssociation to publish a book seeking public support for a challenger \nto a Senator who favors a handgun ban or for the ACLU to post on its \nWeb site a plea for voters to support a Presidential candidate because \nof his stance on free speech. That should, for everybody, be a \nfrightening prospect.\n\n  Under this amendment, Congress and the States could limit campaign \ncontributions and expenditures without even complying with the existing \nconstitutional provisions. Congress could pass a law limiting \nexpenditures by Democrats, but not by Republicans--by opponents of \nObamaCare, but not by its supporters.\n  What does the amendment mean when it says that Congress can limit \nfunds spent to influence elections? If an elected official says he or \nshe plans to run again, long before any election, Congress, under this \namendment, could criminalize criticism of that official as spending to \ninfluence the elections.\n  A Senator on the Senate floor appearing on C-SPAN, free of charge \ncould, with immunity, defame a private citizen. The Member could say \nthat the citizen was buying the elections. If the citizen spent what \nCongress has said was too much money to rebut the charge, he could go \nto jail. We would be back to the days when criticism of elected \nofficials was a criminal offense during the Alien and Sedition Acts. \nYet its supporters say that this amendment is necessary to preserve \ndemocracy.\n  The only existing right that the amendment says it will not harm is \nfreedom of the press. So Congress and the States could limit the speech \nof anyone except corporations that control the media. That would \nproduce an Orwellian world in which every speaker is equal but some \nspeakers are more equal than others.\n  Freedom in the press has never been understood to give the media \nspecial constitutional rights denied to others. Even though the \namendment by its terms would not affect freedom of the press, I was \nheartened to read that the largest newspaper in my State, the Des \nMoines Register, editorialized against this amendment amending the Bill \nof Rights. They cited testimony from our hearing, and they recognize \nthe threat that the proposed amendment poses to freedom.\n  But in light of recent Supreme Court decisions, an amendment soon may \nnot be needed at all. Four Justices right now would allow core \npolitical speech to be restricted. Were a fifth Justice with this view \nto be appointed, there would be no need to amend the Constitution to \ncut back on the freedom.\n\n[[Page S5073]]\n\n  Justice Breyer's dissent for these four Justices in the McCutcheon \ndecision does not view freedom of speech as an end in itself the same \nway that our Founding Fathers did. He thinks free political speech is \nabout advancing ``the public's interest in preserving a democratic \norder in which collective speech matters.''\n  To be sure, individual rights often advance socially desired goals, \nbut our constitutional rights do not depend on whether unelected judges \nbelieve they advance democracy as they conceive it. Our constitutional \nrights are individual, not collective, as Justice Breyer says. Never in \n225 years has any Supreme Court opinion described our rights as \ncollective. Our rights come from God and not from the government or the \npublic. At least that is what the writers of the Declaration of \nIndependence said.\n  Consider the history of the past 100 years. Freedom has flourished \nwhere rights belong to individuals that governments were bound to \nrespect. Where rights are collective and existed only at the whim of a \ngovernment that determines when they serve socially desirable purposes, \nthe results have been literally horrific: no freedom, no democracy.\n  We should not move even 1 inch in that direction that the liberal \nJustices did and that simultaneously this amendment would take us. The \nstakes could not be higher for all Americans who value their rights and \nfreedoms. Speech concerning who the people's elected representative \nshould be, speech setting the agenda for public discourse, speech \ndesigned to open and change the minds of our fellow citizens, speech \ncriticizing politicians, and speech challenging government and its \npolicies are all vital rights. This amendment puts all of them in \njeopardy upon the penalty of imprisonment. It would make America no \nlonger America.\n  Contrary to the arguments of its supporters, the amendment would not \nadvance self-government against corruption and the drowning out of \nvoices of ordinary citizens. No, just the opposite. It would harm the \nrights of ordinary citizens--individually, as well as in free \nassociations--to advance their political views and to elect candidates \nwho support their views.\n  By limiting campaign speech, it would limit the information that \nvoters receive in deciding how to vote. It would limit the amount that \npeople can spend on advancing what they consider to be the best \npolitical ideas. Its restrictions on speech apply to individuals. \nPoliticians could apply the same rules to individuals who govern \ncorporations. Perhaps individuals cannot be totally prohibited from \nspeaking, but the word ``reasonable'' is in the amendment but that word \nlimits can mean anything. Incumbents likely would set a low limit on \nhow much an individual can spend to criticize them; that is, incumbents \nprotecting their office. Then the individual would have to risk \ncriminal prosecution in deciding whether to speak, hoping that a court \nwould later find that the limit he or she exceeded was unreasonable.\n  This would create not a chilling effect on speech, but, in fact, a \nvery freezing effect.\n  This does not further democratic self-government. The amendment would \napply to some campaign speech that cannot give rise to corruption.\n  For instance, under current law, an individual could spend any amount \nof his or her own money to run for office. An individual could not \ncorrupt himself with his own money and could not be bought by others if \nhe or she did not rely on outside money, but the amendment would allow \nCongress and the States to strictly limit what even an individual could \ncontribute to or spend on his or her own campaign. That would make \nbeating the incumbent, who would benefit from the new powers to \nrestrict speech, much more difficult.\n  In practice, individuals seeking to elect candidates in the \ndemocratic process must exercise their First Amendment freedom of \nassociation to work together with others. This amendment could prohibit \nthat altogether.\n  It would permit Congress and the States to prohibit ``corporations or \nartificial entities . . . from spending money to influence elections.'' \nNow, that even means labor unions. That means nonprofit corporations \nsuch as the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. That means \npolitical parties.\n  The amendment will allow Congress to prohibit political parties from \nspending money to influence elections. If they can't spend money on \nelections, then they would be rendered as a mere social club.\n  The prohibition on political spending by for-profit corporations also \ndoes not advance democracy.\n  Were this amendment to take effect, a company that wanted to \nadvertise beer or deodorant would be given more constitutional \nprotection than a corporation of any kind that wanted to influence an \nelection.\n  The philosophy of the amendment is very elitist. It says the ordinary \ncitizen cannot be trusted to listen to political arguments and evaluate \nwhich ones are persuasive.\n  Instead, incumbent politicians interested in securing their own \nreelections are trusted to be high-minded. Surely, they would not use \nthis new power to develop rules that could silence not only their \nactual opposing candidates, but associations of ordinary citizens who \nhave the nerve to want to vote them out of office.\n  As First Amendment luminary Floyd Abrams told our committee: \n``[P]ermitting unlimited expenditures from virtually all parties leads \nto more speech from more candidates for longer time periods, and \nultimately more competitive elections.''\n  Isn't that the goal that we should seek through the political \nprocess? Having parties led to more speech from more candidates for \nlonger periods of time and ultimately more competitive elections.\n  Incumbents are unlikely to use this new power to welcome that \ncompetition.\n  In fact, the committee report indicates that State and Federal \nlegislators are not the only people who would have the ability to limit \ncampaign speech under this amendment.\n  It says that the States and the Federal Government can promulgate \nregulations to enforce the amendment. So you have unelected State and \nFederal bureaucrats, who do not answer to anyone, being empowered to \nregulate what is now the freedom of speech of individuals and entities \nthat for 230 years has been protected by the Bill of Rights. That all \nmakes a mockery of the idea that this proposed amendment would advance \ndemocracy and that argument is used by its proponents.\n  Another argument for the amendment--some voices should not drown out \nothers--also runs counter to free speech. It also is elitist. It \nassumes that voters will be manipulated into voting against their \ninterests because large sums will produce so much speech as to drown \nout others and blind them to the voters' true interests.\n  Tell that to the voters in Virginia's Seventh Congressional District. \nThat incumbent Congressman outspent his opponent 26 to 1. Newspaper \nreports state that large sums were spent on independent expenditures on \nthe incumbent's behalf, many by corporations. No independent \nexpenditures were made for their opponent, but yet his opponent won.\n  That doesn't seem to be drowning out people making their own \ndecisions in the ballot box, and it is not some undue influence that \nproponents of this amendment want you to believe that this \nconstitutional amendment can do away with undue influence. Just think, \n26 to 1, trying to convince people to vote for an incumbent \nCongressman, and he loses.\n  Let me say this. The exact amount of money that the winner of that \nprimary spent was just over $200,000 to win 55 percent of that vote.\n  Since a limit that allowed a challenger to win would presumably be \nreasonable under the amendment, Congress or the States could limit \nspending on House primaries to as little as $200,000, all by the \ncandidate with no obviously unnecessary outside spending allowed.\n  The second set of unpersuasive arguments concerns the Supreme Court \ndecision Citizens United. That case has been mischaracterized as \nactivist.\n  Again, I wish to say what Mr. Abrams testified before the committee. \nHe said that case continues a view of free speech rights by unions and \ncorporations that was expressed by President Truman and by liberal \nJustices in the 1950s.\n\n[[Page S5074]]\n\n  What the Citizens United overruled was the departure from precedent. \nAnd Citizens United did not give rise to unfettered campaign spending.\n  The Supreme Court case in 1976, in Buckley v. Valeo, ruled that \nindependent expenditures could not be limited. That decision was not \nthe work of a supposed conservative judicial activist. Wealthy \nindividuals have been able to spend unlimited amounts since then. And \ncorporations and others have been able to make unlimited donations to \n501(c)(4) corporations since then as well.\n  As Mr. Abrams wrote to the Judiciary Committee in questions for the \nrecord:\n\n       What Citizens United did do, however, is permit \n     corporations to contribute to PACs that are required to \n     disclose all donors and engage only in independent \n     expenditures.\n       If anything, Citizens United is a pro-disclosure ruling \n     which brought corporate money further into the light.\n\n  And it is this amendment, not Citizens United, that fails to respect \nprecedent. It does not simply overturn one case. As Mr. Abrams \nresponded, it overturns 12 cases, some of which date back almost 40 \nyears. As the amendment has been redrafted, it may be 11\\1/2\\ now, \ndepending upon what the word ``reasonable'' means.\n  Justice Stevens, whom the committee Democrats relied on at length in \nsupport of the amendment, voted with the majority in three of the cases \nthe amendment would overturn. Some members of the committee may not \nlike the long-established broad protections for free speech that the \nSupreme Court has reaffirmed, but that does not mean there are five \nactivists on the Supreme Court. The Court ruled unanimously in more \ncases this year than it has in 60 or 75 years, depending on whose \nfigures you use. Its unanimity was frequently demonstrated by rejecting \narguments of the Obama administration.\n  I have made clear that this amendment abridges fundamental freedoms \nthat are the birthright of Americans. The arguments made to support it \nare unconvincing. The amendment will weaken, not strengthen, democracy. \nIt will not reduce corruption, but will open the door for elected \nofficials to bend democracy's rules to benefit themselves.\n  The fact that the committee reported this amendment is a very great \ntestimony to the wisdom of our Founding Fathers in insisting on and \nadopting the Bill of Rights in the first place. As Justice Jackson \nfamously wrote:\n\n       The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw \n     certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political \n     controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and \n     officials and to establish them as legal principles to be \n     applied by the courts.\n       One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, \n     a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other \n     fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend \n     on the outcome of no elections.\n\n  We must preserve our Bill of Rights, including our rights to free \nspeech. We must not allow officials to diminish and ration any one of \nthe Bill of Rights, but especially the first one, which is so \nimportant.
