Mr. President, for many months now my Republican friends \nhave promised the impacts of the sequester's arbitrary cuts would be \nminimal--don't worry about them. When they voiced any concern at all \nabout the sequester cuts, it was over the potential impact on the U.S. \nmilitary. The impact on middle-class families and the national economy \nwouldn't be that drastic, they promised in February and in March.\n  Well, now it is April and contrary to Republican promises, Americans \nin communities from Massachusetts to Nevada, from coast to coast, in \nred States and in blue States, are beginning to feel the pinch of those \nacross-the-board cuts.\n  In the District of Columbia, tourists traveling from home to here for \nthe National Cherry Blossom Festival experienced long lines to go \nthrough airport security because of these furloughs. Coming home from \nNevada on Sunday there were mobs of people. When anyone sits down to \ntalk to any of them, they will speak about how miserable it is getting \nthrough security checks at airports all over the country.\n  In Murray, UT, a food pantry that feeds more than 1,000 people every \nmonth has closed because of these cuts. In Durham, NC, scores of \nemployees at a medical research facility will get pink slips. In \ncentral Maine fewer senior citizens will be able to participate with \nMeals on Wheels. In Bethlehem, PA, more than 100 children are going to \nbe kicked off Head Start.\n  Now, maybe my Republican friends don't feel this, but I guarantee my \ncolleagues the parents of these little children in Bethlehem, PA, feel \nit. People waiting in these airport lines feel it.\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\nWhy, at this medical research facility, should these people get pink \nslips? Are they unnecessary? Of course not. If the food pantry in Utah \ncloses, are the people still hungry? Of course they are--more of them \nthan before this cut took place.\n  In central Nebraska emergency response times have increased \nsignificantly since the local airport control tower closed. In southern \nOhio the director of the local public defender's office--a man by the \nname of Steve Nolder--fired himself. He did that rather than lay off \nother members of his staff. He figured: I am one; I can save the jobs \nof three people. And that is what he did. That is quite unbelievable, \nbut it is true. He has worked there for 18 years in the public \ndefender's office. I repeat, he gave up his job so three could keep \ntheirs.\n\n  Perhaps most concerning of all, community cancer centers around the \ncountry are facing difficult choices. For the people who have \nexperienced cancer or experienced cancer in their families, this is \nsomething that is noted. Community cancer centers around the country \nare facing a very difficult choice: send Medicare patients away or just \nclose their doors. The Washington Post reports that because of the \nsequester cuts to Medicare reimbursements, cancer centers around the \ncountry can no longer afford to administer many common drugs. For \npeople who have watched loved ones have chemotherapy--it was just a few \nmonths ago when people worried about whether they were going to be able \nto get the chemo drugs because there was a shortage. Well, now it is \nwidespread.\n  The Post reports, I repeat, because of the sequester cuts to \nMedicare, reimbursements for these cancer centers around the country \nhave to make a choice: close or change their hours, which is tough on \npatients. These clinics, where two-thirds of the cancer patients \nreceive treatments, would lose so much money so quickly they could have \nto go out of business. So providers are sending cancer patients to \novercrowded hospitals instead, not to the cancer centers. For patients \nin clinical trials for these new cancer drugs--lifesaving experiments--\nthe situation is really dire. Some in these clinical trials are going \nto have to travel across the country, to Washington, DC, Boston, or New \nYork. People can't afford that, especially when they are sick.\n  As I said last month, the effects of the so-called sequester didn't \nbreak over us like a big wave, they sneaked up on us like a rising \ntide, and that tide is here now. But the effects are devastating, even \nthough we didn't feel them immediately, and there is more pain to come. \nThat is the sad part about it.\n  In the coming months, meat inspectors, FBI officers, and Border \nPatrol agents will be furloughed. We haven't even begun to see the \nworst of the job losses. There will be 750,000 jobs lost because of \nsequester across the country.\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans wanted us to compromise before \ntheir friends and family members got pink slips or furloughed or were \ntold there is no more treatment for them even though they have cancer. \nFor some it is already too late. But we can repair that damage, \nperhaps, and we should do it immediately, to put Americans back to \nwork--no more furloughs.\n  To give our economy a foundation for growth, we must replace the \nsequester with a balanced approach to deficit reduction. A balanced \napproach is one that asks the richest among us to contribute a little \nbit more--their fair share--to deficit reduction. The rich are willing \nto do this. If we did this, we would avert cuts that hurt American \nfamilies, harm our military readiness, and hinder our economic \nrecovery.\n  I want everyone within the sound of my voice to doublecheck my \nstatistics, but I heard on the radio on the way to work the Pentagon \nhas decided that one-third of all of our aircraft simply will not be \nused because they don't have enough resources to fuel them. So that \ntraining just will not go forward. That is what I heard on the radio, \nand someone can doublecheck what I heard, but I am confident that is \nright.\n  In the House and in the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats voted \nto impose these cuts quite a long time ago, so it is going to take \nRepublicans and Democrats working together to avert them. That is what \nwe need to do. It is senseless to go on as we are done with these cuts \nthat are done with a meat cleaver, not a scalpel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/10/senate-section/article/S2512-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         The President's Budget\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in about an hour the President of the \nUnited States will release his budget--65 days after the statutory \ndeadline of February 4, the first Monday in February.\n  Since taking office, President Obama has raised taxes roughly $1.7 \ntrillion--a number that I know none of us can actually comprehend. But \nnow he wants to raise taxes once again.\n  I heard the majority leader on the floor this morning advocating for \nanother tax increase. The President's proposed budget will ask for \nanother $800 billion, and that is on top of $600 billion that was the \nsubject of the fiscal cliff negotiations at the end of last year.\n  The President's budget, which will be released in an hour but which \nwe have heard a lot about already, will never, ever actually balance. \nEvery household in America, 49 States, every municipality, county \ngovernment, everyone else in America has to live within their means but \nnot the Federal Government.\n  The President's budget, as I said, does not purport to live within \nour fiscal means, and it does not balance, but the President says this \nis a compromise. I heard his spokesman on television say this is not \nthe President's ideal budget; this is what he views as a compromise. \nBut here is the simple reality: America cannot afford this budget, and \nAmerica cannot afford the President's so-called compromise.\n  Let's review some recent history.\n  In November and December of last year, Republicans were asking the \nPresident to embrace serious entitlement reform. Everyone who has \nlooked at Medicare and Social Security realizes that both of those \nprograms are on a path to insolvency and that they will not be there \nfor future generations. And we asked for some smart reductions in \nFederal spending--what we have come to know as wasteful Washington \nspending--in exchange for more revenue. The President refused, citing \nthe need for a ``balanced'' approach. But I do not want anyone to \nconfuse that with a balanced budget; the President calls for a \n``balanced'' approach but never a balanced budget.\n  Meanwhile, his Treasury Secretary made clear that the White House was \nabsolutely prepared to go over the fiscal cliff--this was in December--\nunless Republicans agreed to raise taxes. Well, we did not have much \nchoice because after the expiration of the so-called Bush tax cuts, \nthey were going to go up by operation of law. But now, after getting \nmore than $1 trillion in new tax revenue as part of ObamaCare and after \ngetting a separate $620 billion tax increase on January 2, which I have \njust talked about, as a result of the fiscal cliff negotiations, the \nPresident is back for more. It seems as though that is his knee-jerk \nsolution to every fiscal\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\nissue: more taxes, more spending, and more debt.\n  Not only would his proposed budget raise taxes by more than $800 \nbillion, it would increase annual spending by $2 trillion by 2023 and \nincrease our national debt even more, by $8 trillion. For those keeping \nscore, our gross debt has already increased by more than $6 trillion \nsince the President was sworn into office. It is already larger than \nour entire gross domestic product--in other words, our entire economy--\nand we are already spending more than $200 billion a year just on \ninterest payments.\n  Here is the risk--one of the risks--of this huge overhang of debt: If \ninterest rates were just to go up by 1 percentage point that we had to \npay our creditors, such as China, to buy our debt, that would be $1.7 \ntrillion in additional interest we would have to pay on the debt for \neach percentage point over a 10-year period of time. So you can begin \nto see very quickly how payment of interest and payment of mandatory \nprograms would quickly crowd out everything else, including national \ndefense expenditures.\n  A serious long-term fiscal plan must include three elements: \nprogrowth tax reform, which we stand ready to do; structural Medicare \nreform, which we stand ready to do because we believe we need to \npreserve and protect Medicare for future generations; and, No. 3, a \nrealistic strategy for reducing our long-term debt burden before we \nexperience a European-style debt crisis. Unfortunately, President \nObama's budget does none of that.\n  Last year, speaking about America's national debt, President Obama's \nTreasury Secretary told the Republican chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee:\n\n       We're not coming before you to say we have a definitive \n     solution to our long-term [debt] problem. What we do know is \n     we don't like yours.\n\n  Since that time, our national debt has grown by $1.4 trillion. Now \nmore than ever, America needs a definitive solution to our debt \nproblem. Now more than ever we need a balanced budget amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution, like one that has been cosponsored by every Member \non this side of the aisle. Now more than ever, amid the longest stretch \nof high unemployment--the highest unemployment--since the Great \nDepression, we need innovative, progrowth tax reforms that encourage \ninvestment and private-sector job creation. Yet the President is still \noffering more of the same--more taxes, more spending, and more debt. To \nparaphrase a famous diplomat, it seems the President never misses an \nopportunity to miss an opportunity.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                   Congratulating the Lady Cardinals\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday I was proud to congratulate \nCoach Pitino and the Louisville men's basketball team for an impressive \nnational championship win. Today I would like to recognize Coach Walz \nand the Lady Cardinals for playing their hearts out last night. You \nknow, these women were the lowest seeded team to make it all the way to \nthe title game in decades--and that is really quite an achievement.\n  So my sincere congratulations to you, Lady Cards. Keep up the hustle \nfor next year's tournament. And to the Connecticut Huskies, \ncongratulations on your hard-fought victory last night. You earned it.\n\n\n                         The President's Budget\n\n  Mr. President, later today we will receive the President's budget. \nLike nearly every one of his budgets so far, it is late--really late. \nIn the extra 2 months he has kept the country on hold, both the House \nand the Senate have actually already passed their own budgets. So it is \nhard to see what the White House plans to accomplish. I want to believe \nthe intention is not to purposely blow up the budget process so the \nPresident can campaign against the very budget process he blew up, but \nfrom the reports we are seeing, it is getting harder and harder not to \ndraw that conclusion. After all, the document headed our way does not \nappear designed to bridge the differences between the House- and \nSenate-passed budgets. That is the role Americans would expect the \nPresident to play at this stage. But his budget simply does not \nrepresent some grand pivot from left to center; it is really just a \npivot from left to left.\n  I mean, if these reports we are seeing are correct, it is mostly the \nsame old thing that we have seen year after year after year, and that \nis really too bad because it is not as if we do not know the kinds of \nthings that need to be done to get our budget back to balance and \nAmericans back to work. We need to provide families and businesses a \nfairer and flatter Tax Code so they can save for the future and create \njobs. We do not need a budget that piles on tax increase after tax \nincrease. We need to get government out of the way so the private \nsector can actually grow again. We do not need a budget that spends \nmore money we do not have. We need a balanced budget that encourages \ngrowth and job creation. We do not need an extreme, unbalanced budget \nthat will not balance in your lifetime or mine.\n  The White House initially made some fantastic claims about the amount \nof deficit reduction supposedly contained in its budget. But when you \ncut through the spin and get to the facts, it looks as though there is \nless than $600 billion worth of reduction in there--and that is over a \ndecade--all of it coming, not surprisingly, from tax increases. In \nother words, it is not a serious plan--for the most part, just another \nleftwing wish list. Let me clarify: a wish list, actually, with an \nasterisk.\n  The President seems prepared to finally concede this time that at \nleast something needs to be done to save entitlements from their \ninevitable slide toward bankruptcy. I am glad to see him begin to come \nto grips with the math. It is well past time for reform, and it is \nsomething the President ought to want to do because he presumably cares \nabout saving entitlement programs, not just because he wants yet \nanother excuse to raise taxes.\n  As we start to think about reforming entitlement programs, we should \nthink about reform this way: Will the changes we make help modernize \nentitlements over the long term in order to eventually meet the needs \nof a rapidly aging population in a realistic way or will they just kick \nthe can down the road without actually solving the problem? Remember, \nkicking the can down the road is how we got to this point in the first \nplace. So we need to have the courage to finally make the tough \ndecisions Americans sent us here to make.\n  If the President and his allies care about Social Security and \nMedicare--and I take them at their word that they do--then they need to \nprove that commitment by proposing ambitious, forward-leaning \nstructural reforms to save them. This budget is their chance to do \nthat, and I hope they will. But if they choose to continue using these \nprograms as campaign weapons instead, then the math points to a clear \noutcome: The entitlement programs so many Americans rely upon will go \nbankrupt, and today's Washington Democrats will have to live with that \nlegacy. We cannot get to that point. But Republicans only control a \ntiny sliver of the Federal Government, so there really is not much we \ncan do until the President and his allies get serious about reform. It \nis way past time they did.\n  We do not need another reheated budget. We have had enough of those \nin the past few years. We need a serious reform-oriented budget. Sadly, \nI do not believe we will see that one today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today, finally, we are going to see the \nPresident's budget--so we are told. When we look over the history of \nthe last few decades, never has there been a budget submitted so late. \nThe budget is due in February, as we know. With the exception of the \nfirst year of a President's term, when a new President comes in, when \nwe give that new administration some time to put together its own \nbudget, this will be the latest budget submission in decades.\n  I hope the wait will have been worth it. In other words, I hope what \nthe President submits today is something serious, that helps us address \nthe central challenge of our time. I see there are some young pages on \nthe floor. I also met with lots of young people from the Ohio State \nUniversity this morning. I told them the same thing I\n\n[[Page S2514]]\n\nwill say today, which is their future is at stake.\n  It is about our economy, but it is also truly about the future. Are \nwe going to get control of the record debt and deficits and begin to \nturn our country toward the America that has been something we so much \nhave taken for granted over the past century, which is an America that \nis growing, that is prospering, where wages are going up, where we have \nthe ability to chart our own course and are a beacon of hope and \nopportunity for the rest of the world? Or, are we going to continue the \nslide we are on now, where wages have actually gone down, where \nAmerica's deficit and debt continue to grow at unacceptable levels, \nwhere we risk a financial crisis as we have seen in Southern Europe, in \ncountries such as Greece, places where they did not watch what was \nhappening in terms of their fiscal house.\n  These countries allowed their debts and deficits to grow to such a \nlarge extent that they became as large as the entire economy of those \ncountries. Guess what? As of this year, we are told our debt--our gross \ndebt in this country--is now the size of our entire economy. There are \nstudies out there that indicate that when we get to that kind of a \nlevel, there is a big impact on economic growth. We are certainly \nseeing it, are we not?\n  We are living through the weakest economic recovery since the Great \nDepression, whether it is measured in terms of our economic growth or \nwhether it is measured in terms of jobs. We just had a very \ndisappointing report last month on the jobs front showing that we only \ngained about 88,000 jobs, disappointing all the projections.\n  But significantly, one-half million people--almost 500,000 people \nleft the workforce. We now have the lowest labor participation rate--\nmeaning that as a percentage of people working or seeking work--that we \nhave had since the days of Jimmy Carter. That is over three decades. In \nsome ways, the policies of Jimmy Carter have been replicated over the \nlast few years in the sense of larger government, more taxes, more \nregulations.\n  What we are seeing is, frankly, an economy that is starting to \nresemble what happened back in the Carter days. That is unacceptable. \nWe need to provide opportunities for Americans who are on that first \nrung of the economic ladder to get to the second and to the third and \nto the fourth. Those are the folks who are being hurt the worst with \nthis economic malaise we have with this anemic economic growth, with \nthese job numbers that are so disappointing.\n  They do relate back to the budget deficit and debt. There is a study \nby a couple economists named Rogoff and Reinhart that indicate we would \nhave about 1 million more jobs this year alone if we did not have debt \nat these incredibly high levels.\n  This year we are told we can expect a deficit of $1 trillion again or \nmore. This is the fourth year in a row. Never in the history of our \ncountry have we had debts and annual deficits of $1 trillion. Yet the \nPresident's budget, it appears, will not fundamentally change the \ncourse we are on. I think from what I have heard from the media reports \nand so on, it is likely to add about $7 trillion to our debt over the \nnext 10 years, putting our debt that is already at over $16 trillion, \nagain, at a level where it is at the entire size of our economy, where \nwe have unfortunately continued economic doldrums because we cannot get \nout of this huge overhang of debts and deficits.\n  It is time to make a change. It is a moment for truth. It is an \nopportunity to address the challenge. My fear is the President's budget \nwill not be adequate to meet the challenge.\n  There are some things in the budget I think will be positive. I want \nto say that. I understand the President is likely to propose a more \naccurate measure of inflation, when we are talking about how to adjust \nfor cost of living and our programs, including the important and vital \nbut unsustainable program Social Security.\n  Social Security this year is actually in deficit, meaning that $77 \nbillion is projected to be spent for benefits in Social Security \ngreater than the amount of payroll taxes coming in. So people who say \nSocial Security is OK, it is in fine shape--a $77 billion shortfall is \nnot OK. Also, we are told the disability trust fund will be insolvent, \nbankrupt, belly up by 2016. That is just a few years from now. More \npeople have gone on disability, unfortunately, than have been added to \nthe work rolls in the last 4 years. Yet this trust fund is going \nbankrupt in just a few years.\n  Even if we include all the IOUs in the trust fund for the Old-Age and \nSurvivors Trust Fund, the fundamental trust fund for Social Security, \nthat will be insolvent by 2033. That is not that long from now. Folks \nwho are retiring today, many of whom are likely to live to that point, \nin other words, for retirees today, they are looking at the possibility \nof this trust fund going bankrupt.\n  What happens under law when that goes bankrupt? There is a 25-percent \ncut in benefits. That is the law. So with this hemorrhaging every year, \nthis year again about $77 billion with these trust funds heading toward \ninsolvency, Social Security does have to be addressed. I commend the \nPresident for saying let's use the right measure of inflation. It also \nhappens to affect the benefit side and the tax side. So it actually \nincreases taxes as well because there will not be the same adjustment \nfor the rates for indexing on the income tax side. So there is both \nrevenue gained through this proposal and also there are some savings on \nthe programmatic side because the more accurate measure of inflation is \nused.\n  This is a controversial issue among some folks. I understand that. \nAgain, I commend the President for putting it in the budget, as I am \ntold he will. But having said that, this is just one step in the right \ndirection.\n  Unfortunately, even with that proposal, Social Security will continue \nto have these enormous shortfalls. On the health care side, I am told \nthe President may make a proposal to reduce some spending in health \ncare. That is a good thing but again not adequate to the task before \nus. I am told it will be $400 billion. We can argue about where that \n$400 billion comes from. But it looks like most of it will come out of \nproviders; in other words, the people who are providing health care to \nlower their reimbursement at a time when more and more providers are \nsaying, we are not interested in providing care under Medicare and \nMedicaid because the reimbursement is already too low.\n\n  So we need to be careful how it is done. But let's assume we could \nagree on the $400 billion. What would that mean? That would mean that \ninstead of rising 110 percent over the next ten years, Federal health \ncare expenses would go up 100 percent.\n  The point is we have a challenge in front of us that requires a much \nmore aggressive approach. It requires us to be honest with the American \npeople. It requires us to tell the American people: things are not \ngoing well. We are not turning the corner because these incredible \ndebts and deficits do not enable us to do that. It is a shadow over the \neconomy. It is a wet blanket on the economy today. Unfortunately, for \nthe young people listening today, it is going to affect their futures \nin very significant ways if we do not address the problem.\n  We will see what happens with this budget proposal today. I am \nhopeful it will have more in terms of savings than has been suggested \nin the media. Those savings that are in there, I think we ought to \nsupport, as Republicans and Democrats alike, and then encourage the \nPresident to work with us on taking it to the next level, to truly \naddress this challenge.\n  On the tax side, we are told the President is likely to recommend \nadditional increases in tax. Remember, taxes were increased about $620 \nbillion already this year, just a few months ago. So the ink is barely \ndry on that huge tax increase--some would argue the largest tax \nincrease in the history of our country. Yet the President is apparently \nlikely to recommend taxes at about that level again, $600 billion or \nmore. Some say it is more like $1.5 trillion, which was in the \nDemocratic one offered on the Senate floor. But I am told maybe it is \nmore like $600 billion. But whatever it is, we have to acknowledge that \nincreasing taxes again is going to hurt the economy. There is no \nquestion about it. The question is whether it is appropriate to have a \nhigher level of taxation in our economy.\n  Let's think about that for a moment. We are told by the Congressional \nBudget Office, which is the nonpartisan\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\ngroup that analyzes all these budget proposals, that currently we have \ntaxes as a percent of our economy, which is probably how you ought to \nlook at it, at levels in 2015 which would be below our historic \naverage. So in a few short years, we are looking at taxes that they say \nare 19.1 percent of the economy. What does that mean? Typically, it is \nabout 18.3 percent. So it is higher than the average. We are already, \nunder current law, looking at higher taxes, partly because of the \nfiscal cliff agreement and the $620 billion in new taxes that were \nraised over 10 years.\n  The spending, on the other hand, which is already at levels higher \nthan the historic average--which is about 20 percent, today it is at \nabout 23 percent--is projected to go up and up and up. In fact, over \nthe next three decades, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nit goes from 20 percent to, on an average over the last 50 years, about \n39 percent.\n  Then, frankly, they stop counting because they cannot imagine \nspending at that level because we have no sense of how to get revenue \nat that level. No one is talking about taxes that would be increased \nthat high. It would be tripling the taxes, at least. So these are \nissues we need to talk about as a country. How much taxation do we want \nto have on our economy? How much spending do we want to have? I think \nwhat we ought to do is come up with a plan. Ten years from now, where \ndo we want to be? Republicans are calling for a balanced budget. We \nthink true balance means we balance the budget. We stop spending more \nthan we take in. Democrats would like to see more taxes and fewer \nspending reductions.\n  We need to come up with something that makes sense for the American \npeople. We need to acknowledge the fact that our issue is not the \nrevenue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Instead, it is the spending. That must be addressed. I \nsay to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's work together to \nget America back on track, to solve this problem which, if we do not \ndeal with it, will not allow our economy to prosper. It will not allow \nAmerica to continue to be that beacon of hope and opportunity for the \nrest of the world.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I find myself echoing the words of the \nprevious speaker, my good friend from Ohio. I could have given his \nspeech and he probably could give mine because we are both on the same \ntrack.\n  This is an important day. The President will release his budget for \n2014. While it is late, it is welcome. We now have three budgets in \nplace. The Senate has voted on a budget, the House has voted on a \nbudget, and the President will be bringing his budget before us. We now \nhave the outlines of the beginning of a discussion and a debate and \naction that must take place in the next several months.\n  We have wide differences on of how we need to get to where we need to \narrive, but at least now we have something from which to work. I urge \nmy colleagues and the President to work together to achieve what is \nnecessary to put this country on a path to fiscal health. It may be \nover a period of years. It may be measured out in terms of where we are \nnow in the economy, what needs to be applied now versus what needs to \nbe applied later.\n  I have said over and over from this platform and others, if we do not \nincorporate discipline in our spending, we will have clearly out-of-\ncontrol spending which will continue to grow year after year. This will \nalso grow the deficit and lead to more borrowing each year, putting our \ncountry in an ever-more difficult position. If we do not include \ndisciplined spending within this budget, we will not achieve what we \nneed to achieve.\n  Secondly, if we do not address our out-of-control mandatory spending, \nwe will never achieve what we wish to achieve and we will continue to \nfind ourselves in ever deeper holes. The previous speaker, Senator \nPortman of Ohio, spoke about the need to make structural reforms in \nmandatory spending programs.\n  To those who say: You can't touch this. This has been promised to the \nAmerican people and we cannot even begin to address this issue because \nthese programs should be exempt--those individuals are immune to the \nreality of the current situation which stands before us. The situation \nis these programs are going broke. Spending on these programs is \nunsustainable.\n  Those organizations--and I will not name them here, but I will at \nsome point in time; we all know who they are--are flooding seniors with \nmailings saying: Don't let them touch your Social Security. Don't let \nthem touch one dime of your Medicare. You deserve every penny.\n  They are lying to those people. They are simply telling them they \nwill be in a situation where their benefits are going to need to be \nreduced dramatically a few years down the line in order to keep the \nprograms from going insolvent.\n  If we really want to care for and look out for those who are \ndepending on Social Security and Medicare for their later years, we \nneed to stand up now, tell them the truth, and do what is necessary to \nprotect those programs.\n  Standing by and doing nothing, standing by and listening to outside \ninterest groups who are trying to scare them to death means we are \ndenying those people the future income benefits they are receiving \nunder Social Security and Medicare. Let's have the courage to stand up \nand do what is right, and do what is right for the very people who are \nbeing told we are trying to take something away from them.\n  Someone said on this budget coming forward--we don't have all the \ndetails. There is the good, the bad, and the ugly. I would prefer to \nsay there is the good, the not so good, and the why are we doing this \nin the first place. However we categorize this, first of all, let's \ngive the President some credit for taking that first small step toward \nraising the issue of mandatory spending. My understanding is the \nPresident will suggest a modification of the Consumer Price Index, \nwhich is used to provide for increases each year in these various \nprograms.\n  Once again we get this doomsday warning: You can't touch this. This \nis an index which is not correctly applied. We are still simply trying \nto bring this in line with the actual cost of living for our seniors.\n  Suggesting this gets the printing presses rolling and all of the \ninterest groups saying to send us $10 to save Social Security and \neverything else. Even this correction which the President has proposed \nis being criticized, which is beyond description in terms of how people \ntry to take advantage of our seniors and those on these programs.\n  Let's give the President credit for putting this in play. It is a \nsmall step. It is not nearly as far as we need to go. There are other \nstructural reforms we need to address. Let's at least acknowledge the \nPresident has come forward with something sustentative as a modest \nfirst step.\n  Next is the not so good, the call for new spending, new stimulus. We \nhave been through this. We have had nearly $1 trillion of stimulus, \nabout nine-tenths of which is now documented as not stimulating. It is \nturning out to be a poor, government-selected, so-called investment in \nthe future, which the market has basically said doesn't work.\n  We have solar manufacturing plants closing all over the world. We see \nwind farms being raised through subsidies. Yet they cannot connect to \nthe grid. It ignores the new discoveries in natural gas and fossil fuel \nreserves in America. The cost-to-benefit ratio is way out of balance. I \nnow hear the word ``investment,'' not ``stimulus.'' ``Investment'' is \nanother code word for ``stimulus.'' That means it is a code for we will \ndecide where this money goes.\n  The problem is the political animal puts its hands around it and the \nmoney goes to beneficiaries or supporters for political reasons. \nAnyway, government shouldn't be in this business.\n  This is the not so good of the president's budget because it includes \n$1.5 trillion of additional net Federal spending. At a time when our \nspending is out of control, how can we come forward with a budget which \nadds more than $1.5 trillion of new spending and call it investment \nwhen it is really just stimulus? We have been there and done that. It \ndoesn't work, so why are we going there again?\n  Lastly, why are some of these proposals in this budget, such as the \nnew taxes which were suggested by my colleague from Ohio? This budget \ncontains\n\n[[Page S2516]]\n\nwell over $1 trillion of new taxes on the American people, after we \nwent through this 3 months ago with one of the largest tax increases in \nhistory.\n  Has anyone ever seen an increase in the economic growth through an \nincrease in taxes? Leaving less money in people's paychecks, would this \nresult in more consumer spending which helps our economy?\n  Adding new taxes, a new tax burden to the American economy, when has \nthat ever created a job? We have staggering numbers of people who are \ndropping out of the workforce and giving up the search to find jobs. \nOur unemployment rate, our so-called official rate, is phony, \nabsolutely phony.\n  People are withdrawing from the workforce because they have given up \non ever finding a job. They are simply changing the numbers to make it \nlook as if we are making progress, but as a result we are not making \nprogress.\n  I notice the majority leader has come to the floor. I wish to \nconclude by saying we are in a historic time. We are at a crossroads in \nterms of the future of this country. This is the time when we need to \nput aside partisan interests, political interests, special interest \ngroups, and stand up to do what is right for the future.\n  What is the future? As someone famously said: The future is now. The \nfuture is now for all of those people out of work. The future is now \nfor all of those college kids graduating without a job to go to. The \nfuture is now for our senior citizens who have seen some of their \nsavings eroded through this recession we experienced. The future is now \nfor doing what is necessary to put this country on the right track to \nprosperity.\n  Let's work together. I am willing. I informed the President and my \ncolleagues that I am willing to work with them. I know we will have to \nmake some compromises.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. COATS. Let's seize this opportunity.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, it goes without saying we all do our jobs \nhere and we seek a seat in the Senate for a reason. We decided to run \nfor this high office because of issues which deeply motivated us, \nwhether it be more affordable health care, better housing, or lower \ntaxes. In a job like this we are driven to find the issues which move \nus. Then sometimes there are issues which find us.\n  When I was elected to the Senate last November, I never imagined my \nmaiden speech would be about guns or about gun violence. I could have \nnever imagined I would be standing here in the wake of 20 young \nchildren dying in Sandy Hook or the six adults who protected them. \nSometimes issues find you.\n  Here I am, pleased to have the majority leader, the majority whip, \nand so many of my colleagues on the Senate floor with me here today.\n  I wish to start with the unpleasant part. I think it is important for \nall of my colleagues to understand why we are having this debate this \nweek and next week about gun violence, why for the first time in \ndecades we were able to break the logjam to do something about the \nwaves of gun violence which have plagued this Nation. It is easy to \navert our eyes from the horror of what happened in Newtown. It is just \neasy to close our ears and pretend it didn't happen.\n  We can't ignore the reality because it is here. On a disturbingly \nregular basis it is here--in Columbine, Tucson, Aurora, and Sandy Hook. \nThe next town's name is just waiting to be added to the list if we do \nnothing. Here is what is happening.\n  Sometime in the early morning hours of December 14, a very disturbed, \nreclusive young man named Adam Lanza went into his mother's room and \nshot her dead in her sleep. A few minutes later, maybe hours later, he \ntook his mother's car and drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School. By \n9:35 he shot his way through locked doors with an AR-15 semiautomatic \nrifle, which was owned by his mother.\n  He began a methodical 10-minute rampage which left 20 children, all 6 \nand 7 years old, and six adults who cared for them, dead. In 10 \nminutes, Adam Lanza shot off 154 rounds from a gun which could shoot up \nto six bullets a second. This high-powered gun assured every single \nchild Adam Lanza shot died. Lanza shot most kids multiple times. Noah \nPozner was shot 11 times alone.\n  The State's veteran medical examiner, who had been on the job for \ndecades, said he had never seen anything such as this.\n  Several children did escape. Six kids were courageously hid in a \nclassroom closet by their teacher, Victoria Soto, who shielded her kids \nfrom the bullets and died that day. Five other kids ran out of the room \nwhen Lanza had trouble reloading. Five kids are alive today because the \nshooter needed to stop and switch ammunition magazines. Whether it is \nbecause he had trouble reloading again or because the police were \ncoming into the building at about 9:45, Lanza turned one of his weapons \non himself and the massacre ended, but not before 26 people were dead.\n  This is reality. The worst reality is if we don't do something right \nnow, it is going to happen again.\n  It is happening every day. To this country, which has become so \ncallously used to gun violence, it is raindrops, background noise. The \nreality is the one in which we are losing 30 Americans a day to gun \nviolence.\n  This chart illustrates how many people have died since December 14 \nand it is almost unreadable because it is a cast of thousands. This \nreality is just as unacceptable as what happened in Sandy Hook that \nday.\n  The question is, Are we going to do anything about it or will we just \nsit on our hands as we have for 20 years and accept the status quo with \nrespect to everyday gun violence and these increased incidences of mass \nshooting? If we are really serious about doing our jobs, we can.\n  Outside the beltway this isn't a debate; this isn't a discussion. \nEighty-seven percent of Americans think we should have universal \nbackground checks. Everybody who buys a gun should prove he or she is \nnot a criminal. Two-thirds of Americans think we should restrict these \nhigh-capacity ammunition clips. Seventy-six percent of Americans \nbelieve we should crack down on people who buy guns legally and then go \nout and sell them in the community illegally.\n  The American public knows we need to do something. Why have we been \nstuck for so long? First, it is because Members of Congress have been \nlistening to the wrong people. We should be listening to gun owners. \nThey are comprised of a lower percentage of Americans than 30 years \nago.\n  About one-third of Americans today own guns, and they are very \nimportant constituents. The problem is the NRA doesn't speak for gun \nowners like it used to. Yet we listen to that organization more than we \nshould.\n\n  Ten years ago the NRA came here and argued for universal background \nchecks in the wake of Columbine. Today they oppose those background \nchecks even though 74 percent of NRA members support universal \nbackground checks. I don't know the exact reason for that, but maybe it \nis because increasingly the NRA is financed not by its members--by \neveryday, commonsense gun owners--but by the gun industry. Tens of \nmillions of dollars come into the NRA from the gun industry--a program \nthat actually allows the NRA to make a couple bucks off of every gun \nsold in many gun stores across the country. We are not listening to gun \nowners. If we were, this wouldn't be a debate in this Chamber.\n  But secondly, and maybe most importantly, we have really botched a \nconversation in this place about rights, and rights really are at the \ncore of this debate. When I am back home in Connecticut, I hear a lot \nof people talking about the right to bear arms as an ``unalienable \nright'' or a ``God-given right,'' and of course the Constitution makes \nno such claim. The idea of an unalienable right is actually found in \nthe Declaration of Independence, and it is a phrase we know very well.\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, \n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n  But liberty isn't just about having any gun you want anytime you want \nit; liberty has to also be about the right to be free from \nindiscriminate violence. I mean, what kind of liberty did these kids \nhave in that classroom in Newtown, being trapped by an assault\n\n[[Page S2517]]\n\nweapon-yielding madman? And maybe more importantly, what kind of \nliberty does a kid just up the street from here in Washington, DC, have \nwhen he fears for his life every time he wants to walk to the corner \nstore or walk home from school? That is not the kind of life, liberty, \nand pursuit of happiness our Founding Fathers talked about.\n  But even if we do accept that part of liberty is owning and using a \ngun, then we have to ask ourselves these questions: To what degree are \nour liberties really infringed upon if we just suggest there are a \nhandful of weapons that are too dangerous to own? To what extent are \nour freedoms trampled upon by just saying you are going to need to \nreload your semiautomatic weapon after every 10 bullets rather than \nafter every 30 bullets? How gravely do we really risk tyranny when we \njust moderately restrain the size of a legally purchasable clip?\n  If liberty is really our chief concern, then preserving and \nprotecting the life of little kids has to weigh pretty favorably \nagainst marginally restraining a weapon's payload. If we can't agree on \nthat, what can we agree on?\n  If we accept this balance, then the policy prescriptions are pretty \nsimple:\n  First, guns should be available, but they should be available to \npeople of sound mind with no criminal record. We have believed that for \na long time. Since the Brady bill was passed, we have had about 2 \nmillion people who were stopped from buying guns because they were \nlegally prohibited from doing so. The Brady bill has worked. The \nproblem is that 40 percent of weapons sold in this country don't go \nthrough background checks. I hope we will have some good news by the \nend of the day on this front, but that is a pretty easily accepted \npremise--criminals shouldn't own guns.\n  Second, a small number of guns are just too dangerous for retail \nsale. We have always accepted that premise as well. We have always \ndrawn a line and said some weapons are reserved for military hands, and \nothers can be in the hands of private citizens. We know assault weapons \nkill, and we know what happened when we banned them the last time: Gun \nhomicides dropped by 37 percent, and nonlethal gun crimes dropped by an \nequal percentage.\n  Third, some ammunition too easily enables mass slaughter. What \nlegitimate reason is there for somebody to be able to walk into a movie \ntheater or a religious institution or a school with a 100-round drum of \nammunition? Why do we need that--100 rounds, never mind 30 rounds? That \ndoesn't sound too radical, does it?\n  So what does the gun lobby tell us about these ideas? What do they \nsay is wrong with this approach that is grounded in data and supported \nby people all across the country? Well, specifically we hear two things \nover and over again: First, the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun \nis to have a good guy with a gun, and second, guns don't really kill \npeople, people kill people.\n  As to the first argument, Newtown is part of the answer. Nancy Lanza \nprobably owned guns for a variety of reasons, but one of the reasons \nwas that she was divorced, she lived alone, and she wanted guns to \nprotect herself. She was alone a lot of the time. The guns Nancy Lanza \nused weren't used to fire upon intruders into her home; they killed \nher, and they killed 26 other boys and girls and parents. That is not \njust an anecdote, that is a reflection of a statistical trend. If you \nhave a gun in your house, it is four times more likely to be used in an \naccident than it is against an intruder. If you own a gun, it is much \nmore likely to be used to kill you than it is to kill someone trying to \nbreak into your home.\n  As to the second argument, as author Dennis Henigan once put it, guns \ndon't kill people; they just enable people to kill people. Guns are \nemployed in only about 4 percent of felonies, but they are used in 20 \npercent of all felonies involving bodily injury. Guns enable violence \nthat is vastly more violent.\n  How do we know this? Well, we know it by what happened at Sandy Hook \nthat day, but more importantly we know it by what happened on that very \nsame day on the entire other side of the world. On the same day that 20 \nkids died in Newtown, in Henan, China, a madman walked into a school \nand attacked 23 schoolchildren with a deadly weapon. The same day--20 \nkids in Newtown, 23 kids in China. In Newtown, all 20 kids who were \nattacked died; in China, all 23 kids who were attacked lived. Why? \nBecause in Henan, the assailant had a knife, not a gun that could spray \nsix bullets a second.\n  So forgive me if I dismiss those--like the president of the NRA--who \nchoose to ignore the effect of the laws we are debating this week and \nnext week. He said all we are talking about here is feel-good \nlegislation. Well, he is right about one thing: It would feel really \ngood if Daniel Barden got on the bus this morning to go to school. \nDaniel was an immensely compassionate little kid. He was always sitting \nnext to the kids in school who sat alone. He never left a room without \nturning the lights off. When his family would go to the grocery store, \nthey would leave the store and get halfway across the parking lot and \nturn around and Daniel wouldn't be there because he was still holding \nthe door open for people who needed a way out. And he loved s'mores.\n\n  It would feel really good if Ana Marquez Greene could still sing all \nthose songs she loved. She sang and performed everywhere she went. She \ncame from a very musical family. Her mom said that she didn't walk \nanywhere, that her preferred mode of transportation was dancing. She \nloved most to sing and dance in church. She loved it when her parents \nread to her from the Bible.\n  It would feel really good if Ben Wheeler got to enjoy this beautiful \nspring day outside today. He was a piano virtuoso. He had already done \na recital when he was 6 years old. But what he really loved was playing \noutside with his older brother Nate. They loved to play soccer \ntogether. The morning he was killed, he told his mom, as they were \nleaving for school, he wanted to be a paleontologist when he grew up. \nHe said, ``That's what Nate's going to be, and I want to do everything \nthat Nate does.''\n  So that is our task--to beat back all the naysayers who say that we \ncan't do this, that we won't change the way things are. I believe we \ncan. I believe we are good enough to drown out the voices of the status \nquo and the lobbyists and the political consultants. I think that in \nthe next couple of weeks we are good enough to change the way things \nare.\n  Finally, I want to tell you one last story to explain why I know we \nare good enough. I believe that when we see people in need, when we see \nchildren stripped of their dignity, we are too compassionate a people \nto close our eyes. I know sometimes we wonder what we really are \ninside. Are we truly good or is goodness a learned behavior? And it may \nsound strange, but after December 14, I just know the former to be \ntrue, because after enduring the shooting, as if to swallow up those 10 \nminutes of evil, millions of acts of infinite kindness rained down on \nNewtown, from the teachers who protected those kids, to the \nfirefighters who didn't leave that firehouse for days afterward, to the \nmillions of actions of humanity and gifts and phone calls that came in \nfrom the rest of the world.\n  And because of Anne Marie Murphy. Anne Marie was a special education \nteacher charged with the care of Dylan Hockley, this little boy, a \nwonderful, gentle little 6-year-old boy who was living with autism but \ndoing great at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Anne Marie loved Dylan, \nand Dylan loved Anne Marie back. There was a picture on his \nrefrigerator of Anne Marie, and almost every day he would point to Anne \nMarie with pride to his parents.\n  Nicole, his mom, who is here this week, said at Dylan's funeral that \nwhen she realized Dylan wasn't going to show up at the firehouse that \nday with all the other kids who were returning from the school, she \nhoped she would see Mrs. Murphy, but she knew she wouldn't. She knew \nAnne Marie wouldn't leave Dylan's side if he was in danger. And she \ndidn't. When the bullets started flying, she brought Dylan into her \narms. She held him tight inside that classroom. And that is just how \nthe two of them were found.\n  On Monday, Nicole flew down here to Washington with President Obama \nand me to try to make the case that things need to change for Dylan, \nfor Anne Marie, and for the thousands of other people before and after \nwho have been killed by guns.\n  As Nicole and the other parents walked up the steps of Air Force One, \none mom raised a piece of paper above\n\n[[Page S2518]]\n\nher head with a note she had scribbled on it that day, and the cameras \ncaught the moment. The note simply said ``Love Wins.'' I believe today \nmore than I ever have before that if we are truly doing our job in this \nChamber, then love has to win every single time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate and thank my \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Murphy, on his profoundly eloquent \nand powerful statement to our colleagues and join him in calling \nattention to the horrific tragedy that has brought us to this point in \nthe debate on gun violence. His very eloquent and powerful summary of \nour losses, I think, is a way to begin a potential turning point after \nNewtown has given us a call to action. Newtown is a tipping point in \nthis debate, and my colleague from Connecticut and I have spent \nliterally days and weeks with that community and have seen the courage \nand strength they have brought to this town and to our colleagues, \nbecause they have been meeting with our colleagues and they are indeed \nhere today.\n  Benjamin Andrew Wheeler, who was 6 years old--his father David is \nhere today. Ana Grace Marquez-Greene, age 6--her mother Nelba is here \ntoday. Dylan Hockley, age 6--his mother Nicole is here. Daniel Barden, \nage 7--his mother Jackie and his father Mark are here. Jesse Lewis, age \n6--his father Neil Heslin is here. Mary Sherlach, one of the six heroic \neducators killed at Sandy Hook--her husband Bill is here today.\n  We can draw inspiration not only from the memories of those children \nand great educators who were killed but from their strength and \nresilience and resolve in coming to the Halls of this building, meeting \nwith our colleagues. Indeed, at this very moment, they are with one of \nour colleagues, looking him in the eyes and saying to him: How can you \nnot approve a bill that stops illegal trafficking, strengthens school \nsafety, and imposes a requirement for criminal background checks? How \ncan you not stop assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that were \nintegral to that killing in Newtown? How can you not do something about \ngun violence that has caused more than 3,000 deaths since then? How can \nyou not allow a vote? How can you deprive the American people of a vote \non a measure that is so essential to their safety, their well-being, \nthe futures of their children, and their communities?\n\n  As the President of the United States has said so eloquently--and his \nleadership has been so important to this cause--the victims of Newtown, \nof Tucson, Aurora, Virginia Tech, they deserve a vote. The likelihood \nof a vote has been increased by the leadership of my colleagues, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Manchin, Senator Toomey, who have worked hard \ntogether to bring us to a very promising and profoundly constructive \nturning point in this process. I want to thank also our leader, Senator \nHarry Reid, for his determination and resolve.\n  On the morning of December 14, parents throughout Connecticut and \nNewtown and Sandy Hook brought their children to school. Thinking of \nthe rest of their days. When they would have play dates and snack \nbreaks, holiday parties, Christmas and Hanukkah present wrapping, paper \nangels, gingerbread, songs and poems. Those are the memories. And the \nfutures they brought with them. Just hours later, I was at Sandy Hook \nas 20 families of those children emerged from a firehouse, and I will \nnever forget the cries of pain and grief I saw on that day. I went \nthere as a public official because I felt a responsibility to be there. \nBut what I saw was through the eyes of a parent, as all America did on \nthat day. And I saw the families also of six heroic educators who \nperished trying to save their children. Those sights and sounds changed \nAmerica. We are different today than we were before Sandy Hook. This \nproblem is with us, the problem of gun violence is the same problem \nthat has existed for decades, but we are different. Because we know we \ncan and must do something about it.\n  There was evil that day at Sandy Hook, but there was also great \ngoodness. The goodness of the first responders who stopped the shooting \nthrough their bravery. When they appeared at the school, the shooter \nturned the gun on himself. They saved lives. The knowledge and courage \nand bravery of the clergy. Father Bob, Monsignor Bob, Robert Weiss, who \nthat evening conducted a vigil that we attended, when many resolved to \nlight candles instead of curse the darkness. The greatness of \nleadership demonstrated by many of our public officials, beginning with \nPat Llodra, the First Selectwoman of Newtown, the legislators who \npassed in Connecticut a measure that will provide a model for the \ncountry in attacking the problem of gun violence and the leadership of \nour Governor, Dannel Malloy. And, of course, the great goodness of the \neducators who threw themselves at bullets, cradled the young people \nseeking to save them, and heroically gave their lives. Their models of \ncourage and leadership should inspire us at this critical moment. They \nshould inspire us to think better and do better and resolve that we \nwill not let this moment pass, we will seize this opportunity and we \nwill demonstrate the kind of leadership the majority of Americans \nexpect and deserve and need at this point.\n  The majority of Americans want commonsense measures to stop gun \nviolence. The majority of Americans want a vote and they want action \nfrom this body. And we need to keep faith with them but also with the \nvictims. The victims who should not be forgotten, the Connecticut \neffect is not going away. This resolve is not dissipated. We will keep \nfaith with them.\n  Out of the tragedy, the unspeakable loss, the unimaginable horror of \nthat day and the days since then and the days to come, we resolve that \nthis country will be better and safer. And so as we begin this debate, \nas colleagues of ours at this moment announce a very promising \ncompromise that may lead us forward, provide us with a path toward \nbipartisan action--and it should be bipartisan; there is nothing \nRepublican or Democratic about law enforcement or about law enforcement \nsaving people's lives. We should resolve to go forward as one country. \nI've been working on this issue for many years. I helped to author and \nsupport Connecticut's first assault weapons ban in the early 1990s. I \nwent to court to defend it when it was challenged constitutionally, \nargued in the trial and then in the State supreme court to uphold our \nlaw. I have worked with law enforcement colleagues for three decades. \nAnd I know they support these measures. Our State and local police, our \nprosecutors around the country support a ban on illegal trafficking. \nThey support a national background check system. They support school \nsafety and they support bans on military-style weapons that are simply \ndesigned to kill and maim innocent people and they support a ban on \nhigh-capacity magazines because they know, those are the weapons of \nwar. They enable criminals to outgun them. They put their lives at \nrisk. And so I listen to my colleagues in law enforcement who tell me \nwe need to do something about gun violence. I listen to the people of \nNewtown who say: Can't we do something about the guns? And I respect \nthe rights of gun owners, the second amendment is the law of the land, \nand none of these proposals would take guns out of the hands of \nresponsible and lawful gun owners. But there are some people who should \nnot have them.\n  There are some guns that should not be in use, and there are some \nweapons of war, high-capacity magazines, that should not be sold in \nthis country. In half the mass killings, high-capacity magazines \nenabled the shooting that occurred so rapidly and so lethally. In \nNewtown, the changing of a magazine by the shooter enabled children to \nescape. In Tucson, the killing of a 9-year-old girl, Christina Taylor-\nGreen, by the 13th bullet, would not have happened if that magazine had \nbeen limited to 10 rounds because the shooter was tackled as he tried \nto change magazines. The high-capacity magazines enabled Adam Lanza to \nfire 154 bullets in 5 minutes. So these kinds of commonsense measures \nmay not prevent all these tragedies. They may not enable us to stop all \nthe 3,000 killings that have occurred since Newtown. We cannot look \nback and say with certainty that Newtown would not have occurred if \nthese measures had been in place, but the likelihood would have been \nreduced, some or\n\n[[Page S2519]]\n\nall of those children might be alive today, some of those heroic \neducators could be in their classrooms now. And the challenge here is \nto save lives, to do something to stop the carnage and killing on our \nstreets, in our neighborhoods, in communities such as Newtown, a \nquintessential New England town. If it could happen in Newtown, it \ncould happen anywhere in America.\n  As we go forward in this debate, I hope we will listen to those brave \nand resilient and resolved families who are here today. Listen to them \nwhen they say to us that we must keep faith. Listen to Nicole Hockley \nand what she said when the President of the United States visited \nConnecticut just a couple days ago. She said:\n\n       But now there is no going back for me. There is no way. If \n     you want to protect your children, if you want to avoid this \n     loss, you will not turn away either.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, let us face this reality. Let us not turn away. \nLet us resolve to go forward and keep faith with the children and the \neducators who, by their example, provide us with an enormous and \nhistoric opportunity to make America safer and better. The Nation that \nwe love, the Nation that we all believe is the greatest in the history \nof the world and will be greater still after we move forward to make it \nsafer and better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise this morning to speak in regard \nto the Keystone XL Pipeline project. Much has been made recently about \npipeline spills in Arkansas and in Texas. These spills are being used \nby opponents of the Keystone XL Pipeline project as examples or reasons \nto not approve the Keystone Pipeline. Now, no one ever wants a spill of \nany kind, but let's deal with the facts rather than misperception or \nemotion. This is an important project, and it is important that we deal \nwith the facts.\n  The Exxon spill in Arkansas involves a pipeline known as the Pegasus \npipeline. This pipeline was built in the 1940s--1947 and 1948. \nApproximately 5,000 barrels of oil were spilled. The EPA considers that \na major spill because anything above 250 barrels is considered a major \nspill. Emergency response personnel were on the ground within 30 \nminutes of the leak being detected. Approximately 640 cleanup people \nhave responded to the incident in addition to Federal, State, and local \nresponders.\n  There has been no impact to the drinking water. I will repeat that: \nThere has been no impact to the drinking water, and the oil did not \nenter any lake or waterway. Fourteen vacuum trucks and sixteen storage \ntanks are on site. The claim's hotline has been established for \nresidents affected by the spill to register claims and for anyone who \nwants information. As of today about 140 claims have been made. \nExxonMobile is paying for the cleanup and they have committed to honor \nany valid claims. So that is the Arkansas spill that much is being made \nabout by opponents of approving the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  The other one they talked about is in West Columbia, TX, and that is \na pipeline owned by Shell Oil. Let's talk about that project for just a \nminute.\n  There was approximately 950 barrels of oil spilled, and 50 barrels of \nthat oil entered the waterway. All 50 barrels have been cleaned up. Let \nme repeat that: All 50 barrels have already been cleaned up. The \ncompany is now working to clean up the remaining 900 barrels of oil \nthat is located on land.\n  This pipeline is an oil-gathering pipeline that gathers oil from the \ngulf. It is not an oil sands pipeline. The Keystone XL Pipeline, of \ncourse, would be an oil sands pipeline, and that is not what this is. \nFurthermore, Shell believes the break in this pipeline happened because \na contractor was working in this area and perforated the pipe. There \nwas not a default in the pipe or the pipe leaking. They believe the \ninjury to the pipeline was caused by a worker in that area.\n  Let's consider some basic pipeline safety facts. Pipelines are the \nsafest and most efficient way to transport oil and gas. Let's compare \naccidents at pipelines to accidents for trucks, for barges, or for \nrail. Accidents are 1,000 times more likely to occur with a truck \nhauling oil versus a pipeline. What was that number? Accidents are \n1,000 times more likely to occur when moving oil by truck than by \npipeline. An oilspill is 13 times more likely to occur when it is moved \nby a barge versus a pipeline. Oilspills are five times more likely if \nit is moved by rail than by pipeline.\n  Using a pipeline to transfer oil will result in 1,000 fewer spills \ncompared to moving it by truck, 13 times fewer spills than moving it by \nbarge, and five times fewer spills than moving it by rail. Those are \nthe safety statistics on pipelines versus alternative methods of moving \noil.\n  The Arkansas pipeline was built in the 1940s, so actually the \nincident highlights the need to build new infrastructure using the \nlatest technology. The Keystone XL Pipeline is one of the most advanced \nand most studied pipeline projects in our country's history. For \nexample, the Keystone XL Pipeline will be monitored through a \ncentralized high-tech center 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Satellite \ntechnology will send data every 5 seconds from 21,000 data points to \nthe monitoring center. If a drop in pressure is detected, any section \nof the pipeline can be isolated remotely thereby closing any of the \nhundreds of valves on the system within minutes.\n  After four environmental impact statements and 5 years of review, the \nState Department has determined that the Keystone XL Pipeline will \ncreate no significant impacts to the environment. Again, they have \ndetermined it will create no significant impacts to the environment, \nand that is why several weeks ago 62 Senators supported an amendment \nthat was sponsored by myself, Senator Baucus, and other Senators. \nAgain, 62 Senators went on record approving the Keystone XL Pipeline \nproject.\n  Furthermore, 66 Senators, two-thirds of the Senators, voted against \nan amendment that was put forward by Senator Boxer that would have \nfurther delayed the project and added more restrictions to the project. \nTwo-thirds of this body went on record opposing more delays and more \nrestrictions; 62 Senators then voted to approve the project. That is \nwhy 70 percent of Americans in a recent poll said they want the \nKeystone XL Pipeline approved.\n  This project is about more energy and more jobs for this country. \nThis pipeline project is about growing our economy and producing tax \nrevenues to help with our debt and deficit, not by raising taxes but by \ngrowing the economy and stimulating more economic activity. This \nproject is about eliminating our dependence on oil from places such as \nthe Middle East and Venezuela. That is a national security issue.\n  It is vital that when we are working on important issues, we deal \nwith the facts, and those are the facts.\n  I thank the Chair, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, for several weeks now Washington and the \nrest of the country have been debating several new gun control \nproposals. Along with a number of my colleagues, including the minority \nleader, I have declared my intention to resist an immediate vote on any \nnew restrictions that would serve primarily to limit the freedoms of \nlaw-abiding citizens rather than reduce violent crime in America.\n  Unfortunately, the current gun control proposals would do just that. \nMore than 2 weeks ago, we informed the majority leader that we will \nexercise our procedural right to require a 60-vote threshold in order \nto bring this legislation to the floor. We have taken this step under \nour Senate rules and procedures for three principal reasons.\n  First, the Senate serves an important function in our Republic by \nencouraging deliberation and making it more\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\ndifficult for a temporary majority to impose its will unilaterally. \nUnlike the House of Representatives, the Senate's rules and procedures \nallow for meaningful debate and help ensure that a bare majority of \nSenators cannot impose controversial legislation on the American people \nwithout robust debate, discussion, and broad-based and bipartisan \nconsensus.\n  Contrary to the statements made by the President and by some of my \nfriends across the aisle and even a few from within my own caucus, we \nhave no intention of preventing debate or votes. Quite the opposite. By \nobjecting to the motion to proceed, we guarantee that the Senate and \nthe American people would have at least 3 additional days to assess and \nevaluate exactly how this particular bill might affect the rights of \nlaw-abiding citizens and whether it might have any significant impact \non violent crime.\n  Already we have seen consensus against passing any new gun \nlegislation--at least not without broad bipartisan support.\n  During the recent budget debate, I offered an amendment to establish \na two-thirds vote requirement for the passage of any new gun \nlegislation. Six Democratic Senators voted with a nearly united \nRepublican caucus to support my amendment by a vote of 50 to 49.\n  That vote demonstrated that a bare majority of Senators, including at \nleast six Democrats, believe that new gun legislation should have broad \nbipartisan support in the Senate before it is passed and before it has \nthe opportunity to become law.\n  A 60-vote threshold will help ensure that new gun laws are not forced \nthrough the Senate with the narrow support of just one party.\n  Second, this debate is about a lot more than just magazine clips and \npistol grips. It is about the purpose of the second amendment and why \nour constitutionally protected right to self-defense is an essential \npart of self-government.\n  At its core, the second amendment helps ensure that individuals and \nlocal communities can serve as the first line of defense against \nthreats to our persons and our property. Any limitation on this \nfundamental right of self-defense makes us more dependent on our \ngovernment for our own protection.\n  Government cannot be everywhere at all times, so the practical effect \nof limiting our individual rights is to make us less safe. This is \ntroubling to many Americans. Any legislation that would restrict our \nbasic rights to self-defense deserves serious and open debate. Further, \nas we have seen just today, Washington sometimes prefers to negotiate \nbackroom deals made in secret far from the eyes of the American people \nrather than engaging in thorough, open, and transparent debate right on \nthe Senate floor.\n  The day before the majority leader has set the vote to proceed, the \nbill's critical components are still not there. Right before we have \nset the vote for the motion to proceed to the bill, we still do not \nknow what these critical components look like. We have no legislative \ntext to evaluate the so-called compromise language on background \nchecks. We have no sense of what amendments, if any amendments at all, \nmight be allowed to be offered.\n  So requiring a 60-vote threshold helps us solve some of those \nproblems. It helps us ensure that we have a meaningful debate rather \nthan a series of backroom deals to push controversial legislation \nthrough Congress with solely a bare majority to back it up.\n  Finally, many of the provisions we expect to see in the bill are both \nconstitutionally problematic and would serve primarily to limit the \nfreedoms of law-abiding American citizens. Some of the proposals--for \nexample, universal background checks--would allow the Federal \nGovernment to surveil law-abiding citizens who exercise their \nconstitutional rights.\n  One of the provisions we expect to see in the bill, based on what we \nsaw in the Judiciary Committee on which I sit, would allow the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States to promulgate regulations that could lead \nto a national registry system for guns, something my constituents in \nUtah are very concerned about, and understandably so.\n  You see, the Federal Government has no business monitoring where or \nhow often we go to church, what books and newspapers we read, whom we \nvote for, our health conditions, what we ate for breakfast, and the \ndetails of our private lives, including our lawful exercise of rights \nprotected by the second amendment and other provisions of the Bill of \nRights.\n  Such limitations may, of course, at times make it harder for the \ngovernment to do what it believes it needs to do. But we have to \nremember, the Constitution was not written to maximize or protect the \nconvenience of our government. The Constitution was written to protect \nindividual liberty, and thankfully so. We must not narrow the \napplication of constitutional protections in haste, nor should we allow \na bare majority to jeopardize the basic rights of the American people, \nrights protected in the first ten amendments to the Constitution.\n  The Senate and the American people are engaged in an important \ndebate. I look forward to this debate. I hope others will join me and \nmy colleagues in demanding that our discussions take place in full view \nof the American people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, at long last today we have received the \nPresident's budget. It is several weeks actually months--overdue. It \nwas supposed to have been out on February 4. It is generally used to \nsteer or guide the budget debate we have in Washington, DC. In this \ncase, it is going to be a reaction to. It is going to be an after-the-\nfact discussion of the budget, as the House and the Senate have both \npassed theirs; the Senate for the first time in 4 years and the House \nhas passed their budget every year on time. One would wish the \nPresident's budget would serve as a bridge between the House and the \nSenate. In this point of the process it is so much after the fact and \nlate in the game the President's budget has come to us.\n  Regrettably, much of the President's budget is going to rely on the \nsame formula the Senate Democratic budget did, which is to double down, \nto increase spending, significantly and substantially raise taxes, and \nadd massive amounts to the debt. It never balances.\n  The budget which was passed by the House of Representatives did \nbalance. It balanced in 10 years.\n  The budget which was passed by the Senate did not balance in 10 \nyears. It never balanced. There was a real contrast in terms of trying \nto get to a balanced budget over a period of time, knowing full well it \nwill not happen overnight. We got into a very big hole over a number of \nyears, and it will take us a while to get out.\n  Nevertheless, the House budget did balance in a 10-year window and \n10-year timeframe. The Senate Democratic budget never balances, nor \ndoes the budget we received this morning from the President.\n  For a lot of reasons this budget debate is important, not the least \nof which is it is a vision, a blueprint for the future of the country. \nThis is true for each of the respective parties in the Congress, as \nwell as the President, about where they wish to lead the country.\n  I mentioned yesterday on the Senate floor I thought the basic \ncriteria which should be used to evaluate a budget, the question which \nshould be asked is, What will this budget do to grow the economy, \ncreate jobs, and increase the take-home pay of middle-class Americans? \nWhat can we do, in other words, in terms of a budget process here and a \nbudget itself which actually takes us in a direction which would enable \nmore Americans to work and enable the economy to grow and expand again. \nThis would make these fiscal issues look much smaller by comparison.\n  Last week we received employment data statistics which were due. The \nunemployment rate as a percentage actually dropped to 6.7 percent but \nonly because another half million people quit looking for work. If we \nlook at the real unemployment rate--which is to include the people who \nactually have stopped looking for work, people who\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\nare working part-time because they can't find full-time employment--the \nactual unemployment rate is 13.8 percent. This is 21.7 million \nAmericans. This is how many people who are either out of work, quit \nlooking for work, or are looking for work part-time because they simply \ncan't find full-time employment. This is a great number of people.\n  This is a big part of our economy. A lot of folks are out of the \nworkforce today who couldn't find jobs. Many have actually just given \nup looking for jobs.\n  What this has done, because there are so many Americans who have \ngiven up looking for jobs out of frustration, is it has lowered the \nlabor participation rate to a rate we haven't seen, literally, since \n1979. The last time the labor participation rate was at the low level \nwe saw in the month of March, 63.3 percent, was 1979.\n  In fact, if we had a labor participation rate which was equal to what \nit was when the President took office in January 2009, the unemployment \nrate today would not be 7.6 percent, it would be 11 percent. This is \nhow many people have quit looking for work as a result of this slow and \nsluggish economy.\n  The President's budget, one would hope, would try to answer in an \naffirmative way the question: Does this grow the economy? Does this \ncreate jobs? Does this increase the take-home pay of working Americans?\n  Unfortunately, rather than growing the economy, the President's \nbudget, instead, grows the government. Unfortunately, this is what we \nhave seen in the budget which was passed by the Senate a couple of \nweeks ago.\n  I say this simply because I think there are two very different ideas \nabout how to solve the fiscal crisis we face. One includes expanding \nand growing government, raising taxes, and adding even more to the \ndebt. One really focuses on the issue which plagues our fiscal house in \nWashington, DC: not that we tax too little but we spend too much. It \ngoes after the spending problem we have in Washington, DC, the \naddiction to spending. We have seen this as the percentage of our \neconomy grow consistently over the last several years since this \nPresident has been in office.\n  The House budget recognized this and does balance in 10 years. It \ndoes it without increasing taxes. The House of Representatives actually \nproduced a budget which balances in 10 years and doesn't raise taxes. \nIn fact, it calls for tax reform. Many of us believe this would do \nwonders in terms of unleashing economic growth in this country, \nlowering rates, reducing rates, and broadening the base. It also takes \non what really drives Federal spending, what really contributes to the \ndebt crisis we have in this country, its runaway spending.\n\n  This is true for particular areas of the budget, the areas we call \nmandatory spending, the part of the budget which is on autopilot. It \nincludes entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid. Currently, this includes about three-fifths of all Federal \nspending. At the end of the 10-year window it will represent about 91 \npercent of all Federal spending. That is how fast those programs are \ngrowing--two to three times the rate of inflation.\n  The President's budget doesn't do anything significant or meaningful \nto address that crisis. It is flatout serious.\n  Having said that, there were some what I would call incremental steps \ntaken. I call them baby steps. The President agreed in his budget to \naddress the issue of chained CPI, which recalculates the formula under \nwhich certain government programs are calculated. It achieves a certain \nlevel of savings over time.\n  They assume some savings in Medicare, most of which, again, are by \nreducing payments to providers. We have already cut payments to \nproviders to the point many physicians and other health care providers \nthese days are saying they are not going to serve Medicare or Medicaid \npatients because we keep cutting those reimbursements.\n  This is not the way to save and protect these programs for future \ngenerations. We must restructure or reform these programs in a way \nwhich aligns those programs with the future demographics of this \ncountry. Unfortunately, the President's budget fails on that account.\n  In terms of the direction these various budgets are headed, the \nSenate's Democratic budget, because it didn't balance in 10 years, nor \ndoes the President's, both use similar assumptions about spending. If \nwe look at the new debt which is piled up by the President's budget, he \nadds $8.2 trillion to the debt over the next decade.\n  The Senate Democratic budget added $7.3 trillion to the debt over the \nnext decade. Both have net spending increases. The spending amount over \nthe 10-year period in both the President's budget proposal and the \nSenate Democratic proposal is on the order of $46.5 trillion. This is \nthe amount of money, the amount of taxpayer money, the Federal \nGovernment would spend over the next decade under the budgets proposed \nby the Senate and House Democrats.\n  The House budget, passed largely by the House Republicans, spends \nabout $5 trillion less than that over the same time period. How does it \ndo that? It does so by reducing the rate of growth of Federal spending. \nIf we limit the rate of growth in Federal spending to 3.4 percent, as \nopposed to a 4.6-percent number in the Senate Democratic budget or the \n5.2 percent-increase in mandatory spending called for in the \nPresident's budget, we may achieve significant savings over a period of \ntime.\n  This is not cutting government but simply slowing the rate of growth \nby growing government at a slower rate and moving it back into a more \nreasonable level. This would actually achieve $5 trillion in savings \nover the next decade in terms of what the Federal Government was \nspending. This is the way the House approached their budget.\n  What the Senate Democrats and the President have both done is called \nfor massive new tax increases. The only deficit reduction which will \noccur under the President's budget will be cut because of tax \nincreases. He wipes out the $1.2 trillion in spending cuts which were \nin place as a result of sequester.\n  He replaces those and achieves somewhere on the order of $600 billion \nin deficit reduction. This deficit reduction would be entirely \naccomplished by tax increases, raising taxes yet again after we put in \nplace tax increases on the fiscal cliff on January 1. The President \nreceived a huge tax increase, something he had been wanting for for \nsome time, $620 billion in new taxes. Add this to the more than $1 \ntrillion in new taxes which are in the ObamaCare bill passed a couple \nof years ago and this President, on his watch, has signed into law more \nthan $1.7 trillion in new taxes.\n  This is not a revenue problem, this is a spending problem. What we \nneed to be focused on is what do we need to do to rein in out-of-\ncontrol Federal spending. How are we going to reform and restructure \nthese programs in a way which protects and saves them, not only for \npeople who depend upon them today but for those who will need them in \nthe future. This is really the question before the House.\n  Today we receive the President's budget. It will be the latest point \nat which the President has submitted a budget. Literally, it has been \n100 years, let's put it that way. Around the early 1900s was the last \ntime the President submitted a budget to this Congress at this late \ndate. Again, having already acted in the House and Senate, I am not \nsure what meaning it has other than to perhaps give the President the \nluxury to be able to say he actually at least presented a budget. But \non most of the criteria we ought to be looking at, in terms of \nevaluating this budget, that I mentioned earlier, it is not a serious \nattempt. It doesn't do anything to rein in these out-of-control \nprograms that are growing at two to three times the rate of inflation, \nit has a massive tax increase, a $1 trillion tax increase on top of the \n$1.7 trillion in new taxes the President has already signed into law, \nand it adds $8.2 trillion to the debt over the next decade. So for that \nreason I think it fails the fundamental test of fiscal responsibility, \nbut more important perhaps even than that, it fails to answer the \nquestion I posed earlier, which was: Does the President's budget grow \nthe economy, does it create jobs, and does it increase take-home pay \nfor middle-income Americans? The answer to that is simply no.\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\n  When you are raising taxes consistently--raising taxes on the people \nwho create the jobs in our economy--it makes the economy grow at a \nslower rate, we have more sluggish growth, which is what we have seen \nnow for the past several years. When we are growing at 1\\1/2\\ to 2 \npercent as opposed to 3 to 4 percent, it makes a huge difference in \nterms of the number of people in this country who are employed, the \nnumber of jobs that are created, and, obviously, it makes a huge \ndifference in terms of the fiscal imbalance, because when the economy \nis growing at a faster rate, it means more people are working and \ninvesting and, therefore, making money and paying taxes. So tax \nrevenues go up when the economy is growing and expanding.\n  That ought to be the goal. That ought to be our goal--not only to get \nthose 21.7 million Americans who are out of work back to work but also \nto get the fiscal imbalance we face in a more manageable place. If we \nare going to get our fiscal house in order, we have to do those two \nthings: We have to restrain Federal spending and we have to put \npolicies in place that grow the economy.\n  There is a relationship between the two. It has been well documented, \nwell studied, well researched that when we have spending that is out of \ncontrol, when we have a debt as a percentage of our GDP that exceeds a \ncertain level, it harms economic growth. It reduces the amount the \neconomy grows on an annual basis and, in so doing, also reduces the \nnumber of jobs created. So this is the question that should be asked. \nAgain, when we compare or stack up the President's budget against that \nquestion--does it grow the economy, does it create jobs, does it \nincrease the take-home pay for middle-class Americans--the answer is \nsimply no.\n  I would compare again the budget that was passed by both the House \nand Senate. In the case of the Senate, a study was done that suggested \nit would cost 800,000 jobs a year, again because of the tax increases \nthat are included and the higher level of Federal spending. Simply \nraising taxes to fuel yet more Federal spending does nothing to grow \nthe private economy. What we want to see is a smaller Federal economy \nand a bigger private economy where the real good-paying jobs are \ncreated. Clearly, this budget relies heavily--doubles down on Federal \nspending, adds more to the debt, doesn't achieve balance, increases \ntaxes by $1 trillion, and takes us in absolutely the wrong direction.\n  I hope before this is all said and done, the House of Representatives \nand the Senate--both of which have passed budgets and now that we have \nthe President's budget--can somehow sit down together and figure out \nhow we get a proposal that would actually deal with out-of-control \nspending and would focus on growing the economy, creating jobs, and \nincreasing the take-home pay for middle-class Americans. That ought to \nbe the criteria we use.\n  I would hope before this is all said and done, people in this city \nwould realize we don't have a taxing problem. The problem isn't that we \ntax too little, it is that we spend too much, and that is what needs to \nbe addressed. I hope we can reconcile these budgets, but it will \nrequire the President to be engaged on a level he hasn't demonstrated \nso far. I hope he gets to what this real issue is and wants to get \nserious about reining in out-of-control government spending and we can \nmake some headway yet. I have not lost hope. There were some \nincremental gains, some baby steps the President took in this, but it \nis far short of what needs to be done to get our economy back on track \nand get government spending back under control.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am honored to stand again on the \nfloor of the Senate, as I will be doing, along with my colleague \nSenator Murphy and others who are allied in this effort to make America \nsafer and to stop the scourge of gun violence that has plagued this \ncountry for decades and has been dramatized so horrifically and \ntragically by the nightmarish, unspeakable tragedy that occurred in \nNewtown. I stand here on behalf of the families, but they are speaking \nmuch more eloquently and powerfully than I could ever do, as they go \naround to the offices of my colleagues and look them in the face and \nsay:\n  How could you not favor a ban on illegal trafficking and straw \npurchases? How could you not support strengthening school safety? How \ncould you not favor a national criminal background check?\n  As one police chief told me, a national background check makes sure \nwe do not put criminals on the honor system. Without a criminal \nbackground check, criminals are on an honor system to not buy weapons. \nWhat kind of a guarantee of safety would that be? And how could you not \nbe in favor of banning the kind of weapon that killed the children and \neducators of Newtown or the high-capacity magazine that enabled and \nfacilitated that killing to take place? 154 bullets fired in 5 minutes, \ntearing apart those beautiful, innocent children and six great \neducators who perished trying to save them.\n\n  We are on the cusp of success in this critical first step, and I am \nincreasingly hopeful--in fact, I am confident that we will have a vote \nin this body on gun safety measures. We will have a vote in the United \nStates Senate to impose sensible and commonsense measures to stop gun \nviolence. We will have a vote in the Senate in a matter of days that \nwill enable America to hold accountable its elected representatives \nhere on this floor in the Senate for measures that will stop gun \nviolence in this country that has killed 3,000 or more people since \nNewtown. The epidemic of gun violence is stoppable and we will have a \nvote in this body that makes sure all of us are held to answer to the \nAmerican people. The majority of the American people favor these \nmeasures. Ninety percent or more say they want a national criminal \nbackground check. Their voice deserves a vote, and I am confident we \nwill have it.\n  I am confident, in part, because of the bipartisan compromise that \nhas been announced today. I am going through the details, listening to \nmy colleagues in law enforcement, the mayors, and others who have been \nso responsible and resolute in working over years and decades for these \nkinds of measures. And I'm listening to the families from Newtown. And \nwe will make sure this compromise vindicates and upholds the vital law \nenforcement and safety interests these measures are designed to \nvindicate and uphold. And I am confident this compromise is a positive \nand constructive step toward our having a vote, ending unlimited debate \non this bill, achieving cloture, and stopping a filibuster, as we have \na responsibility to do.\n  And I want to focus for the moment on one aspect of these measures I \nconsider critically important. A ban on high-capacity magazines--all \nmagazines, all clips that hold more than 10 bullets--that I will be \nintroducing on behalf of Senator Lautenberg, working with Senator \nFeinstein and others, to make sure this measure has a vote, whether \nit's as an amendment or a separate bill. I wish to thank Senator \nLautenberg for his leadership on this issue. He has championed it here \nfor some time, and I will be working with him and others to make sure \nthis measure I have introduced has a vote, and my colleague Senator \nMurphy will be working with me in this effort.\n  The statistics show the terrible impact of high-capacity magazines. A \nrecent study of 62 mass shootings since 1982 shows that half involved \nhigh-capacity magazines. Statistics also show bans on high-capacity \nmagazines actually work. The 1994 ban on these devices reduced their \nuse dramatically. A study of gun violence in Virginia showed just 10 \npercent of guns recovered by police in 2004 used high-capacity \nmagazines, but after the ban was allowed to sunset, the prevalence of \nhigh-capacity magazines more than doubled. Garen Wintemute, head of the \nViolence Prevention Research Program at the University of California at \nDavis School of Medicine, said: ``I was skeptical that the ban would be \neffective, and I was wrong.'' He said the database analysis offers \n``about as clear an example as we could ask for of evidence that the \nban was working.'' And the limitation I am proposing--that I will be \nworking on with Senator Lautenberg and Senator Feinstein and Senator \nMurphy and others who have\n\n[[Page S2523]]\n\nchampioned this cause--would be even more effective. Because unlike the \n1994 law, it will prohibit imports of high-capacity magazines, not just \nproduction here but imports of these high-capacity magazines. More than \nten rounds, we need to say no.\n  We also have to implement a buyback program for the existing high-\ncapacity magazines in use and circulation today. The proposal I'm \nadvocating allows for better grant funding to be used for exactly that \npurpose. It doesn't require, doesn't mandate owners of high-capacity \nmagazines participate in a buyback program, but it gives them that \noption. And over time, this measure will reduce the number of high-\ncapacity magazines out there. The provision I am spearheading was part \nof legislation actually offered by Senator Feinstein in the Judiciary \nCommittee, approved by that committee on March 14. It's supported by a \nlong list of mayors as well as organizations representing law \nenforcement.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that list printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       This legislation has been approved by, among others, the \n     following groups:\n\n\n                            Law Enforcement\n\n       International Association of Campus Law Enforcement \n     Administrators\n       International Association of Chiefs of Police\n       Major Cities Chiefs Association\n       National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives\n       National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun \n     Violence\n       National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives\n       Police Executive Research Forum\n       Police Foundation\n       Women in Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                              Health care\n\n       American Academy of Nursing\n       American Academy of Pediatrics\n       American College of Surgeons\n       American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\n       American Medical Association\n       American Public Health Association\n       Association for Ambulatory Behavioral Healthcare\n       Doctors for America\n       National Association of School Nurses\n       National Physicians Alliance\n       Physicians for Social Responsibility\n\n\n                      Education and child welfare\n\n       American Federation of Teachers\n       Child Welfare League of America\n       Children's Defense Fund\n       National Association of Social Workers\n       National PTA\n       National Education Association\n       Save the Children\n\n\n                               Gun safety\n\n       Arizonans for Gun Safety\n       Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence\n       Coalition to Stop Gun Violence\n       Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence\n       Mayors Against Illegal Guns\n       Newtown Action Alliance\n\n\n                               Religious\n\n       African Methodist Episcopal Church\n       Alliance of Baptists\n       American Friends Service Committee\n       Catholic Charities USA\n       Catholics United\n       Faiths United To Prevent Gun Violence\n       Jewish Council for Public Affairs\n       National Council of Churches\n       National Episcopal Health Ministries\n       Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) Office of Public Witness\n       United Methodist Church\n\n\n                           Other organizatins\n\n       American Bar Association\n       Grandmothers for Peace International\n       NAACP\n       Sierra Club\n\n\n                               Localities\n\n       U.S. Conference of Mayors\n       National League of Cities.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. This provision is supported as well by educators, the \ncivil rights community, health care providers and others. It is a \nproposal that is eminently sensible, reasonable. It's a matter of \ncommon sense. A majority of Americans have consistently supported a ban \non high-capacity magazines. A poll in January of this year showed 65 \npercent of Americans, including 55 percent of gun owners, support such \na ban.\n  But the most powerful argument for a ban on high-capacity magazines \ncomes from the experience of Newtown, where the changing of magazines \nenabled children to escape. When the shooter changed magazines, it \nallowed time for the children to evade his nightmarish slaughter.\n  In Tucson, we know from CAPT Mark Kelly, husband of Gabby Giffords, \nwho testified before the Judiciary Committee, that the limitation on \nthat magazine enabled spectators and bystanders to tackle the shooter. \nIf there had been only 10 rounds in that magazine he was using, \nChristina-Taylor Green, shot by the 13th bullet, would be alive today. \nWe know high-capacity magazines enable and facilitate these mass \nkillings. They don't cause them. They don't compel them. They enable \nthem. High-capacity magazines allowed Adam Lanza to fire more than 150 \nrounds of ammunition in 5 minutes. And we know from men and women who \nhave lost loved ones that these devices are part of the attacks too \noften.\n  Bill Sherlach, the husband of Mary Sherlach, who has come to \nWashington this week to speak out against gun violence, had this to say \nabout high-capacity magazines. And his wife Mary is with us in this \npicture today.\n\n       It's just simple arithmetic. If you have to change \n     magazines 15 times instead of five times, you have three \n     times as many incidents as where something could jam, \n     something could be bobbled. You just increase the time for \n     intervention. You increase the timeframe where kids can get \n     out. And there's 11 kids out there today that are still \n     running around on the playground pretty much now at \n     lunchtime.\n\n  Another Sandy Hook family member who is with us today, Nicole \nHockley, mother of Dylan Hockley, said the following:\n\n       [W]e looked at the search warrants . . . and know that [the \n     shooter] left the smaller capacity magazines at home. That \n     was a choice that the shooter made. He knew that the larger \n     capacity magazines were more lethal.\n\n  The fact is that Adam Lanza had smaller capacity magazines that were \nfound in his home at the time a search was conducted. He left those \nbehind. He used the 30-round clips. He brought with him three 30-round \nmagazines for that AR-15 because he knew he could fire more bullets \nmore rapidly, more lethally, with a 30-round clip. David Wheeler, who \nis also here today and is the father of Benjamin Andrew Wheeler, said \nthe following:\n\n       The more bullets you can get out the end of that gun in the \n     least amount of time, that is the single area that I believe \n     affects lethality. And the size of the magazine placed in \n     that weapon is a direct contributor to that--a direct \n     contributor to that factor. There is a place for 30-round \n     magazines, in the military, on the battlefield.\n\n  The families of Sandy Hook have shown tremendous courage and \nstrength. Their resolve and resoluteness are an inspiration and a \nsource of strength to all of us who have spent time with them, who have \ncome to know them, the privilege of knowing them. They have come here \nto talk about something no one would want to talk about, and they have \ndone it so that no mother, no father, no husband, no wife ever has to \nagain experience the unspeakable and unimaginable horror and tragedy \nthat has befallen them. We owe it to them to vote on this measure. I'm \nconfident there will be a vote. I'm proud to offer this measure banning \nhigh-capacity magazines to reduce the scourge of gun violence. There is \nno turning back, as Nicole Hockley has said so eloquently. There is no \nturning back from a proposal to ban high-capacity magazines.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wish to talk about the \nissue of gun violence.\n  Our hearts are still heavy from the reminders of what happened in \nConnecticut, and I want to say that I come to this issue from a \nposition of moderation and common sense. I come to this issue having \ngrown up in the country as a hunter. I grew up on a ranch. I have had \nguns all my life. I am very familiar with guns. And to this day I still \nenjoy hunting quail and pheasant with my son. But is there anybody who \nrealistically doesn't believe we ought to have a criminal background \ncheck for the person who is purchasing a gun?\n  I am very encouraged to hear that Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey \nhave come together to find a way to close the gun show loophole. That \nis instructive.\n  In my State of Florida, years ago we amended the State constitution \nwith an overwhelming vote of the people in Florida, and then there were \nways that in practice had been found to subvert the law that was the \nwill of the people in our State--that you can't purchase a gun at a gun \nshow without having a\n\n[[Page S2524]]\n\ncriminal background check. What they do is they say: I will consider \nyou a personal friend, and therefore that is an exception to doing a \nbackground check on you. So Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey have \ncome to an agreement to find a way to close that gun show loophole, and \nthat proposal will also establish a commission to better understand the \nroot causes of how to prevent mass violence.\n  There is simply no reason we shouldn't be able to do a criminal \nbackground check, which is one way to find out the intention of \nsomebody who is buying a gun. If you bring it back to basics, it is all \nabout common sense, and it is especially so given the circumstances in \nwhich we find ourselves where people are slaughtering children.\n  Is there anybody who thinks we need ammunition clips for 60 rounds? \nThat is not common sense. When I go hunting, if it is quail, I usually \nhave two shotgun shells in the gun. If you are going to give the quail \na chance and if it is hunting instead of killing, then let's see how \ngood a marksman you are. So I can't see any reason that common sense \nwould dictate that we would have more than 10 rounds in a clip. Yet \npeople want to go out and buy clips for 60 rounds. I think that is \ntelling us something about their intention. I voted on this back in \n2004, to extend the existing law that came out of the 1990s. We said in \nthat legislation that 10 and fewer is OK. Now, is that not reasonable? \nIs that not common sense? So if we don't reasonably have a need for \nmore than 10, then that is where we ought to draw it in the law.\n\n  Then there is another element of common sense; that is, why assault \nweapons? I served, wearing the uniform of this country. The U.S. \nmilitary has assault weapons. People are going out and buying these AK-\n47s that are a derivative of the same weapon that was used by the North \nVietnamese against us in the Vietnam war. And I simply ask this \nquestion: Are these guns for hunting or are they for killing? And if \nthe legitimate answer is that they are not for hunting or for some \ncollector's purposes, then they have another purpose. Obviously, that \nis what they were designed for--as an assault-type weapon in a combat \ncircumstance.\n  So how do we approach the legitimate recognition of the second \namendment, the right to bear arms, with assault weapons? And I don't \nthink we can. It seems that among people of good will, using common \nsense and moderation, that we can come to some definitions that would \nban these types of assault weapons. Now, we are probably not going to \nhave the votes to pass it here, but we need to take the vote and we \nneed to see how everybody feels about this issue.\n  I wish to conclude by saying that those of us who are portrayed, by \ntaking this position of moderation and common sense, as if we were not \nfor the second amendment, that is false. Of course I support the second \namendment. I just gave you my history of growing up in the country with \nguns, having guns all my life and still having a number of guns in my \nhome today. I support the second amendment. I do so in light of the \ncircumstances in our society today that have changed.\n  My final comment is that in all of this it is moderation and common \nsense that are so much the solution to facing the issues that confront \nus today, and here is another example. Let's use a little common sense.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Florida for \nthose very thoughtful remarks and, of course, my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  We are here on the floor today to help lead a discussion about how \nthis Nation can finally own up to its responsibility to take on the \nscourge of gun violence that has certainly been highlighted by the \nmassacre in Sandy Hook that I spoke about earlier today in my first \nspeech before this Chamber. But it has, frankly, become too routine \nthroughout the streets of this country, with 3,000 to 4,000 people \nhaving lost their lives to gun violence since Sandy Hook happened.\n  Lost in a lot of the debate here about the particular policy \nprescriptions we are talking about, whether it be universal background \nchecks supported by 90 percent of Americans or a ban on high-capacity \nmagazines supported by two-thirds of Americans or a Federal law ending \nillegal gun trafficking supported by three-fourths of Americans, lost \namidst all of the political back-and-forth over negotiations between \nRepublicans and Democrats and the pronouncements of the NRA and of gun \ncontrol groups, lost amidst all of that debate about politics and \npolicy are the victims. The victims are the people--boys and girls, men \nand women, mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters--who die every \nsingle day in this country. I described it this morning--like \nraindrops. It is just background noise to this country now, the number \nof people who are dying every day.\n\n  I decided after having given my maiden speech this morning that I \nwould come back to this floor--not to occupy the floor or commandeer \nthe floor, but to the extent that there is time today and tomorrow and \nnext week, to spend time on this floor telling the stories of the \nvictims, telling the stories of the individual people whose lives were \ntragically cut short by guns--because it happens here more so than \nalmost every other nation in the world. More people lose their lives, \nmore people have their lives ended prematurely because of guns here \nthan almost any other corner of the world.\n  It is time that we do something about it. Yes because of the \naggregate numbers, yes because of the horror in Sandy Hook, but also \nbecause every single additional life that is cut short is a failure of \nour responsibility to do something about it. So I am going to spend \nsome time down on the Senate floor in between others giving speeches \ntoday and tomorrow and next week to talk about these victims, to just \ntell you a little bit about who they are--especially for the little \nones, maybe who they were going to be.\n  Let me start in Newtown. Let me start in Sandy Hook. We can put up \nsome pictures of just a handful of the victims from Sandy Hook and from \ncities across this country. Let me start with the little guy in the \nmiddle, Daniel Barden. I talked about him this morning.\n  Daniel was a pretty amazing little boy. His parents talked about the \nunbelievable compassion he had. I talked about it this morning. He \nnever failed to turn off a light when he left a room. He was always the \nkid in school who was sitting with the kid who did not have anybody to \nsit with. When his parents would leave a grocery store they would get \nhalfway across the grocery store parking lot, turn around, and Daniel \nwasn't with them because he was still holding the door open for other \npeople who were leaving the store. He was a pretty amazing little kid. \nHe loved to spend time with his family. He loved riding the waves at \nthe beach. You can see with that long hair he was a beach bum.\n  He played drums in a band with his brother James and sister Natalie. \nHis family is very musical, so on that morning his father, who is a \nprofessional musician--he is here this week, actually--taught him how \nto play Jingle Bells.\n  He woke up very early that morning. It was funny because he was the \nlast of the three kids to go to school. They were all in separate \nschools. His parents thought it was strange that on that morning he \nwoke up early. In fact it was the first day all year--this was December \n14, so they had been in school for months--it was the first day in the \nentire year that Daniel had awaken before his oldest sibling went to \nschool.\n  As the oldest sibling was walking down the driveway to go to school, \nDaniel ran after him to tell him that he loved him. The first time, he \nhad never done that all year. It just shows what a compassionate little \nkid Daniel was. I actually wear a bracelet for Daniel. It is a bracelet \nthat links to a Facebook page called ``What Would Daniel Do?'' It has \n16,000 ``likes.'' The point of this page is people can hear about a lot \nof these kids. The families have done a lot of amazing things to try to \nspread the word about who these kids were and what they were going to \nbe. Daniel's page is, ``What Would Daniel Do?'' It is a forum for \npeople to invest in little acts of kindness to try to live up to the \ninspiration this little 6-year-old set for his family and his \nneighborhood.\n  So people posted stories on that Web site for the last several months \nabout\n\n[[Page S2525]]\n\nthese little kind acts they performed: For example, the woman who \nbought coffee and donuts for a firehouse in her home State of New York, \nthe Missouri woman who helped restock a food pantry in Daniel's honor, \nthe Illinois woman who paid for a stranger's meal and on the back of \nthe bill wrote: ``Love, from Daniel Barden.''\n  Daniel was going to grow up to be an amazing young man. He loved \nlife. He did amazing things for people. But we did not get to know \nDaniel Barden later in life because he was gunned down that day in \nSandy Hook.\n  Let me tell the story of someone equally amazing whom we got to know \nfor 20 more years than the kids that she was charged with looking \nafter. Her name is one that you might know, and that is Victoria Soto. \nVictoria Soto was 27 years old. She was a teacher at Sandy Hook \nElementary School. That is what she wanted to do. She had wanted to be \na teacher, her mom said, since she was 3 years old. Imagine knowing \nwhat you want to do when you are 3 years old and sticking with it. A \nlot of people think they know what they want to do when they are 3, but \nthey change their minds. She did not. She worked every day from the \ntime she was 13 to get ready to be a teacher. As early as 13 she was \ncharting out her classes so she could ultimately be a teacher. Even \nwhen she got to Sandy Hook Elementary School she made time for night \nclasses at Southern Connecticut State University where she was getting \nher master's degree in special education.\n  A mentor of hers said she was the last one who would have wanted hero \nstatus, but nobody was surprised to hear what she did in that classroom \nthat day. When Adam Lanza walked into her classroom, Victoria Soto was \nthe only person he saw. Why? Because she had ushered her special \neducation teacher, Anne Marie Murphy, and several of her kids under a \ndesk. She had pushed a number of other kids into a closet to hide them. \nLanza came into the classroom, he faced her and killed her. Then he \nkilled the kids who were under the desk. The kids who hid in the \ncloset, many of them lived. Many of them survived--they were discovered \nafter the incident--because of the heroic actions of this one 27-year-\nold teacher.\n  Imagine what she could have done with the rest of her life. Students \nloved her. Parents loved her. She was made for teaching. Think of all \nof the impact. She probably had 30 more years in the classroom. She had \nhundreds if not thousands of kids she still could have touched with her \nlife--gone. Victoria Soto's genius as a teacher will no longer be able \nto be realized because of what happened that day.\n  If we do not do something about it, Victoria Soto will not be the \nlast teacher who is going to be gunned down. If we don't take some \nsteps here this will not be the last selfless educator we will mourn on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Let me tell a little about Charlotte Bacon, 6 years old. I lost count \nof the number of funerals and wakes that I went to, but I do remember \nCharlotte's funeral. She had this crazy head of curly red hair. She was \ndescribed by her family as sweet and outgoing and exuberant, someone \nwho was willing to argue for whatever she believed in, even at 6 years \nold. She loved the color pink, and she loved animals--any animal she \nmet--but she really loved her golden retriever. She wanted to become a \nveterinarian. A lot of these kids we will hear about today knew what \nthey wanted to do with their lives. These were ambitious kids, in part \nbecause they had special parents as well.\n\n  She was really looking forward to Christmas because she wanted to \nshow off this new pink dress and pink boots she had gotten. It was a \nChristmas outfit, so she was waiting until Christmas to be able to show \nit off. But on the morning of December 14--again, another theme we will \nhear is that these strange things happened that morning--that morning \nshe woke up and she wanted to wear that pink dress. She wanted to wear \nthose pink boots, and her mother let her do it. She wore that special \npink dress and those boots to school on Friday, December 14.\n  Her family has established a nonprofit called Newtown Kindness. The \norganization is comprised of community members who were trying to bring \npositivity and strength back to the Newtown community. I talked this \nmorning about the fact that for many of us who have lived through this \ntragedy--not anywhere close to the way in which the victims' families \nhave--but what we see Newtown defined by is not the 10 minutes of \nviolence and evil, but all the millions of acts of humanity that have \nspilled forth from inside the community and from outside the community \nin the days and weeks since, and this is what Newtown Kindness is \nabout. It is encouraging children to do their own acts of kindness like \nCharlotte did and submit their stories through drawings and letters to \nthe organization. Newtown Kindness is going to show some light on all \nthese little wonderful things that kids do every day in the same way \nthat Charlotte did for the kids she loved and the family members she \nloved and for the animals she loved.\n  Let me talk a little bit about another teacher, Rachel Davino. Rachel \nwas very much like Victoria, in that she knew she wanted to work with \nkids. She had a lot of interests, Rachel Davino did. She was born in \nWaterbury, received her undergraduate degree from Hartford, she got her \nmasters from Post University. She loved animals. That is probably why \nshe connected with a lot of these kids. She loved baking and \nphotography and karate. She drew lots of things, loved to draw \nanimals--dogs, frogs, anything with scales or feathers or fur she loved \nto draw. But her passion was working as a behavioral therapist, working \nwith kids with autism. There were a number of kids in these classrooms \nwho had autism. They were doing great because of the work of people \nlike Rachel and Anne Marie Murphy, who reached out to work with these \nkids.\n  Rachel was exceptional because she integrated these kids into her \ndaily life. She brought the kids to her home. She involved the kids in \nher family. She treated the kids like family and they matured. They did \nbetter under her care.\n  She probably didn't know it when she died, but her best friend and \nher boyfriend, Tony, was about to propose to her. In fact he had \nalready gone to her parents to ask permission to ask to marry her. He \nwas going to do it on Christmas Eve, just 10 days after the incident. \nHe didn't get to ask for Rachel's hand in marriage. Instead, the \nwedding ring he had planned to present to her was placed on her finger \nbefore she was buried.\n  Rachel was an amazing teacher, an amazing person who invested herself \nin these kids, day in and day out. It would have been great to know \nwhat Rachel Davino would have become as she matured as an educator.\n  This is just a sampling of the stories from 1 day in Newtown, CT. \nFewer kids and adults died in Newtown that day than die every day \nacross this country. We think how exceptional it was and how awful and \nhow horrific that we lost 20 kids and 6 adults--and, by the way, 2 \nothers in Adam Lanza and his mother--yet that number is less than the \naverage number of people who are killed every day by gun violence \nacross this country. So I want to talk about them too. I want to talk \nabout just over the last couple of weeks and months what we have \nwitnessed across this country.\n  I want to talk about Hadiya Pendleton in Chicago. We have heard a lot \nabout her because she was here for the Presidential inauguration. She \nwas performing with her school's majorette team in the President's \ninauguration festivities. She loved performing. She was an honor \nstudent at King College Prep High School in Chicago. She was 15 years \nold.\n  She is remembered by her friends as somebody who was always raising \nher hand in class. She had all the right answers in that chemistry \nclass. She wore bright lip gloss that made her stand out. She loved to \ndance. She danced on the Praise Dance Ministry in her church, and she \nwas a member of her cheerleading team as well. She liked Chinese food, \nshe loved Fig Newtons. She was thinking about going to college, \nthinking about either journalism or pharmacology, two pretty different \nthings. Either way, she wanted to go to Harvard. She knew where she \nwanted to go.\n  She was 15 years old. She was shot and killed while standing with her \nfriends in a park in Chicago after she took her final exams, just days \nafter she came back from Washington, DC,\n\n[[Page S2526]]\n\nprobably one of the most amazing experiences in her life.\n  I watched some of that parade, and I always think to myself whether I \nsaw her performing with her majorette team. She was 15 years old. She \nwas going to go to Harvard. She was going to become a journalist or a \ngreat dancer. All the things we missed just because she was standing in \nthe way of a bullet at a park with her friends after she took her final \nexams.\n  I think about Lavanial Williams, who in January of this year, was \nvisiting with his mother and two sisters in Marin City, CA, to \ncelebrate his 17th birthday. He was checking in on his sister April to \nmake sure she was fine because there was some suspicious activity going \non in the housing complex that day. He went downstairs to check out the \ncommotion, and moments later he was shot dead just because he walked \ndown some stairs to check out some commotion.\n\n  The deputies who arrived on the scene found a group of people trying \nto revive the teenager by CPR, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. \nHe had been hit by several bullets. He was there visiting his mother \nand two sisters to celebrate his 17th birthday. Lavanial Williams died \non January 11, 2013.\n  If we talk about the connection to the background checks piece of \nthis discussion, we could talk about Annemarie Bautch. She returned \nhome after dropping off her kids at school on April 8--just a week or \nso ago--in Milwaukee. Her live-in boyfriend pulled in behind her in a \ntaxicab he drove for hire. He walked to her van's window and shot her \nin the head. He then took his gun and turned it on himself.\n  He was on probation for recent domestic violence incidences involving \nhis daughter. He had beaten up his daughter. He had firearms arrests \ngoing back 20 years. He was a convicted felon, and he was prohibited \nfrom carrying weapons. I don't have in front of me why he had the \nweapon that day or how he got it, but he was not supposed to have it. \nHe had a long rap sheet when it came to convictions regarding firearms.\n  He was ordered to undergo anger management training after his most \nrecent conviction, but it is unclear as to whether that ever happened. \nHe is not here to answer those questions and neither is his girlfriend \nAnnmarie who died that day at the age of 39 after dropping her kids off \nat school.\n  Earlier this week in Akron, OH, there was a 28-year-old man who was \nfatally shot while taking garbage to a trash bin in the parking lot of \na McDonald's restaurant at which he worked. He was taking garbage to a \ntrash dump and he was shot and died. His name has not been released, \nbut he had been working at that McDonald's for 10 years. His coworkers \nsaid: ``He was the kind of person who would give you his last dollar.'' \nHe would give his coworkers gifts on holidays--Christmas and \nThanksgiving. He worked in McDonald's. He could not have had a lot of \nmoney to go out and buy gifts for coworkers. He worked at that place \nfor a decade. Because of his generous nature with whatever money he \nhad, that he scraped together, he made sure people knew he loved them.\n  He was 28 years old when he died earlier this week in Akron, OH.\n  This stuff is happening every day. I mean, I will keep on going \nthrough them, but this is happening every day throughout this country. \nPeople are dying on our streets by casual gun violence while bringing \ngarbage to a dumpster outside a McDonald's, walking down the stairs to \ncheck out some commotion at a sister's housing complex, and pulling \ninto a driveway after dropping their kids off at school. These were not \npeople who were going out and looking for trouble. These were people \nwho were just doing their regular everyday business.\n  President Obama came to Connecticut on Monday, and he told the story \nof a mother who was so frustrated at the phrase regarding her \ndaughter's death due to gun violence that her daughter was ``in the \nwrong place at the wrong time.'' She just happened to be in the way of \na stray bullet. Her mother's point was, no; she was in the right place \nat the right time. She was walking to school.\n  This guy was bringing garbage to the dumpster. Anne Marie was coming \nhome after dropping off her kids. Lavanial was just looking out for his \nsister. They were not in the wrong place at the wrong time, they were \ndoing what they were supposed to be doing. Yet they were gunned down. \nWe have no answer? After 20 years of this, we are not able to step up \nand do something about it? It is like raindrops. It has just become \nroutine.\n  Let me go back to Newtown and talk more about these kids. Olivia Rose \nEngel was a bright-eyed, brunette, 6-year-old girl. She loved school. \nShe particularly loved reading and math, which is good because a lot of \nwhat first graders do is reading and math. If you love reading and \nmath, you are probably in good shape.\n  Her favorite stuffed animal was a lamb, and her favorite colors \nwere--a theme we will hear often--pink and purple. She was set to play \nan angel in her church's nativity play on the night of the tragedy. She \nlaughed a lot, and her parents said she just lit up a room when she \nwalked in.\n  Olivia played soccer and tennis, and she took art classes. She loved \nswimming and ballet classes, and she took hip-hop dance lessons. She \nwas also involved in her Daisy Girl Scouts. Every night when they \ngathered for dinner, her family would have Olivia say grace.\n  She was a great big sister. Olivia really loved her little 3-year-old \nbrother Brayden. She was killed that day in Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool.\n  Josephine Gay celebrated her seventh birthday just 3 days before the \ntragedy. Joey is what she was called by her family. She was a kid with \nan indomitable spirit. She was autistic, as were a handful of these \nkids, but she was still social. She was very affectionate. She was \ngetting very good care from some of these paraprofessionals who were \nthere.\n  She grew up--actually not too far from here--in Maryland with a house \nfull of Ravens fans. Josephine fell in love with the color purple. I \ndon't know if she bought into the Ravens as a team yet, but she loved \nthe color purple. She had a great sense of humor; she smiled all the \ntime.\n  She loved hugs even though she participated in rigorous therapy for \nher disability. She had treatment on a daily basis. She did it \nwithout complaining. She loved her Barbie dolls, her iPad, and her \ncomputer. She loved to sing and swim and be anywhere her sisters were. \nJoey Gay was killed that day at age 7 in Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n\n  I want to talk about Avielle Richman. I have gotten to know Avielle's \nparents pretty well over the course of the last few months. Frankly, I \nhave gotten to know a lot of these families over the last few months.\n  Avielle's parents have done something remarkable, which I will \nmention, but first I will talk about Avielle.\n  Guess what color Avielle loved. She loved the color pink. She loved \nto wear her pink cowboy boots and adored riding her pony Betty. She \nturned 6 years old just about 2 months before the tragedy.\n  She moved from Connecticut a few years ago from San Diego. She loved \nSan Diego. She was barefoot all the time. She would run on the beaches \nof San Diego until the Sun went down. Her relatives used to joke about \nhow hard it was to get shoes on Avielle even after moving to \nConnecticut. When she lived in San Diego, she never used to wear shoes, \nso she certainly was not going to wear them even in a colder climate \nlike Connecticut.\n  She had curly brown hair and an infectious smile. Her parents kept a \nblog about her. They called her their little hummingbird. She loved \nhorseback riding, swimming, ice skating, and superhero adventures. She \nloved pretending to be a superhero. She loved the movie ``Brave,'' and \nAvielle tried out archery, which is a brave thing for her parents to do \nas well. She tried out archery because of her love for the movie.\n  Before her life was taken that December, Avielle was obsessed with an \nEasy Bake Oven she was hoping to get for Christmas.\n  Her parents are scientists, and in the wake of Avielle's death, they \nstarted a nonprofit to raise money to try to get to the root cause of \nthe illness that caused someone like Adam Lanza to pick up a gun. That \nis an amazing thing for the Richmans to do. I talked about a number of \nefforts that have been taken, whether it is a Facebook\n\n[[Page S2527]]\n\npage for Daniel Barden, a Web site to try to encourage kids to engage \nin acts of kindness, or what Avielle's parents did. This is an amazing \nthing for them to do. While they are grieving, they are trying to find \na silver lining in all of this.\n  The Richmans' hope is that they can use the memory of their precious \n6-year-old daughter to go out and raise money to try to research the \ncauses of the illness that led to this tragedy. It is an illness. We \ntalk about it in terms of evil, and I have certainly used that term. It \nis really illness masquerading as evil.\n  The Richmans are going to do their part to raise money to try to do a \nbetter job to figure out what is going on in the brain to cause someone \nto leave their parents' home, drive to an elementary school, and start \nshooting, or walk up to a McDonald's employee as they are delivering \ngarbage to the dumpster and shoot them. It is a different kind of \nillness, I suppose, but it deserves examination nonetheless.\n  The Richmans are heroic in the fact that they have decided to reach \nout and try to make this discovery.\n  Another teacher to talk about is Lauren Rousseau. She wanted to be a \nteacher so badly. She was 30 years old. Up to the point she was hired \nas a full-time substitute teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary, she spent 6 \nyears working at part-time jobs just to make ends meet so she could \nsubstitute teach during the day. During that 6-year period of time, she \nwas looking for a full-time job, and she finally found it. That October \nshe had been hired in Newtown to be a full-time substitute teacher. It \nis just what Lauren wanted to do, and she was really good at it. She \nwas literally on the verge of realizing that 6-year dream when her life \nwas taken.\n  She was very bubbly and outgoing. She spent the morning of December \n14 looking forward to a movie she was going to see that night with her \nfriends and her boyfriend, ``The Hobbit.'' She was a huge fan of \nTolkien, so it was a big deal to see ``The Hobbit'' that evening, and \nthat is what she was talking about that morning.\n  She loved animals too. She was passionate about doing something about \nchild poverty. Part of the reason she went into education was she \nbelieved she needed to live her life in a way that was going to reach \nout and eradicate the scourge of child poverty.\n  Purple was her favorite color, and so everybody at her funeral wore \nthe color purple.\n  She was a huge UConn basketball fan. In particular, she was a big fan \nof the UConn women's basketball team. So if Lauren is looking down from \nup above, she is very happy because her UConn women are national \nchampions again. She would have been watching that game last night, and \nhopefully she was.\n  Lauren Rousseau was right there. Her dream was within her grasp, what \nshe had worked for all of her life, and in an instant it was gone.\n  Teachers, little girls, and little boys who could have been great \npeople, great educators--they could have been dancers and singers. \nDaniel Barden said he wanted to be a paleontologist just like his older \nbrother. He could have done great things, but he is gone.\n  This isn't the first massacre we have seen. Daniel Barden and Ana \nMarquez-Green and Dylan Hockley and Benjamin Wheeler--these are all \nkids who were killed in Newtown, CT, but unfortunately Newtown is just \nthe latest in a line of mass shootings. Forty percent of the mass \nshootings that have happened in this Nation's history have happened \nsince the assault weapons ban expired. Forty percent of all of the mass \nshootings in this Nation's history have happened in the last 8 years--8 \nyears--since the assault weapons ban expired. I am not an expert in \ncause and correlation, but that cannot be a coincidence. It can't be a \ncoincidence because we also know that during those 10 years of the \nassault weapons ban, along with a ban on high-capacity magazines that \nwas in effect, we saw a 37-percent decrease in gun violence. We saw a \ntwo-thirds decrease in the crimes committed with assault weapons. Those \nare real numbers, real reductions in overall gun violence and in gun \nviolence perpetrated with these dangerous assault weapons. But the \nminute that ban was lifted, a dramatic increase in these mass shootings \noccurred.\n  Newtown was the second worst school shooting. It is seared in our \nmemories in a different way because these were precious, young, little \nkids, and we can't help but grieve in a fundamentally different way for \n6- and 7-year-olds. But Virginia Tech was worse. Still to this day, \nVirginia Tech saw the highest number of people gunned down. So I wish \nto talk about a few of those people.\n  Ross Alameddine was a Virginia Tech sophomore. He loved computer \ngames, and he actually played a lot of them competitively. He was very \nmuch into home computer repair, and it was something he wanted to do \nwith his life. His customers always loved him because they would bring \ntheir computers to him and he was one of the few people who knew how to \nfix them.\n  He did a lot of stuff outside of his fascination with computers. He \nloved rollerblading, whether it was in between classes or going out for \nlong rollerblading expeditions on nice days. He loved movies, and he \nloved music. He played the piano, and he actually sang at a local \ncoffeehouse. He had a fondness for language. He had strong opinions \ntoo. He was part of the debate club at Austin Prep, where he went to \nschool. He talked in every single one of these classes. We know these \nkids who always have something to say, and Ross was definitely one of \nthem.\n  He loved life. He sought to make other people laugh. He used his \nmusic to do that. One of his classmates, Liz Hardwick, remembered his \nmany qualities. She said that Ross's wit, humor, and insightfulness \nmade him so much fun to be around, but his caring for others was also \nalways present. Ross was one of the 32 victims killed during the \nVirginia Tech massacre on April 16, 2007.\n  Christopher James Bishop--``Jamie'' Bishop--was a German teacher who \nwas shot at the age of 35. He was a dedicated husband and son. He was a \ngentle colleague. He was a really generous friend.\n  He had a long ponytail that he wore. That was kind of Jamie's \nsignature. But he didn't keep the ponytail for long because once he \ngrew it, he would regularly cut his hair and donate it to Locks of \nLove. He was doing it for style reasons, I am sure, but he saw his \nponytail as a means to donate to other people who needed some help.\n  He was another techno guru. He knew a lot about complicated gadgets, \nand one of those was cameras. He was a great technician with a camera, \nbut he was also a very avid photographer. Jamie leaves behind a lot of \nwonderful art that captured the intensity and the beauty that \nsurrounded him in Blacksburg.\n  He hailed from a very small town--Pine Mountain, GA--and he was a big \nfan of the Atlanta Braves, so he would probably be pretty excited about \nthe start the Atlanta Braves have had this year.\n  He was a foreign language teacher. He was a tough teacher--``Herr \nBishop'' is what they called him--but he really believed that \nunderstanding language was a way for people to engage in the world. It \nwas a joy, but it was really fundamental to understanding humanity. If \npeople understand languages, they understand different cultures and \nthey understand something more about what it means to be a human being \nin this world. Jamie believed in what he did not just because he wanted \nto teach kids German but because he wanted to teach kids about the \nworld. He died at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007, at the age of 35.\n  Brian Bluhm was a graduate student. He was a TA at Virginia Tech. He \ncared about water resources--something we actually are going to be \ntalking about here pretty soon--something not a lot of graduate \nstudents think about. He cared deeply about a just distribution of \nwater assets across the country, and that is what he was working on at \nVirginia Tech.\n  But his real love was for God. He was dedicated to building a \nrelationship through his church with his God.\n  He was one of the friendliest guys one could ever meet, his friends \nsaid. He had a smile for everybody.\n  He was a big sports fan. Brian grew up with a passion for sports, \nparticularly baseball, and his favorite team was the Detroit Tigers. He \nwas one of these guys who follow everything about their favorite team. \nHe watched all the games, but when the Tigers weren't playing in the \nwinter and in\n\n[[Page S2528]]\n\nthe early spring, he would be analyzing every statistic from the past \nseason and getting ready for the next season. He also loved Virginia \nTech sports, especially football and basketball. He was one of those \npeople others would see on TV who came to all of the games with the \ncolors on their chests to show their support.\n  His family says he will be remembered for his love of God, family, \nfriends, the Detroit Tigers, and Virginia Tech. He was lost that day, \nApril 16, 2007, as well.\n  Ryan Christopher Clark was known to his friends as ``Stack.'' He \nmaintained a 4.0 GPA when he was a student at Virginia Tech, and he was \na kid who had a mastery of science. He had a triple major. I didn't \neven know one could have a triple major, but Stack had a triple major \nin psychology, biology, and English. Can my colleagues imagine what \nStack was going to be able to do with his life? Can we imagine what \nhe would have been able to contribute in his life with a triple major?\n\n  He was a leader on campus. He played baritone in the Marching \nVirginians university band, and he was a resident adviser. So he was \ndoing great things on campus and passing along a lot of knowledge to \nkids underneath him.\n  His friends said: He was a wonderful part of our baritone section. He \nwas fun. He was loving. He was a delightful person to be around. He \ncared so much for other people. He would befriend anyone. He was a \nlight and he was a joy.\n  Ryan Christopher Clark was going to do great things with his life. He \nwas a student leader. At his young age, he had already shown a \ncompassion for his fellow students by being a resident adviser. He had \nshown a talent for music by going out and performing in the band, and \nhe was a triple major who was probably going to do something great in \nthe scientific field in this country. But Stack didn't get to live that \ndream because, along with so many others, he was gunned down that day \nat Virginia Tech.\n  Virginia Tech, Newtown, Aurora, Tucson--these are just the mass \nshootings. I will keep on going, but these victims just don't end. \nStack on top of that 40, 50, 60 people every day being killed on our \nstreets. It is important to talk about these victims. That is why I \nwanted to come to the floor today to do this, because if we don't do \nsomething in the next 2 weeks, these lists are going to grow.\n  The illegal guns used on the streets of Chicago and Bridgeport and \nNew Haven and Washington, DC, and New York weren't always illegal guns. \nThey were legal guns before they became illegal guns. Somewhere along \nthe line, their status transferred. The question is, What can we do to \nstop that transfer from happening?\n  I believe in the second amendment. I believe in the protection that \nit affords people to own a gun, to be able to hunt or to shoot for \nsport or to protect themselves. But I want to make sure guns stay in \nthe ``legal'' category and don't leach into the ``illegal'' category. \nThat is why 90 percent of Americans think we should have a law in this \nNation that provides for universal, mandatory background checks for \neverybody who buys a gun. That is a really simple thing to do.\n  This is just a sampling of the lives that could have been protected. \nThe gun used in Newtown went through a background check, but so many of \nthe guns used to kill boys and girls and young adults and men and women \nin our cities don't go through background checks. We think about 40 \npercent of guns sold across this country don't go through background \nchecks.\n  One of the tragedies in this long line is directly relevant to this \nbill. At Columbine High School, the gun used was bought outside of the \nbackground check system, and the friend of the shooter's who bought the \ngun said after the incident that the reason she bought it with the \nmethod she did was because had she gone to a gun store, it wouldn't \nhave passed the background check. That is the gun show loophole. What \nhas it been--a decade-plus since Columbine, and we still haven't closed \nthe gun show loophole? We still haven't made the collective decision \nthat we should make sure criminals don't buy guns? She said she \ncouldn't have bought the gun if she went to a licensed gun dealer \nbecause it would have been prohibited. So a bunch of kids died at \nColumbine High School.\n  Someone could make the argument that if the gun hadn't gotten in \ntheir hands that way, it might have gotten in their hands another way. \nI get it. Nothing we are talking about guarantees that another Sandy \nHook isn't going to happen, and it certainly can't guarantee that our \nstreets are going to all of a sudden be safer overnight. But if we make \nit a little bit harder to get that gun, if we make it a little bit more \ndifficult for a criminal to get his hands on a weapon, the chances look \na whole lot better to survive on the streets of our cities or in our \nschools and mosques and movie theaters.\n  As Senator Blumenthal pointed out, I can absolutely make the case \nthat if we had stronger laws on the books today, Newtown may not have \nhappened, and even if it did happen, some of these kids would be alive \ntoday.\n  What happened in one of those classrooms is instructive. A handful of \nkids survived because Victoria Soto put them into a closet, and when \nthe shooting was over, they were discovered in that closet.\n  Another set of kids survived a different way. When Lanza went to \nswitch magazines, there was a delay in the shooting and a bunch of kids \nran out of the classroom. Five of them--six were found in the closet, \nand five of them ran out of the classroom when Lanza decided to switch \nmagazine clips. There are five kids who don't look much different from \nAna and Daniel and Dylan and Benjamin who are--and Jesse, there is \nJesse--who are alive today because Adam Lanza had to switch clips. He \nonly had to do it about 6 times to get off 154 bullets. We don't \nexactly understand why, but he didn't actually discharge all of his 30-\nround clips. Sometimes he only shot about 10 or 15 bullets before he \nswitched, but some of them he went straight through. He only had to \nswitch clips we think about 6 times to get off 154 bullets in 10 \nminutes.\n  If we had on the books today a law such as the law we had back in the \n1990s and early 2000s that restricted ammunition clips to 10 rounds--an \namendment Senator Blumenthal and I will bring to the floor next week, \neither an amendment or in a separate bill--that shooter would have had \nto change ammunition clips 15 times--9 more opportunities for kids to \nrun out of the classroom. I know we can't guarantee that things would \nhave been different, but let me tell my colleagues there are an awful \nlot of parents in Newtown who believe their sons or daughters might \nlikely be alive today had we continued to have a restriction limiting \nammunition clips to 10 rounds.\n  What we know is that in Tucson, people would be alive today because \nthat incident absolutely stopped when the shooter switched clips. It \nwas during the transfer of ammunition magazines that he was tackled. We \nknow that if he had 10 rounds rather than a higher number, there would \nstill be people alive there.\n  We know what happened in the movie theater in Aurora. That guy walked \ninto the movie theater with a 100-round drum. What on Earth is the \nreason why somebody needs a 100-round drum? It jammed because these \nguys are amateurs. They have not done this before. People say: It is \nnot going to make a difference--10 rounds, 30 rounds--because it takes \n3 seconds to switch clips, so it is not going to provide any different \noutcome.\n\n  For a professional shooter, it takes 3 seconds. But for a nervous 21-\nyear-old kid, hyped up on adrenaline, it is a different thing. Five \nkids escaped in Newtown; the shooting stopped in Tucson; the shooting \nstopped when the gun jammed upon exchange of magazines in Aurora. \nPeople are alive today because there is something that happens when you \nhave to exchange magazines in these incidents of mass violence. More \nexchanges of magazines mean more kids alive today.\n  Let me talk to you about Porshe Foster. She was 15 years old when she \nwas killed over the Thanksgiving holiday last year in Chicago. She had \nfive sisters--six daughters, and Porshe was the youngest of them. \nPorshe was 15, and she was shot in the back of the head when she was \nstanding with her best friends in a backyard during a sleepover.\n  The intended victim was a gang-related individual. They were \ntargeting\n\n[[Page S2529]]\n\nsomebody else, but she got hit. Twenty-five shots were fired, by the \nway. Twenty-five shots were fired. Porshe was the only victim that was \nhit.\n  She was a sophomore at ACE Tech. It is a charter school that \nspecializes in getting kids ready for college in architecture and \nconstruction and engineering. This is exactly the kind of student we \nwanted, where, on the floor of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, we are all the time clamoring for more girls to go \ninto STEM education--into science, technology, engineering, and math. \nPorshe was doing it. She was living up to our expectations. She was \ngoing to a charter school. It was going to get her ready to go into a \ncareer in architecture, construction or engineering. Imagine what she \ncould have done if she lived beyond the age of 15.\n  She played volleyball and she played basketball. She sang in the \nchurch choir. She loved art. Her classmates actually honored her death \nby holding an art sale in her memory. Because funerals are expensive, \nespecially in inner-city Chicago, they used the proceeds from the art \nsale to pay for Porshe's funeral.\n  Let me tell you, that is no small expense. We do not think about \nthat, but one of the biggest issues in Hartford, CT, today--a city that \nhas had relatively low gun violence this year but on an average year \ncan have a couple dozen gun deaths--is how do you pay for the funerals, \nhow do you come up with the money as a community to pay for a funeral \nevery other week in a small, little city such as Hartford. Porshe's \nfriends decided to do an art sale to pay for her funeral.\n  Her family and friends remember her as happy, as friendly, as a great \nstudent, always busy, someone ``you couldn't be quiet around.''\n  Her five sisters had planned to give their youngest sister a guitar \nfor Christmas. She was killed on November 26, 2012, about a month \nbefore she was going to get that guitar.\n  I know there are other people who are here to speak, and so I will \nyield the floor at this time. But I will be back today and tomorrow to \ntalk about more victims. I just think we need to tell their stories. I \njust think the people need to know who these people are because there \nare going to be more of them if things do not change, and we have the \npower this week and next week to do something about it--not to \neliminate future victims. We are never, ever going to change the fact \nthat people are going to pick up a gun, are going to violate the law, \nare going to shoot to kill. We are never going to stop that. But we can \ndo something to reduce these numbers so next year at this time or 2 \nyears at this time we cannot come down to the floor with a binder full \nof victims just from the past 3 months.\n  I will be back later today and tomorrow to continue to do this, but \nat this time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, Madam President, let me say, I certainly \nsympathize with the tragedy that took place and those who lost family \nmembers. Having 20 kids and grandkids myself, I am probably in a better \nposition to sympathize with that than many others are.\n  I have to say I think somewhat of a disservice is being done to some \nof these families. It is almost akin to saying we are looking at \nlegislation that would have prevented that from happening--and that is \nnot the case--or we are looking at legislation that would preclude \nsomething such as this happening again.\n  I listened to my colleagues on the right side, on the Republican \nside, and on the left, the Democratic side, and they all have good \nideas and they all are sincere in wanting to do something and maybe I \nam looking at it too simplistically. Because I look at the second \namendment, I look at what historically has been our privilege in \nexercising our right to keep and bear arms--I mean since the very \nbeginning--then I see and I have lived through, on the State and on the \nFederal level, all kinds of efforts of people to think: We can do \nsomething about gun violence, and let's do it by background checks, \nlet's check everybody out there, let's do it, and let's approach the \ngun shows.\n  Let's talk about all these things that could be done. We could \nrestrict the number of the cartridges and the magazines and all these \nthings, but it is all predicated on one assumption, which I cannot buy. \nThat assumption is that somehow we think that the criminal element will \nsingle out this one law to comply with.\n  Let's look at the facts. When we look at what they are trying to do, \nanything that is up that we are going to be voting on in the next 2 or \n3 weeks--however long it takes--is going to, in some way, restrict the \nnumber of firearms. I think we would all agree with that. Whose \nfirearms will they restrict? They would restrict the firearms of law-\nabiding citizens. That means the ratio between guns owned by the \ncriminal element versus the law-abiding citizen is going to change.\n  When they talk about the background checks, I cannot imagine anyone \nbeing so naive as not to know that if the criminal element is going to \nget a gun, they are going to get a gun. Sure, they would kind of like \nto have some of these restrictions. They would like to have that \nbackground check because that eliminates the numbers of guns in \ncirculation. So the criminal element is the only one who is not \naffected.\n  I was asked a question not long ago about this. It was on a national \nTV show. I was actually down at the border at the time, the Mexican \nborder. They asked the question: Why is America so wrong? He talked \nabout a poll that was taken where the results were 90 to 3. The \nquestion that was asked was: Do you believe we ought to have stronger \nbackground checks?\n  I said: Fine. If you were to ask that same question--90 percent of \nthe people, by the way, answered: Yes, we need to have stronger \nbackground checks. But if you asked the question: Do you believe we \nshould have stronger background checks on the law-abiding citizens and \nnot the criminal element, then I can assure you, it would be like 99 to \nnothing the other way.\n  That is the thing. That is the one thing people just overlook. We can \npass all the laws we want, and the criminal element is going to sit \nback and smile. Is anyone naive enough not to think, not to believe \nthat regardless of background checks, a criminal element can find \nsomeone who can go and get a gun, make $100, and they have a gun. But \nthe ratio changes and not in a healthy way.\n  In a way I think it is a disservice to an awful lot of people who \nhave had tragedies in their lives to believe we are doing something \nthat is truly going to change that when, in fact, I do not believe it \nis.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I rise again to continue my attempt on the \nfloor of the Senate today, without holding up the Senate or allowing \nothers to speak their mind, to really draw attention to the names, \nfaces, and reality behind this chart. This is probably difficult to see \nfor some of my colleagues because it represents the over 3,300 people \nwho have died since December 14, since the Newtown tragedy. Over 3,300 \npeople have died from gun violence since December 14 and are \nrepresented by all of these individual figurines, which are so many \nthat the picture becomes muddled. It almost looks like lines going back \nand forth. Behind each one of those small, tiny figurines is a story of \na man, woman, little boy, or little girl who had their life stolen from \nthem and from their family prematurely because of gun violence.\n  I wish there weren't enough material to fill today, tomorrow, and \nnext week, when others aren't on the floor speaking. I wish there \nweren't 3,300 stories in the last several months alone with respect to \npeople who have died from gun violence, but that is the reality.\n\n[[Page S2530]]\n\n  The reality is that this Nation has become callous over time to the \neveryday incidents of gun violence that have happened on our streets, \nin my cities of Hartford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, and also in your \ncities of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Baltimore.\n  We have come to believe, over the course of the last 20 years since \nwe passed the last major gun violence initiative, through the Congress, \nthat we can't do anything, that we are powerless. We have come to \ndelude ourselves of that fact.\n  I gave my first speech on the floor of the Senate this morning, and I \nhave been moved to come back and spend time today talking about the \nvictims as a means to try to move us to do something. We know what we \nneed to do because people out there have already decided what it is. \nNinety percent of Americans support the universal background checks. \nTwo-thirds of Americans support a ban on these high-capacity magazine \nclips. We haven't figured it out for ourselves.\n  I wish to speak for a few minutes about these victims. I will start \nthese remarks with a school near Littleton, CO. Columbine High School, \non the morning of April 20, 1999, was visited by two very disturbed \nyoung men who walked into the school. Their names were Eric Harris and \nDylan Klebold, and they opened fire in the school. They killed and \ninjured 12 more. It was at the time certainly one of the worst \ninstances of mass shooting in a school this country had ever seen. Of \ncourse, it has now been eclipsed by what happened at Virginia Tech and \nwhat happened in my State last December 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool. At the time, it shocked the Nation because we didn't know how \nto comprehend 10 students going about their day at Columbine High \nSchool being gunned down by 2 of their fellow students. Now we are \ngrappling with how to comprehend the deaths of 20 kids, 6- and 7-year-\nolds at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n  Although it has now been almost 14 years since the incident on April \n20--we are about to come up on the anniversary--we shouldn't forget the \npeople who were killed. Before the next Senator comes down wishing to \nspeak, I will speak about those kids who were killed in Columbine.\n  Cassie Bernall was a really sweet, kind little girl. She was active \nin her church. Her work in her church meant so much to her that after \nshe died her parents set up the Cassie Bernall Foundation, which \nprovides support to youth ministries. I was a part of my youth group in \nmy church growing up, and I know what a wonderful connection it is, \nboth to God and to your fellow adolescents. It was a big deal for her. \nShe also was fascinated with the United Kingdom, and she had a dream to \nattend Cambridge University. She wanted to become an obstetrician.\n  Today Cassie would be about 30 years old. She would most likely have \ncompleted her training and would be in a residency or be a practicing \nOB/GYN. We spend a lot of time talking about the fact that we need more \npreventive care doctors practicing medicine. Cassie was gunned down \nthat day. She didn't get to live her dream or contribute to a field we \nknow is very important.\n  That wasn't the only thing Cassie cared about. She loved the outdoors \nand spent a lot of time in Breckenridge. She had a passion for rock \nclimbing, snowboarding, backpacking, camping, and taking photographs of \neverything she did so she could record her love of the outdoors.\n  She was buried along with a poem her mother wrote:\n\n       Bunny Rabbit, my friend, my daughter, my mentor, I will \n     love you and miss you forever. I promise to take good care of \n     your kitty. I know that Jesus is elated to have you in His \n     presence.\n\n  Cassie would have been an amazing person and was an amazing person. \nShe was 17 years old. She hadn't yet told us exactly who she was going \nto be, but she was going to do great things. She was killed that day at \nColumbine High School.\n  Steven Robert Curnow was the youngest victim at Columbine. He was \nonly 14 years old when he died. He loved his family. All of these kids \nloved their families, but he was especially close with his family. He \nwas pretty close to his true passion as well--``Star Wars.'' He was 14 \nyears old, and his parents said he watched the ``Star Wars'' movies so \nmuch he could speak every single line of the movies in sync with the \nactors. He was also a great athlete. He played soccer, trained very \nhard, and even worked locally at 14 years old as a part-time referee. \nHe wanted to go into the Navy. He was a pretty well-rounded kid who \nloved ``Star Wars,'' was a great athlete, and wanted to go into the \nmilitary and become a Navy pilot. He was great with young kids too. \nThis is what his friends remember, how compassionate he was with young \nkids. He was 14 years old.\n  We already had this window into who this kid was going to be. He \nloved having fun and watching ``Star Wars.'' He was great with kids as \na volunteer referee. He wanted to be a Navy pilot and serve our \ncountry. He never was able to do these things because he was gunned \ndown in Columbine High School.\n  Corey DePooter is remembered as a really courageous kid. He was 17 \nyears old, and he had a very strong sense of right and wrong, maybe \nstronger than he needed to have. When he was growing up and played cops \nand robbers, he refused to be the robber. He needed always to be law \nenforcement in that equation. He wanted to be a marine, as Steven did. \nSteven wanted to be a Navy pilot; Corey wanted to be a marine. After he \ndied, he was named an honorary marine in a ceremony in front of his \ngrave.\n\n  His friend Austin said: People said Corey was just the kind of guy \nyou want to be around. He would always pick up our spirits in a gloomy \nsituation.\n  He was on the wrestling team. He loved playing golf. He was going to \nserve our country. He was 17 years old, and Corey never was allowed to \nlive out that dream.\n  Kelly Ann Fleming was a year younger when she died in Columbine. She \nwas 16 years old. She was an aspiring author. At 16 years old, she had \nwritten a great deal of poetry, prose, and a lot of stories about her \nown life. She actually started writing her autobiography. What an \namazing thing for a 16-year-old. She was writing an autobiography \ncovering her life from age 5 until the point she died. The library was \nwhat Kelly loved. Her mom said it was her one true safe place. She felt \nright in that library surrounded by learning and books. Ironically, in \nschool her favorite subject was math. Her favorite math teacher served \nas a pallbearer at her funeral.\n  Like most teenagers, she was very much looking forward to obtaining \nher driver's license. She wanted to get out there in a Mustang or \nCorvette and drive around with her friends. She was very bright and \nvery good at math. We need more mathematicians, scientists, and \nengineers in this country.\n  Kelly Ann, who was 16 then, would be about 30 today. She was not \nallowed to fulfill those dreams.\n  This is what happened at Columbine. The two students who walked into \nthe school and started shooting couldn't get the weapons themselves. \nThey had a friend buy them for them. The friend knew that if they went \nto a gun dealership, they wouldn't get them because they wouldn't be \nable to pass the background check. They went outside the background \ncheck to get them a different way--a way thousands of people go to buy \ntheir weapons. The vast majority of them do this not because they are \ntrying to get around the background check system but because in private \nsales, gun shows, and on the Internet, we largely don't require \nbackground checks. This is one of the things we are attempting to fix \nthis week.\n  There is a belief among many of the family members of the Columbine \nvictims that had background checks been universal, possibly the two \nshooters in the school might not have had those weapons. We can't \nguarantee that. I don't want to stand here and say that we know for \ncertain that if we had universal background checks, Kelly Ann, Corey, \nSteven, Cassie, and all the rest would still be alive today. We don't \nknow that, but chances are a little better. Those families want to have \nhad the chance that their sons and daughters might be alive today, \nmight have kids of their own today, might be an OB/GYN, a Navy pilot, a \nmarine, or mathematician. They would take those chances.\n  So when we think about these victims, we need to think about the real\n\n[[Page S2531]]\n\npolicy consequences of what we are debating, and while nothing we are \ntalking about is going to guarantee these students who died would be \nalive today, boy, it gives it a much better chance it would have \nhappened. That is just a sampling of the victims in one high school, in \nColumbine High School.\n  What we know is the names reflected by these little figurines are \nlargely not victims of mass shootings. These are just the victims since \nDecember 14. These are folks who just got killed by a stray bullet or \nas a result of a crime of passion or, as I explained in an earlier \nspeech today, just because they were taking out the trash from \nMcDonald's or going to check out some commotion in their housing \ncomplex or driving home after dropping off kids at school. They were \ndoing what they normally do every day. And because somebody else had a \ngun, legally or illegally, they got killed.\n  So let's talk about some of those victims as well. As I said, I am \ngoing to be down here as much as I can today, tomorrow, and next week \ntelling these stories as a means to hopefully inspire us to some \nbipartisan action on the floor. I hope some good things are happening \ntoday while I am down on the Senate floor. I hope we are coming \ntogether on this issue. But if these stories don't move people, I am \nnot sure what does.\n  On January 7 of last year, 2012, a 14-year-old boy in Bridgeport, CT, \nby the name of Justin Thompson, and his friends from Barnum Middle \nSchool went to a Sweet 16 party for a neighborhood girl on the east end \nof Bridgeport. Justin was a popular eighth grader. His friends and his \nfamily thought he looked exactly like Alex Rodriguez. Down in \nBridgeport that is a good thing; up in the rest of Connecticut, maybe \nnot so much.\n  The parents of the girl had rented a hall and hired a DJ. There was \nno alcohol, there was no fighting. It was just a regular Sweet 16 \nparty. Eventually, as more kids showed up, it kind of started to get a \nlittle too big and the police had to come and break it up. But Justin \nleft the party and began walking down a street nearby with two other \nyoung people when all of a sudden two men appeared and started \nshooting. Justin was hit in the head and he was killed in the \ncommotion.\n  He was 14 years old. He was walking home from a Sweet 16 party. He \ndidn't do anything wrong. He wasn't in the wrong place at the wrong \ntime. He was in the right place at the right time. He was doing what he \nwas supposed to be doing that night--walking home from a Sweet 16 \nparty--and he got killed by guns. That is Justin Thompson.\n  Keijahnae Robinson was 15 years old when, on July 21, 2012, she was \nshot. She told her friends she wanted to be the next Mariah Carey. She \nwas a big singer. She loved to sing and she loved to perform. Guess \nwhere she went on July 20 in Bridgeport, CT. She went to a Sweet 16 \nparty as well. Her 16th birthday was actually the following week, and \nshe was telling friends that she couldn't wait for her party. She was \nenjoying her friend's party but she couldn't wait for her Sweet 16 \nparty, which was happening the following week.\n  After the party, her friend's mom invited some of the girls to sort \nof take the party to her house. It was a warm, beautiful night, and the \ngirls were sitting out on the porch when two men came by and opened \nfire on the porch before driving away in a car. Two hours before she \nwas shot, there was a robbery just down the street, and somehow this \nwas connected to it.\n  She was 15 years old. She was sitting on the porch with her friends, \nbasking in the afterglow of a wonderful Sweet 16 party, getting ready \nfor her 16th birthday and she was gunned down by a drive-by shooting. \nThat is Keijahnae Robinson.\n  Blair Belcher was 17.\n  This is all Bridgeport, CT. I am just giving one city in 2011 and \n2012.\n  Blair was dreaming of one day going to college. He wanted to go into \nelectronics and computing. He was walking through an east side park in \nBridgeport on July 31--he was about to enter his senior year at Harding \nHigh School--when three shooters gunned him down in the middle of that \npark--a life cut short.\n  He was a real talent. Blair had a penchant for fixing things. He \ncould fix anything. His mom said it was like a gift, and he wanted to \ndo something with it when he graduated. He was 1 year away from \ngraduating. He was 17 years old and killed in Bridgeport, CT. He was \njust in a park and he got gunned down in a cross fire.\n  It is hard to even figure out why these things happen, but they just \nget built into the background noise of urban gun violence.\n  ``TJ'' Mathis was good at a lot of things in Bridgeport. Excuse me, \nTJ, I am sorry. TJ was from New Haven. I got to know TJ's father Lenny \nwell. And Lenny will tell you that TJ was good at a lot of things, but \nbasketball was at the top of the list. He was the star of Hamden High \nSchool's team. He led them to three division titles. He was all-State \nand he went on to play Division I basketball at Morgan State University \nand had just been signed to a minor league basketball contract with the \nABA. He was a star. He was good at a lot of things--this was a \nmultitalented kid--but basketball was his thing. He did well and led \nhis team. He was going on to a career in basketball.\n  On a warm Saturday night in September 2011, he and his friends went \nto a party honoring another basketball legend--someone we are really \nproud of in Connecticut, Ryan Gomes of Waterbury. Ryan went to \nProvidence College, went to the NBA and had a great career. After \nleaving the party, his friends realized they were too tired to drive. \nThey were responsible. This kid had a career ahead of him. He was going \nto be a basketball star. He was going to the ABA, and a lot of people \nwho go to the ABA get to the NBA.\n  So TJ decided he needed to get some sleep. Unfortunately, TJ never \nmade it home that night. He pulled over to get a little sleep on the \nside of the road and a young man, seeing the three boys asleep on the \nside of the road, pulled up next to them and tried to rob them. When TJ \nwoke up and realized he was being robbed in his car, he resisted, and \nthe young man shot and killed him.\n  On the verge of a career in the ABA, a basketball standout in Hamden, \nCT, and at Morgan State University, just sleeping in his car trying to \nget a few winks before he drove home, being responsible so he didn't do \nsomething silly like get in a car while he was tired and run off the \nroad and hurt somebody else, he gets robbed and shot.\n  Just part of the background noise of the people who die every day in \nthis country--30, 40, 50, 60 a day. I will come down here today and \ntomorrow and next week, and I won't get through a few days' worth of \nshootings all across this country. The truth is a lot of these \nshootings in cities are happening with illegal guns.\n  The opponents of gun legislation are right in one respect. They are \nright that the majority of crimes are not committed by assault weapons. \nAssault weapons have become the weapon of choice for mass shooters. \nThat is true. But the reality is these kids I am talking about--Justin \nand Keijahnae and Blair and TJ--were killed by hand guns, most of them \nillegal hand guns. Why do we have so many illegal hand guns out there? \nBecause we haven't done anything about it here. We allow 40 percent of \nguns to be sold in this country without background checks.\n  Hopefully, we are getting closer to changing that, but we don't have \na Federal law making gun trafficking illegal. People don't understand \nthat someone can take a whole bunch of guns out of a store legally, \nthen sell them on the street to people who are legally prohibited from \npurchasing guns, and they have not committed a Federal gun trafficking \nviolation. Maybe they have committed a State violation, but they \nhaven't committed a Federal violation.\n  We can't solve this problem entirely. We are not going to stop bad \npeople from taking guns out on the street and doing bad things, but we \ncan substantially decrease the likelihood that another Columbine or \nSandy Hook happens, that another TJ Mathis, a standup young kid, a \nbasketball star, gets gunned down just because he is in the wrong place \nat the wrong time, or the right place at the right time with the wrong \nperson with the wrong gun. We can do something about it here.\n  Throughout the day I have been trying to talk about the variety of \nvictims, people on the streets of our cities but also in our schools. \nSo before I yield the floor again, I want to go back\n\n[[Page S2532]]\n\nto the reason we are here. I think it is important to tell you who the \nvictims are, but I think it is particularly important to tell you who \nthe victims in Newtown, CT, were because while Newtown should not have \nbeen a tipping point, and it should not have taken this long for us to \nhave this conversation, I think we all recognize we are having this \nconversation because of the 20 6- and 7-year-olds and the 6 adults who \nwere killed that day. And I believe if we don't do something about it \nthere will be another Newtown; that we will have another town added to \nthe list of Aurora and Littleton and Tucson and Newtown in a matter of \nweeks or months--hopefully longer--if we don't take some action.\n  So let me go back, before I yield the floor again today, to talk some \nmore about the wonderful children and adults who were killed in \nNewtown.\n  Mary Sherlach's husband is here today in DC lobbying on behalf of his \nwife, who was 1 year away from retirement as Sandy Hook's school \npsychologist when she was murdered that day in Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool. He is here to talk about the insanity of not taking these high-\ncapacity magazines off the streets. That is his passion. He believes \nthere is a chance there would be boys and girls alive today in Newtown \nhad Adam Lanza had 10 bullets per magazine instead of 30 bullets per \nmagazine.\n  But let me tell you about Mary because Mary is pretty amazing. Mary \nhad worked for years at Sandy Hook Elementary. She had actually been \nthere for 18 years. She was not just the school psychologist, she was \ninvolved in basically every school improvement effort you can imagine. \nShe was a member of the District Conflict Resolution Committee, the \nSafe School Climate Committee, ironically, the Crisis Intervention \nTeam, and the Student Instructional Team. She cared so deeply about the \nschool, it wasn't just a 9-to-5 or 9-to-3 or 7-to-3 job for her. She \nput in all sorts of extra hours to make the school better. She was 1 \nyear away from retirement, and, oh, how she and Bill were looking \nforward to retirement. They had a little cabin on the Finger Lakes--\nstill have a cabin in upstate New York--and they loved going up there. \nThey had planned on spending a good part of their retirement up there \nwhen they weren't spending time with their daughters Katie and Maura.\n  Mary loved gardening, reading, and she loved the theater. She was a \ngreat neighbor. She was a very beautiful person, who, on that day, did \nsomething a lot of us hope we would do, though we can't really be sure. \nAbout 9:30 that morning, Adam Lanza blasted his way through the locked \ndoors of Sandy Hook Elementary School. The principal of the school, \nDawn Hochsprung, and Mary were meeting, I believe, when they heard the \nbullets and the glass crash. They must have known something horrible \nhad happened. There are two instincts at that point--maybe three--you \nfreeze, you run the other way, or you do what Dawn and Mary did. You \nrun to the bullets. That is what she did. Her school was in trouble, \nsomething awful was happening, and Mary and her principal ran to the \ngunfire and the gunman. They didn't run away.\n  Now, plenty of people in that school did heroic and courageous things \nthat day--they stowed kids in closets and classrooms, they hugged kids \nas the bullets rained down, but Mary and Dawn were the first people who \ndied because they ran right to the bullets.\n  Mary is a hero not just because of the 18 years she spent dedicated \nto those kids, not just because of all the efforts she put in to make \nthat school a better place, but because that day she did everything in \nher power to make that shooting end. She wasn't successful, but she \ntried, and we all hope we have a little bit of Mary Sherlach in us as \nwell.\n  Mary is different than those kids. Those kids had their whole life \nahead of them. We don't know what they would have done. So at least we \nhave the benefit of knowing who Mary Sherlach was. At least we have the \nbenefit of knowing the wonder that was her life. But she deserved \nretirement, and Bill deserved to have his wife, who had worked so hard \nand had spent all these nights trying to make her school a better \nplace--he deserved to have her for their retirement up in the Finger \nLakes, and he doesn't.\n  Ben Wheeler, whom I talked about earlier today, was a very gifted \nmusician. Ben was 6 years old when he died that morning. Just before \nDecember 14, he had performed his first recital at 6 years old. I have \na 4-year-old at home, and I know what an amazing thing it is to have a \nchild be that dedicated to music that by 6 years old they can perform a \nrecital. He loved trains. They would go to New York City a lot, and he \nwas always more interested in riding the subway and the train than he \nwas in visiting the museums or the zoos. That is not uncommon for kids. \nMaybe doing a recital at age 6 is but loving trains is not.\n  More than music, more than trains, more than subways, though, Ben \nloved his 9-year-old brother Nate. The two of them did everything \ntogether. They played soccer, they swam. As I said this morning in my \nfirst speech before this Chamber, on the way to school that morning Ben \ntold his mom he wanted to be an architect when he grew up, but he was \ngoing to be a paleontologist because that was what his brother Nate was \ngoing to be, and he wanted to do everything Nate did.\n  Ben was going to be a pretty amazing man, that kind of musical talent \nat an early age, a love for his family, and, unfortunately, Ben Wheeler \nlost his life that day.\n  Emilie Parker was 6 years old. The one thing you will hear about with \nrespect to Emilie when you talk to the Parker family is that she had an \ninfectious laugh. You know those laughs you hear once and hope you get \nto hear it again before you leave that person's presence? That was \nEmilie. Her father Robbie described her as bright, creative, and \nloving. She always wanted to try new things, so much so that at 6 years \nold she was actually learning Portuguese. Her father was trying to \nteach her that and it was part of their bond.\n  She was an artist. She loved to draw with markers and she was \ntalented. At 2 years old, she could write her own name and she could \ndraw stick figures of her family. She loved art so much that her \nparents Robbie and Alissa have decided to spend a part of their period \nof mourning and time after that to set up a fund that honors her \ncreativity. As I said earlier today, what is amazing is that so many of \nthese families have dedicated big portions of their time in the \nhorrible 4 months since trying to figure out ways to bring out some of \nthe goodness and light from these kids' lives to the rest of the \ncommunity. So Robbie and Alissa have set up a fund that is going to \nsupport art programs in schools, so art programs have a little more \nresources so other kids similar to their daughter can experience the \njoys of drawing and painting. She was learning Portuguese. This is \nsomebody with a very inquisitive, thoughtful mind, and we never are \ngoing to get to know who Emilie Parker was going to grow up to be.\n  Jack Pinto was 6 years old, and he was already a jock. He loved the \nNew York Giants, and he had an idol whose name is Victor Cruz. He loved \nVictor Cruz. He followed everything Victor Cruz did. He was ecstatic \nwhen the Giants won the Super Bowl and Cruz played a big part. Victor \nwas wonderful enough in the days following the tragedy to honor Jack's \nmemory. During the game after the tragedy, he wore writing on his \ncleats and his gloves that said: Jack Pinto, my hero. Jack was buried \nin a Victor Cruz jersey.\n  He was also a wrestler. I didn't even know that you wrestled at 6 \nyears old, but Jack did, and he was pretty good at it. To show how \ntough Jack was, in one of his practices, he lost a tooth. When a 6-\nyear-old loses a tooth, you would think that would start the tears \nflowing. But Jack didn't cry when he lost that tooth. He just took the \ntooth, handed it to his coach, and went back wrestling with a gapped-\ntooth smile on his face. That was Jack. He was tough. He was an \nathlete. He had perseverance. Imagine who Jack Pinto was going to be \nwhen he grew up. We are not going to know because of what happened that \nday.\n  I get it. I know there is a risk of overselling policy change. I \ndon't want to make it sound like I am coming down to the floor and \ntelling you these stories because these kids are going to come back to \nlife if we pass some bill or that we are going to guarantee this \ndoesn't happen again. I don't want to oversell what we are going to do.\n\n[[Page S2533]]\n\n  But the 3,300 people who have died since Newtown should tell us that \nenough is enough and that we should try something. Even if we are not \nabsolutely, 100 percent, ironclad guaranteed that what we are going to \ndo is going to work, we should try something. Because it is not OK that \nsomebody can walk into a school with a military-style assault weapon \nand shoot bullets at the rate of six per second. It is not OK that a \ncouple students can do an end-around on the background check system to \nbuy guns so they can walk into their high school and kill 10 people and \nwound as many more. It is not all right that there are thousands of \nillegal guns on our streets that are used to kill 16- and 17-year-olds \non their way home from Sweet 16 parties. There are no guarantees that \nwhat we are going to do this week and next week is going to solve \neverything, but we have to try something.\n  So I am going to continue to come down to the floor over the course \nof the next few days to talk about these victims--the victims from \nNewtown, from Columbine. Hopefully, later today I will be able to talk \nabout some of the victims from Virginia Tech and Wisconsin. Of course, \nthere are just binders full of stories that we could put on this floor \nregarding urban gun violence that plagues our cities every day. These \nstories are important because too often we trade in this body in \nstatistics, that we just talk in terms of politics. Underlying this \ndebate are 20 little kids in Newtown whose lives were cut short but \nalso thousands upon thousands of other kids, young adults, and adults \nwhose stories deserve to be told.\n  At this point, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         The President's Budget\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the President submitted his budget \ntoday. It is very late. It was due February 4. It is the first time \nsince the Budget Act was passed in 1974 that a President submitted a \nbudget after the Senate has voted on one and after the House has voted \non one and both passed budget resolutions. That was a disappointing \nevent. The President, as the Chief Executive, as any mayor, as any \nGovernor normally that I have ever heard of, wants to be the one who \nlays out a financial plan for his city or State to advocate for what \nwould make the State and city better and then encourage the members of \nthe board of directors--the Senate and the House--to evaluate his plan \nand support it so they can put the country and the State and the city \non a sound financial path. Once again, we have had a very irresponsible \napproach from the President on the question of budgeting.\n\n  A few weeks ago, this Senate passed a budget for the first time in 4 \nyears. The law requires that the Senate bring up a budget in committee \nby April 1. It requires that it be brought to the floor and passed by \nApril 15. This is the first time in 4 years that process has been \ncompleted; whereas, every year the House of Representatives has \nproduced a budget, a responsible budget that would put America on a \nsound financial course.\n  This year the Senate passed a budget that was irresponsible, did not \nchange the debt course of America, left an annual deficit virtually the \nsame as if we had no budget at all. It did not improve current law. The \nSenate budget left us with a very substantial budget deficit in the \n10th year of the budget.\n  On the other hand, the House, Congressman Paul Ryan, chairman of the \nBudget Committee, produced a budget that balances in 10 years. We have \nheard great complaints that his plan cuts spending too much. Do you \nknow that plan did not cut spending? It allows spending to increase \nevery year for 10 years. It allowed spending to increase at the rate of \n3.4 percent a year, which is higher than the inflation rate is expected \nto be in America. Yet it balances.\n  The Senate budget, on the other hand, has a 5-percent-plus increase \nin spending every year, leaving us on an unsustainable debt path, \nleaving us increasing deficits every year, nowhere close to balancing \nthe budget. That is not the right path.\n  What happened today when the President produced his budget? It is no \nbetter, maybe even worse, than the Senate bill. For example, in his \nbudget it would add, over the 10-year period, $8.2 trillion in new debt \nto the Nation. We now have already $17 trillion in gross debt. This \nwould add another $8.2 trillion to it; over $25 trillion will then be \nthe debt of the United States. The 1-year interest in 2023, under the \nPresident's budget, would amount to $763 billion.\n  The base defense budget is about $540 billion; $763 billion exceeds \nSocial Security--which is the largest expenditure. It exceeds Medicare \nin spending. It would be the largest single item in the budget and the \nfastest growing. It is still assuming relatively low interest rates, \nwhich are extraordinarily low at this moment but could surge in the \nfuture and would hurt us substantially.\n  How much is that? We now spend about $3.7 trillion, so $763 billion \nis a lot of money just to pay the interest. The Federal highway bill \ntoday is about $40 billion, a little over $40 billion. Interest on the \ndebt would be $763 billion in 1 year.\n  Young people, we are indeed borrowing from their future to spend and \nlive high today on the theory somehow it will be paid back in the \nfuture by the people there. How will it be paid back, interest of $763 \nbillion in 1 year? This is not responsible. It is an unsustainable \ncourse.\n  Erskine Bowles, who was chosen by President Obama to head the fiscal \ncommission, former President Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff, a \nsuccessful businessman, he told us in the Budget Committee a couple \nyears ago this Nation is on an unsustainable course. This Nation ``has \nnever faced a more predictable financial crisis.''\n  What he is saying is that if we do not change the course we are on, \nit is guaranteed we are going to have a financial crisis and we should \navoid that. We have the opportunity to avoid that. We do not have to \nslash spending, as Congressman Ryan has made clear in his budget. You \ncan allow spending to increase faster than the growth of inflation and \nstill balance the budget. But, oh no, not here, not the President of \nthe United States, not the Members of this Senate, the majority. They \nsay we cannot live with a 3.4-percent increase in spending every year. \nWe will run the risk.\n  The President said recently he was not setting a balanced budget as a \ngoal. That is absolutely true because his budget does not balance. It \nnever comes close to balancing, has no intention of it balancing ever. \nThey use the words ``sustainable balance,'' but it is not a responsible \napproach to the business of America. I will talk a minute about some of \nthe dangers of this debt beyond just the fact that interest is going to \nsuck huge amounts of money out of our annual budget that we ought to be \nusing to invest in America.\n  How do they do it? When you eliminate the accounting gimmicks and \nhonestly look at the budget presented by the President today, over 10 \nyears, the net deficit reduction is only $119 billion. Each year that \nis about $12 billion in deficit reduction. The deficit last year, 2012, \nwas 1,080 billion--1,000-plus billion, and we are going to average an \n$12 billion reduction in the deficit under this budget? That is \nvirtually nothing. Properly accounted for, properly analyzed, based on \nthe current law, I am correct in giving you those numbers. It is not an \nunfair number.\n  What about this year that we are in, 2013, that will end September \n30? Does he cut anything from our spending level this year? No. \nSpending and debt increases. The debt is projected to increase, between \nnow and September 30, by $61 billion, more than where it would be under \ncurrent. So it increases the debt this year.\n\n  What about next year? Does it increase or reduce the deficit? It \nincreases the deficit again by approximately $100 billion-plus--$100 \nbillion. I believe that figure is correct. I might be incorrect on that \nfigure, but it definitely increases the deficit this year by $61 \nbillion.\n  Taxes go up by $1.1 trillion--$1,100 billion--in new taxes. So taxes \ngo up\n\n[[Page S2534]]\n\n$1.1 trillion, on top of the $650 billion in new taxes that were passed \nin January of this year and on top of the $1 trillion in new taxes \npassed as part of ObamaCare, the health care reform.\n  That is another huge tax increase. But we are told not to worry \nbecause this is a balanced plan. As we talked about the budget plan \nthat was on the floor--and we had 50 hours of debate, a lot of \namendments, a lot of discussion--our colleagues kept using the word \n``balanced.'' They refer to their budget, the majority's--Democratic \nbudget that they laid forward, they used ``balanced'' over and over \nagain. I put up a chart. The numbers kept running up. We got to 100, \n200 times the word ``balanced'' was used in 15 or 18 hours of debate on \ntheir side; ``balanced,'' over 200 times.\n  My staff went back and reviewed the numbers and it was 230 times. \nWhat do they mean by the word ``balanced''? Why did they use the word \n``balanced''? Because some pollster somewhere, some political \nconsultant, said people like to hear that. They want a balanced budget.\n  Their budget didn't balance, nowhere close. So they had several spins \non it,--first, they wanted a lot of people who were not following \nclosely to hear the word ``balanced'' and believed they had a balanced \nbudget when they didn't come close to having a budget that balanced. \nThey never said the budget balanced because they knew that was not \ntrue. They had deficits every year, $400 billion-plus every year. So a \nbalanced approach was what I think people who kind of kept up with \nthings believed--that we would raise taxes by $1 trillion, we would cut \nspending by $1 trillion, and this would be a balanced approach. This is \nthe way to reduce our debt and deficit: raise taxes and cut spending. \nThat is the responsible balanced approach to getting our fiscal house \nin order.\n  But that is not what the budget did. The budget increased taxes by \n$1.1 trillion--$1,100 billion--but it increased spending by $964 \nbillion. It did not cut spending at all. It increased spending. \nBasically, we ended up with only $119 billion in deficit reduction over \n10 years--zero, basically, an insignificant amount. So it increases \ntaxes and increases spending. It is the classic Democratic weakness, I \nhave to say: Tax; spend. Tax more; spend more. Don't worry about the \ndeficit.\n  But somebody needs to be worrying about the deficit because it is a \nvery important matter and we have to deal with it. This morning at the \nBudget Committee we had a new nominee, Ms. Sylvia Burwell, for the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, one of the most \nimportant positions in the entire government. She is a delightful lady \nand I know she wants to do well. She held a position in that office \nsome time ago under President Clinton, a deputy position, and she had \nsome experience in it, but it is a tough job. We need somebody who can \nwhip these agencies and departments into shape. The OMB is the one who \nanswers to the President. The OMB is the one who says: Mr. Secretary of \nthe Interior, Mr. Secretary of Defense, we don't have that much money. \nYou can't spend that much money. I send your budget back to you. Take \nanother $10 billion, take another $5 billion out of it. They are the \nheavies. So she is asking for a tough job, no doubt about it.\n  At that hearing, I talked a little bit about a great concern of mine. \nMy concern is that our debt is so large now that it is pulling down \neconomic growth in America. Let me repeat that. Our debt is so high it \nis pulling down economic growth, and slow growth means fewer jobs \ncreated. The difference between 2 percent growth and 3 percent growth \nis 1 million jobs, according to Christina Romer, who served President \nObama in the White House: So the more growth we have, the more jobs are \ncreated. The less growth we have, fewer jobs are created.\n  We had a disastrous jobs report last Friday. It was terrible and \ndeeply disappointing. What it said was we added 88,000 jobs when they \nwere predicting we would add about 200,000. But more significantly, \n486,000 people dropped out of the labor force, had given up finding \nwork--almost one-half million, and less than 100,000 got a job. That \nwas a very dangerous trend.\n  It comes around to this question: Is our debt so high that it \nadversely impacts economic growth? Let me explain it this way. The \nRogoff-Reinhart study and book that they wrote analyzes debt in America \nand it calculated it and over the world. They examined economies \nworldwide. What they found was that when debt reaches 90 percent of the \nsize of your economy, 90 percent of GDP, growth begins to slow. It \nslows a median amount of 1 percent, on average much more, as much as 2 \npercent. Growth--GDP growth begins to slow when debt reaches that high \na level.\n  What kind of debt level is it we are dealing with? Many people think, \nand the President keeps saying, our debt-to-GDP ratio is 77 percent.\n  We have examined the Rogoff and Reinhart study. Rogoff and Reinhart \nused a higher figure because they compared countries from around the \nworld, and those were the numbers they had. When the gross debt reaches \n90 percent of GDP, we begin to have an economic decline. Our percentage \nof gross debt to GDP is 104 percent.\n  I contend and I believe that the projections for growth for the last \n4 years have all been higher than the growth we have actually seen. In \nfact, it has been much lower than projected--even by the President and \nthe Congressional Budget Office. It appears to me that the gross debt \nfigure being over 100 percent is indicative of a slowing growth.\n  Rogoff and Reinhart are not the only ones who have done studies. \nOthers have done studies as well. Europe has high debt rates. Per \ncapita, we have more debt than any country in Europe and even more than \nGreece.\n  There have been studies in Europe. The International Monetary Fund, \nthe European Central Bank, and the Bank for International Settlements \nall have economists, and they are concerned about high debt in Europe. \nThey have also been analyzing these figures. All three of those, \nthrough an independent process of analyzing the impact of high debt on \neconomic growth--studies indicated that high debt slows growth. Well, \nhow much? Looking at each one of those three studies, the U.S. debt is \nin the range that pulls down growth.\n  I say to my colleagues today, please be aware that there is a cost to \nborrowing and spending and adding debt.\n  The budget the President submitted today would add $8.2 trillion in \ndebt. It would take us from $17 trillion to $25 trillion in debt. Even \nwith a growing economy, we would still remain well over 90 percent GDP \nto debt, and that is an unacceptable figure.\n  It is deeply disappointing that we do not have leadership in the \nWhite House that would lead us to get off of this path.\n  Mr. President, I see the majority leader is here. I know he has \nextraordinary duties and challenges in his busy life, and I will just \nwrap up and say that I am disappointed in the President's budget. It \ndoes not change the debt course of America in any way. It is not a \nresponsible plan for the future. It does not balance the budget ever \nand has no intention of ever balancing the budget. All he talks about \nis some sort of sustainable debt course. We cannot continue on that \ncourse, as Mr. Erskine Bowles, his own fiscal commission chairman, has \ntold us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend yielding. My time on \nthe floor is going to be very brief.\n\n\n           Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Nomination\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m. today the \nSenate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 59; that 2 \nhours of debate be equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use \nor yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to vote without \nintervening action or debate on the nomination; that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; that \nany related statements be printed in the Record; and that President \nObama be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate \nthen resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2535]]\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I gave my first speech on the floor of the \nSenate this morning. This week and next week, we will be debating one \nof the most fundamental issues that come to a body such as this: What \ncan we do to better protect our kids and our loved ones from unexpected \ndeath? I care about this issue not just because it is one that is \nimportant to the families of victims in New Haven, Bridgeport, \nHartford, and others who have been the victims of routine gun violence \nin Connecticut but, of course, because of what happened in Sandy Hook.\n  I spoke this morning more broadly about the awful experience of being \nin Connecticut, the personal experience of having been at the firehouse \nthat day, the wonderful experience of having gotten to know the \nfamilies of the Sandy Hook victims since then, and to have witnessed \nthe millions of acts of kindness that have showered down upon Newtown \nin the days and weeks and months since. That tragedy has become the \ntipping point that has brought us here to talk about a solution to at \nleast some of the epidemic gun violence that for too long has plagued \nthe streets of our cities but now comes to us in waves of mass \nshootings happening in our schools and in our movie theaters and in our \nplaces of worship.\n  My hope, as a brandnew Member of the Senate, as someone who has lived \nthrough this experience as one of the representatives of Sandy Hook, is \nto just try to tell my colleagues whom we are talking about here. I \nthink we get caught up in the numbers and the policy debates and we \nforget these are real kids, these are real people.\n  This is just a small sample of the victims in Newtown and the victims \nfrom across Connecticut, in Bridgeport and in New Haven, who have been \ngunned down prematurely. There are just too many of them. Over 3,300 \npeople have died from guns since those 20 kids and six adults were \nkilled in Newtown. We are not powerless. We can do something about it.\n  I have said over and over as I have been here on the floor today that \nthere are no guarantees. We are not going to pass a law that is going \nto immediately flip a switch and assure that gun violence would not \ncontinue to be a problem, but it can be less of a problem. It can be \nless of a reality for kids who are walking to school fearing for their \nlives in urban America. It can be less of a reality for parents sending \ntheir children to elementary school, never thinking that something like \nwhat happened at Sandy Hook could occur. We can do something about it.\n  So I wanted to come back again to continue talking about the victims, \nto give them a face. I am very encouraged, as I think all of us are, to \nsee some movement between both parties coming together on one element \nof this debate: background checks. Hopefully, this will be looked upon \nas a very good week in the midst of this debate. So I want to tell my \ncolleagues whom we are talking about.\n  Let me go back to Newtown. I think this is my fourth time on the \nSenate floor today, and I still haven't told my colleagues about \neverybody who perished in that school.\n  The youngest victim that day was barely 6 years old. His name was \nNoah Pozner. He was the youngest victim and he was the first to be \nburied. His was the first funeral I went to amongst countless funerals \nI lost count of. He was young, but he was described by his uncle as \n``smart as a whip.'' He had a real rambunctious streak. He could be a \nhandful for his family and for his twin sister Arielle who was also in \nthat school on Friday morning. She was luckily in a different class. \nArielle survived; her brother did not.\n  He was already a very good reader. He was one of the youngest kids in \nhis first grade class, but he was a very good reader and he was looking \nforward to a book he had just bought at a book fair. I will butcher the \npronunciation, but it was a Ninjago book he bought at a fair he was \nexcited about.\n  He was going to a birthday party on the following day, Saturday, that \nhe was just bubbling about in the hours before he went to school. As is \ntrue for so many of the victims, his family describes him as having a \nhuge heart. The Pozners are an amazing family who have spoken out. His \nmother and his uncle have been so articulate since the shooting, \ncalling on the Nation to change. They have been in Washington visiting \nmy office, and I know they have visited with other Members of the \nSenate--just another one of these families who have somehow found the \ncourage and the strength amidst this awful grieving to come here and \nexplain why things need to change, how they will not feel any justice \nuntil we do something here.\n  Caroline Previdi loved to draw and to dance. She was 6 years old as \nwell. She had one of these big smiles that everybody loved. It brought \nhappiness to everybody who saw that smile. She and her family were \nactive members of the St. Rose Church. I can't tell my colleagues \nenough about St. Rose Church. About 10 of the victims were parishioners \nthere. This hit that church harder than any institution save for the \nschool. The monsignor there has been an absolute hero to the community, \nhaving buried almost a dozen of his kids. He has come down to \nWashington to try to lobby for some sense of change, and he has brought \nthat community together.\n  At that funeral he presided over, everybody wore pink. It was \nCaroline's favorite color. My colleagues have heard me say that about a \nnumber of little girls who died, a lot of whom were big fans of the \ncolor pink. Her mom will always remember Caroline as the shadow of her \nolder brother. Sometimes to his dismay, she followed him around \neverywhere and she adored him. Her brother Walker and she were big New \nYork Yankees fans. Even though she was only 6 years old, when her \nfamily recently went to Boston for a family trip, she refused to walk \ninto Fenway Park because she was a devoted Yankees fan.\n  Caroline had a wonderful spirit and we will never know exactly what \nshe would grow up to be. She died that day.\n  Jessica Rekos was 6 years old and, as do so many little 6-year-old \ngirls, she loved everything about animals. Again, another trend. This \nwas a couple of first grade classes full of animal lovers, and even \nsome of their teachers were big animal lovers as well.\n  Jessica loved horses. So anything having to do with a horse, she \nwanted it. She watched movies about horses, she read books about \nhorses, she drew pictures about horses, and she wrote stories about \nhorses. She was murdered just 11 days before Christmas. She was hoping \nthat Santa would bring her a cowgirl hat and cowgirl boots, and her \nfamily even promised her that maybe, if she was really good, in a \ncouple years she could get her own horse.\n  She loved going to Cape Cod and she especially loved seeing the \nwhales. She had a fondness for aquatic life as well, a big fan of the \nmovie ``Free Willie,'' and she loved going to the cape to see if she \ncould catch a glimpse of those whales.\n\n  She was curious. That curiosity was going to spring forth into a \nwonderful young woman who was going to take her loves and her curiosity \nand her passion for life and make it into something great. We will \nnever get to know exactly what that would be. Jessica died at age 6.\n  Ana Marquez-Greene, I talked about Ana this morning in my first \nspeech. Her mother Nelba, who is just amazing--Nelba is a social worker \nwho has a passion for helping people. She is in DC right now as we \nspeak trying to push us to change things. Her little daughter Ana grew \nup in a musical family. Ana's father Jimmy is a very well known \nsaxophone player, a Hartford native. The family came back to \nConnecticut to raise their kids. So Ana was musical. She used to love \nto sing and dance. She loved most of all doing that at church. She was \nso connected to her church. She loved reading the Bible. She loved \nhaving the Bible read to her. She loved being part of the dance and \nsinging experience at her church. Her parents said she didn't walk \nanywhere. That was not her method of transportation. Her mode of \ntransport was to dance from place to place.\n  She is survived by her older brother Isaiah who is a third grader at \nSandy Hook Elementary and who survived that day. My colleagues can find \nAna's performances on YouTube. Ana's performances have been viewed tens \nof hundreds of thousands of times online.\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\nShe was a talent. She had talent in her blood. Who knows whether she \nwas going to choose music and dance as a career, but those creative \nmuscles she had and the amazing parents who were raising her were going \nto assure that she was going to be something special. She died that \nday, horribly, but her family--her mother Nelba especially--is just \ndetermined to make sure we honor her memory by doing something here.\n  Five kids escaped Sandy Hook Elementary School that day out of those \nclassrooms. Eleven kids--around that number--survived. Six of them hid \nin a closet, but five of them escaped because the shooter had to \nreload. When he reloaded, he perhaps fumbled the exchange, and five \nkids ran out of a classroom and were discovered nearby some moments \nlater. Five children--unfortunately, none of those pictured in this \nposter--are alive today because as does happen in so many of these mass \nshootings, an opportunity presented itself when the shooter changed \nmagazines.\n  I wish we didn't have to get into the detailed nuances of how these \nmass shootings play out to try to find a way out of mass violence, but \nwe do because they are happening over and over. So we now have some \nexperience. We now, to our great horror, have some data.\n  Empirically we know what happens. And what happened in Sandy Hook \nthat killed Ana and Jessica and Noah and Caroline and so many others is \nthat he had trouble reloading, five kids escaped, and either at the end \nof the 10 minutes because he had trouble reloading, or maybe just \nbecause the police were coming in, he decided enough was enough and \nshot himself. In Tucson, when the shooter reloaded, it was enough time \nfor somebody to jump on him and end that incident. In Aurora, again, \nwhen the shooter had difficulty reloading--the gun jammed--the shooting \nended.\n  So 154 bullets in 10 minutes at Sandy Hook Elementary School killed \n26 people. The shooter had to reload about six times. What would have \nhappened if he had to reload 15 times? How many more kids would have \nescaped? How many more opportunities would we have had for the shooting \nto go wrong? Would there have been a moment where somebody could have \njumped on him and stopped him, as they did in Tucson? I don't know the \nanswer to these questions. Nobody knows the answer to these questions. \nBut they are important ones to ask because they are relevant to the \nconversation we are having. If the answer is that there is a pretty \ngood chance one of those three things would have happened--the gun \nwould have jammed, kids would have escaped, or somebody could have \nstopped the shooting--then we should think twice before dismissing the \nidea that a limitation on the size of magazines sold in this Nation \nwouldn't have an effect on future mass shootings.\n  Our first job should be to stop that shooting from happening in the \nfirst place. But given the fact we are living in this terrible, awful \nreality in which they are happening on a regular basis, then we have to \nbe talking about what we can do to limit the damage and the carnage \nwhen they do occur.\n  I will tell my colleagues while no one is sure of the difference in \noutcome at Sandy Hook had the assault weapons ban still been in effect, \nthere are plenty of parents there who do believe there is a pretty good \nchance some of their kids might still be alive had that bill still been \nin effect. Remember, these were guns and clips purchased legally. For \nall the arguments that all the laws on the books aren't going to stop \ncriminals, I am not sure Nancy Lanza was going to go onto the black \nmarket to purchase an AR-15 or ammunition that was illegal. Things \ncould have been different.\n  But as we know, every day there are more people killed in this \ncountry by guns than were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary that day. I \nwill tell my colleagues that I have heard some very visceral anger from \nparents and gun victims in the cities I represent because they \nrightfully wonder why we are talking about this issue now--after Sandy \nHook--when, for the last 20 years, young men and women have been \ngetting gunned down in our cities and it didn't seem as though this \nplace stood up and cared too much about it. They welcome the \nconversation, but they wonder where all of this compassion was when \npeople such as Ronnie Chambers were being killed.\n  Ronnie Chambers was 33 years old when he was shot in January 2012. He \ngrew up with his mom and his siblings in Chicago's notorious Cabrini-\nGreen housing projects and he became involved in the gang problem at a \nyoung age. But he had to watch something that no one should ever have \nto watch.\n  You think it is terrible that Noah Pozner's twin sister has to grow \nup with the knowledge that her brother was gunned down. Think about \nwhat Ronnie Chambers had to grow up with, having watched his other \nthree siblings die at the hands of gun violence.\n  Ronnie became convinced, after watching his three other siblings die \nfrom gun violence, that he had to turn his life around. So he did. He \nwent into the music industry and he became a music producer and he \ndecided to go even further and to start to mentor young performers.\n  People remember him in the industry as ``everybody's hero.'' He was \nalways ``pointing kids in the right direction'' despite his own \ndifficult upbringing.\n  He was fun too. He loved banana milkshakes and onion rings. Then he \nwas killed--the fourth of four siblings to be gunned down in and around \nChicago. Four brothers and sisters: His brother Carlos shot in 1995; \nhis brother Jerome shot in 2000; his sister LaToya shot just 3 months \nafter Jerome; and then Ronnie, dead at 33.\n  How about Amber Deanna Stanley, who was killed last summer in \nKettering, MD. She was spending a nice, quiet evening at home when a \ngunman literally kicked down her door and opened fire. She was shot \nmultiple times while she was in her bed. She was 17 years old--17. She \njust started her senior year at Flowers High School in Springdale, MD. \nShe was enrolled in a very elite science and technology program.\n  It is crazy, but this is probably the third or fourth or fifth young \nwoman I have talked about here today--and I am probably into 30 or 40 \npeople I have talked about--another young woman who was pursuing a \ncareer in engineering and science. She had big dreams. She was an \nhonors student. She was in AP classes, and she wanted to go to Harvard \nUniversity and maybe become a doctor. She had the grades to do it. She \ncould have gone anywhere she wanted.\n  She was also very popular. She was a kid whom people were drawn to. \nShe was a peer leader and she would do wonderful, magnanimous things \nfor her classmates, such as she would bring cupcakes to them somewhat \nspontaneously.\n  One classmate said three words: ``She was amazing''--until August 23 \nof last year, a gunman kicked down her door, opened fire, and Amber was \ngone.\n  How about Angela Player, 37 years old, shot on February 21 of this \nyear, an avid reader who also loved the outdoors, gardening, and \nkayaking. She was a fan of everything fun and exciting--fast cars. She \nliked training dogs. She was killed by her ex-husband.\n  A lot of these are random killings, but a lot of these killings are \nby somebody you know. Her ex-husband actually did not have a history of \ndomestic violence but had a gun ready and available in a fit of rage, \nand she left behind a son and a daughter.\n  Mr. President, 3,300 people have died since Newtown, and I think it \nis important, as we have this debate, to come down and talk about who \nthese victims are. I will be doing this over the course of today and \ntomorrow and this week to try to bring a little bit of color to the \ndiscussion we are having.\n  At this time, I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague, Senator \nMurphy, who gave his first speech on the floor of the Senate this \nmorning on the same topic. He is eminently qualified to speak to this \nissue because of his unhappy circumstance of being a Senator-elect when \nthe Newtown, CT, massacre occurred. I have spoken to him and Senator \nBlumenthal about their personal life experiences and memories they will \nnever forget about that day and those that followed.\n  I thank him for his voice on this issue, for his inspiration, and for \nspeaking for many in Newtown, CT, and across the Nation who otherwise \nmight not have as strong a voice on the floor of the Senate. I thank \nthe Senator very much for that.\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\n  I would like to speak as in morning business briefly and then return \nto the underlying bill on firearms. I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Remembering Robert Remini\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in an interview with Roll Call newspaper a \nwhile back, Robert Remini--one of the great historians of our time--\ntalked about what he hoped for after he died. Professor Remini said his \nidea of Heaven would be listening with his own ears to debates \ninvolving congressional giants such as Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and \nJohn C. Calhoun.\n  On March 28--Holy Thursday--Robert Remini died in a suburban Chicago \nhospital from complications of a recent stroke at the age of 91.\n  I hope his wish comes true. I hope right now he is listening in awe \nsomewhere in Heaven as the great issues are debated in the Great \nBeyond.\n  Robert Remini lived a good and full life. He spent most of his career \nat the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he founded the \nuniversity's respected Institute for the Humanities. He produced a \nremarkable body of work that brought important chapters of America's \nhistory to life.\n  In 2002, at the age of 80, Professor Remini became a distinguished \nvisiting scholar of American history at the Library of Congress.\n  At the request of Librarian of Congress James Billington, Professor \nRemini spent the next 3 years writing the history of the House of \nRepresentatives. That is where I met him. What a man, a great \nhistorian, a great personality, with a smile on his face every minute \nof the day.\n  Professor Remini was once asked how he found the stamina to start \nwriting another book at the age of 80. He said he started by setting a \ngoal for himself to write nine pages a day. Then he did what he had \nbeen taught by the Jesuits who trained him. He designed a plan to \nreward success and punish failure. This historian, this writer, this \nman who had assigned himself nine pages a day, would only get his \nreward at the end of the day--a martini--if he met his goal of nine \npages.\n  His system worked. ``The House'' was published in the year 2006.\n  In 2005, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, from Illinois, asked Professor \nRemini to become the official Historian of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. The post of House Historian had been empty for more \nthan 10 years. Over the next 5 years, Professor Remini rebuilt the \noffice's small staff and reestablished its reputation for impartial \nscholarship and integrity.\n  He retired from the House in 2010, but he kept writing until shortly \nbefore his death.\n  In all, he wrote and coauthored more than 20 books. His subjects \nincluded Presidents John Quincy Adams and Martin Van Buren, House \nSpeaker Henry Clay, Senator and statesman Daniel Webster, and Mormon \nleader Joseph Smith.\n\n  As one former colleague said, he wrote with such immediacy ``that you \nmight think he'd had lunch . . . with Martin Van Buren. He is an \nAmerican treasure.''\n  The subject that interested him the most, though, was none of those \ngreat figures but Andrew Jackson. At least 10 of Professor Remini's \nbooks were about Jackson, including an influential three-volume \nbiography, the third volume of which won the National Book Award for \nnonfiction in 1984.\n  To Professor Remini, Andrew Jackson was ``the embodiment of the new \nAmerican.'' He was:\n\n       An orphan, poor, and yet talented, who through his own \n     abilities, raised himself to the highest office in the land. \n     He personified what the American Dream is all about. That it \n     is not class or money or bloodlines that are rewarded in \n     [America], but rather the ability of each individual to \n     achieve something worthwhile in life.\n\n  Professor Remini did not excuse Jackson for his backward views on \nslavery or women's rights or his harsh treatment of Native Americans.\n  He regarded Jackson as admirable because:\n\n       He believed in this Union. He believed in this country. . . \n     . [H]e . . . believed that government shouldn't be for only a \n     small segment of society, but for all of us. That's what I \n     want in [a] President.\n\n  So said Professor Remini.\n  Robert Vincent Remini was born in New York City. He graduated from \nFordham University in 1943. He wanted to be a lawyer, but that changed \nafter he enlisted in the Navy during World War II. To pass the time on \nboard ship, he read history, including all nine volumes of Henry Adams' \n``History of the United States of America.'' By the time the war ended, \nhe knew it was history, not law, that he loved the most.\n  He returned to New York to obtain his master's and doctorate in \nhistory from Columbia University, and he married his childhood \nsweetheart, Ruth Kuhner. He taught at Fordham University for 12 years.\n  In 1965, he moved to Chicago and became the first chair of the \nhistory department at the newly established University of Illinois at \nChicago's Circle Campus. He later founded the university's \ninterdisciplinary Institute for the Humanities. He chaired that from \n1981 to 1987. He became a professor emeritus of history and research \nprofessor emeritus of humanities in 1991.\n  He was an institution, not only in the field of history but certainly \nin Chicago and at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n  In addition to the National Book Award, his other honors include the \nLyndon Baines Johnson Foundation Award, the Carl Sandburg Award for \nNonfiction, the University Scholar Award of the University of Illinois, \nthe American Historical Association's Award for Scholarly Distinction, \nand the Freedom Award from the U.S. Capitol Historical Society.\n  Professor Remini's wife Ruth passed away last year. I wish to express \nmy condolences to their children, Robert, Elizabeth, and Joan, their \nthree grandchildren, and to Professor Remini's friends, colleagues, and \nformer students. I will close with this: In 2003, the National \nEndowment for the Humanities invited Professor Remini to deliver its \ninaugural ``Heroes of History'' lecture. He chose as his subject the \nMembers of the first Congress.\n  This is part of what he said of those men in whose footsteps many of \nus follow:\n\n       Ordinary. Most of them were ordinary individuals as far as \n     the record shows, yet they performed heroically. And they \n     deserve to be called heroes because they set aside their \n     local and regional differences, their economic and personal \n     prejudices, in their effort to make the Constitution succeed \n     and thereby establish an enduring union. They had many \n     disagreements, but they resolved them in compromise. And they \n     did it for the sake of showing the world that a republican \n     government was a viable instrument for the protection of \n     liberty and betterment of its citizens.\n\n  If Professor Remini were here today, he would tell us that the spirit \nof principled compromise is more than a noble part of our past; it is \nthe best hope for our future.\n  Now I will make a statement as part of the continuing debate on the \noutstanding legislation, S. 649.\n  As I mentioned before when Senator Murphy spoke, I rise to speak \nabout a vote the Senate is going to take tomorrow as we begin debating \nlegislation to reduce gun violence.\n  I am glad we are finally having this vote. There were some who \nthought we would never reach this point. It has been far too long since \nthe Senate held a reasonable debate on how best to protect our children \nand families and schools and communities from violent shootings.\n  When we talk to the families who have lost children to gunfire--and \nit has been my sad duty to do that over and over again--and when we \ntalk to law enforcement officials who are getting outgunned by \ncriminals on the streets every day, we know this debate is long \noverdue.\n  Some Senators have said they do not want to touch this issue. They \nhave announced their intention to filibuster in order to try to stop us \nfrom even debating gun safety. This is an extreme political position. \nIt is an unfortunate position. But, fortunately, over the last few \ndays, a growing number of Senators from both sides of the aisle have \nmade it clear this debate is going to move forward.\n  I hope the vote tomorrow reflects that, and when we get to the point \nwhere we are in debate, we can roll up our sleeves and get to work. We \ncan look at our Constitution, which we have sworn to uphold, including \nthe second amendment, and we can also look to the needs of America to \nprotect the life, liberty, and opportunity for happiness for the people \nwho live in this country.\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, over 11,000 Americans--\n11,000--are murdered with guns each year. That is more each year than \nall the American lives lost in the 9/11 attacks, Iraq, and Afghanistan \ncombined.\n  When we count suicides and accidental shootings, more than 31,000 \nAmericans are killed by guns each year. That is 87 Americans killed \nevery single day by guns. Another 200 are shot each day but survive. \nThink of those numbers.\n  Gun violence in America is truly at epidemic levels. Gunshots now \nkill over four times more Americans per year than HIV/AIDS, and \nshooting deaths are projected to surpass car accident deaths within the \nnext few years.\n  These statistics should give us all pause. But numbers cannot truly \ncapture the deeply personal impact of gun violence. There are too many \nfamilies who now face an empty chair at the dinner table, too many \nparents who walk past an empty bedroom, too many husbands and wives who \nhave lost the loves of their lives because of guns.\n  It is heartbreaking. But, sadly, it is almost routine--in a park in \nChicago; at a nightclub in my hometown of East St. Louis, IL; in a \nmovie theater in Auroro, CO; in a shopping center in Tucson, AZ; in a \nSikh temple in Oak Creek, WI; at military bases in Texas, Virginia, and \nKentucky; in college lecture halls in DeKalb, IL, and Blacksburg, VA; \nsadly, in the first-grade classrooms in Newtown, CT.\n  Since the Newtown shooting on December 14, more than 3,300 Americans \nhave been killed by guns, including at least 220 children and \nteenagers. The violence continues. Americans all across the country are \nsaying with one voice: Enough. We have to do something. We need to \nprotect our kids, our communities, our schools, and this epidemic of \ngun violence has to come to an end.\n  On Thursday, we will vote to begin debate on a bill that would take \ncommonsense steps to prevent gun violence. It is called the Safe \nCommunities, Safe Schools Act. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported \nthe parts of the bill last month. The committee held three lengthy \nhearings and four markups which I attended.\n  The Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act would do three things: First, \nit makes sure that the FBI NICS background check programs are conducted \non all gun sales with some reasonable exceptions. Currently, up to 40 \npercent of all transfers of firearms include no background check. \nSomeone raised the point in one of our hearings, what if you got on the \nairplane and they announced to you--the flight attendant said: Welcome \nto this flight from Washington to Chicago. The Transportation Security \nAgency has checked 60 percent of the passengers to make sure they are \nnot carrying a bomb but not the other 40 percent. Have a nice flight. \nWhat would you think about it? You would think, for goodness' sake, we \nhave to do everything we can to check everyone if we are truly \ndedicated to safety. That is what this universal background check is \nabout.\n  We would also create tough Federal criminal penalties for illegal \nstraw purchasing and the trafficking of guns. Get the picture. If you \nare going to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, they are going to run a \nbackground check on you. If your background check discloses, for \nexample, that you have a felony conviction or that you are under a \ndomestic violence order or that have you been adjudged mentally \nincompetent, unstable, and you should not own a gun, you will not be \nsold that gun.\n  Since we came up with this idea of background checks, up to 2 million \nunqualified people tried to buy them and we stopped them. That is what \nthe law is supposed to do. But under the current circumstances, straw \npurchasers go in and buy a gun because they have a clean record. So the \ngangster, the mobster, the drug gang member, the thug sends his \ngirlfriend in to buy the gun. She does not have a criminal record. She \nbuys the gun, comes outside and hands it to him. He turns around and \nuses it to kill someone. This bill is going to change what happens to \nher. Of course, he is still going to face the full brunt of the law for \nhis misdeeds. But she is now going to be held accountable, too, up to \n15 years of hard time in Federal prison for buying that gun.\n  We had a press conference in Chicago and said: Girlfriend, think \ntwice. He ain't worth it. To run the risk of spending 15 years in \nprison if you buy a gun to give to that boyfriend who is going to turn \naround and use it in a crime, it ain't worth it. This bill would also \nauthorize additional resources to keep schools safe.\n  These proposals just make sense. They have strong support from the \nAmerican public, including a majority of gun owners. The National Rifle \nAssociation may speak for the gun industry, but it does not speak for \ngun owners. Gun owners, and I know them. They are part of my family. I \nhave grown up with them my entire life. They are good, God-fearing, \nchurch-going, patriotic Americans who value their guns and use them \nproperly, store them safely at home away from kids. These are people \nwho will follow the law. They understand we have to stop those who \nmisuse guns from getting their hands on them. A majority of those gun \nowners across America, sportsmen, hunters, those who buy guns for self-\ndefense support what we are doing in this bill.\n  The straw purchasing and school safety proposals passed in committee \nwith strong bipartisan votes. I am hopeful we will be able to adopt the \nbipartisan floor amendment from Senators Manchin and Toomey on \nbackground checks.\n  All these proposals are also supported by law enforcement. It was \nabout 3 weeks ago. I went to the Chicago Police Department \nheadquarters. Superintendent McCarthy invited me in. I sat down for \nabout an hour with 10 beat cops from Chicago. They are ones who \nliterally get up every morning and go, usually undercover, into \nneighborhoods and try to stop the murders and violence. I sat there. \nOne of them had just gotten back from his 11th surgery. He got in a \nshootout with a 15-year-old who shattered his leg. He has had 11 \nsurgeries trying to get back on his feet and get back on the force.\n  We talked about what life was like out there. They talked about 14- \nand 15-year-olds packing guns and firing away. They are not worth a \ndarn as a shot. They, sadly, kill a lot of people they do not intend to \nkill. They are as irresponsible as they come, but it is the reality of \nthe mean streets of many cities. So these people in law enforcement \nagree we need to do something about the straw purchasers, for example. \nSo do the prosecutors, the medical community, the faith community, \nteachers, mayors, colleges, universities, and, most important, the \nfamily members of gun violence victims. Many of those family members \nfrom Newtown are here today. Senator Murphy from Connecticut spoke \nearlier, as did Senator Blumenthal, to note their persuasive lobbying \nas they walk the Halls of Congress, hoping the sad and awful tragedy \nthey went through on December 14 will at least lead to a safer America.\n  I salute them. In their grief, they are standing up to make this a \nsafer nation. Unfortunately, some parts of the gun lobby have had a \nlong history of opposing even those commonsense ideas. They have raised \nobjections to them. I want to respond to the main objections the gun \nlobby has raised. As it turns out, they just do not stand up to \nscrutiny.\n  First, the gun lobby claims that requiring FBI background checks for \ngun sales will lead to the creation of a national gun registry. That \nclaim is absolutely totally false. Federal law prohibits the Federal \nGovernment from establishing a national gun registry. We could argue \nthe merits of it, but we have to acknowledge the reality. It does not \nexist today. It will not exist as a result of this bill.\n  I have a copy of a letter signed by 30 Senators, including 26 \nRepublicans. I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2539]]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 2011.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Justice, \n         Science and Related Agencies, Senate Committee on \n         Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harold Rogers,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Frank Wolf,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Science, and Related \n         Agencies, House Committee on Appropriations, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairmen and Chairwoman: As supporters of the Second \n     Amendment and the rights of law-abiding gun owners, we are \n     writing to urge the House and Senate Appropriations \n     Committees to maintain several House-passed firearms \n     provisions in the upcoming Conference Report on H.R. 2112, \n     the legislative vehicle for the Fiscal Year 2012 Commerce, \n     Justice, Science (CJS), and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act. While these provisions had broad, bipartisan support in \n     the Senate, the amendments that would have reinstated these \n     provisions in the Senate version of H.R. 2112 did not receive \n     a vote.\n       Over the years, Congress has taken many actions to preserve \n     Second Amendment rights and prevent undue encroachment on \n     those rights on the part of the Executive Branch. One of the \n     most common ways in which Congress has accomplished this goal \n     has been through a number of general provisions in CJS \n     Appropriations bills. Most of these protections have been in \n     place for a number of years--some going back as far as three \n     decades--and none of them have been the source of any \n     significant controversy.\n       The House CJS Appropriations bill (H.R. 2596) made \n     permanent nine separate Second Amendment protections. \n     However, the Senate version of H.R. 2112 stripped the House \n     language and extended these protections only through Fiscal \n     Year 2012. We believe these protections should not be subject \n     to yearly reinstatement, they should be permanently fixed in \n     the law.\n       Specifically, the House-passed provisions would make \n     permanent the following protections:\n       Firearms Database Prohibition. A prohibition on the use of \n     funds to create, maintain or administer a database of \n     firearms owners or their firearms. This prohibition has been \n     in place since FY 1979 and prevents the federal government \n     from establishing a national gun registry.\n       Curio and Relic Definition. A prohibition on the use of \n     funds to change the definition of a ``curio or relic.'' This \n     provision protects the status of collectible firearms for \n     future generations of firearms collectors. This provision has \n     been included since Fiscal Year 1997.\n       Physical Inventory Prohibition. Prohibition on a \n     requirement to allow a physical inventory of Federal Firearms \n     Licensees. The Clinton Administration proposed a rule in 2000 \n     to require an annual inventory by all licensees, While the \n     Bush Administration eventually withdrew the proposal, \n     Congress has still passed this preventive provision every \n     year, beginning in FY 2007.\n       Information Retrieval Prohibition. A prohibition on the use \n     of funds to electronically retrieve personally identifying \n     information gathered by federal firearms licensees. This \n     provision prohibits the creation of a gun registry from \n     dealers' records that are required by law to be surrendered \n     to the federal government when a dealer goes out of business. \n     This provision has been included since FY 1997.\n       Business Activity. A prohibition on the use of funds to \n     deny a Federal Firearms License (FFL) or renewal of an FFL on \n     the basis of business activity. This provision prohibits \n     BATFE from denying federal firearms license applications or \n     renewals based on a dealer's low business volume alone. \n     Congress added this general provision in FY 2005.\n       Information Gathering Prohibition. A prohibition on the use \n     of funds to maintain any information gathered as a part of an \n     instant background check or to maintain information for more \n     than 24 hours. This provision protects the privacy of law-\n     abiding gun buyers by prohibiting information about legal gun \n     purchases from being kept by government authorities. It has \n     been included since FY 1999.\n       Firearms Trace Data Disclaimer. A requirement that any \n     trace data released must include a disclaimer stating such \n     trace data cannot be used to draw broad conclusion about \n     firearms-related crime. This provision has been included \n     since FY 2005.\n       Firearms Parts Export to Canada. A prohibition on the use \n     of funds to require an export license for small firearms \n     parts valued at less than $500 for export to Canada. This \n     provision removed an unnecessary and burdensome requirement \n     on U.S. gun manufacturers that was imposed under the Clinton \n     Administration, It has been included since FY 2006.\n       Importation of Curios and Relics. A prohibition on the use \n     of funds to arbitrarily deny importation of qualifying curio \n     and relic firearms. This provision insures that collectible \n     firearms that meet all legal requirements for importation \n     into the United States are not prevented from import by \n     Executive Branch fiat. This provision has been included since \n     FY 2006.\n       Once again, these are non-controversial protective measures \n     that have long had the support of members of both parties. \n     Had a vote taken place, they most certainly would have been \n     included in the Senate bill, Once again, we urge the House \n     and Senate Appropriations Committees, particularly those who \n     will serve on the upcoming Conference Committee on H.R. 2112, \n     to work to ensure that the language making these protections \n     permanent are included in the Conference Report.\n       Thank you for your attention regarding this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Orrin G. Hatch; Johnny Isakson; Mark Begich; Jim DeMint; \n           Michael B. Enzi; Lindsey Graham; Dean Heller; Rob \n           Portman; John Barrasso; Mitch McConnell; Kelly Ayotte; \n           Tom Coburn; Olympia Snowe; Ron Johnson; James M. \n           Inhofe; Mike Johanns; Richard Burr; John Thune; Roger \n           Wicker; Pat Roberts; John Boozman; Mike Lee; Jon \n           Tester; Max Baucus; Saxby Chambliss; Chuck Grassley; \n           Marco Rubio; Lisa Murkowski; David Vitter; Joe Manchin.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. This letter, dated November 3, 2011, describes a number \nof longstanding prohibitions in Federal law. Let me quote the letter's \ndescription of two:\n\n       Firearms database prohibition. A prohibition on the use of \n     funds to create, maintain or administer a database of firearm \n     owners or their firearms. This prohibition has been in place \n     since fiscal year 1979 and prevents the Federal Government \n     from establishing a national gun registry.\n       Information gathering prohibition. A prohibition on the use \n     of funds to maintain any information gathered as part of an \n     instant background check or to maintain information for more \n     than 24 hours. This provision protects the privacy of law-\n     abiding gun buyers by providing information about legal gun \n     purchases from being kept by government authorities, and has \n     been included in the law since fiscal year 1999.\n\n  There you have it. This letter, signed by Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, Senators Hatch, Inhofe, Grassley, DeMint, and many \nothers, showed that the claims about a national gun registry are \nbaseless. There is no evidence of such a registry. Longstanding Federal \nlaws prevent the creation of it. Anyone who continues to claim the FBI \nbackground check will lead to a national gun registry should be shown \nthis letter signed by Republican Senators.\n  Second, the gun lobby claims these proposals would unduly burden law-\nabiding gun owners. What is the burden? In 2011, the FBI reported the \nbackground check system had an instant determination rate of 91.5 \npercent. That means 91 percent-plus of background checks were resolved \nin a matter of minutes. For those other background checks where the \ndealer is instructed to temporarily delay the sale to allow for a more \nthorough check, the FBI must give a response within 3 days or the sale \nwill be allowed to go through. In other words, a background check is, \nat most, a minor temporary inconvenience to a small percentage of law-\nabiding Americans.\n  Meanwhile, the public safety and law enforcement benefits of \nbackground checks are enormous. Background checks have stopped unlawful \nusers from buying guns over 1.5 million times. There is no reason for \nlaw-abiding Americans to worry about tougher penalties for straw \npurchases and gun trafficking. Those activities are already illegal and \nlaw-abiding Americans will not be engaged in them.\n  In short, the proposals before the Senate will not burden law-abiding \ngun owners. They will help to save lives, reduce crime, and keep guns \nfrom the hands of those who misuse them.\n  Third claim by the gun lobby. They claim we should not pass any new \ngun laws until there is more enforcement of the laws on the books. I am \nall for that. But it is blatantly hypocritical of the gun lobby to say \nwe should just enforce the gun laws on the books when they constantly \nwork to weaken those same laws.\n  For example, in the last few years, the gun lobby has gotten Congress \nto change the laws on the books to repeal the Reagan-era prohibition on \nloaded guns in national parks, to require Amtrak to allow guns to be \ntransported on their trains, to give the gun industry unprecedented \nimmunity from liability under civil law, and to pass appropriations \nriders which make it harder for law enforcement agencies to enforce gun \nlaws, such as the ludicrous Tiahrt amendment that prevents information \nsharing about even traces of guns used in the commission of crimes.\n  Not only does the gun lobby try to get Congress to undo the gun laws \non\n\n[[Page S2540]]\n\nthe books, it has also supported court challenges to these same laws \nacross the country.\n  Here is the best example: The gun lobby claims to be outraged that \nthere are not more Federal prosecutions when a person tries to buy a \ngun but is denied by the FBI NICS background check. The Federal agency \nthat reviews those NICS denial cases to see whether they merit \nprosecution is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and \nExplosives, or ATF. As we all know, the gun lobby has gone to great \npolitical lengths to make it harder for the ATF to do its job. The gun \nlobby has blocked ATF from getting a Senate-confirmed Director for six \nstraight years. They have pushed appropriations riders that limit the \nATF's authority, and they have sought to repeal ATF regulations in \nCourt.\n  The best part is, at the same time the gun lobby tries to prevent ATF \nfrom carrying out its enforcement responsibilities, the gun lobby has \npushed a rider into law that explicitly prevents Congress from \ntransferring any of ATF's functions to any other agency, such as the \nFBI. So the gun lobby says that all we should do is enforce the gun \nlaws on the books. Then they make it harder for the Federal Government \nto do that.\n  Here is the bottom line. We are going to have votes soon, starting \ntomorrow, to see where the Members of the Senate stand. Are they going \nto stand with the police officers, the legislatures, the teachers, the \nprosecutors, the doctors, the mayors, the victims and their families, \nand the strong majority of Americans who support proposals that will \nsave lives, commonsense gun safety proposals? Or are they going to \nstand with the gun lobby that refuses to compromise even when lives \ncould be saved?\n  I know where I am going to stand. I stand with Americans such as the \nfamily of Hadiya Pendleton, the promising, beautiful young teenage girl \ngunned down just weeks ago in a Chicago park. She had been out here for \nPresident Obama's inauguration. It was a thrilling day for her to be \nhere with her high school friends and classmates. In a matter of days, \nshe had been gunned down in a park after school.\n  I stand with Sandra Wortham, whose brother, Chicago police officer \nThomas Wortham, IV, was shot and killed by gang members with a straw-\npurchased gun while he stood in the driveway of his father's home. The \ngun lobby would like us to forget about these victims. But there is no \nway we can.\n  Sandra Wortham testified at a hearing I chaired in February on gun \nviolence. She talked about how her brother, a policeman in Chicago, was \narmed and shot back, but it did not save him. She told us there is \nnothing anti-gun about doing more to keep guns out of the hands of the \npeople who will misuse them. It was pretty powerful testimony.\n  The NRA posted a summary of my hearing on their Web site describing \nthe hearing as ``an attack on guns.'' They described the testimony \ngiven by five of our six witnesses, but they said nothing about Sandra \nWortham, who lost her brother, the Chicago policeman. They pretended \nher testimony never happened. They did not want people to remember her \nstory.\n  It is not the only time. A few weeks ago, the NRA proposed a set of \nredline changes to the gun trafficking bill that Senators Leahy, Kirk, \nCollins, Gillibrand, and I are cosponsoring. The key section of that \nbill was named after Hadiya Pendleton of Chicago. That was Senator \nKirk's idea and a darn good one. What was the first change the NRA \nproposed? Deleting Hadiya Pendleton's name from the bill. They did not \nwant to be reminded of this young girl who lost her life to gun \nviolence.\n  The gun lobby may hope we forget about Americans such as the \nPendletons and the Worthams, but we will not. None of us should.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with the majority of Americans who \nsupport commonsense reforms that will reduce gun deaths and keep guns \nout of the hands of criminals. That is what we should do. I see my \ncolleagues Senator Kaine and Senator Lee on the floor. Let me close by \njust reminding those who are following this debate what other countries \nhave done when they have experienced tragic mass shootings.\n  They have acted to toughen the gun laws, often going far further than \nany proposal we have before the Senate. In Australia, on April 28, \n1996, a gunman started shooting at tourists in Port Arthur. He killed \n35 people. In response, that nation dramatically toughened their \nstandards for gun ownership, banned assault weapons, and launched a \nbuyback of hundreds of thousands of semiautomatic rifles. I might tell \nyou, that is not included in this bill we are considering.\n  After these laws were passed, gun homicides and suicides decreased \ndramatically, and Australia has not had a single mass shooting since \n1996.\n  In Finland, there were two mass school shootings in 2007 and 2008. \nThe first involved a teenager who killed eight people at a high school, \nand the second involved a gunman who killed 10 at a culinary school.\n  In response, Finland raised the minimum age for gun ownership and \ntoughened their background check requirements.\n  In Scotland, on March 13, 1996, a gunman entered a primary school in \nthe town of Dunblane and killed 16 young children and their teacher. In \nresponse, the United Kingdom actually went so far as to ban virtually \nall handguns.\n  The measures we are working on in the Senate today are modest in \ncomparison with steps other countries took in response to mass \nshootings. Even though we have over 300 million guns in America and a \nstrong tradition of gun ownership, the measures we are considering have \noverwhelming support among the majority of Americans and gun owners. We \nshould move forward with these measures.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be recognized for \nup to 5 minutes as if in morning business and then Senator Lee be \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. KAINE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kaine pertaining to the introduction of S. 700 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KAINE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. LEE. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his cooperation in \nallowing me this time.\n  The President of the United States has spent the last several weeks \nevoking the tragedy of Sandy Hook and highlighting the voices of the \nvictims in an effort to promote his gun control proposals. He has not \nexplained to the American people how any of these new gun control \nmeasures would have prevented that or any other terrible tragedy or how \nany of these measures would reduce gun violence in any measurable way. \nInstead, his proposals would serve primarily to restrict the rights of \nlaw-abiding citizens.\n  Recently, I launched a project called Protect2A, which is an attempt \nto reach out to those who are reluctant to see changes to our Bill of \nRights, our Bill of Rights eroded, and believe Members of Congress \nshould be doing everything in their power to protect the second \namendment rights of citizens. This is also as we should be protecting \nall the rights protected by our Constitution.\n  I am pleased to announce the response to Protect2A has been \noverwhelming. In less than 2 days, we have received well over 1,000 \nresponses on my Web site. The vast majority of them recognized that the \nPresident's proposal will not make them safer but will, rather, result \nin limiting their rights as law-abiding citizens.\n  It is with this in mind I would now like to ensure their voices have \nbecome an important part of this debate. I have several quotes from \nAmericans across the country who oppose these measures and wish \nSenators to stand up for them and their constitutional rights.\n  Roger, from my home State of Utah, writes as follows:\n\n       As a veteran, I've had too many ``brothers'' and \n     ``sisters'' make sacrifices to uphold the Constitution of the \n     United States. Their blood will not be in vain. While I \n     believe our rights are not granted by government, I believe \n     that documentation of these rights in\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\n     the United States Constitution has helped us maintain our \n     freedoms. Why is the Second Amendment important to me? \n     Because without it, the rest of our rights can simply be \n     wiped away.\n\n  Jim from Louisiana writes as follows:\n\n       I lived through the Los Angeles riots. My wife and I were \n     living in Silver Lake. For 5 days we watched the warm glow of \n     businesses being burned on two sides. For 5 days we never saw \n     a law enforcement officer. We were on our own. My wife and I \n     were unarmed. The couple across the street had a pair of \n     shotguns, and the elderly gentleman next to them had a .38 \n     service revolver from his days in the LAPD. After it became \n     clear that law enforcement had abandoned the citizens of Los \n     Angeles, we took shifts watching the street and who was \n     coming and going. Our neighbors brought us coffee in the \n     middle of the night, a night that was lit with the flames of \n     burning buildings. Twice cars came up our street, saw us \n     armed, and turned around. I have no doubt that the drivers \n     had things on their minds other than getting home to loved \n     ones.\n       As soon as I could, I went out and bought my first handgun. \n     I will not be disarmed. I will not be a victim. And I will \n     not let my boys be victims. Legal or not, I am giving them my \n     guns as they get mature enough to use them. If our government \n     is so out of touch they will make law-abiding citizens \n     criminals, it's just something my family will have to deal \n     with. But we will not disarm.\n\n  David, from Missouri, wrote the following:\n\n       I am a handicapped 78-year-old male living alone. I have \n     applied for and received a conceal-carry permit, which I feel \n     is my Second Amendment right. I hope and pray that I never \n     have to use my firearm, but will if challenged to do so.\n       Please don't treat the subject of the Second Amendment like \n     you did with my health care, by passing legislation that you \n     didn't even read.\n\n  Carolyn from New Jersey writes:\n\n       Protection of the 2A is necessary in order to preserve the \n     integrity of our Constitution. The ``ruling elite'' cannot \n     pick and choose which amendments they like, and which they \n     don't. We, the people, are sovereign citizens, and we are \n     protected by the Constitution.\n\n  Annie, from Georgia, writes the following:\n\n       Dear Senator, how I wish we as a civilized nation did not \n     have to go through this in order to defend our 2nd Amendment \n     that has been in place for all these years. It is very \n     important that we the citizens keep our weapons to be able to \n     defend ourselves from criminals as well as to send a message \n     to the government that we are not under any dictatorship. We \n     are a free country, and we are ready to defend our position \n     against anyone who tries to take away what rights we have. To \n     me, personally, my guns are my defense to protect my family, \n     and I have had to make use of them for that reason in the \n     past and will do it again since the police cannot be \n     available fast enough . . . Please protect our rights, \n     because once we lose this amendment, we are defenseless and \n     others will follow. I do not want to live again in a country \n     where citizens have no ``voice,'' where there is no democracy \n     and the people live in fear of what they say. I am a legal \n     citizen of the USA, by choice. I am an American, and I love \n     this country like my own. Thanks so much for what you are \n     doing. Let our voices be heard.\n\n  Mr. President these are just a few of the excerpts. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have the rest of these statements printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Michael--Pennsylvania\n\n       Thank You for taking This stand . . . Not only is it the \n     2nd Amendment at stake here but the right to protect my \n     family and my house . . . I have had 2 encounters since \n     living in my current house of 28 years . . . with the last \n     one . . . the police told me flat out that they couldn't stop \n     a crime all they do . . .95% of the time is take a report on \n     the crime now some want to take this right away from me . . . \n     Guns have been a part of my family for at least 5 generations \n     and never has there been a bad instance with any of our guns \n     . . .\n\n                         Richard--Pennsylvania\n\n       I am a law abiding citizen who deserves the right to \n     protect my family from criminals and tyranny. I abhor \n     violence as do most law abiding citizens but the individuals \n     who commit gun crimes are by definition criminals. This \n     current ``debate'' has not been about reducing violence and I \n     am disappointed in Pro 2A politicians for allowing the \n     conversation to be dictated by politicians who neither \n     understand how guns work nor have the ability to use logic or \n     reason and use emotions and rhetoric to expand control while \n     putting law abiding citizens and freedom at risk. Gun control \n     has not and will never work because it does not address the \n     cause. When we as a country decided to reduce drunk driving \n     deaths the drivers were and are prosecuted not cars or \n     alcohol and it has been successful. Take guns away from law \n     abiding citizens and neglect to enforce and prosecute gun \n     crimes and the result is Chicago. We need to enforce current \n     laws and have a zero tolerance policy for gun crimes while \n     addressing mental illness and a culture that glorifies \n     violence.\n       Please do everything in your power to protect our rights \n     and change the focus of this conversation to the criminals.\n\n                           Leslie--Minnesota\n\n       Because it a legal right as given by our founding fathers \n     to protect our selves, family's, state and country from harm \n     from any direction. Keep up the good work.\n\n                             Holly--Florida\n\n       Years ago, I was robbed at gunpoint by 2 young gang \n     bangers. A call to 911 received no response from the police--\n     none. After that incident, my father gave me one of his small \n     hand guns & took me to the range to teach me how to use it. I \n     have no record of transfer, no background check paperwork, \n     just a clear memory of having a gun held to my head & the \n     knowledge that--if I ever had to--I could defend myself in my \n     home. I fear that the knee jerk gun restrictions emanating \n     from DC and state governments will expose me & others like me \n     to harm. I also fear that the contents of these proposed \n     bills are yet one more excuse for a governmental money grab. \n     I pray you will meet with success in your efforts. Thank you.\n\n                             Rick--Kentucky\n\n       Senator Lee, Thank you for taking a stand for our 2nd \n     Amendment rights. The 2nd Amendment not only provides the \n     American public an avenue to protect themselves and their \n     loved ones when and if the need ever arises, a means of \n     hunting to provide food for ones family, as a sport to \n     compete and enjoy the company of others, but more importantly \n     provides the American people with a means to protect itself \n     from a tyrannical government. Our Founding Fathers and \n     framers of our Constitution knew better than any of us today \n     that government in any form can easily become the enemy of \n     the inherent freedoms and rights of it's citizenry. The 2nd \n     Amendment was put in place as the protectorate and armed \n     guard for each and every other Amendment in the Bill of \n     Rights. Over the last several decades, these rights and \n     freedoms provided us through the Constitution have been \n     slowly watered or otherwise whittled down by our government, \n     and considering our current political and social climate, the \n     2nd Amendment is more important than ever. Unfortunately the \n     opponents of individual freedom are now using an axe to chop \n     away at this, our most important Amendment. I, like all \n     Americans was horrified by the recent and senseless murders \n     in Colorado & Connecticut, but in our grief, many Americans \n     are failing to realize that the problems of our society \n     cannot be washed away simply by removing the inanimate object \n     from the equation. Was it the fault of the airplane or the \n     Boeing Aircraft Company for the deaths of innocents in the 9/\n     11 terrorist attack? No, it was the human beings, with evil \n     in their hearts and minds that were the cause, utilizing an \n     otherwise useful piece of machinery as the mechanism of \n     death. It's times like these when an individual needs to take \n     a stand, to be respectful of those who believe differently \n     than himself, but be resolved to fight for what he believes \n     in none the less. I believe strongly in the 2nd Amendment the \n     same way I believe that it's purpose is just as strong today \n     as it was in our Founding Father's day and I will be standing \n     up for my rights. Thank you for standing with me.\n\n                             Michael--Utah\n\n       More than ever we need to protect our God-given liberties \n     and freedoms. While I mourn for the loss of life from \n     whatever may be the cause, the further eroding of our \n     liberties will make us neither safer nor freer. The \n     overwhelming majority of gun owners are law abiding citizens. \n     There will always be the few that choose to live by their own \n     rules and norms.\n       I am the father of a 12 year old and an 8 year old and I \n     want them to enjoy the freedoms that have been enjoyed by \n     previous generations. Do I want them safe? Of course. Do I \n     think further restrictions of firearms and/or ammunition will \n     do this? No. A mentally ill individual will do harm with a 10 \n     round magazine just as they would with a 30 round magazine. I \n     would like to see us put more resources toward helping those \n     with these life changing problems. How sad and difficult it \n     must be for the loved ones.\n       Press forward with protecting the freedoms and \n     responsibilities of our citizenry.\n\n                            Jeffrey--Indiana\n\n       The Founders understood that control of weaponry, with \n     respect to law abiding citizens, is not about gun control--it \n     is about people control. When the people are no longer in \n     control of their own destinies, then there is tyranny. The \n     Founders also feared that once power left the people's hands, \n     the only way to regain that power over their own lives would \n     be with blood. The 2nd Amendment protects against the need \n     for another revolution of blood.\n\n                           Vitaliy--Colorado\n\n       My family and I immigrated here, legally, from Russia/\n     soviet union to live free and to have opportunity sadly \n     unavailable to most in the world.\n       These freedoms and liberties are coming under attack, \n     starting with the 2nd amendment. There is a reason why it is \n     2nd and not 5th or 10th--it guarantees us the right to \n     protect our freedoms if they are being threatened.\n       I served in the military and swore to protect the \n     constitution of the United States.\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\n     The entire constitution, not just parts of it I like. I feel \n     like our president is in violation of that oath.\n       I understand that there is a push to get hands of criminals \n     and those mentally unstable away from weapons that can \n     potentially be used against citizens and kids, but this plan \n     that those on the Left want, do not guarantee our safety one \n     bit, instead they take rights of those who are law abiding.\n       I'm also sick to my stomach that the president and those on \n     the left use kids faces and their parents to stand in front \n     of them like puppets while the politicians try to abnegate. I \n     cannot believe a human being in such power can exploit a \n     tragedy to advance his political views.\n\n                            Walter--Florida\n\n       This story was recent . . . On Friday April 6th, 2013 my \n     place of business received a phone call that ended with the \n     individual threatening to kill my receptionist and everyone \n     in the building. I immediately placed the building on lock \n     down and called the police. While I was waiting for police to \n     arrive, I retrieved my fire arm from my car and began to \n     carry it in my person as I walked around and checked all \n     entry points. The police finally arrived 15 minutes later and \n     very calmly said that there was no crime committed and that \n     they can't do anything. They then left. This really disturbed \n     me as if I did not have a gun in my possession my employees \n     and I would be nothing but sitting targets. The police are \n     great and I respect them a great deal, but they are reactive \n     not proactive. I equate this to if a fire breaks out, I want \n     to put it out with an extinguisher and not only wait for the \n     fire department. At the end of the day I escorted my \n     employees out to their cars and waited until they drove off, \n     all while I was armed. I am a very responsible gun owner who \n     hopes to God that I never ever have to aim my gun at someone, \n     let alone shoot and kill someone. I love my family, employees \n     and friends too much than to not be armed and just stand \n     around if God forbid something were to happen and I stand \n     helpless watching them be injured or killed. Just because I \n     follow the laws doesn't mean the person who made the death \n     threat does. Please fight for my right to protect the ones I \n     care about most. Thank you and God bless!\n\n                            EddieJean--Utah\n\n       My family for generations have fought with their lives to \n     protect the constitution of the United States. I remember as \n     a child feeling pride in my country by saying the pledge of \n     allegiance. I am still a very proud American and believe in \n     the rights of all Americans. When my husband, daughter and I \n     moved from Arkansas to Arizona (while my husband was in the \n     military) it was a shocker to my system. Moving was \n     exhausting, and like many new young couples with no money and \n     moving ourselves, we were so excited to find an affordable \n     home in a not so scary neighborhood. It was about 2 weeks \n     when we woke (we slept in our living room, we did not have a \n     bed) to someone trying to open our front door. Terrified, my \n     husband told me to go get our young daughter, while he \n     grabbed his revolver. I got our daughter, got behind my \n     husband and called the police. The lady on the line was very \n     concerned and talked to me the whole time. The person trying \n     to get in was very persistent, and moved the window. I was so \n     scared and asked where are the police, what is taking so \n     long, she explained that they put calls in order of threat. I \n     said this is important and the person or person's are trying \n     to get in. She asked if we were armed I said yes, but we did \n     not want to hurt anyone (a crazy statement), because I did \n     not know the person on the other side, who would possibly \n     kill me and my whole family for what $10.00 and no items of \n     value. My husband finally yelled I have a gun and I know how \n     to use it; I am not sure but the person on the other side \n     must have decided not to take the chance, seeing our Arkansas \n     plate that we probably did know how to use it, or to find a \n     less threatening home. It took the officers over 45 minutes \n     to arrive to our home and when I asked what took so long, one \n     responded, if you had been shot or dying we would have been \n     here sooner. I am a law abiding citizen and have the right to \n     defend myself, that is why I believe in the 2nd amendement. \n     Criminals do believe in the laws and they will find a gun \n     with or without laws. So if you take away my rights, my death \n     and many others will be on the heads of foolish goverment \n     officials who do not know what they are doing. For Obama is \n     out for power not the rights of Americans. I like many \n     Americans was so saddened by the death of the children and \n     adults by the hand of a madman, but I need to be armed and \n     have done so legally, to protect my family. When are we going \n     to hold people responsible and not the objects they use? \n     Maybe we should ban cars, for they kill more people than \n     guns, or how about a baseball bat, or a hammer, or my purse \n     (now that is a deadly weapon). People are responsible for \n     their actions, not objects. Thank you Senator Lee, Eddie Jean \n     Mahurin, a proud American.\n\n                           Maureen--New York\n\n       As a woman a firearm is an equalizer against those bigger \n     and stronger than me. I have the right to protect myself!\n\n                           Patricia--Nebraska\n\n       Living in the Midwest, it allows me self-protection of \n     property and family. We live in the country and there are \n     only limited law enforcement here with extremely long \n     response times. We need the ability to defend ourselves \n     against the ever increasing influx of crime.\n       We are also very much of the belief that the Constitution \n     guarantees our right to bear arms to protect us from \n     tyranny--politicians in power who seek to do our country \n     harm.\n       It is your obligation to uphold our rights as per the \n     Constitution, as all elected officials took an oath to do \n     just that and We the People will not settle for less . . .\n\n                             Melissa--Utah\n\n       Being a military wife, my husband is away most of the time. \n     I don't believe the federal government should have the power \n     to tell me what I need and don't need in order to keep myself \n     and my family safe. They do not know my comfort level and \n     ability with firearms, so how can they decide what would be \n     best for me to use? That decision should be mine. Whether I \n     decide a rifle or handgun or none at all, is of no concern to \n     anyone else. Controlling me will not keep anyone else safe \n     from criminals. It will only make me less safe.\n       Our constitutional liberties should never be up for a vote. \n     This whole thing is quite disturbing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/10/senate-section/article/S2542-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2542-S2547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       NOMINATION OF SARAH JEWELL TO BE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Sally Jewell, of Washington, to \nbe Secretary of the Interior.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided prior to a vote on the nomination.\n  The senior Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this afternoon we will take up in the \nSenate the confirmation of Sally Jewell to head the Department of the \nInterior. The Department is one of America's biggest landowners and is \nthe second largest source of revenue for the Treasury after the \nInternal Revenue Service. The Department of Interior has the unique \nmission of protecting America's treasures while pursuing balanced \napproaches to promote sustainable economic development.\n  The Department administers the Outer Continental Shelf Program, which \nis vital to the gulf coast, and Oregon's forest lands in southwestern \nOregon where we are pushing hard to increase forest health because we \nknow forest health equals a healthy economy.\n  The Department has significant trust responsibilities for Native \nAmericans, and it manages water reclamation projects throughout the \nWest. Public lands, which are administered by the Department, are a \nlifeline for our ranchers, and they are especially important given the \nrecent droughts our country has experienced.\n  In addition to these traditional responsibilities, increasingly the \nDepartment of the Interior is responsible for providing recreational \nopportunities for millions of our citizens. Today millions of Americans \nuse these lands to hunt, camp, fish, hike, and boat. Let's make no \nmistake about it. Outdoor recreation is now a major economic engine for \nour country, generating more than $645 billion of revenue each year.\n  This is why I am especially enthused today to be able to strongly \nrecommend Sally Jewell to head the Department of the Interior. She has \nexceptional qualifications. Somehow she has managed to pack into just \none lifetime two or three lifetimes of experiences. She has been a \npetroleum engineer, corporate CEO, a banker, and a citizen volunteer. \nHer qualifications clearly made an impression on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, which I chair. Last month our members voted 19 to \n3 to approve her nomination, and I believe she got that resounding vote \nbecause she is the right person to oversee the multitude of programs at \nthe Department of the Interior, several of which I have just mentioned. \nShe certainly made clear in her confirmation hearing that she \nunderstands there is an enormous responsibility to balance the dual \nroles of conserving and developing resources.\n\n  I think we all understand that jobs in our country come from the \nprivate sector, and if through this Department we can come up with \ninnovative, fresh policies to set the climate for job growth while we \nprotect our treasures, that is clearly going to be good for the United \nStates of America.\n\n[[Page S2543]]\n\n  Let's look at a few of the areas where she is going to be involved. \nNatural gas is just one. This resource has been a huge, positive \ndevelopment for our country. We have it, the world wants it, our prices \nare lower, and we are seeing a significant interest among American \nmanufacturers in bringing jobs back home. I know this has been of great \ninterest to the Presiding Officer today. A lot of these manufacturers \nare saying they want to come back from overseas because America has a \nprice advantage in terms of clean natural gas.\n  There are significant environmental questions associated with natural \ngas. We have already talked about them in our committee. We are going \nto have to deal with fracking issues and methane emissions and \nunderground aquifers. Based on some of the discussions we have had--and \nwe had a very good dialog between Frances Beinecke of the Natural \nResources Defense Council and Senator Hoeven from North Dakota where \nthey have a significant interest in natural gas--I believe that under \nSally Jewell, when it comes to our public lands, we are going to be \nable to strike the kind of responsible balance that will make sense for \nthe Senate in a bipartisan way.\n  I see my friend and colleague Senator Murkowski is here. She has more \nthan met me halfway as we have tried to look at the issues associated \nwith these questions, such as natural gas.\n  I will only say that with someone with the brains and energy and the \nwillingness to reach out that Sally Jewell has--and she certainly did \nthat based on the number of visits she made to Senators--we may be able \nto have a natural gas policy where we can have it all, where we can \nhave modest prices for our businesses and consumers that make for a \nsignificant economic advantage, we can bring back some of those \nindustries from overseas to Oregon and Ohio and other parts of the \ncountry, and we can do it by using, for example, best practices on our \npublic lands as it relates to managing these resources. But we will \nonly have a chance to accomplish those kinds of things if we have \nsomeone with Sally Jewell's talents and professional track record of \nactually bringing people together on these kinds of issues.\n  I do not believe you can run a multibillion-dollar company, such as \nREI, which has been Ms. Jewell's current position, without showing the \nability to manage, to bring people together, and in particular to \nanticipate some of the exciting trends in the days ahead in terms of \noutdoor recreation, where we all have enjoyed the American tradition of \nthe great outdoors. I think few thought it would be a $646 billion \ncontributor to the American economy. But that happens because \nindividuals like Ms. Jewell are willing to step up to take these \npositions. Because she is from our part of the world in the Pacific \nNorthwest, we are particularly pleased to see her secure this position.\n  But, again, you do not run--and run well--a nearly $2 billion outdoor \nequipment company, as Ms. Jewell has, by osmosis but because you are a \ngood manager, you are good with people, and in particular you \nunderstand what the challenges are all about.\n  At this point, I would like to give some time to my friend and \ncolleague. I know that Washington Senators are very interested in being \npart of this debate, and before we wrap up this afternoon, I also would \nlike to talk about the wonderful track record of Ms. Jewell's \npredecessor, our current Secretary, Secretary Salazar, who is Senator \nMurkowski's and my personal friend.\n  For purposes of this part of the discussion, I would only like to say \nto the Senate that in Sally Jewell we will have an individual with the \nexperience and with the expertise and the drive to lead the Department \nof the Interior. I believe she will listen to Senators who have \nconcerns, listen to Senators who want, as Senator Murkowski and so many \nin our committee have tried to do, to find common ground. So I strongly \nurge the Senate today, when we vote a little bit later on, to join me \nin voting to approve Sally Jewell's nomination for the Department of \nthe Interior.\n  I will now be happy to yield to my friend and colleague from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I follow my colleague from Oregon, the \nchairman of the Energy Committee, here in discussing the qualifications \nof the nominee for Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell. We \nrecognize as westerners that this is an appointment, this is a position \nthat has great significance, great meaning to our States, so we pay \nattention to these nominees, we pay attention to who is the Secretary \nof the Interior.\n  I have taken the position that our constitutional responsibility for \nadvice and consent should begin with very thoughtful questions on our \npart, and then, absent any seriously disqualifying factors, we should \nconclude with the confirmation of the President's nominees. Our \nobligation to get answers to our questions is always a serious one, and \nthe duty weighs most heavily when the interests of our constituents are \ndirectly at stake.\n  I mention the impact the Department of the Interior has particularly \non our Western States--our States that have so much in public lands, \nour States where we have national forests, where we have BLM lands, \nrangelands, refuge lands. In Alaska and really in many parts across the \nWest, the Federal Government's biggest and most prominent role is \nreally that of a landlord. Sometimes you have a good relationship with \nyour landlord, and other times it feels as if the landlord won't even \nlet you put a nail in the wall to hang a picture. So, again, we look \nvery critically and very carefully at this position.\n  In several States, the Federal Government controls the majority of \nthe land. In Alaska, 64 percent of the State is controlled from here in \nWashington, DC. So that means an individual who may have an inholding \nin some Federal land basically has to get permission to get to his or \nher inholding within a park. It is almost hard for many of my \ncolleagues to believe that so much of what it is we do has to go \nthrough this process of approval, but that is our reality.\n  In Alaska, with the Federal ownership, there are more than 230 \nmillion acres that are held in Federal ownership. That is an area which \nis larger than the State of Texas. We always like to compare \nourselves--Alaska to Texas--but the fact is that the Federal public \nlands in Alaska are larger than the size of the State of Texas. We have \nover 57 million acres of wilderness. That is about the size of the \nState of Minnesota. And that is just sitting in my State.\n  The proportion of Federal land in Alaska is exceeded only by that of \nour colleagues from Nevada. The majority leader and Senator Heller \nremind us quite frequently the Federal lands held in their State are at \nabout 85 percent.\n  So when you think about what this does, the Federal land \nclassifications that we have to deal with, oftentimes it not only \nseverely restricts the usage of Federal lands by our people, but as a \npractical matter they restrict the use of State and private lands too.\n  So, again, the Secretary of the Interior is important to the future \nof a State such as Alaska and the West, but really, as it relates to \nother Cabinet members, this is one to which we are going to pay serious \nattention.\n  I had occasion to come to this floor several months ago to discuss a \ndecision that came out of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In that \ndecision, they somehow found cause to oppose a single-lane gravel road, \n10 miles, that would connect the community of King Cove--near the \nAleutians--connect it to the smaller community of less than 100 people \nof Cold Bay. The reason for the need to connect these two communities \nis Cold Bay has the second longest runway in the State of Alaska. King \nCove, on the other hand, where most of the people live--about 900-some-\nodd Native Alaskans--has an airport that is dicey at best. We have seen \naccidents, we have seen lives lost as folks have tried to leave King \nCove for medical services.\n  It was an issue that, for me and for the people of King Cove, was far \nbeyond a discussion about what happens when you put a small road \nthrough a refuge. For the people of King Cove, this was about safety, \nthis was about life and safety, and they felt they were not being heard \nby their Federal landlord. The agencies had not heard the people. In \nfact, the Department had not heard the people. Now, they had listened \nto the biologists and they had gotten that message, but the people had \nnot been heard.\n\n[[Page S2544]]\n\n  So through a series of very lengthy discussions with Secretary \nSalazar, through a series of conversations with the nominee Sally \nJewell, and through the impassioned words of many of the people of King \nCove, who traveled over 4,000 miles to come here to Washington, DC, to \nknock on the door of the Secretary and say: Please hear our voices, \nthere has been an accommodation, there has been an agreement reached. \nAnd I appreciate my colleague, the chairman, helping us with this. The \nDepartment of the Interior has agreed to have the new Secretary as well \nas the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs review the public health \nand safety impacts of the decision to build this road.\n  But I think it is important that folks understand this wasn't a \nparochial issue I was raising here on the floor. I kept referring to it \nas the King Cove issue, but it is not one single issue, and it is not \nparochial. It is obvious to the people of Alaska why this was such a \nconsiderable deal, why it was so important the people of King Cove be \nheard. For them, it was not just about a road, it was an issue of \noverreach. It was a symbol of Federal overreach on way too many \npolicies we see come out of the Department and the harm that causes \nacross our Nation.\n  The reality is so many of us, particularly those in the Western \nStates, have our own King Cove. We all have those instances when issues \nhave come up, where the people from the States we represent have to go \nknocking on the door of some Federal agency for permission, have to try \nto navigate a morass of regulations, and they do not feel as though \nthey are being heard. Every day we have Federal restrictions making it \nharder for local people to live and to prosper.\n  I made a big effort to make sure the incoming Secretary of the \nInterior not only understood the particulars of King Cove--and I \nwelcome the opportunity to travel with her when she comes to Alaska and \nflies out to King Cove hopefully at the end of the summer--for her not \nonly to understand this issue but for her to understand the bigger role \nshe will assume as Secretary of the Interior and how important it is \nfor her to listen to all sides and to listen to the people she \nrepresents. As Secretary of the Interior, she is the one to implement \nthat special trust responsibility the Federal Government has to our \nfirst people, to our Native people, so she needs to see and hear for \nherself.\n  She also needs to fully understand what she has in front of her--as \nSenator Wyden mentioned, the massive public lands that will be under \nher jurisdiction as Secretary, understanding what that means to \nranchers and farmers and those who are the recreators in our national \nparks, to those who will harvest timber, to those who will use our \nlands in the manner in which they are intended--multiple use--for her \nto fully understand what it means to be the custodian, the landlord of \nour amazing public lands in this country. We all need to be working \nwith her.\n  I have no question about Ms. Jewell's intelligence and her competence \nas a manager. I have been very impressed with what I have seen as her \nlevel of sincerity with her very distinguished private sector career. \nIt has been noted that she has probably spent more time in Alaska prior \nto coming to the Department of Interior than any other nominee outside \nof Walter Hickel, who was our former Governor and served as Secretary \nof the Interior. So she gives me comfort with that, knowing that she \nunderstands much of what we have to deal with in Alaska.\n  These are all important qualities as we think about her competence as \na manager, as we think about her intelligence. But dealing with an \nagency the size, the scope, and the complexity of the Department of \nInterior really requires the ability to focus not only on the debates \nand conflicts that we are facing today, but it is going to require an \nunderstanding of how we got here, the fact that the debates and \nconflicts of today often are based on years, decades, perhaps even \ncenturies of history. Those who are steeped in this history raise the \nimportance of the Secretary understanding the context for the many \ndifficult decisions that will be made.\n  I had an opportunity to ask a lot of questions of Sally Jewell not \nonly in our private meeting but before the committee and then also in \nwriting. I asked questions about my questions. I wanted to be thorough. \nAnd I do concede that Ms. Jewell will be on a learning curve as she \nassumes the position of Secretary. But in her answers to questions at \nthe hearing and in her written submissions, she has pointed out her \nexperience and her skill at bringing diverse groups of people together \nto solve difficult problems on which they have been divided \nhistorically, and I do take her at her word there. I will certainly \ncommit to participating in that dialog and to bringing all of my fellow \nwestern constituents with me, whether it is literally or figuratively. \nI believe that is important.\n  Ms. Jewell has used the word ``convener'' when describing herself, \nand I think this will be a very important task and role that she will \nassume. There are conflicting groups and conflicting interests, and Ms. \nJewell has spoken to how she has reconciled that in the past with her \nprevious work experience, not only at REI but at other places, and I do \nbelieve she has the skill sets to accomplish just that.\n  So with this commitment she has made to me and to others on the \ncommittee, I will certainly take the view that the fact that Ms. Jewell \nhas perhaps not been through the full gamut of the conflicts that \nsurround so much of what happens within Interior, perhaps that is a \ngood thing because perhaps she is able to look at some of these issues \nthrough a fresh perspective, a different lens. Perhaps because she is \nnot so embedded in the history, she will be able to look at this anew. \nAnd I think that is good. I think that is a positive. I certainly will \nlook forward to engaging substantively with her as we complete this \nprocess--and beyond--on these issues, on how she can really bring her \nproblem-solving skills to bear in a way that will serve all Americans.\n  I think it is telling--and it was noted in the Energy Committee \nhearing by one of our colleagues--that Ms. Jewell brings to the table \nas the nominee for the Secretary of Interior a business background that \nis quite considerable. She is a petroleum engineer who has actually \nfracked a well, so she has experience there. She has experience in \nAlaska and worked on the beginning portion of how we built out the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline. She did it from the Seattle area but has that \nskill set as well.\n  It was asked somewhat tongue-in-cheek by one of my colleagues on the \nRepublican side: Well, you have all these great characteristics. Why \nwould President Obama select you?\n  So I think it is important to recognize that we have before us a \nnominee who brings a unique set of skill sets and experiences to us \nthat I am hopeful will be beneficial. This is important to me as an \nAlaskan, to know we have someone who will be a listener, who will be a \nconvener, who will work to solve problems. I am looking forward to the \nopportunity to spend time in Alaska with her as she visits with the \npeople up north to better understand some of the challenges we face and \nhopefully work with us on these issues that are so critically \nimportant.\n  I appreciate the good work of my colleague and the chairman of the \ncommittee in getting us to this point so that we can move Ms. Jewell's \nnomination forward. I look forward to supporting her and working with \nher during her tenure as Secretary of the Interior.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Washington State is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues and \nurge them to vote in support of Sally Jewell, who has been nominated to \nserve as Interior Secretary. I thank Senator Wyden for all of his work \nin moving her through this process to today. I was thrilled when \nPresident Obama nominated Sally for this position, and I couldn't be \nmore excited to support her confirmation.\n  Sally is going to come to the Department of the Interior at a \ndifficult time for our country. As a nation, we are working very hard \nto protect our environment and invest in new technologies to meet our \nenergy demands. And on the local level, including in my home State of \nWashington, Sally is going to face some complex issues, such as \nprotecting tribal lands and\n\n[[Page S2545]]\n\ntreaty rights. But I can think of no one better prepared for this task \nthan Sally.\n  After she studied at the University of Washington to become an \nengineer, Sally left the Northwest for the oilfields of Oklahoma and \nColorado, where she learned about the energy sector from the inside \nout. She moved from the outdoors--as you can see from this picture--to \nthe boardroom and spent nearly two decades in finance helping \nbusinesses grow and learning what it takes to succeed in the \nmarketplace.\n  Time and again, Sally has broken the mold to take on tough tasks--\noften in male-dominated industries. When she joined Recreational \nEquipment, Incorporated, the Seattle-based outdoor retailer, it was \nstruggling. But after 8 years with Sally as CEO, REI is now thriving, \ntopping $1 billion in sales, while leading the charge to protect our \nenvironment. And finding that balance--navigating the business world \nwhile keeping REI's commitment to the outdoors--is what will make Sally \ngreat as our next Interior Secretary. Perhaps better than anyone, Sally \nknows that businesses and the environment both benefit when we are \ncommitted to protecting our national parks and promoting our national \ntreasures. At REI, Sally has proven that sustainability and \nresponsibility make sense for the environment and the company's bottom \nline.\n  In Washington State, she has worked closely with me to help create \nthe Wild Sky Wilderness area and expand our other important \nenvironmental protections throughout our State. She has worked with \nindustry and environmentalists to expand recreational opportunities \nthroughout the Northwest and has helped us work toward permanently \nprotecting BLM lands in the San Juan Islands, where my colleague \nSenator Maria Cantwell was at the forefront. That is truly a gem of \nWashington State and has recently been declared a national monument.\n  Sally has backed crucial public-private partnerships that create jobs \nthrough recreation, and she has supported groundbreaking programs to \nget young people involved in the outdoors.\n  So whether it is our forest lands in the Northwest or mineral \ndeposits in the Southwest or oil reserves along our coastlines, Sally \nis going to lead an Interior Department where economic growth and long-\nterm sustainability go hand in hand.\n  I am here today to urge my colleagues to vote in support of Sally \nJewell, and I am really pleased she has been nominated. Again, I thank \nSenator Wyden for all of his work in getting her to this point in this \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues from the Northwest \nwho have come to the floor this afternoon to speak in support of the \nnomination of Sally Jewell as Secretary of the Interior. Like my \ncolleagues from the Northwest, I wish to express how much we appreciate \nher willingness to serve and how proud we are of her legacy and \ninterests in a variety of issues so far.\n  Obviously, the Department of the Interior is so important to us, with \nits broad range of services, including everything from our national \nparks, to wildlife refuge, to offshore drilling lease management, to \nthe important science done by the USGS Service, and many other things. \nIn fact, I read somewhere kind of humorously that the Department of the \nInterior was called the Department of Everything Else.\n  As a nominee, Ms. Jewell came before our committee. I thank her \nfamily for their willingness to support her in her efforts to come to \nWashington, DC, because Sally is the exact type of leadership we need \nat the Department of the Interior. She represents a balanced person who \nnot only knows how to help a growing business, as she did, she has \nserved on the university board of regents and also worked on the \nnonpartisan National Conservation Parks Association. She has done \neverything in business, from dealing with oilfields in Oklahoma to \ncommercial banking to, of late, running REI, one of our most successful \ncompanies in the Pacific Northwest. I know she has the kind of \nleadership it takes to figure out these issues about best use of public \nlands or the vigorous challenges the Department faces when it comes to \nmodernizing the bureaucracy or thinking about climate change at the \nsame time you are talking about deepwater drilling. There are a myriad \nof things we have to forge through, and Sally Jewell is the right \nperson with the right balance to get that done.\n  Having grown up in Washington, where over 40 percent of our lands is \nin public land, I know Sally understands these western issues, whether \nit is water rights or salmon recovery or understanding the impact on \nwater levels, the fire season, wildlife on BLM lands, or the importance \nof access to hunting and fishing. I guarantee, because she grew up \nthere, Sally Jewell understands these issues. I know she has been \ninvolved in many organizations to express that, and that has been a \ngood training ground for her.\n  I am confident, because she is a trained engineer, she is going to \nbring a very pragmatic, can-do attitude to the Interior Department's \nmanagement and problem-solving efforts.\n  I know science will be her compass, and I know she is not going to \nhave an ideological bent, but she is going to have a ``get it done'' \nmentality.\n  Given the importance of the Interior Department's agencies and very \nchallenging mission, I am excited we are going to have somebody with a \nbusiness background and a science background at the Department of the \nInterior.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote today to move Ms. Jewell out of the \nSenate so we can get her into the Department of the Interior so she can \nbegin this important job and continue to move our Nation's agenda \nforward.\n  As the chairwoman of the Indian Affairs Committee I look forward to \nworking with Ms. Jewell on all the issues related to Indian Country as \nwell. There is much to accomplish and much to address. I think her \nbackground is exactly what we need in the Department. I hope my \ncolleagues will move quickly on this issue.\n  I thank the chairman, Senator Wyden, for his leadership in moving her \nnomination through the process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before she leaves I want to thank Senator \nCantwell for all her good work. As northwesterners know, and I hope the \nrest of the country knows, Senator Cantwell is one of those who \nunderstands the opportunity in the great outdoors. I know she is \nclimbing a mountain this summer and is always in shape. She is always \nfit and ready for a mountain.\n  To have the opportunity to work with folks in the Pacific Northwest, \nparticularly with Sally Jewell's background, as the Senator has \neloquently outlined, I think it is going to be an advantage not just \nfor our region but for the rest of our country.\n  I see our colleague from New Mexico is here. If he would like to make \nsome remarks at this point, we welcome him. I have some additional \nremarks as well.\n  Would my colleague from New Mexico like to make any remarks at this \ntime?\n  All right.\n  Let me, then, talk for just a few more minutes about Ms. Jewell and \nsome of the challenges ahead of her, particularly in natural resources. \nObviously, with authorities, as my colleagues have outlined, that range \nfrom managing national parks, to offshore oil and gas development, to \nprotecting fish and wildlife, serving as Secretary of the Interior, it \nis almost like an extreme sport for multitaskers. You are going to have \nto juggle. Ms. Jewell knows a little bit about multitasking, as we have \noutlined, from being a petroleum engineer, a CEO, a conservationist, \nand a banker.\n  Particularly in my part of the world, Oregon, there are some \nespecially important challenges. The Federal Government owns most of \nour land. Particularly in forestry, we need to find a way to bring \ntogether all sides--timber owners, environmentalists, scientists--and \nwe need to go in there and clean out millions and millions of acres of \noverstocked timber stands. We can get that material to the mills. It is \nan ideal source of biomass, a clean source of energy.\n  Because we are working to build relationships with the environmental \ncommunity, we can also find a way to protect old growth as we get to \nharvest\n\n[[Page S2546]]\n\ntimber. But it is, again, not going to happen just by osmosis or \nbecause somebody waves a wand in Washington, DC. It is going to happen \nbecause we have responsible administrators like Sally Jewell who are \ngoing to take the time to learn the checker-board pattern of O lands \nand our local communities, and particularly understand some of our \ntraditions that have worked particularly well in the past and I think \ncan be of great benefit as we look to future solutions.\n  Back in 2000 I had the honor of writing the secure rural schools bill \nand the timber payments bill with our former colleague, Senator Larry \nCraig. What we included in that legislation is the kind of model for \ncollaborative forestry that we are going to see Sally Jewell pick up \non. We established something called resource advisory councils where, \nin effect, on the local level people from the timber industry, people \nfrom the environmental community, scientists, and a whole host of \nothers--frankly, some people who as a general rule had not done much \ntalking to each other, probably done a lot of litigating against each \nother--they would use these resource advisory councils to come together \nand try to find some common ground.\n  It worked. Regarding these resource advisory councils, when I meet \npeople from the timber industry, from any of the extractive industries, \nand environmental folks, they say: Use that model. Use that \ncollaborative model that we are seeing used in timberlands in \nsouthwestern Oregon as a way that we can build on the opportunity to \nbring people together.\n  We have been able to do that with Forest Service lands in eastern \nOregon to some extent. I think we can do it also in western Oregon and \nin the communities that are affected by the Bureau of Land Management \nlands. Probably to do it we are going to have to extend the timber \npayments law for another year to give us the time to come up with a \nlong-term solution. I have talked about this with Sally Jewell in the \npast and about her willingness to see that this is an issue that now \nfinally has to be addressed, addressed in a way that will get the \ntimber harvest up in O lands but also protect our treasures. Our old \ngrowth is some of the very pristine treasures of America. If we do not \nfigure out a way to promote forest health and go in there and thin out \nthese overstocked stands, these fires that we are seeing--they are not \nnatural fires, they are really magnets for infernos because of years \nand years of neglect--are going to continue.\n  I think Sally Jewell is up to the challenge of coming up with the \nkind of policies for the O lands, for the lands in eastern Oregon and \nthose my colleagues talked about in Montana and Colorado and Idaho, and \nI think she is up to that challenge.\n  Before we wrap up today I want to take a few minutes and talk about--\nI know the Presiding Officer has great affection for him as well--our \nformer colleague, Ken Salazar. Ken Salazar has been Secretary of the \nInterior throughout the Obama administration to date. It is my view he \nhas done an exceptional job. I think we all understand in the Senate \nthat when Ken Salazar is involved, get ready for a great smile, an \nenormous amount of energy, enormous amount of intelligence, and someone \nwho, in a very persistent way, is interested in solving problems. Ken \nSalazar has sure done that in a number of important areas.\n  For example, before Ken Salazar took office--I am looking at a \nheadline from when there was a huge scandal at the Department of the \nInterior. I am looking at an article from the fall of 2008 headlined, \n``Sex, Drug Use and Graft Cited In The Interior Department.''\n\n  Basically, what it talks about is an investigation, a number of \nreports delivered by the inspector general, that basically document, at \nthe Department of the Interior, a culture of lax ethics. It basically \ndescribes something like a dozen current and former employees of the \nMinerals Management Service, an agency that collected at that time \nbillions of dollars of royalties annually--you basically had an \n``anything goes'' kind of environment, and the reports go on and on. It \nfeels more like a litany for a late-night television show.\n  The reports focused on a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity \nin what was the Service's royalty and in-kind program--essentially, \nofficials who seemed to be exempt from expense accounts limits, one \nethical lapse after another, as documented in these reports. I remember \nat the hearing, the confirmation hearing, Senator Salazar--it was \nunusual because he had been my seatmate over the years at the Senate \nEnergy Committee--I said: Senator Salazar, you have to go in there and \ndrain the swamp at the Minerals Management Service.\n  In fact, he certainly did that. Essentially, the successor agency has \nbeen free of scandal. I think that is representative of both the \nintegrity and professionalism that Secretary Salazar has brought to the \nagency.\n  Also, I note after the gulf spill he overhauled the offshore drilling \npractices, ensured that they were beefed up in terms of safety while at \nthe same time allowing for the drilling that is so important to the \nindustry.\n  I am also going to reflect on Secretary Salazar's accomplishments, \nmention that he has done yeoman work in terms of promoting green and \nrenewable energy. I note in one of the comments about his departure \nthat Christy Goldfuss, Public Lands Director at the Center for American \nProgress, stated Secretary Salazar championed ``a new model of \nconservation which focused on partnerships with private land owners and \nStates'' and ``that approach has paid off with cooperatives in the \nEverglades in Florida, the Prairie Potholes region of the Dakotas, and \nother areas.''\n  I would like to note something else as well about Secretary Salazar. \nI know Senators on both sides of the aisle would call him when they had \nthose kinds of resource questions. I know Senator Murkowski brought up \none of Secretary Salazar's final acts in office today. Under his \nleadership the State of Idaho and the Fish and Wildlife Service entered \ninto an arrangement so that the State of Idaho's plan for addressing \nthe sage grouse could be implemented. I know this is a critical issue \nfor Senator Risch. He and I talked about it often. I am going to work \nwith him on these issues, and what Secretary Salazar did today is an \nexample of the new kind of partnership that we all are looking to the \nInterior Department and the states for, and certainly something I want \nto promote, and I know Senator Murkowski shares that view.\n  I think it is fair to say that Sally Jewell has very large boots to \nfill. We all remember Secretary Salazar's wonderful western boots and \nthe anecdotes about them. She has certainly got a challenge to try to \nstep in after a Secretary who has accomplished so much. But as I and \nSenator Murkowski and the Washington Senators have outlined today, we \nbelieve strongly that Sally Jewell is up to this challenge. I hope she \nwill receive a resounding vote in the Senate. I believe we are close to \nthe point where we will be able to vote on Ms. Jewell.\n  For all the reasons that I and my colleagues have outlined this \nafternoon, I hope there will be very strong bipartisan support for Ms. \nJewell when we vote.\n  With that I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for a \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent all remaining time \non the Jewell nomination be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time \nis yielded back.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Sarah Jewell, of Washington, to be Secretary of the Interior?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S2547]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, tomorrow at 11 o'clock we are going to vote \non cloture on the motion to proceed to the gun legislation that is now \nbefore this body.\n  This morning and throughout the day, our friend from Connecticut \nspoke, a freshman Senator who was brought to the Senate with this \ntragedy having taken place shortly after he arrived. My friend the \nPresiding Officer, a longtime attorney general, the chief law \nenforcement officer of the State of Connecticut, has lived with this \ntragedy that happened at Sandy Hook like nothing that ever happened in \nhis career. And, of course, for Senator Heinrich, a new Senator, this \nwas something he never appreciated he would be faced with.\n  I saw the pictures today of those little babies who were murdered, \nsome of them shot multiple times--little tiny kids shot multiple times. \nThe shooting was on December 14, about 4 months ago--120 days. So the \ntime has come--it has arrived--when we have to debate this issue. We \nhave to have a response to this tragedy.\n  When this incident took place on December 14, it struck me, as it did \neveryone in America--virtually everyone in America; we had been through \nAurora, CO--that vicious, brutal machine-gunning of people going to \nwatch a movie, and then little kids getting killed in an elementary \nschool, kindergartners, first-graders--so we need to respond, this \ngreat deliberative body, to what the American people want. So we are \ngoing to vote. It is time to vote. I hope we get cloture on this \nmatter. We certainly should. After that, there is no reason not to \nstart legislating immediately. I hope we do not have to go through this \nprocedural mishmash--30 hours; somebody on the floor all the time; if \npeople are not, there are dilatory tactics; only one quorum call--and \nall this. Let's get past that. If somebody has something to say, come \nand say it. But this week we are going to start legislating. We are \ngoing to start legislating whether there is cloture or not. One will be \na little longer process. But we are going to start legislating on this \nbill this week. I hope we can get to it tomorrow.\n  I do not think it is any secret, if we are on this bill, I am going \nto--the first amendment in order will be the amendment to change the \nbackground checks that has been worked on for weeks by Senator Manchin, \nSenator Kirk, and Senator Toomey, and then we will decide where we go \nfrom there.\n  To all my friends, we are going to have amendments. Some of them are \ngoing to take a little bit of time. We are not going to finish the bill \nthis week. I do not know if we will finish it next week. But that \nreally does not matter. Are we going to legislate the right way? Are we \ngoing to legislate? I have in my mind these little children who were \nmurdered. What we do here is not going to prevent all gun violence in \nAmerica, but if we stop a few, isn't that remarkably important for us \nto do? I think we can do a lot more than saving the lives of just a few \npeople.\n  But let's work on this bill. We are going to start. If we have to use \nup the 30 hours, we will use up the 30 hours. I think there are ways \naround that procedurally. I hope we do not have to test that. There are \na number of amendments. We all know. We have been reading about them. \nThere are lots of amendments; people have been waiting a long time for \nthis legislation.\n  One of my Republican colleagues yesterday said: I have a number of \ngermane amendments I want to offer.\n  I said: Fine. Good. Do it.\n  We know we have to do background checks, assault weapons, the \nammunition capacity of clips or magazines, mental health. That is just \nto name a few of the things. And I repeat, we are going to begin this \nprocess before we leave here this week.\n  I so appreciate the work done by Senators Manchin, Toomey, Kirk, and \nmany others. My friend Senator Schumer has been working on this issue. \nMy friend Dick Durbin, who has been involved in guns for a long time, \nhas been involved. I appreciate the work of everyone. As the press has \nindicated, we are likely going to get cloture on this tomorrow. I hope \nso. But, as I have told individual Senators, if we do not get cloture, \nwe are going to have a vote in the Senate on capacity clips, assault \nweapons, background checks, and some mental health items or item. That \nwe are going to do. I hope we can do it in the regular process.\n  We have had people for a long time now--my friends on the other side \nof the aisle--saying: We want regular order. We want to be able to \noffer amendments. Well, I do too. And I hope people will not see how \nmany amendments they can offer, not see if they can set a record for \nhow many amendments can be laid down, because we should have this as a \ncivil process and culminating in a better set of laws for our people in \nthis great country in which we live.\n  For those of us who have the opportunity to try to address this \nissue, I hope we all understand that the world is watching what we do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Sri Srinivasan\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon I had the \nopportunity, the honor, to chair a hearing of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, on which we both serve, to consider the President's \nnomination of a highly qualified lawyer, Sri Srinivasan, to serve on \nthe DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I am encouraged by what the majority leader has just said about the \nvery real possibility that we will get a vote on the floor of this \nSenate on vital and important issues affecting guns, immigration, and \nother issues, but what I speak to today is the absolutely essential \nrole this Senate must fill of voting on qualified judges who have been \nnominated to the circuit courts of the United States.\n  Earlier today at this hearing, 10 of our colleagues, Republicans and \nDemocrats, asked thoughtful questions, and Mr. Srinivasan gave thorough \nand thoughtful answers. I came away convinced that he has the \nbackground, the education, the skills, and, most importantly, the \ntemperament to serve as a circuit court judge. And I was encouraged by \ncomments of my colleagues, both Republican and Democratic, that they \ntoo were inclined to support this nomination.\n  Under normal historical circumstances, today's hearing would be the \nbeginning of a deliberate, timely, orderly process--a process required \nof this body by article II, section 2 of our Constitution by which we \nadvise and consent to the President's nominations.\n\n[[Page S2548]]\n\n  We should, of course, carefully consider the qualifications of \ncandidates and not serve as some rubberstamp, but neither should we be \na firewall blocking qualified nominees from serving. Unfortunately, for \nsome number of years, this Senate has, in some vital instances, served \nmore as a firewall than as an advise and consent body. Instead of doing \nour due diligence with appropriate speed, we have seen delays, stalling \ntactics, and in some instances filibusters of highly qualified \nnominees.\n  Five years into President Obama's administration, the courts are \nstill nearly 10 percent vacant. In my view, our courts should be above \npolitics. When the President of either party submits a highly qualified \ncandidate of good character and sound legal mind, absent exceptional \ncircumstances, that candidate is entitled to a vote.\n  The actions or in this case inaction of the Senate with regard to the \nDC Circuit have consequences. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals has a \nseries of vacancies, the result of which, in my view, are to delay and \ndeny justice for Americans far beyond the boundaries of this District \nof Columbia.\n  The DC Circuit Court is often called the second most important in the \nNation, because, like the Supreme Court, it handles cases that impact \nAmericans all over our country. Regularly, it hears cases on issues \nranging from terrorism and detention to the scope of Federal agency \npower. Yet it is critically understaffed. This circuit court has not \nseen a nominee confirmed since President George W. Bush's fourth \nnominee to that court was confirmed in 2006. Today, more than 1,500 \ndays after President Obama has taken office, 4 of the 11 seats on the \nDC Circuit are open, making it more than one-third vacant and putting \nthe remaining judges under undue strain to decide the complex and \nimportant cases before this court.\n  Contrary to the previous administration, this administration was \nrecently recognized by the New York Times Editorial Board as putting \nforward nominees who are decidedly moderate. President Obama first \nnominated for this vacancy on this court the exceptionally qualified \nCaitlin Halligan, who waited more than 900 days for a simple up-or-down \nvote on the floor of this Chamber. She came with the American Bar \nAssociation's highest rating, glowing recommendations from bipartisan \nsupporters, and a diverse legal career marked by distinctive service as \nNew York's solicitor general. Nevertheless, sadly, Republican Senators \nsuccessfully filibustered her nomination, and last month President \nObama reluctantly withdrew Ms. Halligan from consideration.\n  We have today a chance for a fresh start with Mr. Srinivasan, who \nwould serve equally well and ably on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. \nAs he demonstrated in today's hearing, he has a sharp and capable legal \nmind. He has served in the Solicitor General's office for both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations. He has served in the private \nsector and the public sector and has earned bipartisan support from \nthose who have worked with him.\n  In fact, he has been endorsed publicly in a letter from 12 former \nSolicitors General and Principal Deputy Solicitors General, six \nDemocrats, six Republicans, for those who have served in Democratic and \nRepublican administrations.\n  The letter, signed by conservative legal luminaries such as Paul \nClement and Ted Olson, notes Mr. Srinivasan is ``one of the best \nappellate lawyers in the country,'' with an ``unsurpassed'' work ethic \nwho is ``extremely well prepared to take on the intellectual rigors of \nserving on the D.C. Circuit.''\n  At the same time, throughout the course of his career in private \npractice and as a public servant, he has represented clients with \ncauses diverse enough that any individual policymaker or elected \nofficial is likely to disagree with some of them, including me. I \ndisagree with a position he argued in Rumsfeld v. Padilla in support of \nthe idea that the government has a right to detain U.S. citizens \nindefinitely, but I do not ascribe that position to him.\n  One of the most foundational principles of our legal system is that \nwe do not ascribe to the attorney the position which he successfully \nand vigorously advocates on behalf of his client. I will not block his \nnomination simply because I might disagree with the position he took on \nbehalf of a client in one case.\n  Sri, in my view, is a highly capable attorney, with the character and \ndemeanor to serve on the bench. I will strongly support his nomination. \nI am following in this instance the wisdom of Chief Justice Roberts, \nwho has said: ``It's a tradition of the American Bar that goes back \nbefore the founding of our nation that lawyers are not identified with \nthe positions of their clients.''\n  So I say to my colleagues, let's move forward in that spirit. Let's \nreturn to our historic constitutionally mandated role. Let's give Mr. \nSrinivasan a speedy up-or-down vote, which I believe he has earned with \ndecades of public service and public sector experience.\n  To be honest, if this nomination cannot move forward, if this \nnomination is filibustered for what can only be political reasons, I \ncannot imagine what nomination could move forward to this court. A \nfilibuster of this nomination would sadly prove to me, just as it did \nto those of the other party in 2005, that the judicial nomination \nstandards and procedures at work are unworkable, the system is broken, \nand it would lead to a reconsideration.\n  There was a crisis of this sort when the parties were of opposite \nconfiguration in 2005 that led the majority to threaten the so-called \nnuclear option to end judicial filibusters by the party in which I \nserve, a result that was avoided only at the last moment for the good \nof the Senate and the Nation. I urge my colleagues to come together to \ngive this good man a vote and avoid another such crisis today.\n  Let's do our job so the judges of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals can \ndo theirs for the people of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                         GAO Duplication Report\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would note to my colleague from the \nState of Delaware, if I heard him correctly, we just now have had a \nhearing on a nominee for the DC Circuit Court. He is not even on the \nExecutive Calendar because he has not even been voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee. So the Senator makes a lot of great points. But I \nthink the fact we are talking about a potential judge who has not even \ncleared the Judiciary Committee yet may be a bit premature.\n  He will get a fair hearing. I think we have noted that more judicial \nnominees were approved in the last two Congresses than the two \nCongresses before under the last 4 years of the Bush administration.\n  I rise to say this evening there has been a lot in the news. One \nthing that has not been in the news very much is the third and final \nreport of the Government Accountability Office in terms of looking at \nduplication within the Federal Government.\n  I hope as the American people listen to this, they will take a couple \nthings away. No. 1, we have a great organization called the Government \nAccountability Office. They have done a wonderful job. We mandated this \n4 years ago. They have been on time with their reports. What they have \nshown us has been tremendously revealing. The first thing I want \nAmericans to note is Congress has failed to act on the first two \nreports--no substantive action whatsoever.\n  One significant thing in the Senate was the elimination of the \nethanol mandate. With this report today comes an estimated $98 billion \na year in savings. What we take by looking at this report could \npotentially yield us $98 billion in savings by eliminating duplication \nin what they just found in this one report.\n  Let me go through it for 1 minute. They found 679 different renewable \nenergy programs across 23 agencies--not across the Energy Department. \nIf we are going to have renewable programs, that is where we should \nhave it. Across 23 different agencies of which we spend $15 billion a \nyear, they found instances where we are giving grants from different \nagencies to the same projects for the same thing, spending three times \nas much money as we should be spending on the one project even if we \ndid not have that.\n  So the potential for us to work our way out of the consequences of \nthe sequester is at our fingertips. Here, drug\n\n[[Page S2549]]\n\nabuse prevention and treatment, 76 separate programs, not run through \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, run through 10 different \ndepartments with overlap that shows no metrics but multiple agencies \nhaving programs doing exactly the same thing: $4.5 billion a year. That \nis half the size of my Oklahoma State budget a year.\n  Catfish inspection. I saw in the President's budget today three \ndifferent agencies where one has to meet the requirements before they \ncan have their catfish inspected. The only thing they did not recommend \nin the budget today is getting rid of the Agriculture Department. They \napprove your cheese pizza. But the FDA approves your pepperoni pizza. \nSo if you are a pizza maker, you have to comply with one agency on one \ntype of pizza and another agency on a different type of pizza.\n  Defense foreign language support. Those are people who come in and \nhelp us learn other languages, interpret for us other languages so we \ncan have an effective response and not have a communication error. We \nhave 159 different programs in the Pentagon alone. What they are \nestimating is that we could save tons of money. We do not know exactly \nhow much it costs because the Pentagon does not know how much they are \nspending on it, which is another one of the problems.\n  The GAO report said this week one of the reasons they cannot estimate \nthe savings more accurately is because the majority of the agencies \nhave no idea what they are spending on these programs. The question I \nhave had is, why not? If they do not know what they are spending, why \nare we not doing something about it?\n  Higher education assistance: 21 different programs, four different \nagencies--not all in the Education Department, which is from where I \nthink we would do education assistance, $174.7 billion a year. That \nincludes Pell grants. That includes student loans, the cost associated \nwith student loans.\n  Veterans employment training. We have six programs, not all of them \nrun by the Veterans Affairs Department but run by the Veterans Affairs \nDepartment and other agencies. We are spending $1.2 billion. Here is \nwhat we know. We are running these programs, and veterans unemployment, \neven though they have a skill when they come out of the military, is \nhigher than what the average is in the country. So it is obviously not \nworking.\n  Also, in the report is something that is very important to me. Let me \nfind it, if I might for a moment. GAO's report exposes a government \noffice that does some good things. It is called the National Technical \nInformation Service. It was established in 1950 and tasked with \ncollecting and distributing certain reports. Despite the fact--here is \nwhat GAO found: 75 percent of the information that NTIS supplies, all \nyou have to do is Google it. You do not have to go to NTIS. All you \nhave to do is Google it. So 75 percent of their budget is spent \nproviding reports to other government agencies and other people that \nyou can get with the touch of your iPhone. Why would we continue to do \nthat?\n  This is just one example that I bring up. We are continuing to fund \nan agency where three-quarters of what they do has no bearing on it. If \nit went away, it would not affect us at all. The other thing is they \ncharge other Federal agencies a fee for this information that the other \nFederal agencies, at a touch of their computer, can get for free.\n  It is another case of inefficiency. What else did the GAO report \nshow? What the GAO report showed is that we have done nothing of \nsignificance in the last 2 years based on what they have recommended we \ndo given their first two reports. Our office calculates, based on the \nthree reports that GAO has given us, that we could save in excess of \n$250 billion a year if we would follow the recommendations of the \nGovernment Accountability Office.\n  If you are sitting out there wondering why we are having tax \nproposals increased in the President's budget and that we are having \nsuch a hard time with the sequester, you only have to look at one \nplace; that is, Congress. Congress refuses to follow and do the \noversight. We have had GAO do a lot of it. We refuse to pass amendments \nthat eliminate duplication. We refuse to make the tough choices. So, \nconsequently, we are spending $250 billion a year--that is $2.5 \ntrillion over 10 years--that we should not be spending.\n  Where does the money come from to pay for that? It comes from our \nkids. It doesn't just come in dollars, it comes from a reduced standard \nof living and limited opportunities in the future because we don't have \nthe courage or the work ethic to address the very real issues which are \nin front us, on the tips of our fingers, where the money is, where we \ncould actually save money.\n  We have had almost 1,000 days since the first report came out. We \nhave done one significant thing in the Senate; we have eliminated the \nethanol tax credit and saved $6 billion the first year and about $4 to \n$5 billion afterward. This is the one thing we did. We fought tooth and \nnail while we did it, but we did it.\n  This is one bill to save $6 billion in 3 years out of $250 billion. \nNo wonder the confidence level in the Congress is at 13 percent. What \nwe are actually doing is throwing away our kids' future as we fail to \naddress these issues.\n  When we are spending money we don't have on things we don't \nabsolutely need, and we are borrowing money against our children's \nfuture, I can't think of a greater immoral act of the Congress. It is \nnot red hot lit up as some of the more controversial issues such as the \ngun bill we are doing or immigration; however, I will state it will \nhave a profound effect if we were to address it in terms of the future \nof our country, the health of our country, and the job-creating \ncapacity for our country.\n  Yet what is it about your Senator or your Congressman which keeps \nthem from having the courage to challenge the status quo? I know what \nit is. It is the desire to get reelected by not offending anybody.\n  We don't have tough oversight hearings. We will not allow bills \nthrough committees which actually eliminate waste. There is a bill that \nhas passed the House sitting on the docket right now called the SKILLS \nAct. It takes 47 job-training programs and puts them into 6. It saves \nbillions of dollars a year and puts metrics on the outcome. We will not \neven bring it to the floor even though it saves $5 to $6 billion a year \nin addition to markedly improving the outcome of our job-training \nprograms. It is not here.\n  It passed the House. The House is doing oversight in every committee \nright now. The Senate is not.\n  The House is reading the GAO reports and acting on them. They are not \nright 100 percent of the time, they are right about 95 percent of the \ntime. Nothing is going to be done about it unless we have an oversight \nhearing to actually discover information. Nothing actually happens \nunless we write a bill to change things.\n  Yet this is not the emphasis in the Senate. There can be no greater \nemphasis than for us to get out of the financial troubles we are in. \nThere can be no greater emphasis than for us to create an environment \nwhich produces jobs in the country when we stop wasting money at the \nFederal Government level.\n  Our answer is more government--not less, more. Our answer, according \nto the President's budget, is more taxes, not less.\n  I commend the President. He has $25 billion worth of programs he \nwishes to eliminate in his budget, $25.8 billion. He could send over \nwhat the GAO said and eliminate $250 billion a year.\n  The problems are not really with the President, it is with us: our \nintransigence to do our job and keep in our focal point what is most \nimportant. What is most important is our future and the capability for \nus to create opportunity in the future for our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  I have been fighting this for 8 years. There is a lot of oversight \nwhich has been done, tons of reports. The American people are going to \neventually learn everything that is in this report because there is an \napp coming out which will be on people's cell phones very soon, and \nthey may find out anything about everything where the government is \nwasting money. They will be able to look at an address in their own \ncity and see how much money a company, business, or that farmer \nreceived from their Federal tax dollars. They will be able to see that \nin about 3 months.\n  When the American people discover our incompetence, it will not \nmatter\n\n[[Page S2550]]\n\nthat we didn't offend somebody. They are going to see we didn't do our \njob. We are not doing our job because we are not addressing the things \nwe actually have some control over.\n  What do we do now? Here is what GAO explains: Although Congress had \nmade some limited progress in addressing the issues we have previously \nidentified, additional steps are needed to address the remaining areas \nto achieve associated benefits. A number of the issues are difficult \nbut not impossible. Implementing many of the actions will take time and \nsustained leadership.\n  The key word there is ``leadership.'' Who is going to lead in the \nSenate to solve our problems? It is not party identified. Real \nleadership about solving the real problem is in front of us.\n  It is time for each congressional committee in the Senate to \nundertake the waste and overlap identified by GAO within their \njurisdiction, begin writing bills to consolidate and eliminate these \nprograms, and put metrics as far as performance on every one of them. \nIt is also time for the White House to put real muscle into their \nproposal coming in through OMB.\n  I am thankful we will have a new OMB Director. She will be terrific. \nShe has the skills, dedication, and qualifications. I praise the \nPresident for nominating her. She will fly through the Senate because \nshe is superqualified for the job. Also, she knows what she is doing. \nBut it will not matter what she does if we don't respond, if we don't \ndo our work.\n\n\n                              Gun Control\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take the time now just to spend a \nmoment or two on the guns issue.\n  I spent a lot of time over the last few months thinking about Sandy \nHook. I actually met with a large number of those people today. I am an \nA-plus-rated member, a lifetime member of the NRA. I firmly believe in \nthe second amendment, and I firmly believe in the tenth amendment.\n  We are hearing a lot of politics about the gun situation. What we are \nnot hearing is how do we really keep guns out of the hands of people \nwho shouldn't have them. This is what we need to be addressing.\n  Whether this would prevent a Sandy Hook, nobody knows. There are some \nthings we do know. What we do know is the vast majority of people who \nare convicted the first time of a gun crime didn't steal their gun, and \nthey didn't buy it from a federally licensed firearm dealer. They \nbought it from one of us.\n\n  The very fact we are going to have a piece of legislation go through \nhere which will not solve the real problem of keeping guns out of the \nhands of the mentally impaired and felons is a shame. There are ways we \ncan do that.\n  I haven't spoken to one owner I know who hasn't agreed with the fact \nthat they would like to know if they sold their gun--they don't want it \nto go into the hands of a felon or somebody mentally impaired. Yet we \nare hung up on records. The proposal which comes from Senator Toomey, \nSenator Manchin, and Senator Kirk is a step forward. I will not deny \nit. However, tell me how a record which will only be looked at after a \ncrime is committed is going to help anybody who is a victim of a crime. \nIt is not.\n  If we really wish to solve this problem, what we need to do is put \ninto the hands of Americans who are law abiding the ability to know \nthey didn't sell their gun to somebody who is on the NTIS list. Give me \nthe ability to know when I sell my gun to a stranger that they are not \non that NTIS list.\n  This has been rejected out of hand because there is no record with \nit. The reason there doesn't need to be a record is because we are \nputting an onus on responsible citizens doing the right thing. Also, \nthe government has no right to have a record of when I transfer a gun. \nThey do have a right to expect me to be a responsible citizen when I \nsell my gun.\n  The question is, Are we as a body going to take something which is \nfar less than appropriate to actually keep guns out of the hands of \nfelons and mentally impaired and call it a day? This is what is getting \nready to happen. Are we going to make a difference and not impair \nsecond amendment rights at all and not impair tenth amendment rights \nbecause we give States supremacy on that? If they want to give us \nsomething more or different, they may.\n  We are going to go through a great deal of debate and have all these \namendments. I thank Senator Reid for making it an open amendment \nprocess. I called and spoke to him last night. I said I was happy to \nsupport going to this bill provided we use the regular Senate \nprocedures and we actually are able to offer amendments which are \ngermane to this bill in any number of ways. He is going to allow this \nprocess. I take him at his word he will allow this.\n  When it is all said and done, will we have made a difference to those \nfamilies who are wanting us to make a difference? Would we have made a \ndifference?\n  If we don't allow responsible citizens the ability to know whether \nthey are selling their gun to a felon or a mentally impaired person, we \nhaven't made any difference. We have made a lot of noise, but we \nhaven't made a difference.\n  Let me tell you why the Toomey-Manchin proposal will not work. The \nlargest gun show in America is in Tulsa, OK. It is called the \nWanenmacher Gun Show. Tens of thousands of people come to it twice, \nmaybe three times a year. The sale will be impeded by requiring an FFL \nlicense, which is to say a gun dealer at the show will be required to \ndo a background search against the NTIS list for somebody who purchases \na gun at the show whether they are buying from that dealer or not.\n  The first thing which will happen is the Federal firearms licensed \ndealer will say: I want a fee for transferring this gun, for doing the \nwork--and rightly so. I don't blame him. What is the option?\n  The option which will happen is the people who are going to make the \ndeal buy the gun. Subsequently, 2 or 3 days after the gun show, they \nwill buy the gun because they will not be at the gun show anymore.\n  Look at the opposite side of that. If we had a portal or we could get \na certificate which says someone is not on the NTIS list and are able \nto buy a gun anytime, anywhere, somebody selling a gun would have a pin \ncode to make sure their identity is correct and see their ID. Whether a \nperson is in a gun show or outside a gun show, the responsible gun \nseller will know they didn't sell a gun to somebody mentally impaired \nor a felon.\n  We will have all sorts of statements, but what we are going to do \nisn't going to decrease guns in the hands of felons and the mentally \nimpaired. We can say we need to win. If we want a bill to get through \nthe Senate and get through the House which will actually make a \ndifference in people's lives, that felons and the mentally impaired \naren't empowered to buy guns, we need to do something different.\n  My friends in the second amendment community don't even like my \nproposal. I understand this. But there is no impairment when all you \nneed to do is go to your cell phone to receive a clearance to know \nsomebody is not on the NTIS list.\n  We get to decide. Are we going to do it in a way which smells good, \nlooks good, but doesn't do anything? Are we going to fight to do \nsomething which actually makes a difference? I hope we choose the \nlatter. I am not convinced we will. The reason Senator Manchin couldn't \nget me to agree to what he had agreed to with Senator Toomey is because \nI don't think it is going to work. I think the vast majority of gun \npurchasers at gun shows are going to wait to buy them later from the \nvery same people who were going to sell them at a gun show so they do \nnot have to pay a fee and wait 3 or 4 days on a background check. If \nthat happens, what good have we done? How have we made a difference? We \nhaven't.\n\n  It is a sad fact, as a practicing physician, and having done training \nand surgery, I have had to operate on a lot of people who ended up with \nthe consequences of a weapon being used on them.\n  Oklahoma has a gun culture, and I own multiple guns. I cherish my \nsecond amendment right. But with that right comes some responsibility \nto do the right thing. Liberty without responsibility isn't liberty, \nand it will not last unless we attach responsibility to it. So if we \nreally believe in the second amendment, and if we really believe in the \ntenth amendment, we will relook at what we are going to do in terms of\n\n[[Page S2551]]\n\ngun transfers. There is a way to do it that will actually make a big \ndifference in people's lives in this country, and it may actually get \nthrough the House.\n  What we are proposing, what we are seeing proposed right now, is \nnever going to pass the House. Consequently, we will have done \nsomething in the Senate with no long-term consequences and actually \nmaking a difference for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for the time. I yield \nthe floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Margaret Thatcher\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who passed \naway Monday.\n  In the 1970s, Britain was mired in debt and even had to go to the IMF \nfor a bailout. Britain was known then as ``The Sick Man of Europe''--\nhow we think of Greece today.\n  Governments of both political parties had tried to stimulate the \neconomy through Keynesian spending policies and government intervention \ninto the economy was widespread.\n  Britain faced massive strikes in the winter of 1978-1979, known as \nthe Winter of Discontent. There was talk that Britain had become \nungovernable.\n  Then Margaret Thatcher came on the scene. Her policies of fiscal \nresponsibility and promotion of ``free enterprise'' completely reversed \nBritain's economic decline. Her foreign policy achievements were no \nless impressive. This was the era of detente.\n  Most people accepted that the Soviet Union was strong and successful \nand was here to stay so we had to learn to live with it. It was \nfashionable for political leaders to talk as though the Soviet system \nwas just different, but no better or worse than our own.\n  Margaret Thatcher had no hesitation in pointing out the truth that \nthe Soviet Union and its satellites held their citizens in bondage and \nshe encouraged dissidents who sought freedom. In fact, it was a speech \nin 1976 when she was still just leader of the opposition in which she \nwarned about the Soviet military buildup that caused a Soviet army \nnewspaper to coin her nickname the ``Iron Lady.''\n  Together with President Reagan, she sought every opportunity to \nundermine the Soviet system until it collapsed. If this doesn't sound \nlike a bold position today, it is only because Reagan and Thatcher were \nproven so profoundly right that everyone now claims to have always \nagreed.\n  I should also note that there is a temptation for many people \nremembering Mrs. Thatcher's legacy to note that she was the first \nfemale prime minister of the United Kingdom. While this is a \nsignificant historical fact, to mention it as though it was one of her \nmost important accomplishments comes off as patronizing.\n  Margaret Thatcher rejected the identity politics that is so popular \ntoday. She said:\n\n       I've always believed that what matters in politics, as in \n     the rest of life, isn't who you are or where you come from, \n     but what you believe and what you want to do with your life. \n     What matters are your convictions.\n\n  Because of her convictions and because she acted on those \nconvictions, she restored Britain's economy, national spirit, and \ninternational reputation. Millions of people around the world now live \nin peace and freedom thanks in large part to her efforts. As a result, \nMargaret Thatcher is unquestionably one of the most significant leaders \nof the 20th century.\n  Mrs. Thatcher's legacy shouldn't simply be relegated to history \nthough. We have a lot to learn from her today. As the President submits \nhis overdue budget this week, I would ask my colleagues to ponder this \nquote by Margaret Thatcher:\n\n       If spending money like water was the answer to our \n     country's problems, we would have no problems now. If ever a \n     nation has spent, spent, spent and spent again, ours has. \n     Today that dream is over. All of that money has got us \n     nowhere but it still has to come from somewhere.\n       Those who urge us to relax the squeeze, to spend yet more \n     money indiscriminately in the belief that it will help the \n     unemployed and the small businessman, are not being kind--or \n     compassionate--or caring. They are not the friends of the \n     unemployed or the small business. They are asking us to do \n     again the very thing that caused the problems in the first \n     place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, are we in a period of morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the motion to proceed at this \npoint.\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. I thought so. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \nSenate proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted \nto speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/10/senate-section/article/S2551-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2551-S2552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INAUGURATION OF JOE BERTOLINO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont is a \nspecial place. In a State that abounds in natural beauty, the Kingdom, \nas many Vermonters affectionately call the State's northeast corner, is \nheralded for its rural splendor. While the rural character and \nunspoiled landscape is what defines the Kingdom to many, it is also \nhome to an academic institution that has educated Vermonters for more \nthan 100 years.\n  Since its founding in 1911, Lyndon State College has served as an \neconomic engine for the region, educating students in a diverse range \nof academic pursuits. Lyndon has distinguished itself by developing \nacademic programs that mirror the emerging economic needs of the \ncommunity, such as its first-of-its-kind Mountain Recreation Management \nprogram. At the same time, Lyndon remains committed to a liberal arts \neducation and educating students to be well-rounded professionals.\n  On Friday, April 19, Lyndon State will inaugurate its fifteenth \npresident, Joe Bertolino. Joe comes to Vermont from Hunter College in \nNew York, where he served as vice president for enrollment management \nand academic affairs. Joe's passion for working with students is \nevident in his easygoing manner and in how he has engaged students \nsince arriving on campus last summer. At a college of only 1,400 \nstudents, Joe's personal touch sets the clear tone that under his \nleadership Lyndon will be a student-centered institution. Joe has \nundertaken a number of creative initiatives to build community spirit \namong Lyndon students and alumni, including an informal policy called \n``Go Green, Go Gold,'' that encourages the Lyndon State community to \nwear the school colors on Wednesdays.\n  Beyond this personal approach, Joe has laid out an ambitious plan for \nthe college's future. I have had the opportunity to meet Joe during a \nrecent visit to Washington and am encouraged to welcome his energy and \ncreative thinking to Vermont. Lyndon State College is a vital part of \nVermont's higher education community, and I wish Joe the best as he is \nofficially inaugurated as the college's next president.\n  I request unanimous consent that an article from Lyndon State about \nPresident Bertolino be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Loving Lyndon\n\n                           (By Leon Thompson)\n\n           [From the Lyndon State College Twin Tower Topics]\n\n       To the director of YMCA Camp Ockanickon, Joe Bertolino--an \n     accordion-playing member of his high school debate team in \n     New Jersey--didn't seem so suited for counseling other geeks. \n     Not at first.\n       ``Do you hike?'' the director asked. ``No,'' Joe said. \n     ``Swim?'' ``No.'' ``Boat?'' ``No.'' ``Arts and crafts?'' \n     ``Maybe.''\n       The director wondered, ``Is there anything you do?'' ``I \n     get along with people,'' Joe said. ``That's when my life \n     began,'' Dr. Joseph Bertolino said this fall, a week after \n     delivering Lyndon State College's State of the College \n     Address, as the fifteenth president. ``To me, the meaning of \n     life is relationships, and leadership is all about \n     relationships.''\n\n[[Page S2552]]\n\n       Joe, 49, officially succeeded Interim President Steve Gold \n     on July 1; LSC offered Joe the position in February. For \n     months, Joe traveled between Queens College, in New York \n     City, where he was vice president for enrollment management \n     and student affairs, and LSC, as part of his transition. Joe \n     began his LSC tenure with a 100-day listening tour that \n     involved the College and Northeast Kingdom communities. He \n     has represented LSC twice in the nation's capital, and during \n     his October 4 State of the College Address--preceded by a \n     short, Chaplin-esque silent film about him--he rode into \n     Academic & Student Activity Center, room 100 on his bike, \n     donning a suit, and conveyed a clear message to 200 students, \n     faculty, and staff.\n       ``At Lyndon State College, students come first.'' Joe \n     called the state of the college ``excellent.'' Enrollment is \n     up, the budget is balanced--with a surplus--and LSC has five \n     new faculty and 15 new staff members and administrators this \n     year.\n       ``Every student has said to me, without fail, `Joe, I love \n     it here,' '' he told his audience. Joe aims to bolster \n     internal and external communications at LSC. His lengthy to-\n     do list contains a new public relations campaign, with a \n     focus on social media, and he wants to erase the off-campus \n     community's perception of LSC as ``Harvard on the hill'' by \n     continuing to build strong partnerships in the Northeast \n     Kingdom.\n       He said LSC is a key stakeholder in Jay Peak Resort's plans \n     to invest $500 million in the region over the next decade--a \n     plan that could mean more internships for LSC students and \n     jobs for graduates.\n       ``Lyndon State College is the college of the Northeast \n     Kingdom,'' Joe said. Joe has also started an electronic \n     suggestion box--``Joe Wants to Know''--where anyone can post \n     anonymous concerns and comments. During his one-hour speech, \n     Joe posed challenges to alums: $1 million for an all-weather \n     athletic field, and $1 million for a new version of the old \n     Vail towers. ``The response from our alumni has been great,'' \n     he said.\n       Joe also asked faculty and staff to increase their in-house \n     contributions, and he imposed a lighthearted, non-mandatory \n     policy called ``Go Green, Go Gold,'' where he asks the campus \n     community to wear LSC colors each Wednesday. ``If you haven't \n     figured it out by now,'' he said, after dismounting his bike, \n     before his speech, ``I like to have fun. Life is too short, \n     and the world is complicated enough.''\n       ``I believe I am where I'm supposed to be, and I believe \n     I'll be where I'm supposed to be,'' he said. ``It's been a \n     long time since I've been in a place where I felt I haven't \n     belonged.''\n       Days later, while in his office--``a beautiful corner of \n     the world,'' he said--Joe called himself a motivated, goal \n     oriented Type A personality that leads by surrounding himself \n     with the talent to implement his vision. He is a foodie, a \n     Lion King fan, and textbook introvert who usually recharges \n     alone.\n       ``As soon as I hit the front of a group, or a stage, I'm \n     on,'' he said. ``I am representing and selling LSC. That's \n     what I am doing. But I'm perfectly comfortable being by \n     myself in the house at the end of a long day.''\n       Joe's social circle was small during 16 years of Catholic \n     School in Glendora, N.J. His Italian father, also a Joe, \n     worked for AT His Irish mother, Eileen, was a nurse. He \n     played accordion competitively for 10 years (and still plays \n     a little). When Joe entered the University of Scranton, Pa., \n     in 1982, ``There was a group for everyone,'' he said. ``In \n     high school, there are popular groups. In college, there \n     aren't popular groups. There are different groups.''\n       While earning his bachelor's degree in psychology/sociology \n     in Scranton, Joe spent some time in seminary school and his \n     summers at Camp Ockanickon, where he surprisingly became \n     ``the go-to guy.'' He worked there for eight years, went on \n     to become a board member and president, and will celebrate \n     his 30-year relationship with Camp Ockanickon in the summer \n     of 2013.\n       ``Somehow, I became this listener, this counselor,'' he \n     said of camp. ``It just happened.'' That inherent and well-\n     honed skill helped Joe build an impressive, 10-page \n     curriculum vitae filled with publications, workshops, \n     consulting, honors, awards, and practically every facet of \n     education, from teaching to administration. He earned his \n     doctorate from Columbia University's Teachers College in \n     2003.\n       After eight years at Queens College, Joe left this year \n     with responsibility for 22 departments and more than 200 \n     employees. He also created veterans' services and a wellness \n     center on campus. ``Joe stands out as a president who will \n     attempt to engage, in an extremely supportive way, every \n     single student we have,'' said Jonathan Davis, LSC Class of \n     '97 and dean of students. ``I've already witnessed that in \n     the form of students walking into his office to ask a \n     question or simply to chat.''\n       Student recruitment and retention is also part of Joe's \n     mission at LSC. He has charged Davis with co-chairing a team \n     that would use data and strategies to increase the College's \n     retention rates. Davis was an LSC student when Peggy Williams \n     was president, in the 1990s. Williams was already one of \n     Joe's mentors when he learned about the president's vacancy \n     at LSC last December.\n       Joe was considering other job offers for higher salaries at \n     larger schools, ``but I just kept coming back to Lyndon,'' he \n     said. Enamored after his first trip to campus, and he went \n     with no expectations, he called his partner, Bil, in New \n     Jersey and said, ``The good news is I think I interviewed \n     well, and I liked it. The bad news is I think I interviewed \n     well, and I liked it.''\n       He elaborated further in his office more recently: \n     ``Initially, I underestimated Lyndon in so many ways. Then, \n     when I got here, it was nothing like I thought it would be. \n     The people are passionate. The College is in great shape. I \n     fell in love.'' Bil is in New Jersey for now, working at \n     Rutgers University and living in the house he and Joe shared \n     before Joe moved to Lyndonville. Joe converted the lower \n     level of the LSC president's house--``our house,'' he calls \n     it--to all-purpose meeting space. He lives upstairs.\n       ``I believe I am where I'm supposed to be, and I believe \n     I'll be where I'm supposed to be,'' he said. ``It's been a \n     long time since I've been in a place where I felt I haven't \n     belonged.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/10/senate-section/article/S2552-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE SOMERSET POLICE DEPARTMENT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I stand here to pay tribute to the \nhonorable men and women, past and present, of the Somerset Police \nDepartment in Pulaski County, KY, for 125 years of faithful service and \ntireless dedication.\n  Founded on March 13, 1888, the Somerset Police Department has \nadmirably served the city and surrounding area and to this day \nrepresents the best of our State's citizens. One example of their \nthorough care for and involvement in the community is their annual \ncharity basketball game. Typically, the officers challenge a local \nhigh-school team to an exhibition match--this year they took on the \nlocal fire department, with the proceeds from the event going to \nsupport a local girl who suffers from Type I diabetes. Their reputation \nfor ``coming to the rescue'' was displayed in a different way than \ntheir daily work, but displayed nonetheless, and their efforts \ncertainly are appreciated by those in need who benefit from the support \nraised by their charity.\n  I rise not only to celebrate those who serve, but also those we have \nlost in service. We are grateful for dedicated officers of the Somerset \nPolice Department who risk their very lives to protect and bring order \nto their city.\n  At this time, I would like to applaud the Somerset Police Department \non the 125th anniversary of its founding, and I request that an article \nrecognizing this occasion from a Pulaski County, KY, newspaper be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be appear in \nthe Record as follows:\n       [From the Commonwealth Journal, March 16, 2013]\n\n  125 Years of Service: Somerset Police Department founded March 13, \n                1888--Staff Report, Commonwealth Journal\n\n       Somerset.--The Somerset Police Department recently \n     celebrated 125 years of service in the community.\n       The history of SPD dates all the way back to March 13, \n     1888, when Mayor A. Wolf appointed John B. Ingram as the \n     first chief of police for the newly formed City of Somerset.\n       The police department would grow along with the city's \n     population and physical boundaries over the next 125 years.\n       Still, some have lost their lives in the line of duty.\n       ``As the department gets a year older, it is important to \n     remember those officers who lost their lives serving the \n     citizens of our city,'' stated Lt. Shannon Smith, with SPD.\n       Somerset Chief of Police Silas West was shot and killed in \n     1928 while attempting to arrest a drunk person on the square. \n     Patrolman Walter McKinley Massingale was shot and killed on \n     Halloween night in 1929 while investigating a bootlegger on \n     South Maple Street. And in 1957, Police Chief Harold Catron \n     was shot on his porch on Jasper Street, and he would later \n     die from those wounds in 1964.\n       ``Our 125th anniversary is a milestone to our department,'' \n     said SPD Acting Police Chief Major Doug Nelson. ``Through \n     hard work, rigorous training, and an established level of \n     professionalism, the men and women of the Somerset Police \n     Department will continue to serve our community to make it a \n     safe place to live and work.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/10/senate-section/article/S2552-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2552-S2558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     61ST NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Pryor and myself, I \nask unanimous consent that the transcript of the 61th Annual National \nPrayer Breakfast be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2553]]\n\n61st National Prayer Breakfast, Thursday, February 7, 2013, Washington, \n        DC, Co-Chairs: Senator Jeff Sessions, Senator Mark Pryor\n\n       Senator Mark Pryor: Let me open by saying, ``Good morning \n     fellow sinners.'' My name is Mark Pryor, from Arkansas, and \n     this is my brother, Jeff Sessions, from Alabama. Together, \n     Jeff and I chair the weekly Senate breakfast group, which \n     means we get to chair this ``slightly larger'' event this \n     morning.\n       Senator Jeff Sessions: Thank you all for taking on the \n     adventure of getting here this morning. We have a challenging \n     experience planned for you this morning. We call this the \n     Prayer Breakfast, not only because we come together to pray, \n     but because so much prayer goes into this event, and \n     hopefully, so much prayer comes out of it.\n       Senator Pryor: Everything that happens over the next 90 \n     minutes has really come about through prayer. As a matter of \n     fact, one of the hundreds of volunteers that make this \n     morning possible, literally came in very early this morning \n     and prayed over each place setting here--prayed over each of \n     you.\n       Senator Sessions: Prayer is not a spectator sport. We hope \n     this experience enriches your own life of prayer, for the \n     good of the nation, for the world and for your family.\n       Senator Pryor: Let us join our hearts in prayer. God of the \n     universe, who we individually worship in many different ways \n     and languages, bring us together this morning in a shared \n     experience of praise, understanding and commitment. Our world \n     and our lives fall short of what you created them to be. Use \n     this time to bless us, to bless our leaders, and especially \n     our President, with a sense of who you are and how we all \n     need to change. We are thankful for the food we are enjoying \n     and friendships old and new. Be present in each of our hearts \n     today, in your Holy, precious and matchless name, Amen.\n       Senator Sessions: Enjoy (what's left of) your breakfast.\n       Good morning. We've had a wonderful time together to \n     discuss issues and have a joyful noise. We thank you for your \n     attention.\n       Senator Pryor: It's overwhelming to think of the pathways \n     that each person took to get to this event today. Some from \n     little villages halfway around the world and some from just \n     12 blocks away, so thank you all for coming.\n       Senator Sessions: This huge event, which has taken place \n     for 61 years now, began with a group of people who happened \n     to be leaders wanting to get together for breakfast and for \n     prayer. One thing I know for sure is that life is complicated \n     and is likely to get more complicated tomorrow than \n     yesterday. But as members of the weekly Senate prayer \n     breakfast group, we've learned that taking time each week to \n     meet, to take off the disguises that we wear and pray and \n     share our lives together, makes life better.\n       Senator Pryor: In the modern world and especially in a city \n     like this, there are thousands of things that drive us \n     apart--politics, ideology and even religion. Today, though, \n     we come together in the Spirit of Jesus who taught us to love \n     one another, treat others as we want to be treated and to \n     love God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength. It \n     would be a whole lot better world if we just listened to Him.\n       Senator Sessions: As you look around the room, understand \n     that you're sharing this meal with people from more than 140 \n     countries, all 50 states, heads of government, and leaders of \n     all kinds. Through prayer, we believe God has brought us \n     together for a reason. As you listen closely to the program, \n     try to figure out what God is saying to you. And as you've \n     heard, this event is hosted by members of the House and \n     Senate and I would like to ask all the members of the House \n     and Senate who are present, to stand at this time. We're also \n     honored to be joined by two prime ministers, the Prime \n     Minister of Serbia, His Excellency Ivica Dacic, and the Prime \n     Minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo, His Excellency \n     Augustin Matata Ponyo. Thank you so much for being with us.\n       Senator Pryor: I would like to introduce the head table \n     that will lead us through this experience. I'll start on my \n     right. Today you could say that you ate breakfast with the \n     President and a gold medalist. At the end of our program, our \n     closing prayer will be offered by Olympic champion, Gabrielle \n     Douglas, whose new book is appropriately subtitled ``My Leap \n     of Faith.'' Next to her is former U.S. Senator, Cabinet \n     member and President of the Red Cross, Elizabeth Dole. \n     Elizabeth, believe it or not, was our breakfast speaker 26 \n     years ago. She will give a reading from the Holy Scriptures. \n     Next to her is California Representative, Janice Hahn, one of \n     two co-chairs of the House prayer breakfast group, and next \n     year she'll be standing in my place here. Then we have \n     Admiral and Mrs. Jonathan Greenert. He is the U.S. Chief of \n     Naval Operations, which puts him in charge of about 300,000 \n     sailors, 300 ships and 3,500 aircraft. He will offer a prayer \n     for our national leaders. Next, we have the spouse of my co-\n     chair, Mary Sessions. And please join me in welcoming the \n     passionate, principled and inspirational First Lady of the \n     United States, Michelle Obama.\n       Senator Sessions: Continuing down the table, we have our \n     friend and former colleague, the good Vice President of the \n     United States, Joe Biden. On the other side of our speaker is \n     my colleague and friend, Chuck Schumer. He's the pride of \n     P.S. 197 in Brooklyn, New York and a dedicated member of \n     Congress for amazingly 30 years, and a key member of the \n     Democratic leadership. Chuck will be offering a reading from \n     the Holy Scripture. Next to him is another good friend and \n     former colleague of ours, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, \n     Ken Salazar. In his day job, Ken is responsible for more than \n     500 million acres of United States land. He is a former chair \n     of this Senate prayer breakfast and will be offering a prayer \n     for world leaders. Next to him is Janice Hahn's sidekick for \n     the next year, co-chair of the House breakfast group, Louie \n     Gohmert. He is a member of the House for 8 years and is from \n     East Texas. And finally, visiting from Italy, Mr. Andrea \n     Primicerio, and our soloist, Andrea Bocelli. Mr. Bocelli has \n     gone from a small farming village near Pisa, Italy to selling \n     more than 80 million records worldwide. I read that, at last \n     count, in addition to song writing, he plays 9 instruments. \n     This morning, he will play the most beautiful instrument God \n     has created, the human voice. Join me in welcoming our \n     soloist, Andrea Bocelli.\n       [Song.]\n       Senator Charles Schumer: Good morning. In the Jewish \n     tradition, we are given not only an English name but a Hebrew \n     name and my Hebrew name is Yesha'yahu--Isaiah. So I was \n     particularly honored when Mark asked me to read from the Book \n     of Isaiah. This is Isaiah 55:6-13,\n       ``Seek the Lord, while He may be found, call on him while \n     he is near. Let the wicked forsake their ways, and the \n     unrighteous their thoughts; let them turn to the Lord and he \n     will have mercy on them; and to our God, for He will freely \n     pardon. For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are \n     your ways my ways, declares the Lord. As the heavens are \n     higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, \n     and my thoughts than your thoughts. As the rain and the snow \n     come down from the heaven, and do not return to it without \n     watering the earth, and making it bud and flourish so that it \n     yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my \n     word that goes out from my mouth; it will not return to me \n     empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the \n     purpose for which I sent it. You will go out in joy and be \n     led forth in peace. The mountains and hills will burst into \n     song before you and all the trees of the fields will clap \n     their hands. Instead of the thorn bush will grow the juniper \n     and instead of briars the myrtle will grow. This will be for \n     the Lord's renowned for an everlasting sign that will endure \n     forever.''\n       Representative Louie Gohmert: It is such a pleasure to be \n     here and it's such a pleasure to share our Thursday morning \n     prayer breakfast with you. My co-chair in the House is Janice \n     Hahn. It's a surprise for some people, after they see the way \n     we go back and forth and debate, to see that the Prayer \n     Breakfast is truly bipartisan. We work together. We pray \n     together. And there's something that really brings people \n     together when you pray together. It's the belief in the power \n     of prayer that brings us together.\n       My wife and I have tried to teach that to our three girls. \n     When they were old enough to pray, Cathy and I and our three \n     girls would gather around one of the girls' beds and we would \n     pray each night. One night we had some nose spray that a \n     doctor prescribed for our middle daughter, Caroline--she'd \n     been having real serious sinus problems. She didn't want it \n     up her nose--but I was bigger than her. It was going to be \n     good for her according to the doctor, so we got it up the \n     nose. But there was a lot of crying, wailing and gnashing of \n     teeth. But once the nose spray had been administered and the \n     tears subsided, the crying stopped, we gathered for prayers. \n     Katie prayed first and then Caroline and Caroline finished \n     her prayer by saying ``And please God, help Sarah (the little \n     one), mind her own business and quit being such a pest. And \n     help her to just leave me and Katie alone.'' Little Sarah had \n     the last prayer, and in her little angelic voice she said, \n     ``Please God, help Daddy stick some more medicine up \n     Caroline's nose.'' We had taught them how to pray but not \n     necessarily what it was for.\n       So on Thursday mornings we gather, not to pray that God \n     will help us to stick something up our opponent's nose, but \n     we pray; and God grants mending and healing and blessing and \n     leadership, and it's a beautiful thing to see those come \n     together. It does make us better. It makes us stronger. And \n     it makes the government work better. Which is why Benjamin \n     Franklin, in his own words--his own handwriting--said, ``In \n     the beginning contest with Great Britain when we were \n     sensible of danger, we had daily prayer in this room. Our \n     prayers are heard and they were graciously answered.'' Janice \n     and I and our other colleagues have seen those prayers \n     answered and it's what brings us together. Thanks for joining \n     with us today.\n       Representative Janice Hahn: Good morning. Mr. President, \n     Madam First Lady, Mr. Vice President, Senators, distinguished \n     guests; I'm so delighted to be here this morning with all of \n     you. It's such an honor to co-chair the House Congressional \n     prayer breakfast with my friend and colleague, Congressman \n     Louie Gohmert. His colleagues have said, ``This is the only \n     chairmanship that Speaker Boehner can't remove him from for \n     bad behavior.'' Only God can do that.\n       Today's Prayer Breakfast offers an opportunity for us to \n     set aside political labels and come together to be inspired \n     and pray for the critical issues that are facing our nation \n     and the world. I was elected to Congress in the middle of one \n     of the most bitter, rancorous\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\n     and divided periods in our nation's history. But in the midst \n     of that discord, there was one place that I found that we \n     could set aside our partisan bickering and our differences \n     and come together--a place where once a week, we could be \n     there for each other with our God. That place was the weekly \n     Congressional prayer breakfast. I've found some unlikely \n     friends in that breakfast. But they have helped me to be a \n     better member of Congress and to better serve my God and my \n     constituents.\n       Faith has always been a strong part of my life and my \n     story. I grew up in the church. My grandparents on my \n     mother's side were missionaries to Japan. And my grandmother \n     on my father's side, in a moment of deep despair and \n     helplessness, turned to God for help in raising her seven \n     little boys under the age of 10 when her husband died \n     suddenly. That decision that my grandmother Hattie made, \n     helped me find my journey of faith. Every week when a member \n     of Congress comes to our prayer breakfast and tells their own \n     journey of faith, it gives us a bond that can't be broken. We \n     believe in the power of prayer and every week, we give thanks \n     when God has answered our prayers. Abraham Lincoln said, ``I \n     have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming \n     conviction that I have nowhere else to go. My own wisdom and \n     that of all about me seemed insufficient for the day.'' May \n     we all continue to believe that our own wisdom is \n     insufficient. God bless you all.\n       Admiral Jonathan Greenert: Good Morning. Mr. President, \n     Mrs. Obama, Mr. Vice President, Senators, Congressmen, \n     distinguished guests. Many times many of you have said, even \n     today, to those of us that wear the cloth of the nation,'' \n     thank you for your service.'' And on behalf of our soldiers, \n     sailors, airmen, Marines and Coastguardsmen, may I say thank \n     you for your service and your support to your armed forces. \n     Please join me in a prayer for our national leaders.\n       Oh Lord, we come before you today, thankful for the many \n     blessings you have bestowed upon our nation. And we humbly \n     ask for your continued guidance and strength. On this day, we \n     are reminded to give thanks for the extraordinary freedoms \n     that we enjoy, made possible by the efforts of past \n     generations of men and women who have served this great \n     nation. Your word tells us of King David whose willingness to \n     place his faith in you during difficult times serves as an \n     example for us all. Like David, there are many in this nation \n     who have answered the call to serve, both in and out of \n     uniform. Lord, we are thankful for their dedication, their \n     passion, their perseverance and for the families that support \n     their every effort. When it comes to our search for \n     inspiration, Scripture clearly speaks about where we should \n     begin charting our course--we begin with prayer. We ask that \n     you continue to guide our leaders with wisdom and \n     understanding as they weather the storms that confront our \n     nation. Provide them, God, with the vision necessary to see \n     the way ahead. The strength required to act on difficult \n     decisions and the compassion to care for the wellbeing of \n     those that they lead. Fortify the resolve of the men and \n     women who lead our great nation and provide us with bold, \n     confident and accountable leaders capable of carrying out \n     those actions that your wisdom directs. In your Holy Name we \n     pray, amen.\n       The Honorable Elizabeth Dole: Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, \n     Mr. Vice President, honored guests, ladies and gentlemen. \n     It's my privilege today to read selected portions of Hebrews \n     11, which has been called the Hall of Faith. And I'll end \n     with Hebrews 12 versus 1-3 and verse 14.\n       ``Now, faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain \n     of what we do not see. By faith we understand that the \n     universe was formed at God's command so that what is seen was \n     not made out of what was visible. And without faith, it is \n     impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him \n     must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who \n     earnestly seek him. By faith, Noah, when warned about things \n     not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. \n     By faith, Abraham, even though he was past age and Sarah \n     herself was barren was unable to become a father because he \n     considered him faithful who had made the promise. By faith, \n     Abraham when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He \n     who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one \n     and only son even though God had said to him ``it is through \n     Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.'' Abraham \n     reasoned that God could raise the dead and figuratively \n     speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death. By faith, \n     Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future. By \n     faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's \n     sons and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. By \n     faith, Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus \n     of the Israelites from Egypt. By faith, Moses' parents hid \n     him for three months after he was born because they saw he \n     was no ordinary child and they were not afraid of the king's \n     edict. By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be \n     known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. By faith, he left \n     Egypt not fearing the king's anger. He persevered because he \n     saw him who is invisible. By faith the people passed through \n     the Red Sea as on dry land. By faith, the walls of Jericho \n     fell after the people had marched around them for seven days. \n     By faith, the prostitute Rehab because she welcomed the \n     spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient. And \n     what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about \n     Gideon, Barack, Sampson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the \n     prophets who through faith, conquered kingdoms, administered \n     justice and gained what was promised. Who shut the mouths of \n     lions, quenched the fury of the flames and escaped the edge \n     of the sword, whose weakness was turned to strength. Others \n     were tortured and refused to be released so that they might \n     gain a better resurrection. Some faced years of flogging \n     while still others were chained and put in prison. They were \n     stoned, they were sawed in two, they were put to death by the \n     sword. These were all commended for their faith. Therefore, \n     since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, \n     let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so \n     easily entangles and let us run with perseverance, the race \n     that is set before us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the \n     author and perfector of our faith, who for the joy set before \n     him, endured the cross, scorning its shame and sat down at \n     the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him, who \n     endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not \n     grow weary and lose heart. Make every effort to live in peace \n     with all men and to be holy, for without holiness no one will \n     see the Lord.''\n       The Honorable Ken Salazar: Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, Vice \n     President Biden, members of the United States Senate, fellow \n     Cabinet members, members of the House of Representatives and \n     distinguished guests. The following prayer was written by \n     Cesar Chavez, the great leader of the United States Farm \n     Workers of America. Last year, President Obama visited the \n     gravesite of Cesar Chavez and his office at a place in La \n     Paz, California; and there, he made this place a national \n     monument so that we can honor the work of a true hero and a \n     follower of Christ and a follower of Gandhi. It was a moving \n     time for the President and all of us who were there that day.\n       Chavez was a servant leader who followed the teachings of \n     Jesus Christ. He followed the teachings of Gandhi and Dr. \n     Martin Luther King. He was ever prayerful to Nuestra Senora \n     de Guadalupe (Our Lady of Guadalupe). Today as the world, in \n     many different places, rages in a debate about the peopling \n     of our nations and immigration, and as our nation does the \n     same thing, let us pray that all of our world leaders and all \n     of our leaders here in the United States, will be inspired by \n     the true story of the peopling of our nations and give voice \n     to those who now live in the fear of the shadows of our \n     society. And so, inspired by the teachings and life of Saint \n     Francis and Jesus Christ, let us pray as Cesar Chavez prayed, \n     as he fasted for those who have no voice, who are the most \n     vulnerable in our society.\n       He prayed: ``Show me the suffering of the most miserable, \n     so that I will know my people's plight. Free me to pray for \n     others, because you are present in every person. Help me to \n     take responsibility for my own life, so that I can be free at \n     last. Grant me the courage to serve others, for in service \n     there is true life. Give me honesty and patience, so that I \n     can work with others. Bring forth song and celebration, so \n     that the Spirit will be alive among us. Let the Spirit \n     flourish and grow, so that we will never tire of the \n     struggle. Let us remember those who have died for justice, \n     for they have given us life. Help us love even those who hate \n     us, so we can change the world.'' God bless you, God bless \n     the United States of America, God bless all of our leaders.\n       Senator Sessions: Of all of the complex things in the \n     world, perhaps the most complex is the human brain. How come \n     I can remember the words of the preamble of the Constitution \n     but can't find my glasses? We've invited as our guest speaker \n     this morning a gentleman for three reasons: he loves Jesus, \n     he has a compelling life story and he is a distinguished man \n     of science and healing. We hope that he can help us sort some \n     things out. May I introduce, the director of Pediatric \n     Neurosurgery at one of the world's great hospitals, Johns \n     Hopkins in Baltimore, Dr. Benjamin Carson, Sr.\n       Dr. Benjamin S. Carson, Sr.: Thank you so much. Mr. \n     President, Mr. Vice President, Mrs. Obama, distinguished \n     guests--which includes everybody. Thank you so much for this \n     wonderful honor to be at this stage again. I was here 16 \n     years ago and the fact that they've invited me back means \n     that I didn't offend too many people--so that was great. I \n     want to start by reading four texts, which will put into \n     context what I'm going to say.\n       Proverbs 11:9. ``With his mouth, the godless destroys his \n     neighbor, but through knowledge the righteous escape.''\n       Proverbs 11:12, ``A man who lacks judgment derides his \n     neighbor, but a man of understanding holds his tongue.''\n       Proverbs 11:25, ``A generous man will prosper; he who \n     refreshes others will himself be refreshed.''\n       2nd Chronicles 7:14, ``If my people who are called by my \n     name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and \n     turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and \n     will forgive their sins and heal their land.''\n       I have an opportunity to speak in a lot of venues--this is \n     my fourth speech this week--and to talk to a lot of people. \n     And I've been asking people--what concerns you? What are you \n     most concerned about in the terms of the spirituality and the \n     direction of our nation and our world? I've talked to very \n     prominent Democrats, and very prominent Republicans and I was \n     surprised by the uniformity of their answers. And those have \n     informed my comments this morning.\n\n[[Page S2555]]\n\n       It's not my intention to offend anyone. I have discovered, \n     however, in recent years that it's very difficult to speak to \n     a large group of people these days and not offend someone. \n     And I know people walk around with their feelings on their \n     shoulders waiting for you to say something--``Ah, did you \n     hear that?'' And they can't hear anything else you say. The \n     PC police are out in force at all times. I remember once I \n     was talking to a group about the difference between a human \n     brain and a dog's brain. And a man got offended--he said, \n     ``You can't talk about dogs like that.'' But people just \n     focus in on that and completely miss the point of what you're \n     saying. We've reached the point where people are afraid to \n     actually talk about what they want to say--because somebody \n     might be offended. People are afraid to say, ``Merry \n     Christmas'' at Christmastime. It doesn't matter whether the \n     person you're talking to is Jewish or whether they're any \n     religion--that's a salutation of greeting, of good will. \n     We've got to get over this sensitivity. It keeps people from \n     saying what they really believe.\n       I'm reminded of a very successful young businessman who \n     loved to buy his mother these exotic gifts for Mother's Day. \n     And he ran out of ideas, and then he ran across these birds. \n     These birds were cool. They cost 5,000 dollars apiece--they \n     could dance, they could sing, they could talk. He was so \n     excited, he bought two of them; sent them to his mother; \n     couldn't' wait to call her up on Mother's Day, ``Mother, \n     mother, what did you think of those birds?'' And she said, \n     ``They was good.'' He said, ``No, no, no, mother, you didn't \n     eat those birds; those birds cost 5,000 dollars apiece--they \n     could dance, they could sing, they could talk.'' And she \n     said, ``Well, they should have said something.'' And that's \n     where we end up too if we don't speak up for what we believe. \n     What we need to do in this PC world is forget about unanimity \n     of speech and unanimity of thought and we need to concentrate \n     on being respectful to those people with whom we disagree--\n     that's when I think we begin to make real progress.\n       One last thing about political correctness--which I think \n     is a horrible thing, by the way. I'm very, very compassionate \n     and I'm not ever out to offend anyone, but PC is dangerous \n     because in this country, one of the founding principles was \n     freedom of thought and freedom of expression and it muffles \n     people, it puts a muzzle on them. And at the same time, keeps \n     people from discussing important issues while the fabric of \n     their society is being changed. And we cannot fall for that \n     trick. What we need to do is start talking about things, \n     talking about things that are important, things that were \n     important in the development of our nation. One of those \n     things was education. I'm very passionate about education \n     because it made such a big difference in my life. But here we \n     are at a time in the world, the information age, the age of \n     technology, and yet 30 per cent of people who enter high \n     school in this country do not graduate. 44 percent of the \n     people who start a four year college program do not finish it \n     in four years. What is that about?\n       Think back to a darker time in our history. 200 years ago \n     when slavery was going on, it was illegal to educate a slave, \n     particularly to teach him to read. Why do you think that was? \n     Because when you educate a man, you liberate the man. And \n     there I was as a youngster placing myself in the same \n     situation that a horrible institution did because I wasn't \n     taking advantage of the education, because I was a horrible \n     student. Most of my classmates thought I was the stupidest \n     person in the world. They called me ``dummy.'' I was the butt \n     of all the jokes. Admittedly, it was a bad environment--a \n     single parent home--my mother and father had gotten divorced \n     early on. My mother got married when she was 13. She was one \n     of 24 children; had a horrible life, discovered that her \n     husband was a bigamist, had another family, and she only had \n     a third grade education. She had to take care of us, in dire \n     poverty. I had a horrible temper, poor self-esteem; all of \n     the things that you think would preclude success. But I had \n     something very important. I had a mother who believed in me. \n     And I had a mother who would never allow herself to be a \n     victim, no matter what happened. She never made excuses and \n     she never accepted an excuse from us. And if we ever came up \n     with an excuse, she always said, ``Do you have a brain?'' And \n     if the answer was ``Yes,'' then she said, ``Then you could of \n     thought your way out of it; it doesn't matter what John or \n     Susan or Mary or anybody else did or said.'' And it was the \n     most important thing she did for my brother and myself \n     because if you don't accept excuses, pretty soon people stop \n     giving them and they start looking for solutions and that is \n     a critical issue when it comes to success.\n       We did live in dire poverty and one of the things that I \n     hated was poverty. Some people hate spiders, some people hate \n     snakes--I hated poverty. I couldn't stand it. But my mother \n     couldn't stand the fact that we were doing poorly in school. \n     She prayed, she asked God to give her wisdom, what could she \n     do to get her young sons to understand the importance of \n     developing their minds, so that they could control their own \n     lives? And you know what? God gave her the wisdom, at least \n     in her opinion. My brother and I didn't think it was that \n     wise because it was to turn off the TV. She let us only watch \n     two or three TV programs during the week. And with all that \n     spare time, read two books apiece from the Detroit public \n     libraries and submit to her written book reports, which she \n     couldn't read but we didn't know that--she'd put checkmarks \n     and highlights and stuff. But you know, I just hated this, \n     and my friends were out having a good time. Her friends would \n     criticize her, they would say, ``You can't make boys stay in \n     the house reading books, they'll grow up, they'll hate you.'' \n     I would overhear them and I would say, ``You know, mother, \n     they're right.'' But she didn't care. But after a while, I \n     actually began to enjoy reading those books. Even though we \n     were very poor, between the covers of those books, I could go \n     anywhere, I could be anybody, I could do anything. I began to \n     read about people of great accomplishment. And as I read \n     those stories, I began to see a connecting thread. I began to \n     see that the person that has the most to do with you and what \n     happens to you in life is you. You make decisions. You decide \n     how much energy you want to put behind that decision. And I \n     came to understand that I had control of my own destiny. At \n     that point, I didn't hate poverty anymore because I knew it \n     was only temporary. I knew I could change that. It was \n     incredibly liberating for me, it made all the difference.\n       And to continue on that theme of education, in 1831, Alexis \n     de Tocqueville came to America to study this country. The \n     Europeans were fascinated--how could a fledgling nation \n     barely 50 years old already be competing with them on \n     virtually every level. This is impossible--de Tocqueville was \n     going to sort it out. And he looked at our government and he \n     was duly impressed by the three branches of government--four \n     now because now of special interest groups, but it was only \n     three back in those days. And he said, ``Wow, this is really \n     something.'' And then he said, ``Let me look at their \n     educational system,'' and he was blown away. Anybody \n     finishing second grade was completely literate. He could find \n     a mountain man on the outskirts of society--the man could \n     read a newspaper, could have a political discussion, could \n     tell him how the government worked.\n       If you really want to be impressed, take a look at the \n     chapter on education in my latest book, ``America the \n     Beautiful,'' which I wrote with my wife; it came out last \n     year. And in that education chapter, you will see questions \n     extracted from a sixth grade Exit Exam from the 1800's--a \n     test you had to pass to get your sixth grade certificate. I \n     doubt most college graduates today could pass that test. We \n     have dumbed things down to that level. And the reason that \n     that is so dangerous is because the people who founded this \n     nation said that our system of government was designed for a \n     well informed and educated populous. And when they become \n     less informed, they become vulnerable. Think about that, our \n     system of government, and that's why the education is so \n     vitally important.\n       Now some people say ``Ah, you're overblowing it, things \n     aren't that bad, and you're a doctor, a neurosurgeon, why are \n     you concerned about these things?'' I've got news for you. \n     Five doctors signed the Declaration of Independence. Doctors \n     were involved in the framing of the Constitution, the Bill of \n     Rights, and a whole bunch of things. It's only been in recent \n     decades that we've extracted ourselves--which I think is a \n     big mistake. We need doctors and we need scientists, \n     engineers, we need all of those people involved in \n     government, not just lawyers. I don't have anything against \n     lawyers, but here's the thing about lawyers--and I'm sorry \n     but I got to be truthful--what do lawyers learn in law \n     school? To win, by hook or by crook, you got to win. So \n     you've got all these Democrat lawyers and you've got all \n     these Republican lawyers and their side wants to win. We need \n     to get rid of that. What we need to start thinking about is: \n     how do we solve problems?\n       Now, before I get shot, let me finish here. I don't like to \n     bring up problems without coming up with solutions. My wife \n     and I started the Carson Scholars Fund 16 years ago after we \n     heard about an international survey looking at the ability of \n     eighth graders in 22 countries to solve math and science \n     problems; and we came out number 21 out of 22, barely beat \n     out number 22, very concerning. And we'd go into schools and \n     we'd see all these trophies, All State basketball, All State \n     wrestling, All State this, that and the other. The \n     quarterback was the big man on campus, What about the \n     intellectual superstar? What did they get? A National Honor \n     Society pin, a pat on the head, ``there, there little \n     nerd''--nobody cared about them. And is it any wonder that \n     sometimes the smart kids try to hide; they don't want anybody \n     to know that they're smart? This is not helping us as a \n     nation. So we started giving out scholarships to students \n     from all backgrounds for superior academic performance and \n     demonstration of humanitarian qualities. Unless you cared \n     about other people, it didn't matter how smart you were. \n     We've got plenty of people like that, we don't need those. We \n     need smart people who care about other people. We will give \n     them money, the money would go into a trust, they would get \n     interest on it and then when they went to college, they get \n     the money. But also, the school gets a trophy, every bit as \n     impressive as the sports trophies. It goes right out there \n     with the others. They get a medal. They get to go to a \n     banquet. And we try to put them on the same kind of pedestal \n     as we do the All State athletes.\n       Now, I have nothing against athletics or entertainment, \n     please believe me. I'm from Baltimore, the Ravens won, this \n     is great, okay. But what will maintain our position in the \n     world, the ability to shoot a 25 foot jump\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\n     shot or the ability to solve a quadratic equation? We need to \n     put things into proper perspective. Many teachers have told \n     us that when we put a Carson Scholar in their class room, the \n     GPA of the whole class goes up over the next year. And it's \n     been very gratifying. We started 16 years ago with 25 \n     scholarships in Maryland; now we've given out more than 5,000 \n     and we're in all 50 states. But we also put in reading rooms. \n     These are fascinating places that no little kid could \n     possibly pass up. They get points for the amount of time they \n     spend in their reading, the number of books that they read, \n     and they can trade them in for prizes. In the beginning, they \n     do it for the prizes, but it doesn't take long before their \n     academic performance begins to improve. We particularly \n     target Title 1 schools where kids come from homes with no \n     books and they go to schools with no libraries. Those are the \n     ones who drop out and we need to truncate that process early \n     on because we can't afford to waste any of those young \n     people. For every one of those people that we keep from going \n     down that path, that path of self-destruction and mediocrity, \n     that's one less person you have to protect yourself and your \n     family from. One less person you have to pay for in the penal \n     or the welfare system. One more tax paying productive member \n     of society who may invent a new energy source or come up with \n     a cure for cancer. They're all important to us and we need \n     every single one of them, it makes a difference. When you go \n     home tonight, please read about it, Carson Scholar Fund, \n     Carsonscholars.org.\n       But, why is it so important that we educate our people? \n     Because we don't want to go down the same pathway as many \n     other pinnacle nations have who have preceded us. I think \n     particularly about ancient Rome--very powerful, nobody could \n     even challenge them militarily. But what happened to them? \n     They destroyed themselves from within--moral decay, fiscal \n     irresponsibility--they destroyed themselves. And if you don't \n     think that can happen to America, you get out your books and \n     you start reading. But you know we can fix it. Why can we fix \n     it? Because we're smart; we have some of the most \n     intellectually gifted people leading our nation. All we need \n     to do is remember what our real responsibilities are so we \n     can solve the problems. I think about these problems all the \n     time and my role model was Jesus and he used parables to help \n     people understand things.\n       One of our big problems right now--and like I said, I'm not \n     politically correct so, I'm sorry--our deficit is a big \n     problem. Think about it. Our national debt, 16\\1/2\\ trillion \n     dollars, you think that's not a lot of money. I tell you \n     what, count one number per second, which you can't even do \n     because when you get to a thousand, you can't, it'll take you \n     longer than a second, but one number per second. You know how \n     long that'll take you to count to 16 trillion? 507,000 \n     years--more than a half a million years to get there. We have \n     to deal with this. Here's the parable. A family falls on hard \n     times--dad loses his job or is demoted, gets part time work, \n     has five children. He comes to the five children and he says \n     ``We're going to have to reduce your allowance.'' Well, \n     they're not happy about it; but he says, ``Except for John \n     and Susan, they're special. They can keep their allowance; in \n     fact, I may give them more.'' How do you think that's going \n     to go down? Not too well. Same thing happens, enough said.\n       What about our taxation system? So complex there is no one \n     who can possibly comply with every jot and tittle of our tax \n     system. If I wanted to get you, I could get you on a tax \n     issue. That doesn't make any sense. What we need to do is \n     come up with something that is simple. When I pick up my \n     Bible, you know what I see? I see the fairest individual in \n     the universe, God. And he's given us a system, it's called, \n     tithe. Now, we don't necessarily have to do it 10 per cent, \n     but it's the principle. He didn't say, ``If your crops fail, \n     don't give me any tithes.'' He didn't say, ``If you have a \n     bumper crop, give me triple tithes.'' So there must be \n     something inherently fair about proportionality. You make 10 \n     billion dollars, you put in a billion. You make 10 dollars, \n     you put in one. Of course, you've got to get rid of the \n     loopholes. But now some people say, ``Well that's not fair \n     because it doesn't hurt the guy who made 10 billion dollars \n     as much as the guy who made 10.'' Where does it say you have \n     to hurt the guy? He just put a billion dollars in the pot; \n     you know we don't need to hurt him. It's that kind of \n     thinking that has resulted in 602 banks in the Cayman \n     Islands. That money needs to be back here building our \n     infrastructure and creating jobs. And we're smart enough to \n     figure out how to do that.\n       We've already started down the path of solving one of the \n     other big problems, health care. We need to have good health \n     care for everybody. It's the most important thing that a \n     person can have. Money means nothing, titles means nothing, \n     when you don't have your health. But, we've got to figure out \n     efficient ways to do it. We spend a lot of money on health \n     care, twice as much per capita as anybody else in the world \n     and yet we're not very efficient. What can we do? Here's my \n     solution. When a person is born, give them a birth \n     certificate, an electronic medical record and a health \n     saving's account to which money can be contributed pre-tax \n     from the time you're born to the time you die. When you die, \n     you can pass it on to your family members so that when you're \n     85 years old and you've got six diseases, you're not trying \n     to spend up everything, you're happy to pass it on and \n     there's nobody talking about death panels. That's number one. \n     And also, for the people who are indigent, who don't have any \n     money; we can make contributions to their HSA each month \n     because we already have this huge pot of money. Instead of \n     sending it to some bureaucracy, let's put it in their HSA's. \n     Now they have some control over their own health care. And \n     what do you think they're going to do? They're going to learn \n     very quickly how to be responsible. When Mr. Jones gets that \n     diabetic foot ulcer, he's not going to the emergency room and \n     blowing a big chunk of it. He's going to go to the clinic. He \n     learns that very quickly. He gets the same treatment in the \n     emergency room they send him out to the clinic and say ``Now \n     let's get your diabetes under control so you're not back here \n     in three weeks with another problem. That's how we begin to \n     solve these kinds of problems. It's much more complex than \n     that and I don't have time to go into it all but we can do \n     all of these things because we're smart people.\n       And let me just begin to close here by another parable. A \n     sea captain is out on the sea, near to the area where the \n     Titanic went down. He looks ahead and there's a bright light \n     right there, another ship he figures. He tells his signaler; \n     signal that ship, ``Deviate 10 degrees to the south.'' Back \n     comes the message ``No, you deviate 10 degrees to the \n     north.'' Well he's a little bit incensed, he says, ``Send a \n     message, This is Captain Johnson, deviate 10 degrees to the \n     north'.'' Back comes the message, ``This is Ensign 4th Class \n     Riley, deviate 10 degrees to the south.'' Now he's really \n     upset. He says, ``Send them a message, this is a naval \n     destroyer.'' Back comes the message, ``This is a light \n     house.'' Enough said.\n       What about the symbol of our nation, the eagle, the bald \n     eagle. It's an interesting story how we chose that but a lot \n     of people think we call it the bald eagle because it looks \n     like it has a bald head. That's not the reason. It comes from \n     the Old English word, piebald, which means crowned with \n     white; and we just shortened it to bald. Now use that the \n     next time you see somebody who thinks they know everything--\n     you get them with that one. But, why is that eagle able to \n     fly high, to fly forward? Because it has two wings, a left \n     wing and a right wing. Enough said.\n       And I want to close with this story. 200 years ago this \n     nation was involved in a war, the War of 1812. The British, \n     who are now our good friends, thought that we were young \n     whippersnappers; it was time for us to become a colony again. \n     They were winning that war, marching up the Eastern Seaboard, \n     destroying city after city, destroyed Washington D.C., burned \n     down the White House; next stop, Baltimore. As they came into \n     the Chesapeake Bay, that armada of ships--war ships as far as \n     the eye could see--it was looking grim; Fort McHenry standing \n     right there. General Armistead, who was in charge of Fort \n     McHenry, had a large American flag commissioned to fly in \n     front of the fort. The admiral in charge of the British fleet \n     was offended and said, ``Take that flag down. You have until \n     dusk to take that flag down. If you don't take it down, we \n     will reduce you to ashes.'' There was a young amateur poet on \n     board by the name of Francis Scott Key, sent by President \n     Madison to try to obtain the release of an American physician \n     who was being held captive. He overheard the British plans; \n     they were not going to let him off the ship. He mourned as \n     dusk approached. He mourned for his fledgling young nation. \n     And as the sun fell, the bombardment started, bombs bursting \n     in air, missiles, so much debris. He strained trying to see--\n     was the flag still there? Couldn't see a thing. All night \n     long it continued. At the crack of dawn he ran out to the \n     banister, he looked, straining his eyes, but all he could see \n     was dust and debris. And then there was a clearing and he \n     beheld the most beautiful sight he'd ever seen--the torn and \n     tattered stars and stripes still waving. And many historians \n     say that was the turning point in the War of 1812. We went on \n     to win that war and to retain our freedom. And if you had \n     gone onto the grounds of Fort McHenry that day, you would \n     have seen at the base of that flag the bodies of soldiers who \n     took turns propping up that flag. They would not let that \n     flag go down because they believed in what that flag \n     symbolized. And what did it symbolize? One nation under God, \n     indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, God \n     bless.\n       Senator Pryor: Thank you Dr. Carson. It is now my great \n     honor to introduce our President. One of the striking \n     measures of the passage of time since you first were with us \n     Mr. President is the comparison photographs of your daughters \n     at your first Inauguration and you're second. You have a \n     beautiful and wonderful family. And they remind us of the \n     core American values of faith, family and optimism in the \n     future. Mr. President, we want to express our love and our \n     respect for you this morning. You carry burdens none of us in \n     this room can imagine. Thank you for keeping the unbroken \n     commitment of ten former presidents to join us for breakfast \n     and prayer. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United \n     States, Barack Obama.\n       President Barack Obama: Thank you very much. Please have a \n     seat. Mark, thank you for that introduction. I thought he was \n     going to talk about my gray hair. It is true that my \n     daughters are gorgeous. That's because my wife is gorgeous. \n     And my goal is to improve my gene pool. To Mark and Jeff, \n     thank you for your wonderful work on behalf of\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\n     this breakfast. To all of those who worked so hard to put \n     this together; to the heads of state, members of Congress, \n     and my Cabinet, religious leaders and distinguished guests. \n     To our outstanding speaker. To all the faithful who've \n     journeyed to our capital, Michelle and I are truly honored to \n     be with you this morning.\n       Before I begin, I hope people don't mind me taking a moment \n     of personal privilege. I want to say a quick word about a \n     close friend of mine and yours, Joshua Dubois. Now, some of \n     you may not know Joshua, but Joshua has been at my side--in \n     work and in prayer--for years now. He is a young reverend, \n     but wise in years. He's worked on my staff. He's done an \n     outstanding job as the head of our Faith-Based office. Every \n     morning he sends me via email a daily meditation--a snippet \n     of Scripture for me to reflect on. And it has meant the world \n     to me. And despite my pleas, tomorrow will be his last day in \n     the White House. So this morning I want to publically thank \n     Joshua for all that he's done, and I know that everybody \n     joins me in wishing him all the best in his future \n     endeavors--including getting married.\n       It says something about us--as a nation and as a people--\n     that every year, for 61 years now, this great prayerful \n     tradition has endured. It says something about us that every \n     year, in times of triumph and in tragedy, in calm and in \n     crisis, we come together, not as Democrats or Republicans, \n     but as brothers and sisters, and as children of God. Every \n     year, in the midst of all our busy and noisy lives, we set \n     aside one morning to gather as one community, united in \n     prayer. We do so because we're a nation ever humbled by our \n     history, and we're ever attentive to our imperfections--\n     particularly the imperfections of our President. We come \n     together because we're a people of faith. We know that faith \n     is something that must be cultivated. Faith is not a \n     possession. Faith is a process.\n       I was struck by the passage that was read earlier from the \n     Book of Hebrews: ``Without faith it is impossible to please \n     God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He \n     exists and He rewards those who diligently seek Him.'' He \n     rewards those who diligently seek Him--not just for one \n     moment, or one day, but for every moment, and every day. As \n     Christians, we place our faith in the nail-scarred hands of \n     Jesus Christ. But so many other Americans also know the close \n     embrace of faith--Muslims and Jews, Hindus and Sikhs. And all \n     Americans--whether religious or secular--have a deep and \n     abiding faith in this nation.\n       Recently I had occasion to reflect on the power of faith. A \n     few weeks ago, during the inauguration, I was blessed to \n     place my hand on the Bibles of two great Americans, two men \n     whose faith still echoes today. One was the Bible owned by \n     President Abraham Lincoln, and the other, the Bible owned by \n     Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As I prepared to take the sacred \n     oath, I thought about these two men, and I thought of how, in \n     times of joy and pain and uncertainty, they turned to their \n     Bibles to seek the wisdom of God's word--and thought of how, \n     for as long as we've been a nation, so many of our leaders, \n     our Presidents, and our preachers, our legislators and our \n     jurists have done the same. Each one faced their own \n     challenges; each one finding in Scripture their own lessons \n     from the Lord. And as I was looking out on the crowd during \n     the inauguration I thought of Dr. King. We often think of him \n     standing tall in front of the endless crowds, stirring the \n     nation's conscience with a bellowing voice and a mighty \n     dream. But I also thought of his doubts and his fears, for \n     those moments came as well--the lonely moments when he was \n     left to confront the presence of long-festering injustice and \n     undisguised hate; imagined the darkness and the doubt that \n     must have surrounded him when he was in that Birmingham jail, \n     and the anger that surely rose up in him the night his house \n     was bombed with his wife and child inside, and the grief that \n     shook him as he eulogized those four precious girls taken \n     from this Earth as they gathered in a house of God. And I was \n     reminded that, yes, Dr. King was a man of audacious hope and \n     a man of relentless optimism. But he was also a man \n     occasionally brought to his knees in fear and in doubt and in \n     helplessness. And in those moments, we know that he retreated \n     alone to a quiet space so he could reflect and he could pray \n     and he could grow his faith. And I imagine he turned to \n     certain verses that we now read. I imagine him reflecting on \n     Isaiah, that we wait upon the Lord; that the Lord shall renew \n     those who wait; that they shall mount up with wings as \n     eagles, and they shall run and not be weary, and they shall \n     walk and not faint. We know that in Scripture, Dr. King found \n     strength; in the Bible, he found conviction. In the words of \n     God, he found a truth about the dignity of man that, once \n     realized, he never relinquished.\n       We know Lincoln had such moments as well. To see this \n     country torn apart, to see his fellow citizens waging a \n     ferocious war that pitted brother against brother, family \n     against family--that was as heavy a burden as any President \n     will ever have to bear. We know Lincoln constantly met with \n     troops and visited the wounded and honored the dead. And the \n     toll mounted day after day, week after week. And you can see \n     in the lines of his face the toll that the war cost him. But \n     he did not break. Even as he buried a beloved son, he did not \n     break. Even as he struggled to overcome melancholy, despair, \n     grief, he did not break. And we know that he surely found \n     solace in Scripture; that he could acknowledge his own \n     doubts, that he was humbled in the face of the Lord. And \n     that, I think, allowed him to become a better leader. It's \n     what allowed him in what may be one of the greatest speeches \n     ever written, in his second Inaugural, to describe the Union \n     and the Confederate soldier alike--both reading the same \n     Bible, both prayed to the same God, but ``the prayers of both \n     could not be answered. That of neither has been answered \n     fully. The Almighty has His own purposes.'' In Lincoln's \n     eyes, the power of faith was humbling, allowing us to embrace \n     our limits in knowing God's will. And as a consequence, he \n     was able to see God in those who vehemently opposed him.\n       Today, the divisions in this country are, thankfully, not \n     as deep or destructive as when Lincoln led, but they are \n     real. The differences in how we hope to move our nation \n     forward are less pronounced than when King marched, but they \n     do exist. And as we debate what is right and what is just, \n     what is the surest way to create a more hopeful--for our \n     children--how we're going to reduce our deficit, what kind of \n     tax plans we're going to have, how we're going to make sure \n     that every child is getting a great education--and, Doctor, \n     it is very encouraging to me that you turned out so well by \n     your mom not letting you watch TV. I'm going to tell my \n     daughters that when they complain. In the midst of all these \n     debates, we must keep that same humility that Dr. King and \n     Lincoln and Washington and all our great leaders understood \n     is at the core of true leadership. In a democracy as big and \n     as diverse as ours, we will encounter every opinion. And our \n     task as citizens--whether we are leaders in government or \n     business or spreading the word--is to spend our days with \n     open hearts and open minds; to seek out the truth that exists \n     in an opposing view and to find the common ground that allows \n     for us as a nation, as a people, to take real and meaningful \n     action. And we have to do that humbly, for no one can know \n     the full and encompassing mind of God. And we have to do it \n     every day, not just at a prayer breakfast. I have to say this \n     is now our fifth prayer breakfast and it is always just a \n     wonderful event. But I do worry sometimes that as soon as we \n     leave the prayer breakfast, everything we've been talking \n     about the whole time at the prayer breakfast seems to be \n     forgotten--on the same day of the prayer breakfast. I mean, \n     you'd like to think that the shelf life wasn't so short. But \n     I go back to the Oval Office and I start watching the cable \n     news networks and it's like we didn't pray.\n       And so my hope is that that humility carries over every \n     day, every moment. While God may reveal His plan to us in \n     portions, the expanse of His plan is for God, and God alone, \n     to understand. ``For now we see through a glass, darkly; but \n     then face to face; now I know in part, but then shall I know \n     even as also I am known.'' Until that moment, until we know, \n     and are fully known, all we can do is live our lives in a \n     Godly way and assume that those we deal with every day, \n     including those in an opposing party, they're groping their \n     way, doing their best, going through the same struggles we're \n     going through. And in that pursuit, we are blessed with \n     guidance. God has told us how He wishes for us to spend our \n     days. His Commandments are there to be followed. Jesus is \n     there to guide us; the Holy Spirit, to help us. Love the Lord \n     God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all \n     your mind. Love your neighbor as yourself. See in everyone, \n     even in those with whom you disagree most vehemently, the \n     face of God. For we are all His children. That's what I \n     thought of as I took the oath of office a few weeks ago and \n     touched those Bibles--the comfort that Scripture gave Lincoln \n     and King and so many leaders throughout our history; the \n     verses they cherished, and how those words of God are there \n     for us as well, waiting to be read any day that we choose. I \n     thought about how their faith gave them the strength to meet \n     the challenges of their time, just as our faith can give us \n     the strength to meet the challenges of ours. And most of all, \n     I thought about their humility, and how we don't seem to live \n     that out the way we should, every day, even when we give lip \n     service to it.\n       As President, sometimes I have to search for the words to \n     console the inconsolable. Sometimes I search Scripture to \n     determine how best to balance life as a President and as a \n     husband and as a father. I often search for Scripture to \n     figure out how I can be a better man as well as a better \n     President. And I believe that we are united in these \n     struggles. But I also believe that we are united in the \n     knowledge of a redeeming Savior, whose grace is sufficient \n     for the multitude of our sins, and whose love is never \n     failing. And most of all, I know that all Americans--men and \n     women of different faiths and, yes, those of no faith that \n     they can name--are, nevertheless, joined together in common \n     purpose, believing in something that is bigger than \n     ourselves, and the ideals that lie at the heart of our \n     nation's founding--that as a people we are bound together.\n       And so this morning, let us summon the common resolve that \n     comes from our faith. Let us pray to God that we may be \n     worthy of the many blessings He has bestowed upon our nation. \n     Let us retain that humility not just during this hour but for \n     every hour. And let me suggest that those of us with the most \n     power and influence need to be the most humble. And let us \n     promise Him and to each other, every day as the sun rises \n     over America that it will rise over a people who are striving \n     to make this a more perfect union. Thank you. God bless you, \n     and God bless the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\n       Senator Sessions: Thank you. Thank you Mr. President. We're \n     not of the same political party, sometimes we disagree, but \n     speaking as an American, we are one nation and we have one \n     President who serves us all. Thank you for being my \n     President, thank you for being our President.\n       So let's all enjoy now a final selection from Andrea \n     Boccelli.\n       [Song]\n       Mr. Andrea Bocelli: Thank you very much. I'm very ashamed \n     of my English because I would like to tell you many, many \n     things but I can't because my English is very poor. But I \n     live this moment like a dream, because very often my country \n     has been in trouble, just because the left and the right \n     never are able to speak with each other. And in this country \n     where I received a lot, a big, big affection, incredible \n     affection, today I received also a big teaching. I will try \n     going back to my country, Italy, to transmit this will that \n     for me is the most important thing--the will to pray \n     together. Thank you very much.\n       Senator Pryor: Thank you Andrea. Just like your songs that \n     was very beautiful. At the end of the Sermon on the Mount, \n     Jesus said, ``Therefore, everyone who hears these words of \n     mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built \n     his house on the rock.'' Let's be wise people in the \n     important roles that we're about to step back into in a few \n     minutes and put what we've heard and learned here into \n     practice.\n       Senator Sessions: Love God. Love your neighbor. Let's make \n     that simple rule our guide and make our complex world a \n     better one today. And to offer our closing prayer, please \n     welcome Olympic gold medalist, Gabrielle Douglas.\n       Ms. Gabrielle Douglas: Thank you. It's such an honor to be \n     here today with so many distinguished leaders, especially Mr. \n     President, Mrs. Obama, Mr. Vice President and the Honorable \n     Mark Pryor and the Honorable Jeff Sessions. Now please, \n     please join me as we bow our heads and pray.\n       Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for the many continued \n     blessings. We uplift every leader from every nation and ask \n     that you continue to give them wisdom as they govern. Teach \n     us to walk in humility, strengthen us as we strive to fulfill \n     your plan, your purpose for our lives. And as we go from \n     here, I pray we would all pursue your peace, your love and \n     your grace, in Jesus' name, Amen.\n       Senator Pryor: We're done, thank you, God bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/10/senate-section/article/S2558-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR A FEW\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record an article written by Ken Hamilton, \nExecutive Vice President of the Wyoming Farm Bureau that was Published \nin the April 2013 edition of Wyoming Agriculture. The article's title \nis ``Equal Access to Justice for a few.''\n  Mr. President, while we continue to fight for increased transparency \nwith regards to the Equal Access to Justice Act, one thing is already \nclear--the Federal Government is picking winners and losers. Mr. \nHamilton calls this a ``cozy appearance between the groups who sue the \nFederal Government and the desire by the government to help pay their \nway.'' He points out in one recent case of several environmental groups \nsuing the Fish and Wildlife Service over wolf delisting efforts where \nthe Federal Government quickly approved their November 2012 claim for \n$380,000 in attorney fees. That is $380,000 dollars of hard-earned \nAmerican taxpayer dollars this administration's Justice Department was \nmore than happy to hand over to their political allies.\n  Ken continues to illustrate the apparent political fingerprints and \nfavoritism in the Justice Department by stating, ``Meanwhile back at \nthe ranch, the Wyoming Wolf Coalition through its attorney Harriet \nHageman, has asked the Federal Government for their fees under EAJA. \nThese fees, one-tenth of the environmental claim, have been argued over \nby the same Federal Government since April of 2011.'' Let me repeat \nthat. Since 2011, the Justice Department has been actively arguing over \nan EAJA claim of approximately $36,000 to a group that supported wolf \ndelisting when the same Justice Department agreed to send $380,000 to \nenvironmental groups opposed to the delisting of wolves.\n  Based on these facts I would have to agree with Ken's conclusion \nthat, ``the Equal Access to Justice Act is being applied less than \nequally by the Federal Government. It appears that if they agree with \nyou they will send you a check, but if they do not they will send you \nan attorney's response denying you your money.''\n  This administration should not be in the business of playing \nfavorites by rewarding their political friends with taxpayer dollars. I \ncommend Ken for highlighting the apparent inequality and abuse of the \nso-called Equal Access to Justice Act. This is one of the reasons I \nplan to continue fighting for real transparency regarding which groups \nare receiving EAJA payments, why they are receiving it, and how much \nmoney--taxpayer money--is being given away. It is time the Equal Access \nto Justice Act truly live up to its name.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation Opinion Editorial, Mar. 26, \n                                 2013]\n\n                   Equal Access to Justice for a Few\n\n   (By Ken Hamilton, Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation, Executive Vice \n                               President)\n\n       Many people are aware of the efforts to reform the Equal \n     Access to Justice Act (EAJA) in order to bring more \n     transparency to the process of the federal government paying \n     attorney fees. Based on information researched and brought to \n     light through the Budd-Falen law offices we found out that \n     monies were being awarded without the slightest effort by the \n     government to keep track of who received them and why. Thus, \n     the need for some transparency and oversight. We have also \n     seen some of the recipients fight efforts to bring \n     transparency and why wouldn't they? After all, this is \n     something that helps off-set their cost of suing the federal \n     government.\n       The other aspect of this that some have wondered about is \n     the sometimes cozy appearance between these groups who sue \n     the federal government and the desire by the government to \n     help pay their way.\n       Recently, several environmental groups settled with the \n     federal government over their attorney fees for suing the \n     Fish and Wildlife Service on wolf delisting efforts in \n     Montana and Idaho. The settlement agreed to by the federal \n     government will pay the groups $380,000 for their attorney \n     fees. This request for money was filed with the courts in \n     November of 2012 and the government didn't object to this \n     filing.\n       Meanwhile back at the ranch, the Wyoming Wolf Coalition \n     through its attorney Harriet Hageman, has asked the federal \n     government for their fees under EAJA. These fees, a tenth of \n     the environmental claim, have been argued over by the same \n     federal government since April of 2011.\n       Given this interesting development it certainly appears the \n     federal government, through the Justice Department, does not \n     apply justice uniformly. Perhaps the Justice Department is \n     concerned that these multimillion dollar environmental groups \n     should be paid because they have resources far beyond the \n     troublesome rancher, sportsmen, outfitters and local \n     governments and they could use the money but those other \n     entities should be denied because they are poor.\n       Perhaps they feel that almost $400,000 is not a big deal, \n     but $36,000 is a huge deal worthy of Justice Department \n     attorney time to file objections.\n       Who knows, but one thing is apparent and that is the Equal \n     Access to Justice Act is being applied less than equally by \n     the federal government. It appears that if they agree with \n     you they will send you a check, but if they do not they will \n     send you an attorney's response denying you your money.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/10/senate-section/article/S2558-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GRASSBAUGH VETERANS PROJECT\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the accomplishments of \nLTC\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\nKenneth McDonald, who is retiring this month after a distinguished \ncareer of over 28 years of service to the United States Army and the \nNation.\n  Lieutenant Colonel McDonald graduated from West Point in 1985 with a \ndegree in Civil Engineering and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He subsequently served as a platoon \nleader, support platoon leader, and executive officer in the 299th \nEngineer Battalion (Corps Combat) at Fort Sill, OK. He later commanded \nDelta Company, 20th Engineer Battalion at Fort Campbell, KY and served \nas S3 and executive officer for the 577th Engineer Battalion, Fort \nLeonard Wood, MO.\n  Throughout his career, Lieutenant Colonel McDonald deployed to Iraq \nfor Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, Kosovo, and Korea. In 2006, \nKenny volunteered for service in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and served as deputy commander, Gulf Region Division South \nDistrict, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Basrah. During his 2 year \ntour, he was responsible for over $500 million worth of construction \nprojects, including the Basrah Children's Hospital. In 2008, he and \nmembers of his team were severely wounded in an ambush while they were \ninspecting the hospital. He recovered from his wounds at Walter Reed \nArmy Medical Center and later was assigned to the West Point Warrior \nTransition Unit. While still assigned to the WTU, he requested and was \nallowed to serve as the deputy commander, New York District, U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers.\n  Lieutenant Colonel McDonald also served as an instructor and \nassistant professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental \nEngineering and the Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering at \nWest Point. In 2009, he was promoted to associate professor and served \nas engineering program director for the Department of Systems \nEngineering at West Point. During his tenure, the Engineering \nManagement Program was recognized 3 years in a row as the top \nEngineering Management Program for undergraduate education in the \nNation by the American Society for Engineering Management.\n  His military awards and decorations include the Bronze Star; Purple \nHeart; Meritorious Service Medal; Joint Service Commendation Medal; \nArmy Commendation Medal; Army Achievement Medal; Joint Meritorious Unit \nAward; Meritorious Unit Commendation; Army Superior Unit Award; Air \nAssault; Airborne; Ranger Tab; and Combat Action Badge.\n  Kenny and his wife COL Debbie McDonald, who currently serves as the \ndirector of admissions at West Point, have two grown children.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Gordon \nMoulton in honor of his retirement after 46 years of service to the \nUniversity of South Alabama. Gordon dedicated his life to the success \nof the university and its surrounding communities and served as \nuniversity president for 16 years. I am honored to call this remarkable \nman my friend and fellow Alabamian.\n  Gordon received his B.S. in Industrial Management from the Georgia \nInstitute of Technology and an M.B.A. from Emory University. He was \nalso awarded an honorary doctorate from Spring Hill College in 2006.\n  He began his service at the University of South Alabama 3 years after \nits founding in 1966 as a business faculty member and went on to launch \nthe School of Computer and Information Sciences as its first dean. He \nwas named president of the university in 1998. Gordon's numerous \nsuccesses at the university include increasing academic programs and \nscholarships, securing grants for cancer research, expanding student \nopportunities, development and renovation of various facilities, and \nthe creation of the USA Research and Technology Park which has provided \nmany jobs and opportunities for high-tech industry partnerships in \nsouth Alabama.\n  During his tenure as President, the University of South Alabama was \nable to launch ``Campaign USA,'' a highly successful fundraising effort \nthat has raised millions for the university. He also worked to form a \ncritical partnership with Infirmary Health System which has been \ninstrumental in making improvements in area health care. For his work \nin the area, Gordon was named ``Mobilian of the Year'' in 2002.\n  Over the years, Gordon and his wife Geri have donated generously to \nthe University of South Alabama, most recently presenting the \nUniversity with $3 million in order to fund cancer research at the USA \nMitchell Cancer Institute. Their generosity, compassion, and dedication \nto finding a cure for cancer is both admirable and humbling. In \naddition to funding for cancer research, they have given millions to \nfund Moulton Tower and Alumni Plaza, Geri Moulton Children's Park at \nthe USA Children's and Women's Hospital, and various scholarships and \nathletic endeavors.\n  Today, it is rare to see an individual so invested in one institution \nfor the larger part of his career, but the work that Gordon Moulton has \ndone at and for the University of the South will forever be remembered \nby its students, faculty, board of trustees, and the communities in and \naround Mobile that have benefitted from the University.\n  I congratulate him on his retirement and thank him for his decades of \nservice to one of Alabama's great educational institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/10/senate-section/article/S2559-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        FRIENDS OF THE CHILDREN\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise in support of Friends \nof the Children, FOTC, a revolutionary organization founded and based \nin my hometown of Portland, OR, that provides intensive, long-term \nmentors to highly vulnerable kids in need. FOTC takes a preventive, \nearly intervention approach that breaks the cycle of poverty and helps \nchildren grow up to be productive citizens.\n  The key to FOTC's success is its mentors, called Friends. Each Friend \nis full time, paid and professionally trained. The Friends are matched \nwith the most severely at-risk children at an early age--selected in \nkindergarten--and make a 12\\1/2\\ year commitment to each child, guiding \nthem through high school graduation.\n  Friends of the Children was founded in 1993 and is celebrating its \n20th anniversary this year. My friend Duncan Campbell, founder of FOTC, \ngrew up in poverty himself, and his persistence, hard work and \nentrepreneurial spirit continue to be a driving force behind FOTC's \nsuccess.\n  The goals for FOTC's children are both simple and profound: success \nin school with a minimum of a high school diploma or GED; avoid \ninvolvement in the juvenile justice system, and avoid early parenting. \nAnd independent research has shown that Friends of the Children is \nachieving those goals: 85 percent of FOTC graduates have completed high \nschool, despite 54 percent having a parent who did not graduate; 97 \npercent of FOTC youth are not involved in the juvenile justice system \ndespite 60 percent having a parent who has been incarcerated; and 98 \npercent of FOTC adolescents avoid early parenting despite 60 percent \nhaving been born to a teen mother.\n  Friends of the Children works because it treats every child as an \nindividual facing a set of unique circumstances, and takes a committed, \nhands-on approach to improving those circumstances. It works because it \nfocuses on one-on-one relationships using a rational, intelligent and \nproven system.\n  While headquartered in Portland, Friends of the Children now has \nchapters in four additional cities: Klamath Falls, Seattle, Boston and \nNew York. Today, I am proud to congratulate this remarkable program on \nits 20th anniversary, and look forward to celebrating many more years \nof its continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/10/senate-section/article/S2559-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2559-S2562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014--PM 7\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\nreport; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January \n30, 1975 as modified by the order of April 11, 1986; to the Committees \non Appropriations; and the Budget:\n\n\n                  THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Thanks to the hard work and determination of the American people, we \nhave made significant progress over the last 4 years. After a decade of \nwar, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home. After years of \nrecession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs. We \nbuy more American cars than we have in 5 years, and less foreign oil \nthan we have in 20 years. Our housing market is healing, our stock \nmarket is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy \nstronger protections than ever before.\n  But we know that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and \ndedication have not yet been rewarded. Our economy is adding jobs--but \ntoo many people still cannot find full-time employment. Corporate \nprofits have skyrocketed to all-time highs--but for more than a decade, \nwages and incomes have barely budged.\n  It is our generation's task to reignite the true engine of America's \neconomic growth--a rising, thriving middle class. It is our unfinished \ntask to restore the basic bargain that built this country--the idea \nthat if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get \nahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, or \nwhom you love.\n  It is our unfinished task to make sure that this Government works on \nbehalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free \nenterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of \nopportunity to every child across this great Nation.\n  A growing economy that creates good, middle class jobs--this must be \nthe North Star that guides our efforts. Every day, we should ask \nourselves three questions as a Nation: How do we attract more jobs to \nour shores? How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get \nthose jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent \nliving?\n  This Budget seeks to answer each of these questions.\n  Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and \nmanufacturing. After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our \nmanufacturers have added more than 500,000 jobs over the past 3 years. \nCompanies large and small are increasingly deciding to bring jobs back \nto America.\n  To accelerate this trend, the Budget builds on the success of the \nmanufacturing innovation institute we created in Youngstown, Ohio last \nyear, and calls for the creation of a network of 15 of these hubs \nacross the Nation. In these innovation hubs, businesses will partner \nwith universities and Federal agencies to turn regions around our \ncountry into global centers of high-tech jobs.\n  The Budget also includes new initiatives to support manufacturing \ncommunities, including a new tax credit to strengthen their ability to \nattract investments and jobs. And it expands my Administration's \nSelectUSA initiative to help draw businesses and investment from around \nthe world to our shores.\n  If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the \nbest ideas. That is why the Budget maintains a world-class commitment \nto science and research, targeting resources to those areas most likely \nto contribute directly to the creation of transformational technologies \nthat can create the businesses and jobs of the future.\n  No area holds more promise than our investments in American energy. \nThe Budget continues to advance my ``all-of-the-above'' strategy on \nenergy, investing in clean energy research and development; promoting \nenergy efficiency in our cars, homes, and businesses; encouraging \nresponsible domestic energy production; and launching new efforts to \ncombat the threat of climate change.\n  Modeled after my successful Race to the Top education reform effort, \nthe Budget includes a new Race to the Top energy efficiency challenge \nfor States, rewarding those that implement the most effective policies \nto cut energy waste. And it establishes a new Energy Security Trust \nfunded by royalty revenue from oil and gas leases to support \ninitiatives to shift our cars and trucks off oil, cutting our Nation's \nreliance on foreign oil.\n  Over the last 4 years, we have begun the hard work of rebuilding our \nNation's infrastructure. We have built or improved over 350,000 miles \nof road and more than 6,000 miles of rail. And we have repaired or \nreplaced over 20,000 bridges. But to compete in the 21st Century \neconomy and become a magnet for jobs, we must do more. We need to \nrepair our existing infrastructure, and invest in the infrastructure of \ntomorrow, including high-speed rail, high-tech schools, and self-\nhealing power grids. These investments will both lay the foundation for \nlong-term economic growth and put workers back on the job now.\n  My Budget includes $50 billion for up-front infrastructure \ninvestments, including a ``Fix-it-First'' program that makes an \nimmediate investment to put people to work as soon as possible on our \nmost urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally-deficient \nbridges across the country. And to make sure taxpayers do not shoulder \nthe whole burden, the Budget creates a Rebuild America Partnership to \nattract private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: \nmodern ports to move our goods; modern pipelines to withstand a storm; \nand modern schools worthy of our children.\n  The Budget also supports efforts I announced earlier this year to \nmodernize and improve the efficiency of the Federal permitting process, \ncutting through the red tape that has been holding back even some of \nthe most carefully planned infrastructure projects. These efforts will \nhelp us to achieve the new goal I set to cut timelines in half for \ninfrastructure projects, while creating new incentives for better \noutcomes for communities and the environment.\n  All of these initiatives in manufacturing, energy, and infrastructure \nwill help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new \njobs. But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with \nthe skills and training to fill those jobs.\n  And that has to start at the earliest possible age. But today, fewer \nthan 3 in 10 4-year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool \nprogram, and the high cost of private preschool puts too much of a \nfinancial burden on middle class families.\n  The Budget therefore includes a proposal that ensures 4-year-olds \nacross the country have access to high-quality preschool education \nthrough a landmark new initiative in partnership with the States. And \nit increases the availability of early learning for our youngest \nchildren to help their growth and development during the formative \nearly years of life.\n  Providing a year of free, public preschool education for 4-year-old \nchildren is an important investment in our future. It will give all our \nkids the best start in life, helping them perform better in elementary \nschool and ultimately helping them, and the country, be better prepared \nfor the demands of the global economy. Not only that, it could save \nhard-working families thousands of dollars each year in child care \ncosts. This is an investment we need to make, and it is fully paid for \nin this Budget by imposing a new tax on every pack of cigarettes sold.\n  The Budget also builds on the historic reforms made during my first \nterm to improve our elementary and secondary school system by rewarding \nexcellence and promoting innovation. To help ensure that our high \nschools are putting our kids on a path to college and a good job, the \nBudget includes a new competitive fund that will help redesign \nAmerica's high schools to prepare students with the real world skills \nthey need to find a job right away or go to college. The fund rewards \nschools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and \ncreate classes focusing on science, technology, engineering and \nmathematics (STEM)--the skills today's employers seek to fill the jobs \navailable right now and in the future.\n  Even with better high schools, most young people will still need some \nhigher education. Through tax credits, grants, and better loans, we \nhave made college more affordable for millions of students and families \nover the last 4 years. But skyrocketing costs are still pricing too \nmany young people out of a higher education, or saddling them with \nunsustainable debt. And taxpayers cannot continue to subsidize\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\nhigher and higher costs for higher education.\n  To encourage colleges to do their part to keep costs down, the Budget \nincludes reforms that will ensure affordability and value are \nconsidered in determining which colleges receive certain types of \nFederal aid. My Administration has also released a new ``College \nScorecard'' that parents and students can use to compare schools.\n  To further ensure our educational system is preparing students for \ncareers in the 21st Century economy, the Budget includes additional \nmeasures to promote STEM education, such as launching a new STEM Master \nTeacher Corps, to leverage the expertise of some of America's best and \nbrightest teachers in science and mathematics, and to elevate the \nteaching of these subjects nationwide. It also includes a \nreorganization and consolidation of STEM education programs to improve \nthe effectiveness of Federal investments in this area.\n  The Budget takes other critical steps to grow our economy, create \njobs, and strengthen the middle class. It implements the Affordable \nCare Act, giving every American access to the high-quality, affordable \nhealth care coverage they deserve, and reducing the deficit by more \nthan $1 trillion over the next two decades. It implements Wall Street \nreform, ending too-big-to-fail and protecting consumers against the \nabuses and reckless behavior that contributed to the financial collapse \nin 2008. And it includes measures to strengthen our housing market and \nensure that every responsible homeowner has the opportunity to \nrefinance at today's rates, saving $3,000 a year on average.\n  Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of \nstriving, hopeful immigrants. That is why I have proposed a plan to fix \nour broken immigration system that secures our borders, cracks down on \nemployers who hire undocumented workers, attracts highly-skilled \nentrepreneurs and engineers to help create jobs and drive economic \ngrowth, and establishes a responsible pathway to earned citizenship--a \npath that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a \nmeaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line \nbehind the folks trying to come here legally. The Budget makes \ninvestments that will make our immigration system more efficient and \nfair and lay a foundation for this permanent, common-sense reform.\n  The Budget also builds on the progress made over the last 4 years to \nexpand opportunity for every American and every community willing to do \nthe work to lift themselves up. It creates new ladders of opportunity \nto ensure that hard work leads to a decent living. It rewards hard work \nby increasing the minimum wage to $9 an hour so an honest day's work \npays more. It partners with communities by identifying Promise Zones to \nhelp rebuild from the recession. It creates pathways to jobs for the \nlong-term unemployed and youth who have been hardest hit by the \ndownturn. And it strengthens families by removing financial deterrents \nto marriage and supporting the role of fathers.\n  We also know that economic growth can only be achieved and sustained \nif America is safe and secure, both at home and abroad. At home, the \nBudget supports my initiative to help protect our kids, reduce gun \nviolence, and expand access to mental health services. We can protect \nour Second Amendment rights while coming together around reforms like \neliminating background check loopholes to make it harder for criminals \nto get their hands on a gun--common-sense reforms that will help \nprotect our kids from the scourge of gun violence that has plagued too \nmany communities across the country.\n  To confront threats outside our borders, the Budget ensures our \nmilitary remains the finest and best-equipped military force the world \nhas ever known, even as we wind down more than a decade of war.\n  Already, we have brought home more than 30,000 of our brave \nservicemembers from Afghanistan. Our remaining forces are moving into a \nsupport role, with Afghan security forces taking the lead. And over the \nnext year, another 34,000 American troops will come home. This drawdown \nwill continue and, by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will \nbe over. Beyond 2014, the Budget supports our continued commitment to a \nunified and sovereign Afghanistan.\n  To maintain our national security, the Budget supports our ongoing \nfight against terrorists, like al Qaeda. The organization that attacked \nus on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self. But different al Qaeda \naffiliates and extremist groups have emerged--from the Arabian \nPeninsula to Africa. We will confront these emerging security \nchallenges through the full range of U.S. capabilities and tools, \nincluding diplomatic, security, intelligence, and economic development.\n  The Budget also provides the resources we need to act on our \ncommitment to and interests in global development, by promoting food \nsecurity that reduces dependence and increases prosperity; by investing \nin the increasingly successful drive toward an AIDS-free generation; \nand by maintaining our leadership as a global provider of humanitarian \nassistance that saves lives and reflects American values.\n  We must also confront new dangers, like cyber attacks, that threaten \nour Nation's infrastructure, businesses, and people. The Budget \nsupports the expansion of Government-wide efforts to counter the full \nscope of cyber threats, and strengthens our ability to collaborate with \nState and local governments, our partners overseas, and the private \nsector to improve our overall cybersecurity.\n  The Budget also focuses resources on the Asia-Pacific region, \nreasserting American leadership and promoting security, stability, \ndemocracy, and economic growth.\n  Importantly, the Budget upholds our solemn obligation to take care of \nour servicemembers and veterans, and to protect our diplomats and \ncivilians in the field. It keeps faith with our veterans, investing in \nworld-class care, including mental health care for our wounded \nwarriors, supporting our military families, and giving our veterans the \nbenefits, education, and job opportunities that they have earned.\n  The Budget does all of these things as part of a comprehensive plan \nthat reduces the deficit. All of these initiatives and ideas are fully \npaid for, to ensure they do not increase the deficit by a single dime.\n  By making investments in our people that we pay for responsibly, we \nwill strengthen the middle class, make America a magnet for jobs and \ninnovation, and grow our economy, which will in turn help us to reduce \ndeficits. But economic growth alone will not solve our Nation's long-\nterm fiscal challenges.\n  As we continue to grow our economy, we must take further action to \ncut our deficits. We do not have to choose between these two important \npriorities--we have to do both.\n  Over the last 4 years, both parties have worked together to reduce \nthe deficit in a balanced way by more than $2.5 trillion. That is more \nthan halfway toward the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that \neconomists say we need to stabilize our finances. As we wind down two \nwars, we have protected our military families and veterans while \ncutting defense spending on outdated military weapons systems. Domestic \ndiscretionary spending is approaching its lowest levels as a share of \nthe economy since President Eisenhower was in office; and we have moved \naggressively to cut waste, fraud, and abuse. And together, we have \nbegun to ask the wealthy to do their fair share while keeping income \ntaxes low for middle class families. Overall, we have cut the deficit \nin a balanced way that protects the investments in education, \nmanufacturing, clean energy, and small businesses we need to grow the \neconomy and strengthen the middle class. There is more work to do, and \nthis Budget is designed to finish the job.\n  But we should not do it by making harsh and arbitrary cuts that \njeopardize our military readiness, devastate priorities like education \nand energy, and cost jobs. That is not how to grow the economy. We \nshould not ask middle class senior citizens and working families to pay \ndown the rest of our deficit while the wealthiest are asked for nothing \nmore. That does not grow our middle class.\n  The American people understand that we cannot just cut our way to \nprosperity. That is why I have repeatedly called for a balanced \napproach to deficit reduction. And that is why I have offered proposals \non multiple occasions that cut wasteful spending,\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\nstrengthen entitlements, and eliminate special tax breaks and loopholes \nso the wealthiest pay their fair share.\n  In my negotiations with House Speaker Boehner in December over the \nso-called ``fiscal cliff,'' I again offered a compromise proposal that \nwas balanced and comprehensive, and would achieve our $4 trillion \ndeficit reduction goal. That proposal is still on the table. I am \nincluding it in this Budget to demonstrate my commitment to making the \nkind of tough and balanced choices that are needed to put our Nation's \nfinances in order.\n  To be clear, the package I am offering includes some difficult cuts \nthat I do not particularly like. But these measures will only become \nlaw if congressional Republicans agree to meet me in the middle by \neliminating special tax breaks and loopholes so millionaires and \nbillionaires do their fair share to cut the deficit. I will not agree \nto any deal that seeks to cut the deficit on the backs of middle class \nfamilies. I am willing to make tough choices that may not be popular \nwithin my own party, because there can be no sacred cows for either \nparty. And I look forward to working with any member of Congress who \ntakes a similar, balanced approach. This plan is built on the kind of \ncommon ground that Democrats and Republicans should be able to reach.\n  In total, the Budget will cut the deficit by another $1.8 trillion \nover the next 10 years, bringing the deficit below 2 percent of GDP by \n2023 and putting our debt on a declining path. This is not an end in \nand of itself--the best way to grow the economy and cut the deficit is \nby creating good middle class jobs. But this plan to reduce the deficit \nin a balanced way is a critical step toward ensuring that we have a \nsolid foundation on which to build a strong economy and a thriving \nmiddle class for years to come.\n  Finally, this Budget continues my commitment to reforming and \nstreamlining our Government for the 21st Century. It builds on my \nCampaign to Cut Waste by further targeting and eliminating wasteful \nspending wherever we find it. It reorganizes and consolidates agencies \nand programs to make them leaner and more efficient. It increases the \nuse of evidence and evaluation to ensure we are making smart \ninvestments with our scarce taxpayer dollars. And it harnesses new \ntechnologies to allow us to do more with less.\n  No single Budget can solve every challenge and every problem facing \nthe country. But this Budget shows how we can live within our means \nwhile growing our economy, strengthening the middle class, and securing \nour Nation's future. It is not a Democratic plan or a Republican plan. \nIt is an American plan.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 693. A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the City of Hermiston, Oregon, water recycling and reuse \nproject, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce legislation \nthat will authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to share in the cost of \nthe construction of a new wastewater treatment plant for Hermiston, \nOregon. This is the same bill that was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, by voice vote, in the 111th Congress and reported by \nthe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee without opposition \nthat Congress as well. I look forward to working with supporters of \nthis bill to advance this important reclamation project.\n  The city of Hermiston will be responsible for the lion's share of \nthis project. CBO has estimated that the Federal share of the $26 \nmillion project would be $7 million or just over \\1/4\\ of the cost. \nOnce constructed, the plant will provide the Bureau of Reclamation-\nauthorized West Extension Irrigation District with enough additional \nhigh-quality water per year to irrigate approximately 600 acres of high \nvalue crops. This will have a significant, long-term benefit to the \nfarming industry in the Hermiston area.\n  The Hermiston project has gotten the sign-off at every level from the \nlocal irrigation district to Federal agencies. The city and the bureau \nhave completed the required feasibility report and the bureau of \nreclamation has formally concluded that the project meets the \nrequirements of the Title XVI cost-sharing program. The regional office \nof the National Marine Fisheries Service at NOAA has completed a \nbiological opinion approving the project. The city and the West \nExtension Irrigation District have signed a memorandum of understanding \nto work together to develop the project. The bureau has concluded its \nenvironmental review of the authorization to transfer the water to they \ndistrict and issued a finding of no significant impact, or FONSI.\n  The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation have also \nrecognized the benefits of the project and support it. These benefits \ninclude a significant improvement in the quality of water discharged to \nthe Umatilla River in winter and protection of sensitive fish habitat \nduring summer. These benefits have led the tribe to endorse \nconstruction of the Hermiston Water Recycling System Improvement \nProject and the city's effort to obtain Federal funding.\n  This project will increase agricultural production while improving \nthe local economy, the environment and habitat for endangered fish. I \nintend to\n\n[[Page S2566]]\n\nwork with colleagues to complete action on legislation that has \nadvanced so far in previous Congresses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 695. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend the \nauthorization of appropriations for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nto pay a monthly assistance allowance to disabled veterans training or \ncompeting for the Paralympic Team and the authorization of \nappropriations for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide \nassistance to United States Paralympics, Inc., and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, physical activity offers injured members \nof the Armed Forces and veterans additional opportunities for \nrehabilitation for both physical and mental health. Using the expertise \nof the United States Olympic Committee to work with local programs is a \ngreat tool to help our veterans improve their quality of life. The U.S. \nParalympic Integrated Adaptive Sports Program partners with local \norganizations to develop programs and skills that meet the needs of our \nwounded warriors. As a result of this legislation, the program has \nreached more than 5,000 participants in more than 150 communities in 46 \nStates and has successfully collaborated with 85 VA Medical Centers in \n39 States to provide adaptive sports programs to veterans in their \nlocal communities through outreach programs, training, practices, \ncamps, clinics, and competitions. For this reason, Senator Begich and I \nare introducing Veterans Paralympic Act of 2013, which would extend the \nauthorization for the U.S. Paralympic Integrated Adaptive Sports \nProgram through 2018.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 695\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reallocate Federal judgeships for the courts of \nappeals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. President, today I am introducing the Court \nEfficiency Act, a bill that will help some of the nation's busiest \ncourts. Hopefully, it will also ease some of the tension that arises \nduring debates of D.C. Circuit Court nominees. I am pleased that \nSenators Hatch, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, Lee, Cruz, and Flake are \noriginal co-sponsors.\n  It is no secret that the D.C. Circuit is the least-busy, least-worked \nappellate court in the nation. By nearly every measurement taken by the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the D.C. Circuit comes in a \ndistant last. Here are three of the most common measurements using the \nmost recent data available for the 12 months ending September 30, 2012.\n  First, ``Total Appeals Filed.'' Total Appeals Filed measures the \namount of work coming into the court. Simply put, it is the total \nnumber of appeals that a circuit court received in the last 12 months. \nThe D.C. Circuit has 108 appeals per authorized judgeship, the lowest \nin the nation. To put this in perspective, the Second Circuit is 4 \ntimes higher and the Eleventh Circuit, the busiest in the nation, is \nmore than five times as high, with 583 appeals filed per authorized \njudge.\n  Next, ``Total Appeals Terminated'' measures the amount of work the \ncourt is accomplishing. Once again, the D.C. Circuit is by far the \nlowest in the nation with 108 total appeals terminated per authorized \njudgeship. By comparison, the Second Circuit is 4 times higher and the \nEleventh Circuit is 5 times higher, at 540 appeals terminated per \nauthorized judgeship.\n  Finally, ``Total Appeals Pending'' measures the amount of work before \nthe court. In other words, it is the number of appeals the court hasn't \nyet addressed or the cases that are outstanding. The D.C. Circuit has \n120 appeals pending per authorized judgeship, which means it is \nessentially tied for last with the Tenth Circuit that has 115. In \ncontrast, the Second Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit have 343 and 323 \nappeals pending per authorized judgeship, respectively.\n  Back during President Bush's administration, my friends on the other \nside of the aisle cited the light work load of that court in order to \nblock qualified, non-controversial nominees. Since that time, the D.C. \nCircuit Court workload has only continued to decrease.\n  Considering the imbalance between the workloads of the Circuits, my \nbill essentially reallocates those vacancies to other circuits that are \nmuch busier. The Court Efficiency Act does four things. First, it adds \none seat to the Second Circuit. Second, it adds one seat to the \nEleventh Circuit. Third, it reduces the number of authorized judgeships \nfor the D.C. Circuit from 11 to 8. Fourth, it would become effective \nupon enactment.\n  Adopting this bill would be a step towards rectifying the great \nworkload disparities between the circuit courts. The Court Efficiency \nAct would ease some of the pressure on the Second and Eleventh \ncircuits. By moving just one judgeship each to the Second and Eleventh \ncircuits, we would lower each circuit's respective workload by \napproximately 7.5 percent. This reduction can be accomplished without \njeopardizing the D.C. Circuit's status as the ``least-busy Circuit.'' \nEven after the D.C. Circuit is reduced to 8 seats, it would still be \nroughly half as busy as the Circuit median in appeals filed, \nterminated, and pending per authorized judgeship.\n  I would also like to highlight several things that this bill will not \ndo. First, it would not impact the President's current nominee to the \nD.C. Circuit, Mr. Srinivasan, whose hearing occurred earlier today. \nInstead, for the remaining three seats, it removes one and reallocates \nthe other two.\n  Second, the bill would not affect the president's opportunity to \nnominate two of those Circuit court vacancies. It simply reassigns \nthose vacancies to other circuits that are clearly busier.\n  Third, this legislation will be effective immediately, rather than \npostponing until the beginning of the next presidential term, as has \nbeen in the past. Immediate enactment will empower the President to \nquickly act to alleviate some of the heavy workloads of the Second and \nEleventh Circuits.\n  The bill will also save the taxpayer a significant amount of money \nannually. Although the bill has not been scored yet by the CBO, this \nestimate is based on previous estimates offered by the CBO when it has \nscored judgeship bills.\n  The last time the D.C. Circuit had 11 nominees was the end of 1999. I \nwant to move past the disagreements over the D.C. Circuit and shift \nthese judges to circuits where there is a greater need to fill them.\n  This is a common sense bill. It moves judges to where they are \nneeded, a significant step in addressing the severe imbalance in the \nworkloads of some of these circuit courts. It saves the taxpayers \nmoney. It doesn't negatively impact the D.C. Circuit Court. It won't \naffect President Obama's current nominee, Mr. Srinivasan.

A bill to ensure that the education and training provided \nmembers of the Armed Forces and veterans better assists members and \nveterans in obtaining civilian certifications and licenses, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my first bill as \na US Senator. It has been delivered to the desk. The bill is the Troop \nTalent Act of 2013. I am pleased to note it is cosponsored by Senator \nSaxby Chambliss and Senator Max Baucus.\n  The bill begins with a problem which I know concerns all Americans, \nthe unemployment rate of our veterans. Currently, the national \nunemployment rate average is 7.6 percent, but the unemployment rate for \nveterans is 9.4 percent. That unemployment rate is particularly acute \nfor veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We can't be comfortable if we see the statistic that our veterans \nhave a higher unemployment rate than the national average. It should be \notherwise.\n  In Virginia, where one in nine of our citizens, one in nine of our 8 \nmillion citizens from birth to death is a veteran, this is a \nparticularly acute challenge. Frankly, it is only going to get worse as \nmore and more people exit military service in the drawdown from \nAfghanistan.\n  What is the reason for the veterans' unemployment rate being higher \nthan the national average? Some of the reasons have to do with medical \nchallenges and issues which are in the province of the VA. I learned of \nanother reason as I was campaigning across the State for 19 months. I \nheard stories from veterans, and they would say the following: I was in \nthe military. I was a battlefield medic. I got out of the military and \ntried to get a job as a physician's assistant or a nurse, and I was \ntold I had no credit for all my military service as I tried to \ntransition into the civilian world.\n  Another stated: I maintained Naval aviation engines for 20 years. \nThen when I finished and tried to do the same thing on the civilian \nside, I was told I had to go back and start as if I had no experience.\n  Another: I operated heavy equipment, but I was told I would need a \ncommercial driver's license.\n  Many of the members of our military--all of them are gaining skills \nalong the way, but they go into a civilian workforce where their skills \nand talents are not recognized. In some ways this is a feature of an \nall-volunteer military. When we had a draft and men were compelled to \nserve, someone departing military service would go into the workforce \nand say they were a gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps or an E-5 in \nthe Navy, and someone in the workforce would know what it was they had \ndone.\n  Today only 1 percent of our adults serve in the military. We \nappreciate what our military members do, but we don't understand their \ntechnical skills or their leadership talent.\n  This is the genesis for the Troop Talent Act of 2013. It is to make \nsure military members, while they are active, are getting recognized, \ncredentialed credit for the skills they obtain, which will help them \nget immediate traction back into the civilian workforce.\n  The True Talent Act has three pillars: The first is the credentialing \nof military members for the skills they have obtained and the sharing \nof information between the military branches about the skills they have \nwith servicemembers, the private sector, and with agencies who would \ncredential them with a civilian credential. This is the first pillar, \ncredentialing people for the skills people obtain.\n  The second pillar is a bit of a policing function. Sometimes folks \nwill prey upon people leaving the military and say: Pay me $500, and I \nwill administer a test which will give you a credential. Then it turns \nout their credential is worthless.\n  The VA had a working committee to police these credential-granting \nagencies to ensure no one was being ripped off. That committee no \nlonger is in service. This bill would restart it.\n  Finally, the last thing this bill would do would be to take one \nparticular industry sector, information technology, where there is a \nhuge need to hire people and where our military members have \nsignificant skills, and this will accelerate credentialing traction for \nthose members back into the military workforce.\n  There is a current pilot project DOD is working on with certain \nspecialties but not IT. This would seek to expand the pilot programs to \nadd IT to the list where people are credentialed.\n  In conclusion, this is about doing what the Nation should do for our \nservicemembers and making sure they receive the traction they deserve \nfor the service they provided. It is not just about the members \nthemselves, it is also about us. We have invested in our service men \nand women. They have skills, technical and leadership skills, which \nwould help our society be more successful. To the extent we do not \nallow them traction back in the civilian life, we are not only \ndepriving them, we are depriving ourselves of their strengths and \ntalents.\n  I am pleased to introduce this bill and honored to have Senators \nBaucus and Chambliss as cosponsors.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am offering legislation \ncorrecting Obamacare's definition of a ``full-time'' employee to allow \nemployees to work 40 hours a week without triggering penalties on the \nbusinesses that hire them. Currently, Obamacare defines an employee \nworking just 30 hours a week as ``full time.''\n  Because Obamacare uses an unreasonably low threshold of 30 hours a \nweek to define ``full time'' employees, some businesses are restricting \ntheir employees to no more than 29 hours of work per week, to ensure \nthat their workers are considered ``part time'' for purposes of \nObamacare. This is a consequence of the substantial penalties Obamacare \nimposes on businesses that reach a threshold of 50 ``full time'' \nemployees, unless they provide expensive health care coverage which \nmany small businesses simply can't afford.\n  The penalties imposed by Obamacare begin at $40,000 for businesses \nwith 50 employees, plus $2,000 for each additional ``full-time \nequivalent'' employee. These penalties serve as a huge disincentive for \nbusinesses to grow or add jobs, particularly for firms close to the 50-\njob trigger.\n  One Maine business I know has 47 employees, and it would like to hire \nmore but won't because of these onerous penalties. If more businesses \nfollow suit, millions of American workers could find their hours, and \ntheir earnings, cut back. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nnearly 10.5 million Americans work between 30 and 35 hours per week. \nAnother 9.7 million work between 35 and 40 hours per week. My bill will \nhelp protect these Americans who may otherwise find their hours \ncurtailed and their earnings cut as a result of Obamacare.\n  Obamacare's definition of a ``full time'' employee is completely out-\nof-keeping with standard employment practices in the U.S. today. \nAccording to the American Time of Use Survey published by the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics, the average American works 8.8 hours per day, which \nequates to 44 hours per week. Under Obamacare, working only 30 hours a \nweek is considered ``full-time''--nearly one-third lower than actual \npractice.\n  Likewise, the Obamacare definition of ``full-time'' employee is one-\nquarter lower than the 40 hours per week used by the GAO in its study \nof the budget and staffing required by the Internal\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\nRevenue Service to implement Obamacare. In that report, the GAO \ndescribed a ``full time equivelant,'' or ``FTE,'' as: ``a measure of \nstaff hours equal to those of an employee who works 2,080 hours per \nyear, or 40 hours per week for 52 weeks.''\n  During consideration of the Budget resolution last month, the Senate \nadopted my amendment calling for legislation setting a more sensible \ndefinition of a ``full time'' employee for purposes of Obamacare \npenalties. That amendment was endorsed by the National Association of \nManufacturers, and the National Education Association. The fact that \nthese two organzitions--typically thought of as bookends on the \npolitical spectrum--would agree that Obamacare's definition of a \n``full-time'' employee is broken illustrates how out-of-step it truly \nis.\n  Under my bill, a ``full time'' employee would be someone who works a \n40-hour week. This is a sensible definition in keeping with actual \npractice. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/10/senate-section/article/S2568-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 95--RECOGNIZING LINEMEN, THE PROFESSION OF LINEMEN, \n THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PROTECT THE PUBLIC \n SAFETY, AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF APRIL 18, 2013, \n                  AS NATIONAL LINEMAN APPRECIATION DAY\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON (for himself and Mr. Bennet) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Con. Res. 12\n\n       Whereas private retirement plans in the United States paid \n     out over $3,824,000,000,000 in benefits from 2000 through \n     2009, while public sector retirement plans paid out \n     $2,651,000,000,000 during the same period, with both playing \n     an essential role in providing retirement income for millions \n     of our Nation's senior citizens;\n       Whereas there are approximately 670,000 private-sector \n     defined contribution plans that are currently covering \n     67,000,000 participants, and over 48,000 private-sector \n     defined benefit plans covering 44,000,000 participants;\n       Whereas $4,700,000,000,000 is held in 401(k), 403(b), 457 \n     and similar defined contribution plans, $2,300,000,000,000 is \n     held in private defined benefit plans, and another \n     $4,900,000,000,000 is held in Individual Retirement Accounts, \n     largely consisting of funds rolled over from employer-based \n     retirement plans;\n       Whereas from 2000 through 2009, employers have contributed \n     almost $3,500,000,000,000 to public and private retirement \n     plans;\n       Whereas tax incentives are an important impetus for \n     individuals to save for retirement and for employers to offer \n     plans under our voluntary system;\n       Whereas generally, the taxation of amounts contributed to \n     pension and retirement plans is simply deferred, not lost;\n       Whereas more than 70 percent of American workers making \n     between $30,000 and $50,000 a year contribute to their own \n     retirement when covered by a retirement plan at work;\n       Whereas under current law, if business owners and managers \n     sponsor a retirement plan, they also must cover and provide \n     benefits to lower-income and middle-income employees;\n       Whereas 401(k) and similar defined contribution plans have \n     been enhanced over the years by Congress on a bipartisan \n     basis;\n       Whereas the private retirement system in the United States \n     is voluntary and is dependent on the willingness of business \n     owners and corporations to adopt and maintain retirement \n     plans; and\n       Whereas the United States system of employer-based \n     retirement savings is designed to work together with other \n     personal savings and the Social Security program to provide \n     meaningful income replacement upon retirement: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) tax incentives for retirement savings play an important \n     role in encouraging employers to sponsor and maintain \n     retirement plans and encouraging participants to contribute \n     to such plans;\n       (2) existing tax incentives have increased the number of \n     Americans who are covered by a retirement plan; and\n       (3) a reformed and simplified Federal tax code should \n     include properly structured tax incentives to maintain and \n     contribute to such plans and to strengthen retirement \n     security for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/10/senate-section/article/S2568-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2568-S2569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.
