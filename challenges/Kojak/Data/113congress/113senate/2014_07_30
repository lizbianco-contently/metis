The clerk will read the bill by title for \nthe second time.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2685) to reform the authorities of the Federal \n     Government to require the production of certain business \n     records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers \n     and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of \n     information gathering for foreign intelligence, \n     counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. I would object to any further proceedings with respect to \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will be \nplaced on the calendar.\n\n\n                          Bring Jobs Home Act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wisely noted: \n``It takes less time to do a thing right than it does to explain why \nyou did it wrong.''\n  In about 1 hour, Senators will be on the floor and have an \nopportunity to follow what Longfellow said; that is, to do the right \nthing. We have a bill that protects American jobs. The Bring Jobs Home \nAct tackles the growing problem of American jobs being shipped \noverseas. It is called outsourcing, shipping jobs overseas.\n  We Democrats are lined up against outsourcing. The Bring Jobs Home \nAct would protect about 21 million jobs in our country.\n  Today in the United States, anytime an American company closes a \nfactory or a plant in America and moves operations to another country, \nAmerican taxpayers pick up part of that moving bill. It is hard to \nbelieve, but it is true. A company moves from America, and American \ntaxpayers help them with the move. If they want to move, American \ntaxpayers shouldn't help them at all.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act ends senseless tax breaks for these \noutsourcers. It ends the ridiculous practice of American funding \noutsourcing of their own jobs.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act doesn't just fight to keep jobs here in \nAmerica, it also brings jobs back.\n  This bill provides a 20-percent tax credit to help American companies \nwith the costs of moving operations back to the United States. The \nBring Jobs Home Act will protect 150,000 jobs in Nevada. It could \npotentially save as many as 325,000 at-risk jobs in Kentucky and jobs \nall over the country.\n  Economically speaking, what else could be more important than \nensuring our working Americans' jobs are protected. Regardless of what \nRepublican leaders said and what the Republican\n\n[[Page S5076]]\n\nleader has opined, helping our constituents stay employed is our duty \nas a Senator.\n  Frankly, a vote against this bill is a vote against American jobs. \nThere is absolutely no excuse, no justification, for any Member of this \nbody to vote against this legislation. But as of late, Senate \nRepublicans have repeatedly blocked legislation, such as the Bring Jobs \nHome Act, which is good for the American people.\n  Remember, the Longfellow quote that I mentioned at the beginning of \nmy remarks: ``It takes less time to do a thing right than it does to \nexplain why you did it wrong.''\n  The wisdom of Longfellow's quote is there, and each time another good \nbill is blocked by the Senate Republicans we must think of Longfellow \nand what he said: ``It takes less time to do a thing right than it does \nto explain why you did it wrong.''\n  Each time after Republicans have voted against legislation that is \ngood for working families, an odd scene has developed on the Senate \nfloor. A procession of Republicans makes it way to the floor and \nindividually Senators begin to explain why they voted against a good \nbill, trying to explain why Americans don't deserve a fair shot. For \nexample, after voting against an increase in the minimum wage, after \nvoting against equal pay for women, after voting against cost-cutting \nenergy efficiency, and after voting against student loan refinancing, \nafter all of these votes, the same spectacle unfolds immediately after. \nThe Republicans come through that door and try to make their case.\n  All the American public wants is a fair shot at a good life. Instead \nof voting for a good piece of legislation that would benefit folks back \nhome, they spend time explaining why they did the opposite.\n  Maybe our vote today will be different. Maybe Senate Republicans will \nfinally focus on the many families depending on the jobs we are trying \nto protect. If they do, they will vote to bring jobs home. This \nlegislation is important and necessary. If they do, they will vote to \nkeep American jobs from going overseas.\n  Those of us who do the right thing and vote for this will not need to \nexplain because we have done the right thing; and that is because our \nconstituents know we work to give them a fair shot at good, secure \njobs.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The minority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            epa regulations\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Obama White House likes to pretend that its war on \ncoal is about protecting the planet. Yet his newest regulations would \nhardly do a thing to impact global carbon emissions.\n  The President's own EPA Administrator basically admitted it when she \nsaid a few years back that U.S. action alone won't meaningfully impact \nglobal CO2 levels.\n  They don't seem to care that their regulations would devastate the \nlives of whole families in my State, working-class Kentuckians who just \nwant to put food on the table and give their children a better life.\n  They don't seem to care that their regulations threaten to undermine \nKentucky's traditionally low utility rates, splinter our manufacturing \nbase, and shift well-paying jobs overseas. They don't seem to care that \nthe people who stand to be hurt most by their regressive policies are \nthose who can afford it the least.\n  As a candidate President Obama wasn't just open about his plan to \nmake American energy bills skyrocket, he was pretty cavalier about it \ntoo. For him it was a necessary sacrifice to achieve an ideological \naim.\n  But for a working mom in Ashland, KY, a skyrocketing utility bill can \nmean the difference between an annual trip to Lake Cumberland and a \ntearful apology to her kids. It can mean choosing which bills to pay \nthis month and which to put off just a little longer. It can mean \nbirthday disappointments and missed credit card payments.\n  These types of consequences may not be a big deal to the President, \nbut for many people in the country and many in Kentucky, they are a \nvery big deal. Families have had to put up with enough in nearly 6 \nyears that this administration has been in power: higher medical costs, \nstubborn unemployment, and the feeling of less opportunity.\n  What I am saying is middle-class families deserve a break. They \ndeserve to have Washington battling in their corner instead of against \nthem. That is why I keep fighting this war on coal.\n  Later this morning I will take my message to one of the \nadministration's so-called listening sessions on these extreme energy \nregulations. The Obama administration may have been too afraid to hold \na hearing anywhere near coal country, but that doesn't mean they will \nbe able to ignore the voice of my constituents. I will be joined by \nKentuckians who have had to travel hundreds of miles just to get here.\n  One of them is Jimmy Rose, the former coal miner from Pineville who \nrose to national attention with his song: ``Coal Keeps the Lights On.'' \nAs Jimmy puts it: ``Coal keeps the bills paid, clothes on the backs, \nand shoes on the feet.'' And that is true for so many in our State.\n  I will note the irony that the administration's so-called listening \nsession in Atlanta had to switch locations due to a significant power \noutage.\n  As one person put it, the power outage is either cruel irony or a \nglimpse of coming cruel reality; that is, of course, if the Obama \nadministration and the EPA are successful in their quest to end the use \nof affordable, reliable coal. It is hard to disagree.\n  The point is the President's extreme energy regulations are little \nmore than a political turnout strategy masquerading as a serious \nenvironmental policy. Not only could they end up making the environment \nworse rather than better but they threaten to hurt countless middle-\nclass families in the process while shipping American jobs overseas.\n  So they need to be stopped. The administration needs to be stopped. \nKentuckians aren't going to take this lying down. We are going to keep \nfighting back.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2569, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2569) to provide an incentive for businesses to \n     bring jobs back to America.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 3693, to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 3694 (to amendment No. 3693), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Finance, \n     with instructions, Reid amendment No. 3695, to change the \n     enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 3696 (to (the instructions) amendment \n     No. 3695), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 3697 (to amendment No. 3696), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 1 \nhour of debate equally divided and controlled between the two leaders \nor their designees.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am going to be joined shortly on the floor by Senator \nJohn Walsh of Montana and Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, who are \ngoing to speak to the bill that is pending before us.\n  Until they arrive I wish to set the context here. We are trying to \ncreate incentives in the Tax Code to bring good-paying manufacturing \njobs back to the United States, to incentivize companies that will \nbring jobs from their overseas facilities back into our country and put \nAmericans to work. How we pay for it is we reduce the current subsidies \nwhich we give to American companies to ship jobs overseas. Pretty \nsimple.\n  So the vote really comes down to the question of whether Democrats \nand Republicans in the Senate want to create an incentive in the Tax \nCode to keep jobs--good-paying jobs--in America, to build the workforce \nin America so that they have a future, and to discourage shipping \nAmerican jobs overseas. I don't know what the debate is about. I don't \nknow what Republican can go to a town meeting in any State in the Union \nand argue that this is not a good\n\n[[Page S5077]]\n\nidea. It is a very important idea, and it is one that we want to use to \nrepopulate the United States with good-paying jobs and hard-working \nfamilies getting the kind of money they deserve.\n\n  We are in the midst of a debate now--a national debate that has \ntouched the State of Illinois--about something called inversion. Most \npeople are not familiar with that term. It is a situation where, at \nleast on paper, an American company moves its headquarters and \noperations to a foreign country to avoid paying American taxes. We have \nmajor companies that are doing that. Some are considering making that \nmove. The President spoke to it last week, and I think the President \nhit the nail on the head. It isn't a question of whether it is legal; \nit is a question of whether it is right.\n  Is it right for a pharmaceutical company that is dependent on the \nFederal Government to build their company, build their products, and \nbuild their profitability, to walk away from their tax responsibilities \nin America? You don't put a successful drug on the market unless it \nstarts with research, and most research begins with our government. The \nNational Institutes of Health, for about $30 billion a year, does basic \nresearch that leads to new discoveries, new drugs. Those efforts of \nbasic research are converted into pharmaceuticals and drugs that are \nthen developed by these private companies.\n  When the private companies think they have finally found the right \ncombination, they have to submit their drug to the Food and Drug \nAdministration, which is a regulatory agency in Washington that tests \ntheir drug to make sure that it doesn't harm people and that it \nperforms as promised. It takes some time. It takes a lot of taxpayer \nmoney. But when the Food and Drug Administration then hands down its \ndecision that your drug is safe to go on the market, you have just \nreceived the most amazing endorsement possible in the world for a \ndrug--that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved it for \nsale in the United States of America. That is a ticket to success and \nprofitability, but that isn't the end. You have to protect your right \nin that drug, and to protect it you go to the U.S. Patent Office and \nmake sure there is a registration that protects your legal right to \nmake a profit on that drug and keep others from duplicating it at your \nexpense.\n  Look at the process that led to the profitability of these \nblockbuster drugs--National Institutes of Health research, taxpayer \nfunded; Food and Drug Administration approval, taxpayer funded; Patent \nOffice protection, taxpayer funded.\n  Now major pharmaceuticals are saying: Well, it sure would be nice to \nstay in America, but what we are going to do is move our corporate \nheadquarters to a European country or perhaps to the island of Jersey--\nwhich I am not sure I could find on the map--and in doing so, we won't \nhave to pay as much in Federal taxes to America.\n  Is that ingratitude? It certainly is. You have used all these Federal \nagencies to become profitable, and now you walk away from your Federal \ntax responsibility.\n  There is another side to this coin. When these companies invert and \nmove overseas, the tax they don't pay is a burden shifted to other \nAmerican companies and other American taxpayers. They are getting off \nthe hook for American taxes, but they are pushing the burden on to \nothers.\n  We have to come to grips with the reality that many major companies \nare using global commerce and global opportunities at the expense of \nAmerica. We have to encourage good-paying jobs in this country and \ncompanies that stay in this country. In our Tax Code we need to reward \nAmerican-based companies headquartered in America, with their jobs in \nAmerica, paying a good wage, good benefits, and veteran preferences. \nGive them a break in the Tax Code. Don't subsidize companies that want \nto move their jobs overseas.\n  The bill before us gets to that basic question: Should our Tax Code \nincentivize bringing jobs back from overseas or should it incentivize \nand encourage shipping jobs overseas? It is a simple vote, and I hope \nit is overwhelmingly positive and bipartisan when it comes before us.\n  We know our country can grow with the right encouragement because we \nare lucky. For those of us who were born here, we were born into one of \nthe strongest democracies in history. We were born into an economic \nsystem that creates opportunity for those who are educated and trained \nand strive to improve themselves. We also know we have a responsibility \nhere in the Senate, in the House, and in the White House to create a \ntax climate and an economic climate for that kind of growth. That is \nwhat we are trying to do with this bill--give a fair shot for American \ncompanies so they can bring jobs home and be incentivized and rewarded \nto do it and discourage the companies that do just the opposite.\n  I think this is a front-and-center issue. Good-paying jobs are the \nkey to restoring the middle class in America--something I think is long \noverdue to create an incentive for people who are struggling to see at \nthe end of that rainbow the chance to raise a family in a good \nneighborhood and a good church and parish and a good State that really \nhelps America.\n  I will be supporting this measure before the Senate this morning.\n  I yield the floor and suggest that during the quorum call the time be \nequally divided between Democrats and Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Returning Austin Tice\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to make some remarks about the \nongoing humanitarian crisis that is occurring on our southern border in \nTexas. I have spoken on this subject a number of times. Before I do \nthat, I would like to say a word about a decorated U.S. Marine Corps \nveteran, an award-winning journalist, and a courageous seventh-\ngeneration Texan by the name of Austin Tice.\n  In 2012 Austin went to Syria as a civilian. He went to report on the \nbrutal civil war that has now claimed the lives of more than 170,000 \nSyrians, caused a huge refugee crisis in Turkey, Lebanon, and in other \ncountries in that region and has destabilized that entire region. \nAustin was a strong believer in the freedom of the press and the \nimportance of letting his fellow countrymen know what was happening in \nthe Syrian civil war.\n\n  During his time in Syria his works were published in The Washington \nPost and the McClatchy News, among other news outlets.\n  On August 14, 2012, he was kidnapped and no one has heard from him \nsince. His family is understandably concerned about his well-being and \nhis whereabouts. It has been nearly 2 years and his family and friends \nstill have no idea where he is, who is holding him or what they might \nwant in exchange for his freedom.\n  I once again call on the Obama administration to do whatever they \ncan, through the resources the Federal Government has, to locate and \nsafely return Austin Tice to his family.\n  I say once again to Austin's family: We have not given up. We will \nnever give up until we find your son and bring him safely home.\n\n\n                             Border Crisis\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, 1 month ago President Obama gave an \ninterview with ABC News in which he was asked about the massive influx \nof unaccompanied minors--mainly from Central America--who are crossing \nthe southwestern American border, most notably into Texas where we have \nseen 57,000 unaccompanied children since October.\n  Unless any of my colleagues think this problem will just go away, let \nme remind everyone some of the projections are that if we don't do \nanything to deal with the causes or deal with the remedy to this \ngrowing humanitarian problem, it will get worse. Indeed, some estimates \nare that as many as 90,000 unaccompanied minors will come this year \nalone, and the number could well rise to 145,000 next year. That would \ntend to track the historical trend we have seen--both the combination \nof the impression that the Obama administration is less than serious \nabout enforcing our immigration laws, as well as this loophole in the \n2008 human trafficking law that is being exploited by the cartels which \nis helping\n\n[[Page S5078]]\n\nthem make money. This is part of their business model because they \ncharge by the head, by the child, by the person, and then they bring \nthem through these smuggling corridors from Central America, through \nMexico, into South Texas. It is a great business model for them.\n  The problem is it is a horrific experience for the immigrants who \nsubject themselves to the tender mercies of the cartels that care \nnothing about them as human beings. They rape the women, kidnap the \nmigrants, and then hold them for ransom. We know--because of the perils \nof that journey on the top of that train called The Beast--that many \nimmigrants are severely injured, some losing limbs, and others are \nkilled or die from exposure as a result of the process from Central \nAmerica.\n  I say to my colleagues who think doing nothing is an option that \npeople are losing their lives, people are being injured, and women are \nbeing assaulted. These migrants are being held for ransom and \nkidnapped. It is not compassionate to allow this to continue, but that \nis what illegal immigration looks like in 2014.\n  For those people who come into the country legally, they obviously \ndon't have to turn themselves over to the cartels--these transnational \ncriminal organizations that traffic in drugs and people. These drug \ncartels are despicable and they will prey on these migrants and those \nwho want to come to the United States. As long as it happens outside of \nthe legal system, they are going to continue to be victimized.\n  About 1 month ago the President said: ``The problem is that under \ncurrent law, once these kids come across the border, there's a system \nin which we're supposed to process them, take care of them, until we \ncan send them back.''\n\n  That is what the President of the United States said 1 month ago. Of \ncourse he was referring to a 2008 law that I referenced earlier and has \nbeen talked about a number of times. This was a law that was passed by \nessentially unanimous consent and acclimation. It was a human \ntrafficking law, but unfortunately what we didn't know at the time is \nthat the creative minds of the cartels would learn to exploit a \nloophole in the law, which treats migrants, particularly unaccompanied \nchildren, from contiguous countries differently than we treat migrant \nchildren coming from Mexico.\n  Specifically what happens is they are released after being processed \nby the Border Patrol, and they are given a notice to appear at a future \ncourt date. They are then released into the custody of a family member, \nmany of whom are not legally present in the United States themselves. \nWhat we have seen from experience is that many of them don't show up \nfor their court hearings. We don't have sufficient resources committed \nto make sure people do appear, so they melt into the great American \nlandscape and have essentially succeeded in coming to the United \nStates--outside of our legal immigration system--and staying here. As \nlong as this loophole continues to exist, they will keep coming.\n  The President was referring to this human trafficking statute that \nhas become an effective magnet for illegal immigration, and it is not \njust children who are taking advantage of it. I talked to the Secretary \nof Homeland Security yesterday morning. We have seen a huge surge in \nparents with young children as well. They are exploiting the same \nloophole because we don't have adequate detention facilities to keep \nthem safe pending any court hearing and pending repatriation back to \ntheir country of origin unless they have a valid claim for asylum or \nsome other claim for immigration relief.\n  The loophole that is in the 2008 law is effectively part of the \ncartel business model. We have colleagues who believe the compassionate \nresponse is to do nothing to close that loophole, and I hope they will \ncome to understand it is the opposite of compassion to allow this \nloophole to exist and allow the cartels to continue to use these \nchildren and other migrants as a commodity by smuggling them into the \nUnited States.\n  This situation has also overloaded the capacity of many of our local \ncommunities that have big hearts and want to treat these migrants, \nparticularly the children, with compassion, but they have become \noverwhelmed. We have seen, as these children have been warehoused in \nother parts of the country, many communities are starting to feel the \nbacklash. While people have big hearts and believe we ought to try to \nhelp people in need, particularly children, they realize that \nultimately they are the ones who will have to pick up the tab for \nhealth care, education, and the like.\n  They are also concerned about whether they will actually be able to \nassimilate these immigrants, which has always been the American way, \nand the way we have done that is through legal immigration and an \norderly immigration process which complies with the rule of law.\n  We are a nation of immigrants and we should be proud of that, but we \nshould not be proud of this uncontrolled flow of people coming into the \ncountry, exploiting this gap in the 2008 law, making money for the \ncartels, and exposing these migrants to horrific treatment, some of \nwhom don't even make it here. We should not consider that compassion; \nit is not. It is the opposite of compassion. We ought to try to do \nsomething to fix it, and we have it within our capacity to do so.\n  Earlier this week the White House Domestic Policy Council Director \nCecilia Munoz said the administration was ``absolutely interested'' in \nreforming this law to create an efficient repatriation process for the \nunaccompanied minors. Good for them. I hope that is the case, but \nunfortunately I get the sense that the people who understand this gap \nin this 2008 law--this flaw or this loophole--have not been able to win \nthe argument with the political folks at the White House who don't want \nto be seen repatriating these children back to their home country \nbecause they are worried about the upcoming election.\n  Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson has repeatedly emphasized \nto me in private as well as publicly the need to change this law and to \nestablish a more efficient system of removal to one's home country.\n  To be sure, there are going to be valid claims for asylum. If someone \nis a victim of human trafficking, they can get a T visa, they call it, \nso they can cooperate with law enforcement in the United States. If you \nare like the young boy whom I saw in McAllen, TX, 2 weeks ago--I asked \nhim where his parents were. He said they were dead. That young boy \ncould qualify for a special immigrant visa as a minor child having been \nabandoned or who is an orphan. So there are ways valid claims for \nrelief can be processed, but right now these claims are not being made \nbecause people are just melting into the great American landscape, and \nthey keep coming.\n  So Jeh Johnson understands this, Cecilia Munoz said she understands \nthis, and the President has said he understands it, and it has also had \nbipartisan support. The senior Senator from Missouri Mrs. McCaskill has \nacknowledged this issue, the senior Senator from Delaware, who happens \nto be chairman of the Homeland Security Committee Senator Carper, and \nthe junior Senator from West Virginia Mr. Manchin have all publicly \nacknowledged it, as well as Democratic representatives in the border \ndistrict in Arizona, and the No. 3 Member of the House Democratic \nleadership. All of them have acknowledged what the problem is and what \nwe need to do to fix it.\n  Let's review: President Obama described the border situation as a \ncrisis, and I agree with that; it is. He described the 2008 law, which \nI have talked about, as a problem, which it is. Some leading \nRepublicans and leading Democrats and senior members of the \nadministration believe that reforming this 2008 law is part of the \nsolution and would help resolve the crisis, which it would. They called \nupon Congress to make the necessary changes, which we should.\n  At a time of intense political gridlock in Washington, we actually do \nhave some bipartisan agreement on what we need to do to help address \nthe problem. Yet none of these critical reforms can happen in the \nSenate unless the majority leader allows a vote on the bill I \nanticipate will come over from the House which will contain a solution \nto this problem. We have seen a bipartisan group of political leaders\n\n[[Page S5079]]\n\ncontend it is necessary, if we are actually going to address it, but so \nfar my impression is the majority leader is not going to allow us to \nhave that vote.\n  Indeed, the majority leader, the majority whip, and the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee have all said they reject the need for changing \nthis 2008 law that I have described. The majority leader has gone so \nfar as to say the border is secure. It may look secure from Nevada, \nwhere he is from, but it is not secure in Texas, where I live, and it \njust defies reality.\n  I wish the majority leader and the President would actually come \nvisit the border. I wish they would visit these processing centers, \nmeet these children, and congratulate the Border Patrol for doing a \ngreat job under very difficult circumstances, but so far they have \ndeclined. I hope they will reconsider.\n  Ms. Collins, the Senator from Maine, is getting a bipartisan codel to \ngo down to McAllen on Friday, and I look forward to accompanying her on \nthat trip. But if people can make that one trip--at least one trip--\nthey would learn for themselves that the border is not secure.\n\n  This isn't a trick. Sometimes I get the feeling that some of my \nfriends in the Senate think we are going to always claim the border is \ninsecure, so we are never going to do the other parts of immigration \nreform that they want to do or that need to be done. As a matter of \nfact, in 2011 the President notably said: Well, people won't be \nsatisfied until we create a moat and fill it full of alligators. He \nridiculed those who said the border is not secure. Yet last year alone \n414,000 people were detained on the southwestern border, 414,000 from \n100 different countries--100 different countries--most of them \nadmittedly from Mexico and Central America and South America.\n  But people should come visit in Falfurrias, TX. They have a Border \nPatrol stop there where many migrants are let out of the vehicle by \ntheir coyote, which is a human smuggler, and forced to walk around this \ncheckpoint in 100-degree-plus weather. Colleagues will find that some \nof them die from exposure. People can imagine coming from Central \nAmerica or South America and coming in that hot weather under those \nconditions. Some of them literally die. So the Border Patrol has \nestablished rescue beacons, they call them, where if the immigrant says \n``I have to get some help,'' they can actually hit the button on this \nrescue beacon, and the Border Patrol will come and find them and make \nsure they get some medical care. Those rescue beacons are in English, \nthey are in Spanish, and they are in Chinese. I assure my colleagues \nthere are not many native Chinese speakers in Brooks County, TX.\n  The point is, to anybody who will listen, the border is not secure. \nIt is a national security challenge in addition to our other issues.\n  I ask people to talk to GEN John Kelly, who is head of Southern \nCommand, who says right now 75 percent of the illegal drug traffic \ncoming from Central and South America into the United States--they have \nto sit and watch because they don't have the adequate resources to stop \nit. It is the same cartels that are smuggling those drugs that are the \ncriminal organizations that are smuggling the people. They are \ntrafficking in human beings, and they will transport any commodity, any \nweapon, any person, anything into the United States as long as they can \nmake money off of it. It is just the way they do business.\n  It is enormously frustrating to hear the majority leader declare the \nborder is secure in spite of the facts and in spite of the bipartisan \nacknowledgment that we need to fix this 2008 loophole in order to help \nsolve this problem. But there are people who have shown some courage, \npeople such as Secretary Johnson and others, other Democrats who have \nsaid, despite the majority leader's pronouncement that we should \nactually do something, we should actually solve the problem, and we \nhave it within our ability to do that.\n  I wish to particularly acknowledge the courage of my friend and \ncolleague Henry Cuellar from Texas. He is a proud blue dog Democrat, as \nhe reminds me almost every time I see him, and he has partnered with me \nin bipartisan bicameral legislation that would actually fix this flaw \nin the 2008 law. If we could just get a vote on it here in the Senate, \nmaybe we would have a chance to fix the problem and do what the \nPresident acknowledged was the problem in the first place.\n  I am hopeful we can achieve a breakthrough, but we have about 2 more \ndays that we will be in session before the August recess. My \nconstituents back home don't understand why in the world we would leave \nwithout fixing this problem, without addressing this humanitarian \ncrisis, because they see the numbers as we see the numbers. They are \ngoing to continue to grow and the crisis will get worse unless we act \nin a sensible way.\n  The only way we are going to get that breakthrough is if we get some \nleadership here in the Senate and the majority leader allows a vote on \neither what the House is going to send us on Thursday or allow an \namendment, which I am proud to offer, which has broad support here in \nthe Senate.\n  But leadership requires more than just giving a speech or an \ninterview and then heading off to the next fundraiser. It requires \nthoughtful, persistent engagement and a willingness to spend political \ncapital.\n  We know all of this is controversial. We get that. But it strikes me \nthat when you are getting attacked from the right and the left, that \nmeans you are probably doing something that could at least have the \npotential for being a bipartisan consensus, which, as we know, is the \nonly way anything gets done here because none of us get everything we \nwant. I would love it if I could get everything I want, but that is not \ndemocracy. That is not our system. That is not our constitutional form \nof government.\n  I hope the President would tell the majority leader that he believes \nthis 2008 law is a problem, as he said a month ago on ABC News, and I \nhope he will offer support for his own Secretary of Homeland Security, \nwho I know understands the nature of the problem, but unfortunately I \nfear he is being outvoted by the political advisers at the White House, \nnot the people making public policy.\n  The folks in my State and particularly in the region of South Texas \nand the Rio Grande Valley are watching and waiting and hoping that \nWashington will act to resolve this ongoing crisis. But we can't act \nunless the majority leader allows us to act. That is the nature of this \ninstitution. He won't allow a vote unless President Obama steps up and \nleads in order to do what he has acknowledged is the right thing to do \nand what we must do in order to address this problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                          Medicare Anniversary\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to speak very briefly about \nMedicare.\n  Before 1965, as the Presiding Officer and many others in the Chamber \nknow, nearly half of America's seniors had no health insurance at all. \nMedicare made certain that seniors had access to affordable health \ncare, and it has lifted millions out of poverty in this country.\n  Seniors earn their Medicare benefits; they are not given to them. \nSeniors earn their Medicare benefits through a lifetime of hard work \nbecause, as we know, for all of our working lives a portion of every \nsingle paycheck is deposited and is guaranteed for benefits for when we \nturn 65. This is a bedrock commitment. We pay into it and it should be \nthere for all of us when we reach the age of 65.\n  Today we celebrate the 49th anniversary of Medicare, but I encourage \nmy colleagues to hold the balloons and cake because over the past few \nyears what we have seen down the hall in the House of Representatives \nis a group of House Members who try to continually chip away at the \npromise of Medicare. They want to turn Medicare into a voucher system. \nThey even tried to raise the eligibility age.\n  These proposals in effect shift the cost on to those who can least \nafford to pay it. They will increase out-of-pocket expenses for our \nseniors on benefits such as wellness visits, cancer screenings, and \nlifesaving drugs. These plans will allow insurance companies to cherry \npick who they want to cover, setting off a premium spiral that would \nleave sicker seniors with higher premiums and higher costs, leaving \nmany American seniors without the care they need and the protection \nthey have earned.\n\n[[Page S5080]]\n\n  These proposals we see coming out of the House of Representatives \nundermine the integrity of the program. I think it is important for us \nin the Senate to not allow them to put the health and financial \nsecurity of our seniors in jeopardy. That is why I have introduced the \nMedicare Protection Act. It is a responsible commonsense solution. It \nprevents budget schemes that would reduce Medicare benefits and \nrestrict eligibility, and it sends a strong message that Medicare \nshould not be dismantled, privatized, or turned into a voucher system.\n  The promise of Medicare is one we must keep. The Senate should pass \nthe Medicare Protection Act. I ask that we keep Medicare strong and \naffordable for today's seniors and for future generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I applaud and commend my friend the Senator \nfrom Arkansas. This is very visionary legislation. I support what he is \ndoing, and we are going to do everything we can to move forward on this \nlegislation. We would do it more quickly except we have a few problems \nwith people over here. So we are going to do our best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5080-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF JILL A.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                        Partnership With Africa\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I have never been more optimistic about \nAfrica and about the potential for a U.S. partnership with Africa than \nI am today.\n  Every year I host a conference in my home State of Delaware called \n``Opportunity: Africa'' that brings together Delawareans and Africans, \nleaders from across our country and from the continent interested in \nbuilding and strengthening new ties. Every year it has grown in \nparticipation, in the scope of issues we have looked at, and in the \nnumber of Delaware businesses interested in the opportunities in this \ncontinent of 54 countries. At this past March's conference, President \nClinton delivered the keynote.\n  The hunger to build new relationships between business, government, \nthe faith community, and those in the African diaspora is undeniable. \nWhat is required of us is to think anew and dedicate ourselves to \nbuilding partnerships of mutuality and that last. In this Chamber that \nwill mean passing a reauthorized African Growth and Opportunity Act \nthat does more to encourage and facilitate real two-way trade than the \ncurrent law and to take up and pass the bipartisan Power Africa law \nthat will strengthen investment in infrastructure and in electricity \nacross the continent.\n  Next week it means coming together with Africa's government and \nbusiness leaders to forge new relationships built on mutual respect and \nthe opportunities we share.\n  I urge my colleagues and my friends throughout the business community \nto seize this opportunity and focus on the bright future it could \ncreate. An Africa that trades with us, that can defend itself, that can \nsecure itself, and that empowers its citizens is the Africa we see, and \nthat is an Africa which we in the United States are uniquely suited to \nhelp its people build. We have already built a powerful foundation for \npartnership through our investments in public health and education, \nclean water, democracy, and good governance.\n  After 50 years in the Peace Corp and more than a decade of PEPFAR--\nPresident Bush's groundbreaking commitment to combating HIV and AIDS--\nwe are better regarded in Africa than in anywhere else in the world. \nFrom our universities, to our businesses, to our military training and \npartnerships, to the vibrant Africa diaspora community spread \nthroughout this land, we have tools no other Nation has. The \nopportunity for progress is extraordinary. By helping to build a broad \nand sustainable middle class across this continent, American workers \nand businesses will have more people to sell their products to and more \nmarkets in which to invest. The more we partner with African \nbusinesses, the stronger they will become.\n  Genuine partnerships such as this must be the foundation for our \nrelationships with Africa going forward, and we have a lot to gain as \nwell.\n  As many have commented, in the last decade 6 out of 10 of the fastest \ngrowing economies in the world have been in Africa, and that number \nwill only rise. Other countries have noticed the opportunity. China's \nexports to Africa, for instance, have outgrown ours 3 to 1 since 2000, \nand 5 years ago China eclipsed us as Africa's largest trading partner. \nSo it is no surprise that since 2000, China has hosted five summits \nwith African heads of state. Let's be clear, the Chinese, in seeking \nopportunities for this century, will not miss the ``next China.'' So we \nhave a lot of ground to make up.\n  It is also critical we recognize that we should not just mimic the \nways in which the Chinese are seeking opportunity in Africa. They bring \na policy of nonintervention in domestic affairs. We bring American \nvalues--a focus on democracy, on governance, on human rights, as well \nas the attractiveness of our technology, our resources, and the \nrelationship with our diaspora community.\n  This week we have had remarkable opportunities for our President, our \nSecretary of State, and several of us from this Chamber to meet with \nyoung African leaders as part of a program that brought 500 inspiring \nyoung African leaders to Washington.\n  Next week we will welcome more than 40 heads of state from across the \ncontinent--a summit that I hope signals the next big step in building \nstrong and sustainable partnerships throughout the continent.\n  President Obama, leaders from this Chamber, leaders from the Cabinet, \nand from across America's corporate community will join for 3 days to \nallow us to refocus our efforts on the continent, to seize this moment, \nand to move forward. It is my hope that this Chamber, this Congress, \nwill take advantage of\n\n[[Page S5081]]\n\nthe opportunity to enact the African Growth and Opportunity Act on a \nlonger reauthorization and to open it to truly balanced trade, and pass \nthe bipartisan Power Africa Act to significantly improve our investment \nin infrastructure.\n  The opportunities are limitless. It is my hope that we will but seize \nthem.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today's Wall Street Journal has an \narticle that should send shivers through every Member of this body. The \narticle reports on what the President is planning to do with regard to \nexecutive amnesty, using Executive orders to do that which Congress has \nrefused to do.\n  The article says this:\n\n       For months, President Barack Obama said there were limits \n     to his power to protect people living illegally in the U.S. \n     from deportation. Now, he is considering broad action to \n     scale back deportations that could include work permits for \n     millions of people, according to lawmakers and immigration \n     advocates who have consulted with the White House.\n\n  The President has been meeting regularly with immigration activists \nand he has been promising them things that he has no power to promise. \nHe has promised them things that constitutionally he is not able to do, \nand this Congress needs to say no to that. We can do that by simply \nbarring the expenditure of money in the future to execute such a \nscheme.\n  Congressman Blackburn in the House has offered legislation, and \nSenator Cruz in the Senate has offered legislation, which would do just \nthat. But it is not in the bill we are being asked to provide cloture \non that will come up in a few minutes.\n  The article goes on to say--just to stress the stark nature of what \nis being considered--\n\n       The shift in White House thinking came after House \n     Republicans said they wouldn't take up immigration \n     legislation. . . .\n\n  So the President is saying: I have legislation and the House will not \npass it, therefore, I am going to do it myself. It is one of the most \npathetic excuses for abuse of power by a court or a President that you \ncan imagine. Congress considered his legislation. He promoted it \nstrongly. Members of both parties have advocated for it. But the House \nconsidered it and rejected it. That is an action. That is a decision by \nthe House of Representatives. The President has no power to go beyond \nthat, and I think this Congress--this Senate--has a responsibility to \nspeak to that question and to avoid an issue. The Wall Street Journal \ngoes on to say:\n\n       An announcement is expected soon after Labor Day, an \n     administration official said.\n\n  They are going to announce this within weeks. The article goes on to \nsay that it could involve 5 million people or more, and the President \nsaid himself he would ``fix as much of our immigration system as I can \non my own, without Congress''--without Congress. I will just use my \npen. I will just order my officers, who work for me, you know. The \nBorder Patrol, the ICE officers, they work for me. I will just tell \nthem to do A, B, and C. We will just not pay any attention to the fact \nthat plain law, section 274 of the INA, says that a person in the \ncountry unlawfully is not entitled to work.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. He will just do that on his own.\n  So we are now being asked to move forward on legislation that \nprovides no opportunity to even get a vote on this issue. Certainly its \ntext does not fix this problem.\n  Let me be plain, colleagues. There are times when we have to rise \nabove politics. Maybe somebody believes in amnesty, and they would like \nto see this happen, but we cannot acquiesce in having the President \nunilaterally do so in an unlawful fashion.\n  The truth is that the people who are refusing to bring language up of \nthis kind and fix it--what they want is to see the President do this. \nThey are for it, they are supporting it, and they have rejected any \naction, so far at least, to defend the rule of law, defend the Senate, \ndefend the entire Congress's legitimate powers. It is just breathtaking \nto me.\n  So let me again say, colleagues, we need to take action. This \nCongress needs to speak. We cannot allow Executive orders to be issued \nby a President who eradicates plain law. To do so is wrong. The \nAmerican people are watching this. They are not going to be happy that \nthe Congress did not take action. Expressions of concern among Senators \nare not enough. We need to bring this up.\n  But Senator Reid, I predict, is not going to allow that to happen, \nand he is going to be supported by every Member of his Democratic \nConference. And every Member of the Democratic Conference, every Member \nwho supports him in this plan, will be, in fact, involved and \nsupportive of the President's plan.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first I would ask the Presiding Officer \nif he could notify me after I have spoken for 4 of my 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  In a few moments we are going to be voting on a very fundamental \nprinciple and a very important bill that is literally about bringing \njobs home to America. The question before us is, Are we going to begin \nto change the incentives in the Tax Code where instead of incentivizing \njobs being shipped overseas, we are going to support our companies that \nare bringing jobs home?\n  This is a no-brainer. I think anybody listening to this debate, \nanyone across America who is focused in, would say: Why were you not \neven just having a voice vote and everybody voting yes and then go on \nto the next tax policy, like inversion, that we need to be dealing with \nthat will keep jobs in America?\n  Unfortunately, we have had to go through a lot of procedures, motions \nto proceed. We are now having to go through a supermajority vote here \nto get to the final bill. I hope colleagues will join us in a \nbipartisan way to vote to get to the final vote on this bill so we can \nmake it very clear we are on the side of American workers and American \nbusinesses.\n  Here is what we have seen in the last few years, as shown on this \nchart. In the last decade we have lost 2.4 million jobs being shipped \noverseas. Now that, by the way, does not count the ones that are \nleaving on paper right now, which is a whole other story. That is \nsomething we need to be deeply concerned about and speaking out about \nand calling people out on it. But these are the jobs where they are \npacking up shop and moving overseas.\n  To add insult to injury, not only does a worker lose their job, the \ncommunity loses the factory or the business, but we as American \ntaxpayers foot the bill for the move.\n  Now, that is shocking. When you explain to people that is in the Tax \nCode--yes, when you pack up shop, you do all the moving, you ship your \njobs overseas, you can write that off on your taxes and we all pay for \nit--they probably look at us like we are crazy. And they are right. We \nhave been trying to close this now for the last few years. This is the \nopportunity in just a few moments to have that vote to get it done.\n  What are we going to be voting on specifically? It is very simple: \nend the taxpayer subsidies that pay for moving costs of corporations to \nship jobs overseas. On the other hand, if you want to bring your jobs \nhome, we will gladly allow you to write off the costs of bringing jobs \nhome. On top of that, we will give an additional 20-percent tax credit \nfor the costs of moving production back to the United States.\n  The good news is we actually have companies, for a variety of \nreasons, that are moving jobs home. We want to applaud them. There are \na lot of reasons for that in a global economy: shipping costs, low \nnatural gas costs that we want to keep low so we have affordable energy \nand we continue to bring manufacturing back. We have the most \nproductive, skilled workforce in the world. There are a lot of reasons \nwhy companies now are bringing jobs home.\n  But a lot of companies are right on the edge. They look at the Tax \nCode, and they are making decisions about whether they are going to \nmove overseas or stay, whether they are going to\n\n[[Page S5082]]\n\nbring jobs home. The bill we are voting on--and I want to thank Senator \nWalsh for his leadership. He has been a passionate advocate in talking \nabout it from a Montana perspective. And the two great M States are \ninvolved here--Montana and Michigan. We both understand deeply about \nthe fact that you are not going to have a middle class unless you make \nthings in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has now consumed approximately 4 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  We have to make things and grow things, and this is about making sure \nit is in America when we make things and grow things so we have a \nmiddle class. But the reality is we have to start in the Tax Code by \nmaking it clear we are not going to incentivize moving your jobs \noverseas. We are not going to incentivize somebody packing up--and, by \nthe way, oftentimes those workers end up having to train their \nreplacement. We have many stories in Michigan where the replacement \nworkers in another country are flown into our country and trained by \nour people, to take their jobs; and then, to add insult to injury, they \npay for the move through the Tax Code. So it is very simple.\n  I am going to turn to Senator Walsh to close off this debate. But we \nhave a very simple message. If you want to bring your jobs home, we are \nall in. You can write off the cost of that move and we will give you an \nextra 20-percent tax cut. But if you want to ship your jobs overseas, \nyou are on your own.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. WALSH. Madam President, I rise today to thank my Senate \ncolleagues for joining with American workers and voting overwhelmingly \nto consider the Bring Jobs Home Act. I want to particularly thank my \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, for her tremendous \nleadership and work on behalf of America's working families.\n  The vote last week was a procedural vote, but it was an important \nsignal that job creation here at home can be a bipartisan issue. I am a \nstrong believer in reaching across the aisle to promote good ideas. We \nare not here to represent our parties, we are here to represent our \nconstituents. I made a promise to Montanans that I will support good \nideas from anyone and any party as long as they grow our economy and \ncreate jobs.\n  Unfortunately, since I joined the Senate 5 months ago, what I have \nmostly seen in Washington is the opposite. What I have seen in \nWashington are people playing games. Washington is not broken because \nthere are not good ideas out there; Washington is broken because not \nenough people reach across the aisle to find common ground. I have \ninsisted from the start that the Bring Jobs Home Act is a bill that \nboth Republicans and Democrats can get behind. We must not let partisan \npolitics and gamesmanship jam up the process.\n  The American economy is recovering from the long and deep recession. \nMany Americans are still out of work and are desperately seeking the \nstability and security that comes with a job and a reliable paycheck. I \nam committed to leveling the playing field for American workers.\n  It is time for us to come together and show American workers we are \nfighting for them, for their jobs, for their families, and for a better \neconomy.\n  I have heard from some of my colleagues who have commented on the \nfloor that we should only consider the Bring Jobs Home Act in the \ncontext of comprehensive tax reform. That is not good enough. The \nanswer to disagreements is not to do nothing, the answer is to start \nwith manageable, commonsense reforms that everyone can get behind.\n  Montanans understand this. They know it is wrong that American \nworkers subsidize corporations' decisions to pack up businesses in the \nUnited States and send our jobs packing. Imagine an American worker \nwhose final task before being laid off is to help shut down operations \nso his job or her job can be sent overseas. That is baloney. If \nCongress cannot come together to end that subsidy, then we deserve the \nlow approval ratings we are receiving.\n  Millions of American jobs have been sent overseas in recent decades. \nToo many large corporations have opened factories in countries such as \nChina or Mexico while closing factories right here in the United \nStates. We need to do what we can to stem the tide and reward companies \nthat bring jobs back to America.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act will help do that. My bill closes the \nloophole that some multinational corporations use to claim a tax \ndeduction for the cost of moving jobs overseas. It also creates a new \n20-percent tax credit for companies that bring jobs back to the United \nStates. These two parts complement each other. The first ends the \nincentive for shipping jobs overseas. The second encourages the return \nof jobs we have already lost.\n  Our Tax Code should not reward outsourcing. What we need is more \ninsourcing. Many companies are considering bringing jobs back home \ntoday. This is especially true in the manufacturing sector. The Bring \nJobs Home Act could make a difference for some of those companies to \nreinvest in America and American workers. So today I urge my colleagues \nto stand with America's workers and pass this bill. Now is the time for \nleadership to embrace good ideas that help create jobs in Montana and \nall across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak on the pending \nbusiness before the Senate.\n  The Senate just achieved cloture on the motion to proceed to the \nemergency supplemental funding bill. Let me explain to the people who \nare watching this either in the gallery or on C-SPAN.\n  The Senate has creaky rules, and these creaky rules are to make sure \nwe can cool the passions that may be raging in the Nation at any given \ntime so we can duly give consideration, that\n\n[[Page S5084]]\n\ndebate can be diligent and we won't be gripped by the fire of the \nmoment or the passion of the motion. I appreciate that. However, now \nthese rules require us to take a lot of time to get to the meat of the \nmatter.\n  We are now debating a motion to proceed to legislation related to \nsupplementing existing funding to meet new emerging crises. The Senate \nvotes on a motion to proceed not to the bill itself but on whether we \nshould even go to the bill. So what we are debating now is whether we \nshould proceed to the emergency supplemental funding bill. I want to \nsay yes. Yes, vote on the motion to proceed. Let's get on with it. \nLet's have a real debate on real issues. Thirty hours has been set \naside to debate whether we should proceed. I am here to say let's \nproceed, let's yield back our time, and let's get on the bill. We have \na lot of things we need to get done in the next 48 hours. I want to see \nthis emergency supplemental funding bill debated and voted on.\n  We have three elements in this bill that meet compelling needs--need \nfor our neighbors in our country; need for our treasured ally, the \nState of Israel; as well as need for a crisis at the border where \nchildren literally are marching across Central America in search of \nrefugee status. We need to deal with all three of these issues.\n  This emergency funding bill is about neighbor helping neighbor.\n  First of all, it is about our own country. Wildfires are raging in \nthe West. Over the last year 39 States have faced wildfires. Right this \nvery minute eight Western States are coping with unbelievable \nwildfires, some of the largest fires in their history. What happens? \nVast amounts of territory are going up in smoke. We are losing towns, \nbusinesses, homes. Our firefighters are worn out, as well as our first \nresponders, and they need help. This legislation will provide $615 \nmillion to the States facing this horrific Armageddon-like emergency.\n  In addition, this legislation includes $225 million to replenish the \nrockets that are being used by Israel, deploying technology called the \nIron Dome. The Iron Dome is a missile defense system that is destroying \nthe rockets being sent into Israel by Hamas. The technology is working, \nbut they are using up the rockets and they need to be replenished.\n  Then there is the humanitarian crisis at our border. We have $2.7 \nbillion to meet the needs of children seeking refuge, in order to be \nable to deal with placing them while we determine their legal status \nbut also being able to fight the crime of the narcotraffickers and the \nhuman traffickers who are creating this surge of children.\n  This is a total emergency funding level of $3.57 billion. Why do we \ncall it an emergency? Well, because under the law we can't just say \nthis is an emergency. In order to get emergency funding, we have to \nmeet the criteria of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The need has to be \nurgent. It has to be temporary. It has to be unforeseen. It is either \nto prevent the loss of life or in the interests of our national \nsecurity. All three of these areas of funding meet this need.\n  Under emergency funding, there are no offsets. That means we don't \ntake from another important program being funded by the U.S. Government \nto meet that need. So in order to meet the needs of Iron Dome, we don't \ntake from other national defense money. It will replenish that. When we \nhelp with wildfires, we don't take from other important areas, such as \nagriculture or interior or from other bills. This will help to not only \nmeet the need but also not place an additional burden on other \ncommunities.\n  Now I wish to speak about the urgency. This firefighting help is \nreally needed now. We listened to the Senators from Western States. We \nsee the photographs literally showing parts of our country going up in \nsmoke. The Forest Service--the agency that actually is in charge of \ndealing with this--will run out of money in August. As I said, last \nyear these wildfires burned in 39 States.\n  Then we look at Iron Dome. Hamas--this violent terrorist organization \nthat actually rejects Israel's right to even exist--from its tunnels is \nshowering Israel with rockets. Iron Dome, Arrow Head, and David's Sling \nare missile defense systems designed to help them. The up-close missile \ndefense system is Iron Dome. This bill will make sure we replace the \ninterceptor rockets that are being used to protect them against this \nshowering of rockets. The Israeli Embassy spoke to my staff yesterday. \nThere have been over 2,000 Hamas rockets fired in the last week. Israel \nneeds to replenish these rockets.\n  Then there is the issue of the surge of unaccompanied children \npresenting themselves at our border, asking for refugee status. In \norder to really be able to meet this crisis--and they are coming in by \nthe thousands; 59,000 kids have come this year. We know the immigration \nand customs service, if we don't meet this emergency funding, will run \nout of money in August. Border Patrol will run out of money in early \nSeptember. That doesn't mean the Border Patrol agents or the \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents will stop working; it means \nthe Department of Homeland Security--22 agencies--will take money out \nof existing funds to fund this. So it means they could take money out \nof Federal emergency management just as we are going into hurricane \nseason, just as we are in high tornado season. We could be taking money \nout of FEMA to put it in Border Patrol unless we do this emergency \nfunding. We have to do it.\n  Health and Human Services runs out of money in August. They are the \nones in charge when the children present themselves while their legal \nstatus is being determined. The children must be taken care of in a \nhumane way, the American way. We don't treat children in an abusive \nmanner. It means we will feed them, we will clothe them, we will \nshelter them, we will meet any emergency health needs they have, and we \nneed to do that while we determine their legal status.\n  My bill--the supplemental I am presenting--helps accelerate the \ndetermination of their legal status. My legislation and this \nsupplemental spending actually provide more immigration judges and \nlegal representation for the children. That is so we can quickly \ndetermine if they have a right to asylum while we are also taking care \nof them. We need to be able to do that.\n  I hope others will get the briefings that I had and visit the border \nthe way I did to find this out. The reason we have a crisis at the \nborder is because we have a crisis in Central America. This legislation \nprovides the money to do this. People say root causes such as poverty \nhave been going on for years. This doesn't only deal with poverty. We \nwant to work with the governments of Central America to really go after \nthe narcotraffickers, the human traffickers, and the coyotes engaged in \nsmuggling.\n  Why do we want to do that? If we ask these children where are the \nhome towns they are from, they will give us the names of little cities \nand little towns, and when we look at their poverty rate, we find the \npoverty rate in these communities has been consistent for a number of \nyears. That is a sad circumstance. But when we look at the crime rate, \nthe murder rate, the recruitment into violent gangs, the recruitment \ninto human trafficking, with the threat of death or torture--that is \nwhere these kids are coming from.\n  We have to go after the criminals in Central America and not treat \nthese children as though they are criminals. We cannot treat children \nin this country as though they are the criminals. We need to go after \nthe real criminals in Central America using our assets and working with \nthe assets in Central America. They have programs and they have plans. \nHonduras is a great example of what they are trying to do. They need \nour help. If we don't want the crisis at our border, we need to deal \nwith the crisis in Central America.\n  That also deals with our insatiable, unending, vociferous appetite \nfor drugs. The drugs have created the narcoterrorists. Once people \nstart selling drugs, they are willing to sell women and children like \ncommodities, and if they are willing to sell women and children like \ncommodities, then that is where the vial, repugnant practice of human \ntrafficking and human smuggling and even a new form of slavery--sexual \nslavery--begins.\n  These children are on the march. And when we talk to these children, \nwe learn they are terrific children. They are brave and gutsy. When we \ntalk to the boys, we learn they don't want to be part of the gangs. \nThey want to get\n\n[[Page S5085]]\n\nout. They want to get out, so they start this long march from their \nhome country to Mexico to make it on the Rio Grande on rafts and by \nswimming and so on so they can make it to our border. When we talk to \nthe girls, we learn the girls want to go to school and get an \neducation. They don't want to be recruited into these vial \ncircumstances. These are earnest, hard-working children who want to \nhave safety, who want to have a future, and we want to be able to see, \nby interviewing them, if they qualify for refugee status. If they \ndon't, they will have to go back home, but if they do, they get to stay \nhere. So they deserve the protection under law. We need to pass this \nlegislation.\n\n  This bill is a funding bill. It does not include immigration \nlegislation. We say those kinds of things can either be brought up in \nanother way or another method, but this is a clean funding bill. When I \nsay ``clean,'' it means it has no legislative language on it related to \nimmigration. So I hope we can pass this legislation.\n  Now, I have listened to my own constituents, and many of them are \nsaying to me: Hey, Barb, we are not against these kids. In fact, recent \npolling says 69 percent of the American people say if they are \nrefugees, we should take care of them and they have a right to \ndetermine their legal status. But many of my constituents say: Hey, \nBarb, what about us? What does this mean? You are going to spend more \nmoney? What about my schools? When do we get help? My kids need help. \nThey need schools; they need health care. You talk to families now. \nThey are getting ready to go back to school. Many parents cannot wait \nfor sales-tax-free day in Maryland, where you can get your backpack and \nyour school supplies and your little clothes and shoes. My God, the \ncost of kids' shoes now is a small fortune, and they will outgrow them \nby the time they get to Thanksgiving. Parents are looking for bargains, \nfor deals, to be able to do this. They are not hostile, but they wonder \nabout them.\n  I want to say to them, I hear you. I was touched by a very poignant \nstory over the weekend about how we have a food bank at Steelworkers \nHall in Baltimore. Bethlehem Steel closed. It will never, ever, ever \ncome back. The steelworkers of America, who contributed to the United \nWay, were always the first in line if a blood bank was necessary. Now \nmany of those who lost their job are using the very food bank that they \nonce donated to.\n  That story was so moving because we have lost our manufacturing. We \nhave just lost a bill earlier today on bringing jobs back home--\nsomething I know the Presiding Officer is for, I sure am for, and so \non. So I know American families are hurting. Yes, they are. But I want \nto bring out that the cost of this bill is the same amount of money as \nwe are going to spend on training the Afghan National Security Forces. \nDid you know that? So we are going to spend $4 billion--that is \n``billion'' as in ``Barb,'' not ``million'' as in ``Mikulski''--$4 \nbillion to train the Afghan National Security Forces. I am not going to \ndebate the merits of that. But we can spend money all over like that \nand we cannot spend money at our border and also for threats to our \nborder because of narco terrorism that breeds other vile, repugnant, \nheinous behavior? I think we have to get real here.\n  The reason I want a supplemental--that is urgent and meets that \ncriteria--is that we do not have to take the money from other important \nprograms that do help America's families in education, in health, in \njob retraining in order to bring our jobs back home.\n  So I really do hope we pass this bill. Not spending money will not \nsave money. It means we will just take out of existing programs and the \nAmerican people will pay for it doubly. They will pay for it through \ninaction, which will ultimately cost more. They will pay for it because \nthey will lose programs they thought they were going to have access to \nor there will be limited availability.\n  We have a chance here now to help our neighbors in our Western \nStates. I know Wisconsin has been hit by it terribly, and we are so \nsorry for the loss of property and the danger to that community. It \nwill help a treasured ally, Israel, which we must. Also, we will help \nour own country. The way to protect our border is two ways: fight it in \nCentral America and also show what we stand for. If children are \napplying for refugee status, they should have their day in court and \nunder the law proceed.\n  So, Madam President, we are now on this motion to proceed. Let's get \non with it. Let's yield back our time. Let's get to the bill. Let's get \nthe job done. I hope at the end of the day the vote will be ``yes.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I want to talk principally in the next \nfew minutes about a bill that Senator Boxer and I have introduced this \nweek on Israel and talk about what is going on in Israel, but on the \nwork that is the bill before us right now, I am always hesitant to \ndisagree with the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, my \nchairwoman, my good friend, Senator Mikulski. I just think we are \nheaded in the wrong direction here.\n  Providing money, and not trying to solve this problem, not sending \nthe right message, I think is a mistake. People are leaving these \ndangerous countries--if they are dangerous to be in, they are also \ndangerous to travel through, they are dangerous to leave.\n  One of the concerns I have had during this whole debate is how many \nkids leave their home country and never get to the American border? \nWhat happens to those kids? We have heard stories in briefings that \nwere not classified about kids who never get here because they get sold \ninto some sort of terrible situation, even kids whose organs are \nharvested and sold that way. This cannot be something we need to \ncontinue to encourage.\n  In fact, if you do qualify for asylum in the United States, there is \na way to do that. That is why we have embassies. That is why we have \nconsulates. Surely, it is safer for someone in Guatemala City to go to \nthe American Embassy in Guatemala City than it is to leave Guatemala \nCity and try to come through their country, through other countries, \nthrough Mexico to get here, under the control of people who have tried \nto make the most of the President's announcement that if you get here, \nyou can stay here.\n  This is not the Red Cross bringing kids here. This is not some \naltruistic group bringing kids here. These are people who are taking \nadvantage of misinformation in their country about what happens if you \nget here. And some of these kids do not get here. Doing this in this \nway--money without policy; acting like somehow it does not cost \nanything if it is an emergency, and so we can continue to do everything \nthe chairwoman mentioned that needs to be done in the United States, \nbut we can also do this because it is a supplemental, it is an \nemergency, and it is more money we borrow from somebody else--life is \nfull of choices, and for our government we have choices.\n  There are things that need to be done right now to send a message: Do \nnot leave your home country. The door is not wide open, no matter what \nthe President's announcement in 2011 led people to believe.\n  The law needs to be changed so that immigrants from all countries \ncoming to our borders are treated just like immigrants from Mexico and \nCanada coming to our borders. They have an immediate hearing within 7 \ndays or so. Almost all of them are told: You have to go back. Once that \nhappens, almost all of them stop coming.\n  It would be a mistake to do this in this way, and I believe this bill \nnever winds up on the President's desk. The House of Representatives \ndoes not share this view, even if a majority of the Senate does.\n  We need to send a message to Guatemala, to El Salvador, to every \nother country that the door is not open. Just getting here is not \nenough. This is not a safe ``Disneyland-type'' ride to the United \nStates of America. This is a very, very dangerous thing for you to try \nto do, and you should not try to do it. When you get here, it is not \ngoing to be successful.\n  Again, let me say, if you have a case that you should have asylum in \nthis country, there is a way you do that which is much safer than \nshowing up at the border. We should not encourage the danger that these \nkids go through. I think the case is very dramatic on the side that \ncares for the lives of these\n\n[[Page S5086]]\n\nkids. We should send the message strongly and now: Do not come the way \nyou are coming now. The kids who get to the border--we are concerned \nabout what happens to them as a country because of who we are. We \nshould be equally concerned about the kids who never get to the border \nbecause of this false message we have sent.\n\n\n                 U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership Act\n\n  But, Madam President, let me spend a few minutes talking about a bill \nthat Senator Boxer and I introduced this week, the U.S.-Israel \nStrategic Partnership Act of 2014. This is an updated version of \nlegislation we first introduced in March 2013.\n  This bill that was introduced this week is already backed by more \nthan three-quarters of the Senate. I am hoping we figure out how to get \nthis done and get this done this week. There has never been a more \nimportant time to send a message to the world and to Israel about this \nrelationship, about what it means to us, about how committed we are to \nit.\n  This legislation reaffirms our unwavering commitment to Israel's \nsecurity and the strong relationship that goes back to the founding of \nIsrael. It supports deepened U.S.-Israel cooperation on defense, \nincluding continued U.S. assistance for the Iron Dome. By the way, the \nIron Dome assistance in the Defense appropriations bill that the \nAppropriations Committee approved, that is the way to fund the Iron \nDome. Do the work for the fiscal year that begins October 1. We are 2 \nmonths and a couple days from the time this fiscal year is over. We \nshould be having bills on the floor that talk about the Iron Dome, but \nit should be the Defense bill. It should not be some bill that we are \ntalking about because we are unwilling to go through the regular \nprocess.\n  But we do in this bill talk about the Iron Dome. We reiterate our \nsupport to negotiating a settlement, a political settlement that the \nGovernment of Israel is for where you would have two states, but both \nof those states have to recognize each other. You cannot have two \nstates where Hamas and others that are significant parts apparently now \nof the coalition on the other side deny that Israel has a right to \nexist. But we do support the Israeli concept that we want to have two \nstates peacefully coexisting. That is reiterated here. But it is also \nclearly understood that you cannot have one of those states say the \nother one does not have a right to exist.\n  We have a longstanding relationship here. Really it dates back to the \nvery moment that Israel was founded. My fellow Missourian, President \nTruman, in great leadership, decided we would immediately recognize \nIsrael, and that moment, that decision, that commitment from the United \nStates continues today through security, through energy, through trade. \nWe would like to make that clear and make that clear this week.\n\n  What does the U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership Act do?\n  First of all, it authorizes an increase of $200 million in the value \nof U.S. weapons held in Israel, to a total of $1.8 billion. What does \nthat mean? Does that mean we are spending $200 million more? No. It \nmeans we are putting more of our equipment in Israel, with the clear \nunderstanding that it is there for us to use in the time of a crisis. \nIt is also there for Israel to have access to when they need it. And \nwhen they use it, they pay us back and replenish that stockpile that we \nhave strategically placed in Israel for our future use and for an \nimmediate challenge to Israel where they may need to look at that \nstockpile of our weapons there.\n  It requires the administration to take steps to include Israel in the \ntop-tier category for license-free exports. The top-tier category of \nlooking at the technologies we share with any other country we would \nsuggest you should also be able to share with Israel. If they are \nuniquely held in our country, technologies that we do not want to share \nwith anybody, they are not considered in that category.\n  It authorizes the President to carry out cooperation between the \nUnited States and Israel on a range of policy issues. They include \ndefense; water, things like the water salinization efforts that Israel \nis, frankly, ahead of us in and we need to understand, as we look \nforward to water needs; homeland security, alternative fuel \ntechnologies, more cooperation in cyber security. All those things are \nauthorized in this bill.\n  There is new language that encourages the administration to work with \nIsrael to help the country gain entry status in the Visa Waiver \nProgram, which would make it easier for Israeli citizens to travel to \nthe United States without first having to get a waiver, but it would \nalso make it easier for people in our country to go there.\n  It requires the administration to provide more frequent and more \ndetailed assessments of the status of a qualitative military advantage \nthat we have committed that Israel would always have. This bill that \nSenator Boxer and I have introduced just says we are going to check \nthat even more often and in more detail to be absolutely sure in that \ntroubled part of the world that Israel's adversaries look at Israel and \ncan clearly understand that Israel has an advantage that makes up for \nthe difference in its size.\n  It strengthens the collaboration between the United States and Israel \non energy development. It encourages increased cooperation in academic, \nbusiness, and governmental sectors.\n  This legislation amends previous legislation related to how people \ncan travel between our two countries. We do have a unique situation. In \nthe recent fighting in Israel, two American citizens, members of the \nIsraeli Defense Forces with dual citizenship in this country and in \nIsrael, were killed in that fighting. This is one of the unique \nrelationships we have in the world where people actually leave our \ncommunities, go to another country they also care about, fight in the \nuniform of that country, because this country is our ally. We need to \nlook for ways to continue to emphasize that.\n  It authorizes but does not require the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to waive the \nnonimmigration refusal rate requirement for Israel, but only if Israel \nmeets all of the other program requirements, and then it is still \nauthorized but not required.\n  This is a particularly important time to send this message. This is \nan important time to send this message of continued support between our \ntwo countries. Israel--we see, looking at the Gaza situation today, \nduring recent months uncertainty in Egypt, support from terrorist \ngroups all over the world, weaponry, missiles taken into Gaza, money \nthat could have been spent on concrete that could have been used to \nbuild houses, schools, hospitals, and places for jobs, was used to \nbuild tunnels so that people could come into Israel and attack Israel.\n  Certainly the Government of Israel and the citizens of Israel look at \nthis moment and think: No time to quit now with this job partially \ndone. Some of the messages that have been sent from our country have \nnot been helpful and encouraging in regard to what has to happen in the \nmiddle of this conflict.\n  But this kind of legislation sends a message, the message we should \nsend. I hope we can get to it this week. I am pleased that three-\nquarters of our colleagues--I think that number is right at 80--have \ncosponsored this legislation. The legislation was just introduced this \nweek. So if there is any question to our friends in Israel, and maybe \nmore importantly others around the world, where the Senate, and \nhopefully by the end of the week the Congress, stands, this action \nsends that message. I cannot think of a more critical time to send that \nmessage. I hope we see this bill on the floor and send that message \nthis week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise today to speak in \nfavor of a critical issue for Coloradans; that is, fighting, \nmitigating, and recovering from wildfire. Recent history has shown my \nState that there is no greater threat to our communities, water \nsupplies, and our special way of life than wildfire. Successive \nmegafires over the past few years have broken records faster than they \ncan be written down.\n  Even today's flash floods in recently burned areas are a reminder \nthat after the embers of wildfires have cooled, their destruction \nlingers for months and years. I used to joke that Coloradans were \nstrong and prepared for anything, come hell or high water. But I had no \nidea that the past several years would bring both, with modern\n\n[[Page S5087]]\n\nmegafires and floods devastating thousands of households and \nbusinesses. We have endured these tests, and we have communities all \nover the State, such as Black Forest, that are rebuilding. But these \nrecent disasters and the fires burning today in Colorado, California, \nWashington, and across the West show that the status quo is \nunacceptable. The cost of inaction for homeowners and first responders \nalike is too high to not act. That is why I have come to the floor \ntoday to speak in favor of a few smart, bipartisan, and fiscally \nresponsible bills that are in front of our Congress right now.\n  These bills, taken together, address wildfires in a comprehensive way \nby attacking the problem before, during, and after a fire. So if I \nmight, I want to share some of the elements in these important pieces \nof legislation.\n  First, I want to focus on what we can do before a wildfire at the \nindividual and community level to reduce risk. There are many studies, \nnumerous studies, that single out the most important factor in \nprotecting homes. That is, if you do mitigation work. You involve \nyourself with ignition-resistant construction techniques. You reduce \nhazardous fuels around your home.\n  That is one of the reasons I introduced the commonsense legislation \nthat is entitled the Wildfire Prevention Act of 2013. It will help \nhomeowners in communities better reduce the risk of wildfire damages \nupfront. I am very pleased that the bill is moving forward in a \nbipartisan fashion. I am working with Senator Inhofe as my Republican \npartner. In the House, two Members of our delegation from Colorado, \nCongressmen Polis and Tipton, have joined with their California \ncolleagues to lead this bill through the House. That is what Coloradans \nexpect from their elected representatives, collaboration for the good \nof our State and country.\n  This bill is a game changer, not just in my State but across fire-\nprone communities in the West and increasingly in other parts of our \ncountry, the upper Midwest, the Northeast, Florida. You name it, \nwildfire has continued to be a threat more broadly across our country.\n  What this act will do, the Wildfire Prevention Act, is it will allow \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to provide hazard \nmitigation grants to States and localities to implement these \nmitigation projects. These mitigation projects will help put Colorado \ncommunities and public lands managers on the offensive. We put our \ncommunities and our public lands managers in front of the threat of \nmegafires. We can head them off before they even start. It is an idea \nthat came from Colorado. It is more than just a commonsense idea; it is \na fiscally responsible approach to dealing with the threat of wildfire.\n  Why do I say that? Well, studies show that for every dollar you put \non hazard mitigation upfront, it saves an average of $4 down the line \nif you have to fight a fire. For that reason, and the other ones I \nmentioned, I am going to keep doing everything I possibly can to move \nthis bipartisan bill to the President's desk this year.\n  The second point I want to make and discuss with colleagues is that \nwe must fundamentally change and modernize how the Federal Government \nfunds wildfire-suppression operations. That is another way of saying \nfighting fires, wildfire-suppression operations. The rising severity of \nmodern fires has caused land management agencies to divert resources \naway from the critical fire prevention efforts I just described to \nfight fires that are already burning. This is a vicious self-\nperpetuating cycle that is called ``fire borrowing,'' which then only \nincreases the risk of catastrophic fires later.\n  It is a backwards way of budgeting. It is classic robbing Peter to \npay Paul and leaves us all to bear much larger costs, most notably our \ncommunities in Colorado. That is why I joined Senators Wyden and Crapo \non their bipartisan bill that would finally separate wildfires like \nother natural disasters and help make sure that we are not fighting \nfires that could have been prevented. This is a sensible approach for \nmany reasons. It has been cosponsored by 120 Members of Congress in the \nHouse and the Senate. It has been endorsed by over 150 groups, ranging \nfrom the timber industry, to the environmental community. That speaks \nvolumes about the utility of this and the broad support, obviously.\n\n  My hometown State newspaper, the Denver Post, put it this way earlier \nthis month, ``Using disaster fund money for wildfires could solve a lot \nof problems long-term, and we hope Congress sees it that way.'' I also \nhope my colleagues see it that way. If we are serious here about \nhelping prevent future wildfires and reducing the threats to lives and \nproperty, we all join together and pass this legislation.\n  Proper wildfire budgeting and the use of disaster relief funds would \nhelp break this vicious cycle of fire borrowing and allow our natural \nresource agencies to manage healthy forests, instead of fighting \nmegafires. I have the great privilege of chairing on the energy \ncommittee, which the Presiding Officer serves on, the National Parks \nSubcommittee. I know all too well the problems this bill could solve. \nIf we adopted this measure, this new way of wildfire budgeting, we \ncould ensure that the resources are available for our national forest \nsupervisors to reduce hazardous fuels, provide quality recreation \nexperiences, and provide the timber supply to sustain a diverse forest \nproducts industry. It would be there for the uses we need them to be \nthere for.\n  We could do this also while upgrading our safe, modern air tanker \nfleet in such a way that would keep our communities and firefighters \nsafe. So this legislation I just described is in the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations measure before the Senate here today. We \nreally need to pass it. It is crucial. It is an opportunity we have to \ngrab. In the supplemental appropriations act before this body, there is \n$615 million to prevent fire borrowing this year, get resources on the \nground fighting these blazes, and help our resource agencies plan unto \nthe future.\n  I know House Appropriations Chairman Rogers. The Presiding Officer \nand I both know Chairman Rogers. He did say that he did not include \nwildfire funding in their supplemental because, in his words, ``there \nis no urgency for such money.'' I have to respectfully disagree with my \nfriend Chairman Rogers. I know Coloradans, as well as people in \nWashington State, California, and many States across the West would not \nonly disagree, they would strenuously disagree. I would invite Chairman \nRogers to come out to the West and see firsthand how urgent the \nsituation is for our communities.\n  Let me finish with a couple of remarks about other elements in this \nsupplemental.\n  My colleague Senator Blunt from Missouri, just spoke of the Iron Dome \nsystem. The supplemental includes emergency funding for Israel's Iron \nDome system. It has intercepted hundreds of Hamas rockets targeting \ncivilian areas over the last several weeks. It has literally been a \nlifesaver for our Israeli allies many times over.\n  I chair the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, which has responsibility \nfor the Iron Dome and working with Israel and the Israeli Defense \nForces. I heard today from an Israeli who said the system is \nmiraculous. As Hamas continues to rain rockets down, we need to ensure \nthat this system continues to protect our friends and allies in Israel.\n  Finally, this supplemental includes critical resources to help \naddress the root causes that have led to the humanitarian crisis at our \nsouthern border. So, in summary, I am glad we have moved forward on \ndebating this crucial supplemental appropriations bill. Let's move to \nan up-or-down vote as soon as we possibly can. This is a timely debate. \nPassage of this bill is too important to allow partisan gridlock to \ninterfere. So let's come together, let's show the American people we \ncan meet our obligations and rise above partisanship.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                             Policies Focus\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the disturbing \nleadership failure we are seeing out of the White House. Over the past \nyear the President and his administration have seemed increasingly out \nof touch with the many challenges facing our country at home and \nabroad. Two weeks ago the President's spokesman told reporters, ``I \nthink that there have\n\n[[Page S5088]]\n\nbeen a number of situations in which you have seen this administration \nintervene in a meaningful way that substantially furthered American \ninterests and substantially improved the tranquility of the global \ncommunity.'' Let my repeat that. ``Substantially improved the \ntranquility of the global community.''\n  Well, fighting is going on right now in Israel and the Gaza Strip. \nRussia is actively involved in a war in Ukraine and recently played a \nrole in bringing down a Malaysian airliner with 298 people onboard.\n  Iraq is virtually in chaos. Much of the country is under the control \nof a terrorist organization considered by al Qaeda to be too extreme.\n  Those are just some of the most serious trouble spots that we face \nright now. Yet the President's spokesman claims that ``there have been \na number of situations in which you have seen this administration \nintervene in a meaningful way that have substantially improved the \ntranquility of the global community.''\n  Not only can I not think of a number of situations in which the \nPresident's action has substantially improved tranquility, I find it \nhard to think of one. We are actually looking at more points of serious \ninstability than we have seen in decades.\n  Writing in the Washington Post over the weekend, the paper's \neditorial page noted that during the President's administration: ``we \nhave witnessed as close to a laboratory experiment on the effects of \nU.S. disengagement as the real world is ever likely to provide.''\n  Disengagement is a good description of the President's attitude \nbecause right now the President doesn't even seem to be paying \nattention. Obviously America can't fix all of the world problems, but \nstrong American leadership can help, as we have seen many times over \nthe past century.\n  Strong American leadership, however, requires a President who is \nfully engaged and this President is anything but.\n  Tens of thousands of children are arriving at our southern border. \nThe President is playing pool. When a plane is shot down in Ukraine, \nthe President keeps right on with his campaign schedule.\n  Earlier this month, as thousands of unaccompanied children were \nmaking their dangerous trip across the southern border--because of the \nPresident's statement if they got here they could stay--the President \ntraveled to Texas, but he didn't go to assess the situation himself. He \nwas, as the Associated Press reported, ``primarily in Texas to raise \nmoney for Democrats.''\n  Weeks later, despite taking multiple trips to fundraise for \nDemocrats, the President still hasn't visited the border, despite calls \nto visit from members of his own party. Indeed, the President has \nlargely stopped even discussing the crisis. This is the same President \nwhose spokesman described him as having substantially improved the \ntranquility of the global community.\n  Our world is facing a number of very serious crises now, and the \nPresident seems completely unaware of it. Unfortunately, when it comes \nto domestic issues, the President seems equally out of touch.\n  The President has recently taken to telling his audience that ``by \nalmost every economic measure, we're doing a whole lot better now than \nwe were when I came into office.''\n  Try telling that to the American families who are doing worse. \nAverage household income has dropped by nearly $3,000 on the \nPresident's watch. Meanwhile, prices have risen. Food prices are \nhigher. The price of gasoline has almost doubled. College costs \ncontinue to soar.\n  Health care premiums which the President promised would fall by \n$2,500 have increased by almost $3,000, and they are still climbing.\n  Combine high prices with declining income and we get a whole lot of \nfamilies who were once comfortably in the middle class are now \nstruggling to make ends meet. The Obama administration's economy \nprovides few opportunities for these families to improve their \nsituation.\n  In 2009 the President's advisers predicted that the unemployment rate \nwould fall below 6 percent in 2012. Two years later unemployment still \nhasn't fallen below 6 percent. The only reason the unemployment rate is \nas low as it is is because so many Americans have given up looking for \nwork and dropped out of the labor force altogether. If the labor force \nparticipation rate were as high today as it was when the President took \noffice, our unemployment rate would be about 10 percent.\n  Even when jobs do become available, too often they are low-paying \njobs, not the kinds of jobs that help middle-class families achieve \nfinancial security or move low-income families into the middle class.\n  Take the most recent jobs report. Under the President's policies, the \neconomy lost 523,000 full-time jobs and gained 799,000 part-time jobs \nlast month, which is the largest 1-month jump in part-time employment \nin 20 years.\n  I will give the President this, he does talk. He talks about helping \nmiddle-class families, but he has steadily opposed measures to help \nthem.\n  Republicans have proposed numerous measures to create good-paying \njobs and increase opportunity. We have urged the President to approve \nthe Keystone Pipeline and the tens of thousands of jobs it would \nsupport. In fact, Democrats have urged the President to approve it too. \nThe President said no.\n\n  Republicans have proposed fixing the 30-hour workweek provision in \nObamaCare, which is cutting workers' hours and wages. The President has \nsaid no.\n  Republicans have proposed repealing the medical device tax, which has \nalready eliminated thousands of jobs in the medical device industry and \nwill eliminate many more if it isn't repealed. A lot of Democrats agree \nwith that position. The President said no.\n  The President hasn't just said no to measures that would help the \nmiddle class, he has implemented policies that have hit the middle \nclass with tremendous financial burdens. Chief among the President's \nburdensome policies of course is ObamaCare. The President told an \naudience in Wilmington, DE, the other day that thanks to his \nadministration, millions more now have the peace of mind of having \nquality, affordable health care if they need it.\n  Try telling that to the Americans who lost their health care plans as \na result of the President's law and were forced to replace them with \nplans that cost more and offered less. Try telling that to the \nAmericans who obtained health care plans under the Affordable Care Act \nonly to discover their plan didn't cover the doctor they wanted it to \ncover. Tell it to the families paying thousands of dollars more each \nyear in premiums, deductibles, and copays thanks to the President's \nhealth care law. That does not even mention the drag the health care \nlaw is having on the economy.\n  Part of the reason there are so few opportunities for American \nfamilies to get ahead is because the President's health care law is \nmaking it more difficult for businesses to afford to hire new workers.\n  Now the President is piling up his budget-busting health care law \nwith a national energy tax that will drive up energy bills for American \nfamilies and put hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work.\n  Nero may have fiddled while Rome burned, the President fundraises.\n  The Washington Post reports:\n\n       In his two presidential terms combined, Bush hosted 318 \n     fundraisers. Obama has already smashed that number with 393 \n     events to date.\n\n  And he still has 2\\1/2\\ years to go in his administration.\n  Instead of urging the President to focus on crises at home and \nabroad, Democrats have taken a leaf from the President's book and spent \nthe past several months focused on elections. Rather than taking up \nlegislation to provide real help for struggling middle-class families, \nSenate Democrats have spent months--months--on political show votes and \ndesigned-to-fail legislation they hope will win them a few votes in \nNovember.\n  Our country is facing challenges at home and abroad. Campaigning has \nits place, but in Washington Members of Congress and the President \nshould be focused on solving the problems facing our country, \nsupporting middle-class families, and restoring America's economic \nvitality.\n  It is time for Democrats and the President to stop focusing on \npolitics and start focusing on the policies we need to create jobs, to \ngrow the economy, and support freedom and opportunity at home and \naround the world.\n\n[[Page S5089]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                   African Growth and Opportunity Act\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Next week, between August 4 and August 6, the United \nStates will welcome leaders from across the African Continent to \nWashington, DC.\n  I first wish to acknowledge the work of our colleague Senator Coons, \nthe chairman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, Foreign Relations \nCommittee, for the work he has done on behalf of the Senate to make \nthis opportunity a real chance to strengthen the economic ties, to \nstrengthen the strategic ties between the countries of Africa and the \nUnited States.\n  We expect there will be robust discussions that will be encouraging \neconomic growth, unlocking opportunities, and fostering greater ties \nbetween our country and Africa.\n  One of the areas that I hope will get some debate and discussion \nduring next week's meetings will be a key government trade initiative \nthat makes these ties possible; that is, the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act, AGOA.\n  AGOA provides qualifying sub-Saharan countries duty-free access to \nthe U.S. market for a wide variety of products. It was first signed \ninto law in 2000 by President Clinton and has been strengthened and \nextended by Congress and both President Bush and President Obama.\n  AGOA enjoyed broad bipartisan support throughout the years because \nits advocates recognize the crucial role Africa plays in the global \neconomy.\n  The African Continent is one of the world's fastest growing regions. \nFor instance, by 2035, it is estimated that Africa will have a larger \nworking-age population than China. I mention that because it is \ncertainly in our interest to have stable partners who develop their \neconomy and can work in strategic partnership with the United States, \nbut it also means we are going to have stronger markets for U.S.-\nproduced goods and products. As we have a growing middle class in \nAfrica, it represents a market for U.S. manufacturers, producers, and \nfarmers, which creates more jobs in the United States.\n  AGOA allows the United States and Africa to both take advantage of \nthis dynamism. Since the act was fully implemented in 2001, U.S. \nimports under AGOA have tripled. Nonoil AGOA trade has increased \nfourfold.\n  Some of the sectors that AGOA has helped open are apparel, textiles, \njewelry, handicrafts, and electronics. AGOA has created hundreds of \nthousands of jobs in those sectors, most of those in the apparel \nsector, where women comprise 75 to 90 percent of the industry.\n  In sub-Saharan Africa women are at the highest risk of being poor. \nAGOA has tackled barriers to poverty reduction by eliminating tariffs \non goods that come from many sectors in which women are employed.\n  Modern trade agreements and initiatives are much more than just \nlowering tariffs. It also involves dealing with good governance \npractices.\n  In an increasing global economy, we can no longer consider issues \nsuch as labor rights, human rights, and good governance as issues that \nare separate from trade.\n  Trade with our country is a benefit with deserving nations that share \nour values. Strong commitments to the rule of law and human rights are \nan essential part of those values and level the playing field between \nthe United States and our partners in the global marketplace.\n  AGOA is no exception. The Act has been encouraging these commitments \nsince it was first enacted. In other words, this is not only an \nopportunity by lowering barriers to our markets, it is also about \nexpectations and enforcement that the African countries will improve \ntheir good governance and their labor rights so we have a more level \nplaying field.\n  To qualify for AGOA benefits, countries must establish or make \ncontinual progress on measures that promote good governance and a fair \neconomic system. These include fundamental rights, the rule of law, a \nsystem that combats corruption, and policies that increase access to \nhealth care, education, and expand physical infrastructure. In other \nwords, the African countries involved that take advantage of AGOA must \nhave continuing progress on the good governance key issues.\n  For example, as part of the annual AGOA review process, the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor examines AGOA countries' efforts to implement and \nenforce workers' rights, including the right of association, the right \nto organize and bargain collectively, prohibitions on forced or \ncompulsory labor, a minimum age for the employment of children, and \nacceptable conditions of work.\n  These are the International Labour Organization standards. The ILO \nstandards are very much a part of the progress we made under AGOA in \nthe African countries. Improvements in these areas have been shown to \nfoster the kind of inclusive economic growth and opportunities that \nraise families and nations out of poverty.\n  We understand that by developing stronger economies in African \ncountries, we are building more stable African countries, countries \nthat are more reliable to be partners with the United States in dealing \nwith global issues.\n  We understand that by doing that we are going to have a stronger \npartner sharing U.S. values. This is just one of the tools we use. We \nalso use our transparency initiatives. We included in the Dodd-Frank \nlegislation transparency on extractive industries that operate globally \nbut also in Africa so we could find and make sure the wealth of a \ncountry is actually going to its people. That requires good governance. \nAGOA is one of our tools to accomplish that good governance.\n  So these countries that have mineral wealth, the wealth is not a \ncurse but truly benefits the people of that country.\n  AGOA helps, the transparency initiatives that we passed help, but \nthis is the issue: The current authorization of AGOA expires on \nSeptember 30, 2015. Once again, Madam President, as you know, as you \nworked so hard, we need predictability in our law. Short-term \nextensions don't do much good. What we need is a long-term economic \ncommitment with the continent of Africa.\n\n  A bipartisan effort in Congress to extend and improve this important \nlegislation is already underway. The U.S. Trade Representative has been \nreviewing AGOA's successes as well as the areas that can be improved. \nLater today in the Senate Finance Committee we will be holding a \nhearing on AGOA, and Ambassador Froman will be one of the witnesses at \nthat hearing. So we will have a chance to work together, bipartisan \nmembers of Congress with the administration.\n  One of the areas we are looking at is strengthening the eligibility \ncriteria to further incentivize improvements in human rights, and I \nwill be talking about that in the Finance Committee. Another area is \nproviding coordinated technical assistance and capacity building. This \nis very important. Too often trade and development policies operate on \nseparate tracks. Granting trade preference means little without \nproviding countries with the ability to take advantage of those \nbenefits. We have development assistance that we provide to countries. \nWe have trade that we do. Let's combine it and recognize that these \ntrade opportunities can only be taken advantage of if the country has \nthe capacity to deal with the issues we are talking about.\n  Capacity building is already underway in Africa. For instance, the \nDepartment of Labor provides capacity-building assistance to AGOA \ncountries to improve workers' rights through partnerships with a broad \nrange of organizations, from NGOs, to health organizations, to social \nand economic researchers. By providing this aid in a more efficient and \nclearly measurable fashion and seeking more input from local \ncooperatives and groups, we can help foster more sustainable growth in \nSub-Saharan Africa.\n  The time to develop consensus on AGOA improvements is now. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting and strengthening the AGOA Act so \nwe can maintain this important tool to increase the trade relations \nbetween the United States and Africa and fight global poverty. I look \nforward to seeing the results of next week's meetings with the African \nleaders. It is my sincere expectation that these meetings will produce \nconcrete ways we can improve the ties between Africa and the United \nStates, and I certainly expect it will help us lead to the improvement \nand reauthorization of AGOA.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to talk about the \ntransparency provisions in the USA FREEDOM Act. I am a proud cosponsor \nof Chairman Leahy's bill, and I am particularly proud to have written \nits key transparency provisions with my friend Senator Dean Heller of \nNevada. As I said yesterday, both of us are indebted to Senator Leahy \nfor his leadership on this issue.\n  For over a year now there has been a steady stream of news stories \nabout the National Security Agency's surveillance programs. Yet right \nnow, by law, Americans still cannot get very basic information about \nthese programs.\n  Americans understand that we need to give due weight to privacy on \nthe one hand and national security on the other. But when they lack an \neven rough sense of the scope of the government's surveillance \nprograms, they have no way to know if the government is getting that \nbalance right. There needs to be more transparency.\n  The controversy unleashed by Edward Snowden's disclosures has been \ngoing on for over a year. Yet Americans still don't know the actual \nnumber of people whose information has been collected under these \nprograms. They don't even know how many of these people are Americans, \nand they have no way of knowing how many of these Americans had their \ninformation actually looked at by government officials as opposed to \njust being held in a database. This lack of transparency is pretty \nbreathtaking.\n  I believe the provisions Senator Heller and I wrote will go a long \nway toward addressing and fixing this. It will give Americans the \ninformation they need to judge the government's surveillance programs \nfor themselves.\n  Three programs are at the center of this debate: the telephone call \nrecords program, the collection, through 2011, on Americans' Internet \ncommunications records, and the so-called PRISM Program that targets \nthe communications of foreigners abroad.\n  Our provisions would require detailed annual reports for each \nprogram. The government will have to tell the public how many people \nhave had their information collected and how many of those people are \nlikely American. For the call records program and the PRISM Program, \nthe government will also have to say how many times it has run a \nspecific search for an American's data.\n  By creating these reporting requirements, the government will have an \nincentive to also disclose the number of Americans who have actually \nhad their information reviewed by government officials, and we give the \ngovernment authority to do that too.\n  We don't just require the government to issue more detailed \ntransparency reports. We are also helping American Internet and phone \ncompanies tell their customers about the government requests for \ncustomer information they are receiving. For years those companies have \nbeen under gag orders. As a result, people around the world think the \nAmerican Internet companies are giving up far more information to the \ngovernment than they likely are. Those companies are losing billions of \ndollars because people think they are handing over all of their \ncustomers' data to the NSA.\n  Our provisions expand the options that companies have to issue their \nown transparency reports, and they let companies issue those reports \nmore quickly. Our provisions give the public two ways to check on the \ngovernment--government transparency reports and company reports as \nwell.\n  Like all major bills, this bill is a compromise, and we didn't get \neverything we wanted, but our provisions will go a long way toward \ngiving the American people the information they need to evaluate the \ngovernment's surveillance program.\n  After 9/11, our Nation faced a security crisis. Most Americans had \nnever lived through anything like that. We are now experiencing a \ncrisis of trust where a big part of the American public now thinks our \nintelligence agencies are out to spy on them, not on foreign countries.\n  The administration has committed to end the bulk collection of \nAmericans' data, and Congress has written a bill to ban the bulk \ncollection of Americans' data. But unless we pass these transparency \nprovisions, Americans have no way to know if the government is making \ngood on those promises. Our transparency provisions will force the \ngovernment to prove annually and publicly that bulk collection is over. \nThis is an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability which \nwill allow the American people to decide for themselves whether the \ngovernment is striking the right balance between privacy and security.\n  We should take up this bill as soon as possible so that Americans are \nnot in the dark a single day longer. We should take it up so that \nAmerican companies stop losing business because of misperceptions about \ntheir role in domestic surveillance. We should take this bill up so \nthat Americans can get the information they need to hold their \ngovernment to account.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Alvaro Bedoya\n\n  Before I yield the floor, I wish to take a moment to recognize and \nthank Alvaro Bedoya, my chief counsel, who is to my left. This is \nAlvaro's last week on my staff. Alvaro has been a member of my team \nsince my very first day in office, and I have relied on and trusted his \ncounsel on so many things in the 5 years since.\n  He has been instrumental in helping me launch and set the agenda for \nthe Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law that I chair, and \nwe would not have reached this point in working to make the NSA more \ntransparent and accountable to the American people if it were not for \nAlvaro.\n  Alvaro's counsel has also been crucial as we have sought to improve \nour Nation's broken immigration system, as we fought for marriage \nequality and LGBT rights, including the right of all children to be \nfree from bullying in schools, and as we work to ban apps that allow \ndomestic abusers to stalk their victims.\n  Alvaro was even at my side during my very first week in office when \nthe Judiciary Committee held confirmation hearings for Sonia Sotomayor \nto serve on the Supreme Court. That was my fifth day in the Senate, and \nI remember pulling some late nights preparing for that.\n  Alvaro's departure is bittersweet for me. I am, of course, sad to see \nAlvaro leave, but I am very excited for him as well. He will soon \nbecome the founding executive director of Georgetown Law School's new \nCenter for Privacy and Technology. I have no doubt the folks at \nGeorgetown soon will learn what I already know--that Alvaro is one of \nthe most talented, intelligent, hardest working, decent, good-guy \nlawyers I know.\n  Thanks, Alvaro.\n  And I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Corporate Inversions\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, our Tax Code is tilted toward the rich \nand the powerful. Huge corporations hire armies of lobbyists and \nlawyers to create, expand, and protect every last corporate loophole. \nThat is how we end up with a tax code that makes small businesses and \nrestaurants and construction companies pay, that makes teachers and \ntruckdrivers and nurses pay, but that allows huge American corporations \nto make billions of dollars in profits and not pay a single dime in \ntaxes.\n  The Tax Code is rigged. Apparently, even this rigged game does not go \nfar enough for some corporations. Those companies are taking advantage \nof a new move--a loophole that allows them to maintain all their \noperations in America but claim foreign citizenship so they can cut \ntheir U.S. taxes even further.\n  Here is how the loophole works. An American company merges with a\n\n[[Page S5091]]\n\nmuch smaller company located in a foreign country, usually a tax haven \nsuch as Ireland or Bermuda. As long as the shareholders of the foreign \ncompany own 20 percent of the newly merged company, our tax laws allow \nthat new company to claim foreign citizenship. That means American \ncompanies can hire a bunch of Wall Street bankers and a bunch of \nlawyers, fill out some paperwork, keep everything the same in their \noperations, and dodge their U.S. taxes.\n  Tax lawyers call this process a corporate inversion, but do not let \nthat bland name fool you. These companies are renouncing their American \ncitizenship, turning their backs on this country simply to boost their \nprofits. They are taking advantage of all the good things our \ngovernment helps provide--educated workers, roads and bridges, a \ndependable court system, patent and copyright protections--and then \nrunning out on the bill.\n  If a person did that, we would call them a freeloader. We would \ninsist that they pay their fair share. That is exactly what our tax \nlaws do for people who renounce their American citizenship. Even if \nthey do not sell their property in the United States, when they \nrenounce their citizenship, we treat them as if they had sold it. If \nthey try to send money back to a U.S. citizen, we tax that amount too. \nAnd if someone attempts to evade their tax obligations by renouncing \ntheir American citizenship, we bar them from coming back to this \ncountry.\n  For a person who does not want to pay a fair share, our message is \nclear: You can renounce your citizenship but do not come back and \nexpect the rest of us to pick up the tab. But we do not do that for \ncorporations. Corporations can renounce their American citizenship--and \nmake absolutely clear in legal documents that they are doing it to \navoid their U.S. tax obligations--and not suffer any consequences.\n  In this corner of the Tax Code we have gone way past treating \ncorporations as people. In this corner of the Tax Code we are treating \ncorporations better than people. That is not right. That is why I have \nteamed up with Senator Levin and more than a dozen of our Democratic \ncolleagues to introduce the Stop Corporate Inversions Act. The bill is \nsimple. It allows American corporations to renounce their citizenship \nonly if they truly give up control of their company to a foreign \ncorporation and truly move their operations overseas. The bill would \nhelp protect $17 billion in tax revenue--money we could spend on Head \nStart Programs, on fixing our roads and bridges, on investing in \nmedical research.\n  President Obama and Secretary Lew have spoken in favor of the \nproposal. I commend their leadership, and I join them in urging the \nSenate to pass this bill right away.\n  Some say wait. They say we should address this loophole in the \ncontext only of broader tax reform. I am all for a major overhaul of \nour tangled tax system, but make no mistake, more and more companies \nare rushing to renounce their citizenship to take advantage of this \ninversion loophole before we can get to full tax reform. We cannot \nallow the larger fights over tax reform to stop us from holding these \nfreeloaders accountable.\n  I believe the Senate should act on this, but I am also realistic. \nEven if the Senate passes this bill today, we know that, like so many \ngood Senate bills before it, it will face a tough road in the House. If \nwe have learned anything from the past few years, it is that House \nRepublicans will claw, scratch, whimper, beg or do whatever else it \ntakes to defend every last corporate tax loophole.\n  But the administration does not need to wait for Congress. It can use \nits existing authority to slow down and reduce the attractiveness of \nthese sham inversions right now. According to a paper published this \nweek by Steve Shay, a Harvard Law School professor and former senior \ntax policy official at the Treasury Department, the administration \ncould take action today to reduce the tax benefits of corporate \ninversions.\n  It could use its authority under section 385 of the Tax Code to \nprevent companies that renounce their citizenship from using any other \nloopholes to shield themselves from additional taxes that they would \notherwise be required to pay. This will not totally solve the problem, \nbut it would significantly reduce the benefits of corporate inversion. \nIt would be an important first step toward treating companies that \nrenounce America the same way we treat people who renounce America--as \nfreeloaders who get cut off from other benefits.\n  America is a great place to do business because of the investments we \nhave made together. In Massachusetts and across this country, we invest \nin public education, and our colleges and universities produce millions \nof skilled workers. We invest in infrastructure, in our roads and \nbridges and ports, making it easier for our companies to move their \nproducts across the country and beyond. We invest in scientific and \nmedical research, giving our companies access to the most innovative \nand cutting-edge technology. We invest together to make America a place \nwhere any kid will have a chance to come up with an idea and turn it \ninto the next great American corporation.\n  The companies that are pursuing these corporate inversions know all \nof this. That is why they are not actually leaving America behind. They \njust do not want to pay for it. Our achievements are not magic. They \ndid not simply happen on their own or through dumb luck. America works, \nour government works, our democracy works because we all pitch in and \ndo our part to build that which none of us can build alone, giving \neveryone a chance to succeed.\n  If these companies want to leave all of that behind, well, that is \ntheir right. But if they exercise that right, if they leave America \nbehind, then they should not get to turn around and claim all of the \nprivileges of being an American company. We have had enough of rich \ncorporations taking whatever they want and expecting everyone else to \npick up the pieces. The time for freeloading is over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Israel\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it has been 22 days now since Hamas \nbegan its most recent campaign of terrorist attacks against the \ninnocent citizens of Israel. Since the operation began, 32 tunnels have \nbeen uncovered that would have been used to attack Israel. On Saturday \nand Sunday--this past Saturday and Sunday alone--almost 100 rockets \nwere fired at Israel. In the Gaza strip, since the beginning of \nOperation Protective Edge--that would have been July 8--there have been \nover 2,000 Hamas rockets fired into Israel, with Tel Aviv and Jerusalem \nboth targets.\n  Israel has responded, as any nation protecting its people would, with \nair strikes and ground troops to silence these Hamas terrorists. \nIsraelis are tough. I have to remind people all the time that since \ntheir independence back in the 1940s, they have been attacked--Israel \nhas been attacked--six different times.\n  Remember how they were outnumbered in the Six-Day War in 1967. They \nwon. They prevailed. Then again, the same thing in Yom Kippur--that was \nin 1973. Again, they prevailed. I have often kidded with them--I have \ntold Prime Minister Netanyahu this, that the Israelis consider a fair \nfight being outnumbered two to one. So they are a great bunch of \npeople. We have got to continue to support them.\n  The Hamas terrorists are not only killing Israelis; they are killing \ntheir own people too because they place their rocket launchers--we see \nthis is happening, just yesterday we saw a picture of this--in the \nmiddle of their own population centers. We are talking in homes, in \nhospitals, in mosques. Like the cowards they are, they use civilians as \nhuman shields. Despite Israel's extensive precautionary behavior and \nmeasures to avoid collateral damage, casualties, unfortunately, have \noccurred. Hamas bears complete responsibility for the civilian deaths.\n  As Prime Minister Netanyahu said: Israel is using missile defense to \nprotect our citizens, and Hamas is using their civilians to protect \ntheir missiles. To date, the Israeli missile defense system, called the \nIron Dome, has\n\n[[Page S5092]]\n\nsuccessfully intercepted over 400 Hamas rockets headed toward the \npopulated areas in Israel. I was just in Israel last month. I visited \nthe Iron Dome battery. You see, there has to be a place where they \ninitiate these protective devices. Here they are over there. I was so \nimpressed with the young Israeli troops who operate it in the southern \ncity of Ashkelon. The same battery you see on TV every night \nintercepting Hamas rockets comes from the Gaza Strip, 13 kilometers \naway.\n  I have a picture here I want the Presiding Officer to look at. This \nbeautiful young first lieutenant in the Israeli Army I met. She is the \none in charge of the Ashkelon battery down there. She is doing her duty \nright now as we speak, bravely protecting her fellow citizens. Her name \nis Lee Shmulevitch. I salute her.\n  It gives people an idea of the commitment that is being made by the \nIsraeli people and the successes they are having. As ranking member, \nwhich I am, of the Armed Services Committee, I am proud to say I have \nbeen a constant supporter of the Iron Dome, which we have done on a \nnonpartisan basis. We have put in the authorization for $175 million in \nthis last authorization bill. Then we added another $176 million that \nwould take care of not just the Iron Dome but also other systems that \nwe have such as David's Sling and Arrow 3.\n  These are jointly developed by the United States and Israel. I think \nit is important that people understand. I have heard people say: Well, \nyou are just sending all this stuff over from us to Israel. If that \nwere true, it would be worth doing it anyway, because they are looking \nout after our interests. Those things which they are not able to do in \nthe Middle East we would have to be doing with our equipment, with your \nyoung people.\n  This is not the case. They have a lot of brave people over there. In \nthe case of the Iron Dome, of David's Sling, of Arrow 3, and of a lot \nof the UAVs, their technology is technology that we use. So it is not \nsomething that we are doing for them. We are doing it mutually for each \nother.\n  I think it is important also to note at this point that--and nobody \nseems to put this together--Hamas would not have the rockets and \ncapability of trying to kill all of these Israelis if it were not for \nIsrael's greatest threat, and that is the country of Iran. Quite \nfrankly, I think Iran is the greatest threat to the United States also. \nA lot of people do not realize this, but back in 2007 our--at that time \nit was classified--Our intelligence said that by 2015, Iran would have \nthe weapon and a delivery system. Well, that is only 6 months from now.\n  That has been reconfirmed in our unclassified intelligence starting \nin about 2010. So right now it is really Iran that is responsible for \nwhat Hamas has been able to do. I might ask the question: What is \nPresident Obama doing? His rush to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran \nhas undermined years of bipartisan sanctions that were working. We have \nsanctions, not just by us but by European countries and other countries \nthat have really brought Iran down--not to their knees, because they \nare still developing their weapons. But nonetheless, they were working.\n  As part of the President's agreement--this is what he is doing right \nnow. His agreement is to reduce Iran's sanctions, as he announced in \nJanuary. He has endorsed Iran's right to enrich uranium. So let's stop \nand think about it. This is a deal he has cut. He said: All right. We \nwill pull off our sanctions so you will be able to receive the benefit \nof that. At the same time we are going to let you go ahead and continue \nto enrich uranium.\n  He has allowed Iran to keep 19,000 centrifuges while unlocking $7 \nbillion in assets. These are assets that were held which they can now \nuse to their benefit. He has just extended the deal by agreeing to \nprovide Iran with an additional $2.8 billion in frozen assets. That \nbrings the $7 billion up to almost $10 billion. While Iran is building \na bomb, Obama is releasing sanctions.\n  I believe the Iranians are using negotiations to buy time as they are \ndeveloping their nuclear weapon. Again, Netanyahu called the \nPresident's agreement a ``historic mistake'' that is making the world a \nmuch more dangerous place. History is going to prove that he is right. \nObama should demand Iran dismantle its nuclear program, but he will not \ndo it. We should reinstate full sanctions now and consider additional \nsanctions. But President Obama will not do it.\n  Does anyone really believe Iran is not involved with Hamas and its \nattacks?\n  Today, Obama is rewarding Iran by releasing more financial assets to \nIran, funding that will be used to support more terrorism against \nIsrael. There is little to show for the administration's reckless \ngamble for Israel. President Obama is negotiating with an Iranian \nregime that has repeatedly deceived us and concealed its nuclear \nprogram for over 2 decades.\n  I see nothing different in this deal. Israel lives in a dangerous \nneighborhood, surrounded by terrorists who refuse to even acknowledge \nthe Jewish state's right to exist. They need all the friends they can \nget. I keep hearing people talk about the two-state solution. The two-\nstate solution between Hamas and Israel is kind of interesting because \nHamas does not consider Israel to be a state. So how can you have a \ntwo-state solution if you only have one state? That is the situation.\n  That is why I want to salute the country of Egypt. There are some \nother friends that we have over there. I have been upset with some of \nthe Members here in this body because they do not have an appreciation \nfor what Egypt does and the part they play in the Middle East and their \nsupport for Israel. Let me tell you, this started a long time ago. The \nCamp David Accords was in 1979. In the Camp David Accords they made a \ndeal with Israel. Now, you have to keep in mind that this was the \nmilitary of Egypt. It is hard for people in this country to see that \nsometimes there is a difference between the administration in a country \nand the military.\n  So it is the military here that has said: We will be protecting \nIsrael. We had, not too long ago, an effort from this body to try to \nstop the shipment of some F-16s that Egypt had already bought. Now, \ngranted, that was back during President Morsi and his radical Muslim \nBrotherhood. But nonetheless, these were going not to him but to the \nmilitary. The newly elected President Sisi has destroyed--he is working \nright along with the Israelis. He has been involved, and his people and \nhis military, in destroying over 90 percent of the tunnels that are \ngoing from the Sinai to Gaza.\n  So I only mention this because those individuals who do not \nunderstand this might consider punishing Egypt. If you punish Egypt, \nyou are punishing, to the same degree, Israel.\n  The turbulent times we face serve as a reminder why the United States \nand Israel have to continue to work together. The same enemies that \nthreaten the existence of Israel also want to destroy America. Over the \nyears the United States has greatly benefited from the cooperation with \nIsrael on missile defense technologies. We have to continue that \ncritical partnership. Israel is our most faithful ally, our most \ncritical partner in the region, and acts as a roadblock against \nterrorism, terrorism that would be hitting the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Israel and \nsupports its right to defend itself.\n  Since his first budget, President Obama has been degrading our \nmilitary while also making the world more dangerous through an \napologetic and reactive foreign policy of appeasement. I often quote \nHiram Mann, who said:\n\n     No man escapes\n     When freedom fails,\n     The best men rot in filthy jails;\n     And they who cried: ``Appease, Appease!''\n     Are hanged by men they tried to please.\n\n  We have to get out of that system. We have to stand by Israel and \nhang tough with our best friend. We can't survive without them.\n  I often look back wistfully at the days of the Cold War. That was \nback when they had two superpowers in the world, the USSR and the \nUnited States. We knew what they had, and they knew what we had. We \nknew what their capacities were, they knew ours.\n  They had a system called MAD, mutually assured destruction. It meant: \nYou shoot at you, we will shoot at you. You die, we all die, and \neveryone is happy.\n  That doesn't work anymore. Now we have these rogue elements out there\n\n[[Page S5093]]\n\nthat are developing weapons that can wipe out an entire U.S. city. I am \nabout not just the Middle East but about North Korea also.\n  So we are looking at the Middle East. We are looking at our only way \nof defending our allies there and working to stop the capabilities of \ncountries such as Iran to have a weapon that would reach the United \nStates of America. So we have to hang tough with our best friend \nIsrael, and I pray that we do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                      49th Anniversary of Medicare\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise in honor of a birthday.\n  Forty-nine years ago, Medicare was signed into law. Every year, the \ntrustees prepare a report about the fiscal health of Medicare and \nSocial Security, and that report was issued earlier this week. On this \n49th birthday of Medicare, I wish to talk about Medicare's health \nbecause there is some good news.\n  The 2014 trustees' report released earlier this week looks at the \ntrust fund financing for Medicare hospital coverage and indicates that \ntrust fund, under current projections, will remain solvent until 2030. \nLast year the 2013 report indicated that solvency period would go to \n2026. So in 1 year the fiscal projections for Medicare and Medicaid \nimproved by 4 years--solvency until 2030.\n  In addition, the projected Part B premiums, the Part B portion of \nMedicare, which is the prescription drug premium program for seniors, \nfor the second year in a row the premiums will not increase one penny.\n  This improved health of Medicare is significant. The health of it has \nimproved dramatically, even in the last year. But where the improvement \ntruly looks significant is if we compare the 2014 report with the 2009 \nreport, the report that was done on Medicare's 44th birthday 5 years \nago. The 2009 report said the hospital insurance trust fund was not \nadequately financed for the next 10 years, and it would be exhausted in \n2017.\n  Again, just to compare, 2009 Medicare trustees' report, the trust \nfund will be exhausted by 2017; 2014 Medicare trustees' report, the \ntrust fund will be solvent all the way through 2030. There is a \ndifference of 13 years of additional solvency in Medicare, according to \nthe projections and the change just from 2009 to 2014.\n  I think we know where I am going with this subject. What explains the \nimproving solvency of the Medicare trust fund? Why would it have \nchanged so dramatically from the 2009 to the 2014 projection and added \n13 years of solvency to the trust fund?\n  The Congressional Budget Office and others have indicated it was not \nthe 2009 recession that was the primary driver for Medicare spending \nreduction. Instead, the CBO and others are indicating that a large part \nof the improved solvency of Medicare is because of the reforms that \nwere included by Congress when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act \nin 2010. When it comes to reducing costs, bending the cost curve, the \nAffordable Care Act is working.\n  That is not the only reason Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. \nCoverage is expanding. Certain health care indicators are improving. \nMore people have access because they are not denied insurance because \nof preexisting conditions. Kids can stay on family policies. Businesses \ncan get tax credits if they are small.\n  But one of the areas--and that was why the first day the ACA was \naffordable. It was to try to do things that would control health care \ncosts.\n  This Medicare trustees' report on Medicare's 49th birthday shows on \ncost reforms the ACA is working. The innovative systems of changing the \npayment model from pay-for-procedure to pay for quality, paying for \nvalue over volume, for reducing costs and improving health care \ndelivery systems are extending the solvency of Medicare.\n\n  Not only is this cost containment good for the Federal Government, \nfor the Federal Treasury, it is also good for Medicare recipients: 8.2 \nmillion Medicare recipients saved more than $11.5 billion on \nprescription drugs thanks to closing the Medicare Part D doughnut hole.\n  In Virginia, people with Medicare saved $254 million on prescription \ndrugs because the Medicare Part D doughnut hole was closed just since \nthe ACA was enacted--$254 million since the 2010 enactment. In 2013 \nalone, 37.2 million Medicare recipients received free preventive \nbenefits, including more than 900,000 in Virginia, because of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  The work obviously needs to continue to bend the cost curve the right \nway, but the trustees' report from Monday is not the only evidence of \nthe improving health of our fiscal expenditures.\n  Just this month CBO again revised downward its 10-year estimate for \nspending on Medicare and our Nation's major health care programs. Since \n2010 CBO has lowered its estimates for Medicare and Medicaid and other \nhealth care programs by $1.23 trillion--lowered projections of health \ncare spending since the Affordable Care Act was passed.\n  The CBO said in a recently issued long-term budget outlook that the \ngovernment will spend 1.6 percent of GDP less on health care programs \nthan estimated in 2010 before the ACA was passed. A report released \nthis week by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and \nEvaluation at HHS reported essentially no growth in Medicare \nexpenditures on a per capita basis last year.\n  That report also said Medicare spending between 2009 and 2012--for \nbeneficiaries in the traditional program--was approximately $116 \nbillion lower than it would have been if the average growth rates from \nyears 2004 to 2008 had been projected forward.\n  So there are many reasons we should be thankful the Affordable Care \nAct passed, that we should be absolutely committed to maintaining it, \nand that we should also be committed to maintaining it wherever we can. \nBut as we celebrate the 49th anniversary of Medicare today, one of the \nreasons we should be thankful is it is clear that the ACA is helping us \nmake health care more affordable.\n  To conclude, the report that was issued this week was not all good \nnews because it also had challenges with respect to Social Security. \nThe Social Security trust fund will be exhausted in 2033, and that \nrepresents no change from last year. The solvency of the trust fund was \nnot changed at all in the interim year.\n  But in the area of Social Security disability income, that insurance \nprogram--at current projections--will be completed by 2016.\n  Secretary Lew indicated this week that measures need to be taken to \nmake sure that program--which is of critical importance to millions of \nAmericans who are on disabilities--requires that we take action to fix \nthat program so they can count on it.\n  So what we see is when Congress in the Affordable Care Act acted in a \nsmart way to deal with Medicare, we have improved the area of Medicare \ncosts and we are saving money. Congress has not acted with respect to \nSocial Security and the Social Security disability insurance program, \nwhich is critical to folks with disabilities. It is going to need some \nquick fix.\n  I conclude and just say it is good for Congress to act. We can \nfilibuster. We can debate. We can consider nominations. We can do a \nbill in one House and send it over and wait--as with immigration reform \nfor 1-year-plus--for the other House to do something about it. None of \nthat is action. None of that will fix any of the challenges that face \nus.\n  But when we do act and we are willing to tackle tough problems such \nas Medicare cost growth, we do it in both Houses and take the risk, we \nwill find we will be better off than if we don't act. Social Security \nneeds to have the same kind of focused and careful attention to it, \nespecially the disability insurance program, as we paid to Medicare in \n2010.\n  Medicare is one of the best programs this Nation has ever embraced. I \nwish it a happy 49th birthday today and congratulate those who were in \nthe Senate in 2010 for being willing to risk action and thereby found a \nway to save costs and make Medicare work better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I rise to speak on the urgent supplemental bill, and I \nrise as the chair of the full Committee on Appropriations that is \nactually trying to move the urgent supplemental.\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\n  ``Supplemental'' is an important word. It means it is in addition to \nfiscal year 2014 funding. There are elements where we make requests for \nan urgent supplemental because of unexpected emergencies, either within \nour own country or affecting a treasured ally--such as the State of \nIsrael--or the crisis at our border because of what is going on in \nCentral America. Remember, it is the crisis in Central America that is \ncreating the humanitarian surge at our border.\n  Although I rise now to speak about one element. I have spoken about \nthe fires in our Western States and later today I will speak about the \nchildren and actually try to paint a picture for people about what is \ngoing on in Honduras, El Salvador, and other countries that are also \naffected, but now I am going to speak about Israel.\n  Israel is under attack, and it is under attack by a terrorist group \nthat denies its very right to exist. It is under attack by an \norganization called Hamas that is sending thousands of rockets to \nIsraeli cities and towns targeting innocent civilians. Its very \nsurvivability is being defended by missile defense technology. The most \ncrucial for short-range missiles is a technology called Iron Dome. This \nmissile defense technology has saved hundreds of lives.\n  I can speak to this--when I say personally, not because I am in \nIsrael and see the horrific attacks, but because I have a classmate \nfrom college, a very dear friend, and we have stayed in contact over a \nnumber of years. She is a psychiatric nurse. When she married, they \nmade aliyah and moved to Israel, where she has taught at Hebrew \nUniversity and her husband is a distinguished psychiatrist. They live \nin a town called Ashkelon.\n  She sent me the most poignant of emails. I will not read it to my \ncolleagues, but she did tell me what is going on. Every day there are \nthese rockets going on. They spend their lives going to shelters. They \ncan only move around in a small patch because they have to be, under \nsafety rules, within 2 or 3 minutes from a shelter. She said in her \nemail to me that it is literally Iron Dome that is saving their lives.\n  Iron Dome is a technology that needs to be replenished. It needs to \nbe replenished, and the State of Israel has discussed this with our \ngovernment. Secretary Chuck Hagel wrote to our committee asking that \nthis be in the supplemental essentially because of this war or \nterrorist attack against Israel.\n  The committee has responded by placing $225 million in there, but in \norder to replenish it. There are many who say: I don't know if I am \ngoing to vote for this. What is Iron Dome, and is this an attack \ntechnology?\n  Let me say what Iron Dome is.\n  Iron Dome is a high-tech defensive system. It is not an offensive \nsystem. It is used as a missile defense system. How does it work? \nApproximately 10-feet-long missiles intercept rockets. Their rockets \naren't designed to shoot out; they are designed to shoot rockets at \nrockets that are being fired on Israel from a range of between 2.5 and \n43 miles. Each interceptor missile--remember, they intercept another \nrocket--costs about $50,000. Stunning, isn't it? Israel has invested \nover $1 billion of its own money in Iron Dome. Our government has \nworked with them on Iron Dome so they can maintain their qualitative \nedge. But just think. In order to protect themselves, every rocket \ngoing off costs $50,000.\n  As of July 30, over 2,730 rocket launches have been directed at \nIsrael itself. Iron Dome has sent over 515 interceptions; 9 batteries \nhave been deployed; more than 4,100 targets were attacked since the \nbeginning of the operation.\n  But remember, over 2,700 rockets have been directed at Israel. Iron \nDome has deployed 515 at the cost of $50,000 apiece. Now what they are \nsaying is, help us replenish our interceptor rockets because we are \nusing them up. Essentially, it is bullets--not directed at people--it \nis rockets in the air.\n  Israel has a 90-percent success rate in intercepting these rockets \ncoming from the Gaza. What they are asking for is help from us, the \nability to replenish these rockets. I hope we do this in order for them \nto continue to be able to defend themselves. It is absolutely crucial \nthat Israel has the opportunity to defend itself while others are \nworking on cease-fires or political solutions. Those are excellent \ndiplomatic and humanitarian goals, but right now we have to make sure \nthat Israel can defend itself.\n  This is important because Israel is a treasured ally. It is important \nthat we enable them to guard themselves against a terrorist \norganization.\n  We all know that the long-range solution is that the Hamas \ninfrastructure must be eliminated. That is absolutely so. These so-\ncalled--well, they are not so-called. As a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, I have had many briefings on this. I can't go into detail, \nbut there are tunnels that go right through Gaza and into the edge or, \nactually, in some instances into Israel itself. During this conflict \nIsrael has discovered 31 tunnels. This is extremely disturbing. And \nthey are big. When we think of a tunnel--this isn't like a little pipe \nfor water. This is a tunnel where as many as two people could cross \nside-by-side going through and, in some instances, actually weapons \nbeing able to be put through. These tunnels are a very threat to \nIsrael's existence.\n  In addition to the tunnels, the rockets that are pummeling Israel \ncontinue to be fired every single day.\n  We believe, for our allies, in the right to self-defense. We have \nsigned memorandums of agreement to enable them, with their missile \ndefense system, to maintain their qualitative edge.\n  Now, when they are in the very struggle for their safety and perhaps \ntheir future, we need to be able to pass this important legislation.\n  We also know that when we pass this legislation, Iron Dome should \nstand alone. Many people who support the Iron Dome legislation, such as \nmyself, want to also support those people who are also under threat.\n  That takes me to the children, because right now the children in \nCentral America are under threat. And what are they under threat of? \nWell, I will talk more about that around 5:00. But what are they under \nthreat of? They are under threat because of the narco drug dealers who \nhave created the most vicious and violent gangs that have now almost \ntaken over some of these Central American countries. They want to \nrecruit the young men to be part of the gang, part of the drug trade, \npart of the couriers, part of what is involved in doing a drug trade. \nThen, when they refuse, they either threaten them with death or the \nmost grisly and ghoulish of torture.\n  There are reported incidents, not in our classified briefings but in \npublic media, of children being tortured to death because they refused \nto join a gang. They are literally fighting for their lives. These \nchildren coming to our border are fighting for their lives, and the way \nthey fight for their life is to flee. They are fleeing the violence.\n  I know people are dismissive of some of this and they say: Oh, there \nyou go. You are a soft-hearted social worker, you are a liberal, you \nlove children. The answer is: Yes. Yes to all that. Yes, you betcha, I \nclaim it; I own it; that is who I am.\n  But I don't do this because of some ``gushy-poo'' feeling here. I am \ndoing this because of the actual documented violence in these \ncountries, and I believe we need to respond to the needs of the \nchildren. Let them tell their case not only to a social worker--which \nis a good step, in my mind--but also to an immigration judge, and using \nthe laws of our country, the legal criteria for asylum and refugee \nstatus, let's listen to the stories of the children. And if those \nchildren qualify for asylum and refugee status, then they should remain \nin this country. If they don't, there are other avenues for them to \nreturn home. But for gosh sakes, could we stop punishing the children \nfor the crimes of the drug dealers and the human traffickers? Don't \npunish the children.\n  There are those who want to further militarize our border by calling \nout the National Guard. Well, what are they going to do when the \nchildren present themselves with little strips of paper saying what \ntheir name and their hometown is, and where their aunt is living in \nLangley Park, MD? That is not the job of the National Guard.\n  And if we want to use guns at the border, yes--don't use them about \nthe children, use them about the drug dealers. And by the way, it is \nour insatiable, vociferous desire and appetite for drugs that has \nfueled this whole economy in these countries.\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\n  I am going to say more about this, but I do want to say that what is \nin this supplemental is the tools for people to defend themselves. For \nour friends in the Western States, this is money to protect themselves; \nand for firefighters--and gosh knows our local communities need that \nhelp; it is for a great nation such as Israel, our treasured ally, to \ncontinue to have the interceptor rockets to be able to defend itself; \nand it is also here that we take a look at the border, we honor our law \nin terms of determining refugee status for those fleeing from violence \nin their home country; and then we go after what is creating the \nviolence which is right there in Central America against the \nnarcotraffickers, because remember--and the Presiding Officer is very \nknowledgeable in this--if someone is willing to trade in drugs, they \nare also willing to view everything like a commodity. So they view \ndrugs as a commodity and they view women and children, girls and boys, \nas a commodity, and they are then moved into human trafficking in the \nmost vile, repugnant sexual trafficking.\n  We need to get some of our darker appetites under control, and we \nneed to be able to fight. If we want to fight with guns, join with \nCentral America and fight against the narcotraffickers.\n  I hope that clarifies the intellectual underpinnings of this bill, \nthe compelling financial necessity, and humanitarian issues that are \nfacing people in our own country, at our own border, and with a \ntreasured ally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             International Convention on Disability Rights\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come before the Senate to call again for \nthe ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities.\n  I would like to give a little history. We passed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act here in 1990. It was signed into law by President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush on July 26, 1990--24 years ago last \nSaturday. That changed the face of America. Anywhere you go, you can \nsee ramps and curb cuts and automatic door openers and accessible \nbathrooms and in education kids being integrated fully into schools \nunder the IDEA and ADA. It really did change accessibility and also \nopportunity in the workplace, for example, for people with \ndisabilities.\n  Some years after the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed, the \nUnited Nations set up a committee to study whether there should be a \ntreaty, an international convention on the rights of people with \ndisabilities. That committee drafted it after consultation with us here \nin the Senate. In looking at the ADA, in fact--I was told by one of the \npersons instrumental in this that the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nwhich we refer to as ADA, informed them on what they needed to put into \nthe convention. That convention was sent out to member states for \nratification in 2008. Since that time, 148 nations have ratified it, \nwith one exception--well, there has been more than one exception, but \none glaring exception is the United States.\n  Under our constitutional system, this treaty was sent to the \nPresident. The President sent it to all of his Departments to find out \nwhat laws we had that needed to be changed. So it goes to the \nDepartment of Commerce, the Department of State, the Department of \nAgriculture perhaps, and everywhere else to see what laws we would have \nto change to comply with this treaty. Well, it came back after about a \nyear, and because the Americans with Disabilities Act was so good, we \ndidn't have to change any of our laws--none--because we are the best in \nthe world on it. It was sent to OMB to see if there would be any budget \nimplications, and OMB said there were no budget implications either.\n  After that, the President sent it to the Senate for ratification \nunder our Constitution. It was sent to the Committee On Foreign \nRelations. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts was then the chairman of \nthe committee. They had hearings. In fact, the first two witnesses at \nthe hearings were Senator John McCain and I. There were a lot of other \npeople who testified, both Republicans and Democrats, disabilities \nleaders, disability rights advocates, and others. This was in 2011.\n  Then it was brought to the floor in December of 2012, and that was a \nlameduck session. It turned out that 38 Senators--all on the Republican \nside--had signed a letter that we should not vote on a treaty in a \nlameduck session. There were some other issues raised, but that was the \nbig one. So we brought it up for a vote. In the Constitution, a treaty \nrequires a two-thirds vote of those present and voting, and so we fell \nfive votes short.\n  That Congress ended, so the treaty had to be resubmitted from the \nadministration to the Senate. It went through another hearing process. \nI spoke with the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee \nabout what we could do to advance it, and they wanted more hearings. So \nwe did that. Senator Menendez from New Jersey is now the chair of the \nForeign Relations Committee, and he had more hearings on it.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Menendez, the bill was reported \nout of the committee last week and it was put on the Executive Calendar \nyesterday. There has to be 3 days before they can send it to the floor. \nThey sent it to the floor on Monday, 24-hour layover, and it is now on \nthe Executive Calendar ready to be brought up.\n  I understand we have a busy week this week and there are a lot of \nthings happening. I suppose people could look around and say: What? \nThere is not much happening around here today.\n  But we are in postcloture, and under the rules there is 30 hours of \npostcloture time unless time is yielded back, and evidently--I don't \nknow if that is going to happen. I am hopeful that sometime today or \nlate today maybe or tomorrow, we will have a unanimous consent request \nin terms of bringing up this treaty, this convention on the rights of \npeople with disabilities.\n  So that is what I wanted to talk about today, but I wanted to give a \nbrief history of where we are and why we are at this point.\n  During the past week we have seen extraordinary efforts to move \nforward with this treaty. As I said, Senator Menendez, the chair of the \nForeign Relations Committee, has marked up the treaty and brought it \nout with a 12-to-6 bipartisan vote. The committee added new \nreservations, understandings, and declarations that thoughtfully \naddressed the concerns that have been raised, including the matter of a \nparent's right to decide how their children are schooled as well as \nissues related to federalism and sovereignty.\n  This week we are hearing from disability advocates from across the \ncountry. Yesterday afternoon there was a big rally on the Mall calling \nfor passage of the treaty. Many of our offices have been flooded with \ncalls and visits from people with disabilities, veterans groups, and \nbusiness leaders asking us to vote on and pass this treaty. Businesses \nsuch as Walmart, AT, Sprint, and Coca-Cola have urged passage of this \ntreaty. In the days ahead we will hear from many more calling for its \npassage.\n  Now let me talk about a few of the issues that have been raised. \nFirst, I will talk about the issue of sovereignty. Some of our \ncolleagues continue to express concern about some aspects, particularly \nwith regard to sovereignty and reproductive health. Let me talk about \nsovereignty first, but I want to say this first of all: It is important \nto address these issues thoughtfully and respectfully. The Senate \nForeign Relations Committee in a bipartisan fashion did so last week \nwhen it approved a series of new reservations, understandings, and \ndeclarations.\n  For those who don't know what that means, every treaty we adopt has \nwhat are called RUDs--reservations, understandings, and declarations. \nWhat are those? Those inform other free nations on how we will adopt \nthis treaty, how under our laws and the Constitution we will comport \nwith that treaty. Just about every treaty we have has some reservation \nor understanding or declaration.\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\n  So the Foreign Relations Committee adopted new reservations, \ndeclarations, and understandings, but concerns remain.\n  Last week my good friend the senior Senator from Utah spoke \neloquently about his genuine concerns about the loss of or possible \nloss of U.S. sovereignty. In answering my question as to why this \nconvention is different from the Convention on the Worst Forms of Child \nLabor treaty, he expressed his fear that the disabilities convention \nwould ``threaten American sovereignty and self-government.'' The \nSenator from Utah stated that the child labor convention we passed in \n1999 is the Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. The Senate \nadopted it in 1999. So the Senator from Utah says that convention gives \nauthority to ratifying countries to determine whether they are in \ncompliance with the convention while under the disabilities \nconvention--the CRPD, as it is known--the U.N. determines whether \nratifying countries are in compliance with their treaty obligations. On \nthe Senate floor, my good friend from Utah stated that ``the Disability \nTreaty gives the last word on whether a nation is in compliance to the \nUN, the child labor treaty leaves that entirely up to each nation.''\n  Well, the fact is that the review process of compliance is \nessentially identical in both the Worst Forms of Child Labor treaty \nthat we adopted in 1999 and the CRPD that we are discussing right now.\n  Let me further explain that. When an ILO member--that is the \nInternational Labor Organization, under which that treaty was signed--\nwhen an ILO member state ratifies this convention, it is required to \nsubmit regular reports. Those reports are reviewed by the ILO's \nindependent committee of experts. Keep that phrase in mind--``committee \nof experts.'' It is reviewed by them on the application of conventions \nand recommendations, and they are known as the committee of experts. \nThe task of the committee of experts is to assess the extent to which \nthe ratifying member's legislation and practices are in conformity with \nthe ratified treaty. This is an external review committee, and the \nUnited States has always supported this type of review. The process \nguarantees fairness and openness in the implementation of treaty \nobligations.\n  While it has been suggested that the United States should conduct its \nown compliance with treaty obligations, I ask my colleagues, would we \nbe comfortable with all countries assessing their own compliance with \nimportant international standards? I don't think so.\n  For example, take any treaty--take the START treaty, the arms control \nreduction treaty. Would we be content to say to Russia ``Tell us how \nyou are in compliance with that'' and just accept their word for it? We \nwouldn't do that. We wouldn't do that with any country with which we \nhave a treaty. That is why there is always an external review process \nto see whether country A, B, C or D that has signed on to any treaty is \nin fact in compliance with it. You wouldn't make a treaty and say: OK, \nCountry X, tell us whether you are in compliance and we will just \naccept that. No one would do that. It goes back to Ronald Reagan's \nphrase: Trust but verify. We will trust, but we want verification.\n\n  The Worst Forms of Child Labour treaty, the one we adopted here in \n1999, has the same conclusions and recommendations as this committee of \nexperts as far as external reviews. It is the same in the CRPD, the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and sets up a \n``committee of experts,'' just as it is under the Worst Forms of Child \nLabour treaty, to review whether a country is basically in compliance. \nAre they really implementing the treaty as they said in the treaty?\n  Again, we have the two committees of experts--the one in the CRPD and \nin the Worst Forms of Child Labour treaty, which was adopted here \nunanimously in 1999. The Senator from Utah supported that. The \nrecommendations and conclusions of that committee of experts under the \nWorst Forms of Child Labour treaty that was set up in 1999 are not \nlegally binding on the United States or any other country. Although \nthese recommendations often have great moral weight and persuasive \nvalue, the findings cannot be imposed on any government. It is up to \neach ratifying member to determine whether and to what extent it will \nact upon those recommendations. That is the same as the Convention on \nthe Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n  This committee of experts will certainly go in and do external \nreviews of whether a country is in compliance or working to be in \ncompliance. They may issue findings and conclusions and \nrecommendations, but they are not binding on any country. They are not \nbinding on the United States. Let me repeat: It is up to each ratifying \nmember to determine whether and to what extent it will act upon those \nrecommendations.\n  A review of practices is common whenever a nation undertakes an \ninternational obligation, whether it is by treaty or any other \ninternational agreement. This does not equate to forfeiture by the \nAmerican people of our right to govern or of our sovereignty. It does \nnot relate to any abandonment of our cultural and social values in \nAmerica.\n  In terms of this external review of compliance, there is no \nsubstantive difference between the child labor convention we passed in \n1999 and the U.N. disabilities convention that we hope to bring up. \nBoth treaties have much the same reporting requirements, oversight \nmechanisms, recommendation process, and ``committee of experts.'' And \njust as in 1999 with that earlier treaty, the United States is in no \ndanger of losing any of its sovereignty with the disability treaty--\nnone whatsoever. If we weren't before, we aren't now. These are \nrecommendations.\n  Why should we be afraid of an external review by a committee of \nexperts to see whether we are in compliance with this treaty on the \nrights of people with disabilities? It was modeled after the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, for crying out loud, and we were already in \ncompliance. We are far ahead, quite frankly, of any other country. Why \nshould we be afraid of any review of our laws and practices in terms of \npeople with disabilities? We should not be. We ought to be proud of it. \nIn fact, we ought to be proud of exporting the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.\n  Given these facts, I ask my colleagues: Why is it acceptable to have \nsufficient reservations to protect our sovereignty for a treaty about \nthe worst forms of child labor and a treaty on torture and a treaty on \ndegrading punishment and not be able to have sufficient reservations \nthat protect our sovereignty when it comes to a treaty regarding people \nwith disabilities? What is the difference? From my review of this \nissue, and the review of legal experts, there is no substantive \ndifference to the threat to our sovereignty. As I have stated \npreviously here, scores of Republican policymakers agree with me.\n  I have heard that some of my fellow Republicans are concerned about \nlosing our sovereignty under this treaty. I will point out that former \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush, who signed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, is in strong support of this treaty. Are you telling \nme he doesn't care about our sovereignty? I don't think so. Former \nPresident Bush was a strong supporter. I kind of think he cares about \nour sovereignty. Since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed, \nevery former Republican leader of this Senate--I am talking about \nSenator Dole, Senator Lott, and Senator Frist--supported this treaty. I \nkind of think they care about our sovereignty a lot too. I know every \none of them.\n  Dick Thornburgh, former Attorney General of the United States under \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush, is in strong support of this treaty. Don't \ntell me he doesn't know what is in the treaty. He knows every legal \npart of it. He cares deeply about our sovereignty, and he says this is \nno threat to our sovereignty whatsoever.\n  The American Legion is a big supporter. Are you telling me the \nAmerican Legion commander and all of those veterans are not concerned \nabout our sovereignty? You bet they are. They know this treaty and have \nread the treaty, and they said it doesn't affect our sovereignty. Every \nveterans group supports this bill, and they do care about our \nsovereignty.\n  I hope we can lay that issue aside. This does not impinge or threaten \nour\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\nsovereignty any more than other treaties. Every treaty we have signed \nhas a reservation that basically says a treaty shall be applied in the \nUnited States in accordance with the Constitution as interpreted by the \nUnited States. That is in every treaty we sign, and it says, basically, \nwe are sovereign and our Constitution is sovereign.\n  There was a court case called the Bond case which was recently \ndecided, I think in May, by the Supreme Court. A lot of people wondered \nwhether that would affect this treaty. It was a case that was brought \nup by the United States against a woman for violating the chemical \nweapons ban treaty because she had been trying to poison one of her \nhusband's lovers or something like that. The Supreme Court said: That \nis nonsense. Get out of here. Those laws are covered by the State of \nPennsylvania, not by a treaty. So that kind of put to rest any idea \nthat somehow this treaty overrode our Constitution--our federalism--and \nthe fact that these criminal laws are State laws. That just happened in \nMay.\n  The other issue that has come up is reproductive health. Some of our \ncolleagues have also voiced concern regarding the provision on sexual \nand reproductive health of women with disabilities as it was mentioned \nin article 25 of the treaty. For those not familiar with this \nprovision, the treaty simply says ``persons with disabilities have the \nright to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health \nwithout discrimination on the basis of disability.''\n  The article goes further and says that those countries ratifying the \ntreaty shall ``provide persons with disabilities with the same range, \nquality and standard of free or affordable health care and programmes \nas provided to other persons, including in the area of sexual and \nreproductive health . . . ''\n  Critics of the treaty say this phrase ``creates and expands rights to \nabortion.'' That is not correct. This phrase has nothing to do with \nabortion. What it is about is equality and access.\n  Historically, people with disabilities have been disproportionately \ndiscriminated against when it comes to health care--especially women \nwith disabilities around the world--because they are blind or have \ncerebral palsy or autism or any number of physical or mental \nimpairments. They were often viewed as not being able to be mothers or \nwives or partners in a family.\n  In fact, because of this prejudiced attitude--which still exists in \nso many places around the world, and probably some places here in \nAmerica too--women with disabilities were, and in many cases still are, \ndenied such vital services as Pap smears, gynecological exams, breast \ncancer screenings, and cervical cancer screenings simply because they \nare disabled. Denying women with disabilities the same health \nprevention, screening, and intervention services that are provided to \nwomen without disabilities is blatant discrimination, prejudicial, and \nunethical.\n  The entire purpose of article 25 of the U.N. convention is to address \nthis prejudiced view of the world that has led to thousands of \nunnecessary deaths of women because they have not been afforded the \nsame access to reproductive health care as women without disabilities. \nThat is why that was put in there. It has nothing to do with abortion. \nArticle 25 simply reflects the underlying principles of the treaty: \nequality and access for all. These same principles are the bedrock of \nour own Americans with Disabilities Act. It has nothing to do with \nabortion, but some people have whipped it up and said it does.\n  In some countries women with disabilities have been the most preyed \nupon. It is women with disabilities--physical and intellectual \ndisabilities--who are the subject of maltreatment, mistreatment, and \nsexual abuse. All we are saying is they have to be treated the same as \nany other woman without a disability under the laws of that country. So \nif a country banned all abortions, that is their right to do so. They \ncannot then say: Oh, you may have an abortion if your unborn child is \ndisabled. They can't do that. They can't make exceptions.\n  If they provide any kind of services, they can't say to one woman: \nBecause you are not disabled, you get this service, but if you are \ndisabled, you don't get it. No, no. Equality of access.\n  There are 71 countries that have absolute prohibitions, or \nsignificant restrictions on abortion, that have signed the treaty \nwithout reservations about reproductive health. Imagine that--71. They \nfelt no harm would come from a reservation because they correctly \ndetermined that the treaty is no threat whatsoever to their sovereignty \nand their national laws limiting access to abortion.\n  Poland, a country with strict abortion limitations, was not going to \nsign this treaty because they were concerned about article 25. I will \nread the exact language of the reservation put in by the Nation of \nPoland:\n\n       The Republic of Poland understands that Article 23.1(b) and \n     Article 25(a) shall not be interpreted in a way conferring an \n     individual right to abortion or mandating state party to \n     provide access thereto, unless that right is guaranteed by \n     the national law.\n\n  Well, when they adopted that reservation, Poland signed it on the \ntreaty. Poland's reservation states exactly what this treaty is about, \na guarantee that women with disabilities will have access to the same \nhealth care services guaranteed to all other citizens by their national \nlaw. To say the treaty is about creating and expanding abortion rights \nis just plain wrong, and to make such a claim is utterly unfounded and \nunfair. It is unfair to women with disabilities around the globe. It is \ncreating a false claim out of thin air with no other purpose but to \nprevent ratification of this important treaty.\n  Most of the concerns raised by my colleagues are serious concerns. \nThey are also concerns that can be addressed by thoughtful \nreservations, understandings, and declarations to the treaty. Indeed, \nthey have been addressed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nThey have acted, and now it is time for the full Senate to act.\n  Let us bring the treaty to the floor of the Senate. Listen to \nSenators' concerns, address those concerns, and then vote on the \ntreaty. We owe this to millions of Americans with disabilities--our \nveterans and others who want the same rights and access afforded by our \nown Americans with Disabilities Act. They want it to apply to the \nglobe. We owe this to our veterans who want to be able to travel and \npursue opportunities in other countries, knowing they can enjoy the \nsame rights and access they have here in America.\n\n  Senator Mark Kirk from Illinois said it very eloquently in a press \nconference we had with the veterans groups last week. He said: ``Our \nveterans fought for freedom around the globe. They ought to be able to \nmove freely around the globe.''\n  We owe this to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, \nand countless companies that know that not only is this the right thing \nto do for veterans, it is the right thing to do for business. There are \nall kinds of markets opening all around the world for people with \ndisabilities--new software, new kinds of equipment, new devices that \nare helping people with disabilities live more full and meaningful \nlives. A lot of that was developed here in America. I know our \nbusinesses would like to be involved with this treaty, to be able to be \ninvolved in raising the level of accessibility and opportunity for \npeople with disabilities around the globe. Scores of religious groups \nwant to see this treaty ratified.\n  In closing, it is time to bring this to the floor. As I say, I know \nMembers have serious concerns and those concerns should be addressed. I \nbelieve the Foreign Relations Committee has addressed them. If not, \nthen let's have a discussion about how we meet those reservations. We \nshouldn't just say I don't like the U.N., so therefore we shouldn't \nadopt it.\n  I think there are some people who maybe don't like the U.N. OK, fine. \nI remember when we passed the convention on the worst forms of child \nlabor. I was in Geneva with President Clinton when he signed it. We \ncame back, resubmitted it to the Senate, and I went to see Senator \nJesse Helms to ask him to move this. There was probably no one in my 30 \nyears of history in the Senate who disliked the United Nations more \nthan Jesse Helms of North Carolina. So he went on to tell me just how \nbad the United Nations was but he would bring the treaty to the \ncommittee and have hearings and a markup. He called me as the first \nwitness. I always appreciated that.\n  So Senator Helms, the chairman of the committee--the Republicans were\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\nin charge of the Senate at the time--brought the convention to the \ncommittee and reported it out. I remember him saying one time he didn't \nlike the United Nations, but if this makes them do something good for a \nchange, he would be all right with it, and it passed the floor \nunanimously.\n  I say to those who maybe don't like the United Nations: Fine, that is \ntheir right; perhaps they have good and sufficient reasons not to like \nthe United Nations. I have some problems with the United Nations myself \nat certain times with some of the things they do or don't do. But I see \nthis in the same light as the convention on the worst forms of child \nlabor. This makes countries change for the better through persuasion, \nnot through mandate. No country has to change their laws because of \nwhat the committee on experts says, but through moral weight, through \npersuasion, through working with other countries under this umbrella on \nthe Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. If this \ncauses countries to change their policies and make life better for \npeople with disabilities around the globe, shouldn't we do it, even \nthough we may not like the United Nations? As Jesse Helms said, if this \nmakes them do something good for a change, we ought to be for it.\n  So I hope colleagues will listen to the veterans groups who are for \nit. All business groups I have met with support it strongly. Religious \ngroups and disability groups are united behind this. Listen to our \nformer Republican leaders, including former President George Herbert \nWalker Bush, President Bush; former Senator Bob Dole, the majority \nleader of the Senate, worked his heart out on this. He cares about \nsovereignty. He knows this is not going to take away our sovereignty. \nEvery former Republican leader of the Senate--Senator John McCain--\ncolleagues tell me Senator John McCain doesn't care about our \nsovereignty? I happen to think he cares a lot about our sovereignty. He \ngave a lot of his life protecting our sovereignty. Mark Kirk, Senator \nKelly Ayotte, Senator John Barrasso, Senator Murkowski, and Senator \nCollins are all strong supporters of this.\n  I have been involved in disability policy since I first got here in \n1975, starting in the House. Everything I have ever worked on, \nincluding Education of All Handicapped Children Act, the Television \nDecoder Circuitry Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the ADA Act Amendments later on in 2008--these were \nall nonpartisan. They didn't devolve into any kind of partisan issue. \nNow, that didn't mean that everybody voted for it, but it passed \noverwhelmingly with both Republican and Democrat support. That ought to \nbe the case with this too. Yes, we should address the legitimate and \nhonest concerns people have about home schooling, abortion, and \nsovereignty. I believe we can do that with reservations, but I want \nevery Senator to know that nothing this committee on experts will ever \ndo under the CRPD takes precedence over our Constitution or over our \nlaws. It does nothing to take away our sovereignty, and we can spell \nthat out just as we have in every other treaty we have signed in the \npast.\n  So I hope we can bring this to the floor, and I hope we can have a \ndiscussion. I hope we can work these areas out and have strong support \nfrom both sides to pass this treaty and help change the face of the \nglobe as we have changed the face of America for people with \ndisabilities.\n  I see the Senator from Wyoming is on the floor. I was listing all the \npeople who support the treaty, and one of the strongest supporters of \nthis treaty from the very beginning has been Senator John Barrasso from \nWyoming. I inadvertently, going through the names, left it off, but I \nsee him here, and I apologize because he has been such a strong \nadvocate for people with disabilities in this country and a strong \nadvocate for people with disabilities in the world. I personally want \nto publicly thank Senator Barrasso for his great leadership on this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I thank my colleague from Iowa for his kind comments. \nWe have worked on this issue, and I do this as a physician who has \ntaken care of patients in Wyoming for a quarter of a century. I have so \nmany friends and there are so many folks who have had extra challenges \nin life, and I was happy to stand with Senator Dole and Senator McCain \nand others in this effort. So I thank my colleague for his comments.\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  As a physician, I come to the floor today as I have week after week \nsince the President's health care law was passed because I have many \nconcerns about the way this health care law is impacting families in my \nhome State of Wyoming, as well as across the country--people who find \nout their rates are going up, they are paying higher deductibles, \nhigher copays, higher premiums. They feel the government is in control, \nWashington is in control rather than them, when Washington decides if \nthe insurance policy they have had and that worked for them is \nsomething they will be able to keep, and many times they weren't \nbecause the President's law said no, it wasn't good enough for them, \neven though the families in Wyoming are better able to make the \ndecision about what is better and more important for them. They don't \nlike it when the President tells them they need to buy insurance they \ndon't want or need or can afford, in many ways, with a long list of \nprovisions that Washington mandates be included.\n  I hear every week, as I did last weekend in Wyoming, from folks who \nhave had work hours cut, resulting in lower take-home pay because of \nthe impact of part of the law that resulted in bipartisan opposition \nthat says the work week is 30 hours. So people who are working part-\ntime have had their hours cut to below 30 hours and have lower take-\nhome pay.\n  I talked to ER doctors at home and around the country where I have \ntrained and where I have gone to medical school. The Wall Street \nJournal even wrote about it last month: ``ER visits rise despite the \nlaw. Health act isn't cutting volume.'' On the front page the lead \nparagraph said: ``Early evidence suggests that emergency rooms have \nbecome busier since the Affordable Care Act expanded insurance coverage \nthis year, despite the law's goal of reducing unnecessary care in \nERs.'' It says: Democrats who designed that law hoped it would do the \nopposite, but that hasn't been the case.\n  I heard last weekend in Wyoming the story about all of these fake \napplications that--actually I guess the Government Accountability \nOffice said let's see how well this works; is the Obama health care law \nworking? So they made up 10 fake applications, sent them in, and they \nfound out that actually a dozen fictitious applicants, online or by \nphone, using invalid or missing Social Security numbers--this is the \nWashington Post writing about this, but it was in stories across the \ncountry--invalid or missing Social Security numbers, inaccurate \ncitizenship information--all but one of the fake applicants ended up \ngetting subsidized coverage.\n  So here we are, a health care law that is supposed to provide a \nnumber of things, including integrity, and we find out that when the \nGovernment Accountability Office says, let's just put in a number of \napplications and see what happens, it is not working.\n  The administration set up the Health Insurance Marketplace in ways--\nwe are hearing from the Government Accountability Act--that leave it \nvulnerable to fraud and a waste of taxpayer money. That is what we are \ndealing with in this health care law.\n  I know many Senators are preparing to head home, and they will be \ntraveling around their home States in the month of August. I expect \nevery Senator who goes home will hear from people in their State about \nvery damaging side effects that so many people across America are \nfeeling from the President's health care law. I hear it every weekend, \nbut I hear it when I travel as well. As chairman of the Republican \npolicy committee, one of my responsibilities is to study how policies \nthat come out of Washington, such as the President's health care law, \naffect people all across America, and that is what I try to look at. So \nin looking around the country, here is what I found in Louisiana.\n  Last month, the Shreveport Times in Louisiana had an op-ed written by \na Dr. Regina Fakner. The headline was: ``Washington ties doctors' \nhands''--not\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\nthe doctor, not the hospital, not the patients--``Washington ties \ndoctors' hands.'' The doctor who wrote this op-ed says she has \npracticed pediatric medicine in Shreveport since the early 1990s.\n  We need pediatricians. We need people to take care of children. We \nneed primary care physicians. There is a gross shortage of nurses, of \nphysicians, of additional health care personnel.\n  She says health care was and is impossible to navigate because it is \nwrapped in layers of red tape and government regulations. This doctor \nknows America's health care system needed reform. We needed to do \nsomething.\n  That is what Republicans here in the Senate have been saying too: We \nneed to do something. The American people wanted reform that gave them \naccess to high-quality, affordable care. That is not what people got.\n  As this doctor writes in the Shreveport Times: ObamaCare only adds to \nthe mess, she said. This is a pediatrician who takes care of lots of \nchildren. She says ``patients and health care providers suffer for \nit.'' The government does not suffer. The Senate Democrats who voted \nfor it do not suffer. Patients and health care providers are suffering. \nShe puts patients first, which is what doctors do.\n\n  The President's health care law has added tens of thousands of pages \nof redtape and Washington mandates--thousands of pages of redtape and \nmandates. The doctor says in her op-ed that ``this one-size-fits all \napproach limits patient freedom, while picking their pockets.'' This is \na doctor who talks to her patients every day. She says she has seen for \nherself in Louisiana how Washington is standing between her and her \npatients. Nothing should be between a patient and that person's \ndoctor--nothing--not a government bureaucrat, not an insurance company \nbureaucrat, no one. The doctor-patient relationship is one that is \nsacred.\n  This doctor's experience is typical of what I am hearing and what we \nare hearing from all across the country from doctors.\n  Every Democrat in the Senate voted to pass this terrible health care \nlaw. President Obama says Democrats who voted for the health care law \nshould, as he said, ``forcefully defend and be proud of'' the law.\n  Is the President proud that patients and health care providers such \nas this pediatrician are suffering because of his health care law and \nall of its dangerous side effects? Where are the Democrats ready to \nforcefully defend standing between Louisiana doctors and their \npatients? Where are they? I do not see them coming to the floor.\n  Democrats in Washington were so eager to pass the President's health \ncare law that they made a lot of promises, and they were not true. They \nsaid people could keep their insurance. That was not true. It seems as \nthough 5 million people received letters saying their insurance had \nbeen canceled, in spite of what the President had promised them.\n  People in Wyoming, people in Louisiana, people all across the country \nlost the insurance they had because it did not include all the \nunnecessary coverage the President's health care law mandated.\n  Democrats said people could keep their doctor. That was not true. \nPeople in Wyoming, Louisiana, all across America lost their doctor \nbecause the new, narrow provider networks made people lose the doctor \nthey had worked with, who treated them, who treated members of their \nfamily, whom they knew and trusted.\n  The President said the American people would save $2,500 per year, \nper family on insurance premiums. Democrats in the Senate who voted for \nthe law promised the same. I remember them standing here. I can see one \nafter another saying that. It was not true.\n  People all across America are paying more than ever because of the \nhealth care law. Well, people in Louisiana specifically, where this \npediatrician lives and works and takes care of patients, are paying a \nlot more.\n  There is an article from the Associated Press newspaper in Lake \nCharles, LA, last Thursday: ``Health insurance price increases could \ntop 10 percent for thousands in Louisiana.'' That was the headline on \nthe front page above the fold.\n  According to the article, Blue Cross--that is the largest health \ninsurer in Louisiana--is planning to raise rates by more than 18 \npercent next year.\n  Is President Obama ready to forcefully defend these premium increases \nbecause of the law? He is the one who said premiums were going to go \ndown. The American people see what has happened. The President did not \nsay, well, they are just not going to kind of go up as fast. He said \nthey were going to go down $2,500 per year, per family. So we are \nseeing large increases all across the country.\n  Are the Democrats in the Senate proud that families in Louisiana are \ngetting hit with another 18-percent premium increase in some locations? \nHigher premiums, higher copays, higher deductibles--all to pay for \ncoverage that people do not want, do not need, cannot afford, but were \nmandated to have.\n  People in Louisiana were already paying more because of the \nPresident's health care law. There is a recent study which found that \nhealth insurance premiums for an average 27-year-old man in Louisiana \nare over 100 percent higher this year than last year--double, double \nthis year from last year. That is before they were forced into the \nObamaCare exchange. Premiums for an average 64-year-old woman are \n$2,000 more this year than they were last year. These are very \nexpensive side effects for families in Louisiana as a result of the \nPresident's health care law.\n  What does the President have to say about these outrageous rate hikes \nthat he caused because of his health care law? What does he have to say \nto the people suffering from the costly side effects of the health care \nlaw?\n  Well, the President went to Kansas City, MO, in the last couple days. \nI think when he travels outside of Washington, the President should \nactually meet with doctors who live in those communities, doctors such \nas this woman, this pediatrician, who practices in Louisiana. He should \nsit down with the women whose children are patients of doctors such as \nthis one, talk to the parents of these children about what the impact \nof his health care law has been on them.\n  The President should hear directly--directly--from these people about \nthe devastating side effects of his health care law and how it is \nhurting them and hurting their families.\n  Every Democrat in the Senate voted for this health care law--every \none of them.\n  Where are the Democrats willing to forcefully defend these costly and \ndamaging side effects of their health care law? Democrats do not want \nto defend this terrible law and all of its devastating side effects.\n  Republicans are going to keep talking about this law. We are going to \nkeep standing for American families who are being hurt by this law. We \nare going to continue to come to the floor to talk about stories that \nwe hear from back home, what we hear from families in our home States, \npeople who have lost their insurance and end up having to get insurance \nthey do not need or do not want or are never going to use that is much \nmore expensive than what they had before because the insurance that \nworked for their families the President said was not good enough.\n  We are going to continue to come and talk about the families who have \nseen their take-home pay go down because instead of being able to take \nthat money home and working the hours they want, they have had their \nhours cut, not because they were not needed at work, not because there \nwas not a demand for their services, but because of the health care law \nthat says anybody working over 30 hours a week is then considered full \ntime, and by the President's mandate, they have to be supplied with \nhealth insurance at work.\n  So what happens? Businesses--and it is not just businesses--what we \nare seeing are school districts, counties, county governments, the \nwhole State of Virginia--the different governing bodies--as to any \npart-time workers, they are saying: Well, we have to keep them below 30 \nhours because we cannot afford the insurance for these folks. So these \nfolks are saying: Well, I lose my take-home pay. And the reason is the \nPresident's health care law. School districts are having to say: Well, \nwe can keep them above 30 hours and then have to pay for their \ninsurance, but\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\nthen we are going to have to fire a number of reading teachers, fire \nthe coach, fire the bus driver, fire someone else who works in the \nschool.\n  That is not a way to help people in a community. That is not good for \nanybody's health. But those are the side effects of the President's \nhealth care law--a bill that so few people actually read before they \nvoted for it because, as Nancy Pelosi famously said: First you have to \npass it before you get to find out what is in it.\n  So we are going to continue to talk about patient-centered reforms, \nreforms that get people the care they need from a doctor they choose at \nlower cost. We are going to talk about restoring people's freedom, \nfreedom to buy health insurance that works for them and their families \nbecause they know what is best for them. It is not Washington \ncontrolled; it is local decisions, families making decisions for \nthemselves. And we are going to talk about giving people choices, not \nWashington mandates. Republicans are going to keep offering real \nsolutions for better health care without all of these tragic side \neffects.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, there is a long list of items on the \nSenate agenda that are important to our country, including reforming \nthe VA health system, addressing the crisis at our border, and ensuring \nfunding is available for improvements to our roads and bridges.\n  While it may seem as though other issues are on the back burner, they \nare not. I want Arkansans to know I hear you loudly and clearly about \nyour dislike for ObamaCare. Recent court rulings confirm ObamaCare is \nunworkable. Americans understand how the law infringes on our rights. \nThe Supreme Court reserved the right for business owners to object to \noverbearing government mandates that would violate our religious \nbeliefs.\n  The promises that were made were not true--like the law will lower \nour premiums. The reality is ObamaCare drives up health insurance \npremiums and copays, and that is what hurts our wallets.\n  Sean from Hackett, AR, wrote to me about a blood test his fiancee \nneeded to help diagnose her illness. In the past, she had a copayment \nand the rest of the bill was paid by her insurance. But Sean wrote:\n\n       Normally it would only cost $25 for a co-payment. Now she \n     received a $200 bill.\n\n  You remember the other promises, such as you can keep your doctors \nand Medicare will not be cut.\n  Cyndi, who lives in rural Arkansas, detailed the problem she is \nhaving with Medicare because of ObamaCare. The changes made through \nObamaCare have cost her both time and money. ``Not everyone lives in \nthe big city where clinics, doctors and hospitals are easily \navailable,'' she wrote. ``Many of these facilities have closed their \ndoors or the doctors are not accepting Medicare patients.''\n  Connie, a registered nurse in Arkansas, told me that she is sick of \nObamaCare and sees the problems her patients and family have to deal \nwith under the law, which includes losing their doctors and the use of \nthe local hospital. She wrote that the cost of the insurance payments \nincreased and customers have to pay such high deductibles that they \ncannot afford to go to the doctor.\n  These failed promises are negatively impacting Arkansans. The ugly \nreality is people are struggling under this law. Amanda's story is what \nso many middle-class families are experiencing. Her family is already \ntrying to make ends meet, but she says ObamaCare is not affordable. \n``There is no way humanly possible that my family can afford a monthly \nfee of $654,'' she wrote.\n  ObamaCare costs American taxpayers more than $2 trillion, but like in \nthe case with Amanda's family, health care is more unaffordable.\n  I believe we need to start over by creating real reforms that lower \ncosts, increase choice, and eliminate Washington's control of our \nhealth care. We need health care reform, but ObamaCare is not the \nanswer. We need to transition the employer-based private insurance \nmarket toward one that allows for flexibility, choice, portability, and \nfairness.\n\n  Let's allow small business owners to pool together to purchase group \ninsurance. Let's allow individuals to purchase insurance across State \nlines to increase competition. Let's expand health savings accounts and \nflexible savings accounts. Let's address medical malpractice reform and \nprevent lawsuit abuse.\n  I want you to know that unraveling ObamaCare and starting over is at \nthe top of my agenda because health care needs to be much more \naffordable than it currently is under ObamaCare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I join my colleagues here to talk about \nsome of the stories we are hearing from the people we work for. I have \nbeen to the floor many times talking about the stories we are getting \nfrom families, from moms, from people trying to get that first job, \nfrom people who suddenly are no longer working the 40 hours they used \nto work because of the impact this has had on the 40-hour workweek.\n  Let me mention, as I am here between Senator Boozman and Senator \nJohanns, just two recent contacts we have had. We have had one from \nJoanne in Fulton, MO. She said her premiums went up from $110 a month \nto $311 a month--an increase of $201 a month. She said:\n\n       Our monthly premium has gone up to $311 a month. It is a \n     large increase for us--it is nearly triple of what we paid \n     before my husband's retirement. It really takes a bite out of \n     our budget.\n\n  She believes this would not have happened without what is happening \nin our health care system. I had a list of employees from one of our \ncounties in Missouri the other day. Because it is a small county, they \nrate their employees. Each one of them pays a different premium, even \nthough the county helps some with that premium. Everybody who is over \n50 had their premium--that is going to be the premium next year--at \nleast doubled. If you were 19, 20, 21, your premium was about what it \nhad been the year before. If you were 51 or 61, your premium was twice \nwhat it had been before.\n  Then we got a letter from Jerrold of Kansas City, who said he has \nseen significant increases in his out-of-pocket costs, both for what he \npays in premiums and what he pays for prescriptions. Jerrold said that \ninstead of retiring at 65, he has had to keep working to help pay for \nhis medical and prescription costs. Jerrold says:\n\n       I started paying $131.00 a month for health and $31 for \n     prescriptions. As soon as ObamaCare was phased in my premiums \n     went up to $149.00 for health coverage and my prescription \n     plan went to $49.\n\n  Like many other people, he expects his plan to go up even more next \nyear.\n  So these are real impacts on the lives of families, people who are \npaying more for the care they get and finding the choices they have as \nto where they get their care are less than they have ever been before. \nThese stories keep coming. This is affecting the health care needs and \nthe health care of individuals and families. We need to do something \nabout it.\n  I thank Senator Johanns for letting me tell those two stories before \nhe took time to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I was here during the days when the \nAffordable Care Act was being debated, if you could call it that. I was \nhere during the time when the effort of Senate Democrats was simply to \nkeep 60 together so they could pass this bill under any circumstances. \nThere were all kinds of promises made as to what this bill was going to \ndo.\n  President Obama himself, when he talked about his plan for health \ncare, said: My plan is going to reduce your premiums by $2,500 a year.\n  But I could go on and on. I could spend the whole afternoon talking \nabout the promises that were made. Now it is time though to take stock \nand determine whether those promises were in fact kept. The people of \nour States tell that story. A Nebraskan from the central part of the \nState wrote to me recently and said this: He and his wife are losing \nthe health insurance they have had for over 21 years. Their premiums \nhad doubled, threatening their retirement savings.\n  He went on to say, ``ObamaCare has ruined the lives we planned and we\n\n[[Page S5101]]\n\nworked so hard for.'' So let me compare what this gentleman from \nCentral Nebraska has seen with the promises that were made. Remember \nthat promise the President made over and over again. Members on the \nDemocratic side of this body made the same promise. The promise was, if \nyou like your plan, you are going to get to keep it--and the promise \nthat your health insurance premiums would go down.\n  This gentleman from Central Nebraska is living proof that those \npromises were not kept.\n  Another Central Nebraskan wrote to me about the effect of the health \ncare law on his wife's job and on his family: ``Because of the ACA she \nwas cut back to less than 25 hours a week and lost our health \ninsurance.''\n  He went on to say that their new premium is twice as much as the plan \nthey liked and the one they lost because of ObamaCare.\n  So you see again we have a situation where we can compare reality \nwith the promises that were made. The promises that your premium would \ngo down, that you could keep the plan you had if you liked it went out \nthe window for those two families.\n  A small construction company from the western part of Nebraska shared \nthis with me: They will be paying an additional $5,000 in ObamaCare \nfees this year. They expect to dedicate over 52 hours to report and \ncomply. To them this is incredibly frustrating because these fees and \nhours of compliance have no direct benefit on their employees, their \nemployees' benefits or their business mission. It is just the Federal \nGovernment has now taken this small company and forced upon them \nadditional costs and additional compliance requirements.\n  One of the most compelling stories comes from the mother of a family \nin Omaha, NE. She explained in her letter that they qualify for a \nsubsidy on the exchange, but the options on healthcare.gov were still \nunaffordable for this family. The lowest cost plan had a $9,600 \ndeductible. Does the Presiding Officer know what a $9,600 deductible \nmeans to most Americans and to most Nebraskans? It means that if they \nhave the kind of illness or accident or whatever it is that requires \nsignificant medical care and if they have to eat through a $9,600 \ndeductible, that means bankruptcy.\n  When considering this massive deductible, she wrote to me and said, \n``It makes more sense to put more money away in savings and just pay \nfor the whole doctor's visit.'' Due to the high cost of plans and their \nother expenses, she said, ``We are forced to make the choice to go with \nno insurance.''\n  I was on the floor during this debate. Democrat after Democrat \npromised: You are going to have insurance now, promised that premiums \nwould go down, promised that if you liked your plan, you got to keep \nit. Unfortunately, that has not been the case.\n  With the new enrollment period on the horizon, the stories will of \ncourse continue to roll in. The supporters of ObamaCare, just as when \nthis bill was being debated, would like us to believe their train wreck \nhas been cleaned up, the train cars are no longer lying next to the \ntracks, and this law is finally on track. But that is not consistent \nwith recent headlines, reality, court decisions, inspectors general \nreports or just the average American who takes the time to write to us.\n  Politico reported earlier this month: ``Most state health insurance \nrates for 2015 are scheduled to be approved by early fall, and most are \nlikely to rise.''\n  This law should have never been passed, but now it is time to scrap \nthis law and its Washington-knows-best mandates; instead, work toward \nsolutions that truly do address the cost of care and give Americans the \nflexibility to choose a plan that makes sense for their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we are now several months into the \nimplementation of ObamaCare. The dust has settled. People from my \nState, Hoosiers, continue to see the reality of this law. Unfortunately \nwhat they see is not what they had hoped for. Earlier this month a news \nreport revealed that health insurance rates will increase fairly \ndramatically in ``most States''--not just a few, not some but most. \nThey said they are likely to rise in the coming year.\n  Unfortunately, my State is one of those States. Unfortunately, \n``likely to rise'' is an understatement. ``Dramatic increase'' would be \na better phrase. The recent headline from the Indianapolis Business \nJournal reads, ``Indiana's ObamaCare rates for 2015 are all over the \nmap.'' The first sentence of the article states, ``Initial 2015 \npremiums filed for the ObamaCare exchanges in Indiana range from as \nhigh as a 46-percent hike to as low as a 9-percent cut.''\n  The article continues: ``Those are the average changes in premiums \nproposed by the four health insurers that sold plans on the ObamaCare \nexchanges for 2014.'' One of those insurance companies providing health \ncare to the State exchange we now learn is requesting rates that range \nfrom a 31-percent to a 59-percent increase in premiums. So the picture \nahead for those who have been incorporated into ObamaCare in my State \nis the shock of double-digit and significant double-digit increases in \ntheir health care costs, not to mention that under their current plans \nthey are paying higher deductibles, which result in higher costs they \nfirst have to put out before they are reimbursed. But now there is an \nincrease of significance for their premiums going into next year.\n  I know the majority leader said all the stories we have been telling \nabout real people and their reactions to the Affordable Care Act, \nObamaCare, are fiction. I was on the floor when he said that. We all \ndid a double take because we have been receiving thousands--literally \nthousands--of emails, physical mail, and phone calls. The phones are \nringing off the hook about people alarmed over what they were \nexperiencing signing up for ObamaCare, and, secondly, what the terms \nwere going to be.\n  So we collected all of these. We have hundreds if not thousands of \nreal live examples, not made up, not fiction, basically describing the \nimpact on them and their families as Obamacare was put in place. Let me \nstate one of those incidents. I will use just the first name. I do not \nwant to put this person at risk for some kind of pushback. But Charles \nfrom Auburn, IN, emailed me and shared that his wife had just received \na cancellation notice from her insurance provider. Charles said the \nnotice indicated that the wife--he said:\n\n       They said my wife's policy did not comply with the \n     requirements of ObamaCare and the replacement policy--\n\n  Which she would have to take if she wanted the coverage.\n\n     --would be $695.38 a month as compared to her current policy \n     premium of $316 a month.\n\n  By my math, that is over a 100-percent increase. That is more than a \ndoubling of what he had paid before. Also, the notice said, ``Your \ndeductible will be $6,000.'' That is every medical expense that she has \nwill have to be paid for before Charles and his wife can get any \nreimbursement. Now I wish these stories were fiction, but unfortunately \nI receive emails such as this on a regular basis.\n  Thousands of Hoosiers have lost their coverage that they liked, that \nthey chose and relied on because of the implementation of Obamacare.\n  We have been talking about replacing this act with something far more \nsensible and something far more reasonable. Yet we have been denied the \nopportunity to go forward with offering any kind of amendments, \nmodifications, repeal or any other process. That is unfortunate but not \njust for us. It is unfortunate for the country and unfortunate for all \nof those people whom we represent who would like to see modifications \nand a much more affordable and much better range of choices for the \nprovisions of health care.\n  The 2,000-page ObamaCare law was sold to the American people on what \nnow has turned out to be false pretenses. I believe we owe it to them \nto replace this law with some commonsense solutions that increase \naccess to quality care without increasing costs. It is doable if we had \nthe opportunity to do it. Unfortunately, we have been denied that, but \nthe American people are speaking. I think they will continue to speak \nabout the need for those reforms that will have to take place if we are \ngoing to provide affordable care for Americans.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5102]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Wildfire Disaster Funding\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today there are wildfires burning across \nthe West. I wish to speak for a few moments about some very important \nwork that Chair Mikulski and her colleagues have done on the \nAppropriations Committee that is really built on a bipartisan proposal \nthat Senator Crapo, our colleague from Idaho, and I, with a large group \nof bipartisan Senators, are proposing to change the way in which \nforests are managed and reduce the likelihood of some of--what I call--\nthese infernos. These are fires that are bigger, hotter, more damaging, \nand they act like a wrecking ball pounding at the rural West.\n  What has happened over the years is that the preventive efforts in \nthe West in terms of our forests are underfunded. There isn't enough \neffort that goes to hazardous fuels management and thinning and \nprograms that reduce the huge load of fuels on the forest floor.\n  Just this past weekend I was in Medford in rural southern Oregon and \nin Portland, meeting with the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement. They told me about the problems that Senator Crapo and I \nare trying to address in bipartisan legislation that Chairman Mikulski \nhas included in her appropriations bill.\n  The heart of the problem is that these prevention efforts are \nunderfunded. When it gets very dry and very hot, and particularly when \nthere is a lightning strike or a series of lightning strikes, what we \nhave is an enormous fire in a hurry. All through the West there is an \neffort to try to share resources, and communities work together and try \nto share efforts--aerial resources and others--but the reality is there \nis not enough money in the agency's budgets to put out those huge \nfires.\n  What happens then is the bureaucracy borrows from the prevention fund \nin order to have funds to put the fire out. Then we are on our way to \ntwo bigger problems. We are on our way again to a lack of preventive \ndollars because of this fire borrowing. Some of our colleagues call it \nfire robbery, but I am trying to be diplomatic. It is fire borrowing, I \nguess, if we want to be diplomatic. But we underfund prevention. Then, \nof course, we don't have enough money needed for suppression as well.\n  This trend that I have described is getting more and more pronounced \nand more and more serious. So what Senator Crapo and I are proposing to \ndo in order to put the focus on wildfire prevention is in effect to say \nthat the most serious fires, especially in the West--the kind of fires \nthat are dominating our TV screens night after night--1 percent of \nthose infernos ought to be treated like the major natural disasters \nthey are and would be funded in the same way as other natural \ndisasters, such as floods and hurricanes.\n  Specifically, the legislation that Senator Crapo and I and others are \nadvancing would move any spending above 70 percent of the 10-year \nrolling average for fire suppression outside of the Agency's baseline \nbudget by making these additional costs eligible to be funded under a \nseparate disaster account.\n  So far this year, more than 33,000 fires have burned a total of 1.6 \nmillion acres nationwide, and the numbers are growing by the minute.\n  Just this past weekend, visiting with our wonderfully talented folks \nat the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management in Medford, they \nwere telling me that their concern is that in southern Oregon it is \nvery hot and very dry and there can be lightning strikes. They were \nconcerned about the prospect of another Biscuit Fire, which we had at \nthe beginning of the century and which burned 500,000 acres--really, \nour most destructive fire ever. That was what was on the mind of the \nfirefighting professionals when I visited with them in Medford last \nFriday.\n  This year the administration already expects to exceed its \nfirefighting budget by more than $600 million, and that isn't going to \nsurprise anybody in the West. In 8 of the past 10 years, the Forest \nService has spent more than its wildfire suppression budget, requiring \nthe Agency to engage in what I have just called ``fire borrowing'' to \ncover these wildfire suppression costs. The reality is that, in many \ncases, the borrowed monies are not repaid. In the cases where the funds \nare repaid, it is only through costly supplemental spending bills that \nCongress has to enact or by taking money out of future years' budgets.\n  So what we have is this kind of borrowing that is extraordinarily \ndisruptive to the ongoing work the Forest Service and their contractors \nare in the middle of performing. And, I might add, what all this does \nis it makes it more expensive in the future and makes it less likely \nthat we are going to get the important prevention work that is so \nnecessary.\n  In our part of the world, I think it is fair to say that westerners \nare coming to consider that the Forest Service charged with managing \nthe Nation's forests for multiple uses and users has really become \nsomething that more appropriately should be called the U.S. Fire \nService, because in effect that is what this agency is month after \nmonth using more of its resources on.\n\n  What I was told in Portland last Saturday, having visited rural \nOregon on Friday and Portland on Saturday--the specialists in Portland \non Saturday told me that the fire season is 70 days longer than it was \nuntil recently.\n  So we have this challenge of more fuel load built up on the forest \nfloor, drier conditions, lightning strikes, and fire seasons lasting \nlonger. That is a prescription for trouble in the rural West, and in \nfact that is what we are seeing.\n  My hope is that, as a result of the work that Senator Crapo and I and \nothers are seeking to do, we can have more hazardous fuel treatment, \nmore preventive work that will be effective at reducing fire risks and \nlowering costs.\n  A fire in central Oregon this year slowed to a halt when it reached \ntreated areas outside the city of Bend. I saw that when I was in Bend \nlooking at the difference between treated areas--this preventative kind \nof approach--and areas that were untreated.\n  A study published by Northern Arizona University's Ecological \nRestoration Institute concluded that treatments ``can reduce fire \nseverity'' and ``successfully reduce fire risk to communities.''\n  Based on Department of the Interior and Department of Agriculture \nanalysis, 1 percent of wildland fires represents 30 percent of \nfirefighting costs. That is what Senator Crapo and I want to address in \nour bill.\n  What we are saying is, for that 1 percent, the 1 percent that is \nreally driving up costs, let's handle those fires as what they are, \nwhich are natural disasters. And then, instead of raiding the \nprevention money to put the fires out, we will be able to cause less \nproblems in the future because we will have the kind of preventive work \nthat is so effective that I saw in Bend and elsewhere.\n  It seems to me, as we see in a lot of parts of government, there is a \nchoice. We can spend modest sums up front on prevention in order to \ngenerate significant savings down the road. If we have $1 to spend, we \nought always to try to put it in prevention and then target scarce \nresources to fight fires. To the greatest extent possible, we must \ntarget disaster money on those infernos that are bigger and hotter and \nmore damaging and cost about 30 percent of the overall budget.\n  In summary, the legislation that Senator Crapo and I and others are \npursuing would fund the true catastrophic fire events under separate \nnatural disaster programs. Routine wildland firefighting costs would be \nfunded through the normal budget and appropriations process.\n  Oversight hearings, letters, and numerous discussions with the \nadministration and colleagues helped to produce the approach that \nChairman Mikulski has included. I remember not long ago being in Idaho, \nbeing hosted by our colleagues Senator Crapo and Senator Risch. We had \nMembers from across the political spectrum. Congressman Labrador from \nthe other body was there. We had progressive Members. This is something \nthat is common sense. It just makes sense to make sure that the small \nnumber of\n\n[[Page S5103]]\n\nfires, these infernos which are dominating our news accounts, that we \nhandle them from the natural disaster fund. Then let's put most of the \nmoney and allow the Forest Service, BLM, and professionals to put their \nfocus and their resources where we can prevent as much of the problem \nas possible--and prevent it early on.\n  That is the point of our legislation. We are very grateful to \nChairman Mikulski for her effort. I thank Senator Crapo for his \nsupport. He and I have been at this with Senator Risch, Senator \nMerkley, Senator Cantwell, Senator Murray, Senator Bennet--Western \nSenators and others such as Senator Baldwin and Manchin that understand \nthe importance of national forests. Senator Udall has been doing \nimportant work on this in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \nAll of the Western Senators are of like mind here. Chair Mikulski \nrecognizes what we are looking at and the prospect that we would be \nleaving this week without this change to make better use of our \nresources. I call it legislative malpractice because we have an \nopportunity in a bipartisan way to make a real difference here. If our \ncolleagues are outside the West, I would say it is a chance to spend \nscarce dollars more effectively. For us in the West, it is nothing \nshort of survival.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Oregon, his \nleadership, along with Senator Crapo, on this firefighting budgeting \nand fire borrowing issue--that is really what it is--is critical to all \nof us in Western States. Every single one of us has seen communities \ntouched by these catastrophic wildfires as our climate is changing and \nwe see fires get bigger and bigger. But we have solutions, and the \nsolutions are bipartisan and common sense.\n  I can only hope that we are able to move quickly to make these budget \nchanges. They will make a real difference for all of us up and down in \nthe Intermountain West.\n\n\n                             Border Crisis\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues who have \nbeen vocal about their commitment to address the Central American \nrefugee crisis along our southern border.\n  We have heard the stories of unimaginable violence, of corruption, of \ninstability in places such as Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala--\nfactors that are driving many children to the United States and to \nother neighboring countries in Central America. In some cases these \nchildren are literally fleeing for their lives.\n\n  Our Nation has responded with a spectrum of attitudes toward \nimmigrants ranging from hostile to downright hospitable. It is my hope \nthat our attitude as a nation continues to be defined by the image of \nthe Statue of Liberty and not by shouting protesters holding signs \nlabeled ``Return to Sender'' as they stand in front of buses full of \nCentral American children.\n  I recently received a letter from a constituent in my home State of \nNew Mexico whose grandmother, as a result of extreme poverty, left her \nfamily and emigrated by herself to the United States from Ireland at \nthe age of 14 at the end of World War I. Brendan said that when he was \ngrowing up, his grandmother frequently shared this Irish proverb with \nhim. She said, ``Courage is the trust that your feet will bring you to \nwhere your heart is.'' Brendan asked that I continue to remind my \ncolleagues that the immigrants who arrive at our borders come by foot \nfollowing their hearts and do so in the hope of building a better life.\n  Last week I sat down with Ambassadors from Honduras, El Salvador, and \nGuatemala, and we discussed how our Nation's approach to stemming the \ninflux of unaccompanied children to the United States must be \ncollaborative and get at the root cause of the dire situation in these \ncountries. With out-of-control drug cartels and nearly 90 murders for \nevery 100,000 persons annually, Honduras now has the highest murder \nrate in the world. Similarly, El Salvador and Guatemala have the \nworld's fourth and fifth highest murder rates. There is no easy \nsolution to these problems, but Congress has an opportunity and a \nresponsibility to act on pragmatic measures before time and resources \nrun out.\n  Secretary Johnson has warned that Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nwill run out of money in August and Customs and Border Protection will \nrun out of money in mid-September if nothing is done. With resources \nalready running scarcer by the day, Customs and Border Protection won't \nhave any other choice but to direct border agents away from other \nsectors of our southern border and into the Rio Grande Valley.\n  So let's be clear. Those who would choose not to support this \nemergency supplemental are putting our border security at risk. New \nMexico, California, Arizona, and West Texas will all see fewer agents \nand fewer resources on our border if the House and Senate do not act.\n  This is no way to address a crisis. We must pass the Senate's \nemergency supplemental funding bill introduced by Senate Appropriations \nCommittee chairwoman Barbara Mikulski. This emergency funding bill \nincludes important resources to help stem the current refugee crisis \nwhile continuing to treat these refugee children humanely as required \nby the law. This situation is an emergency, and we need emergency \nfunding.\n  Passing the emergency supplemental would also allow the Departments \nof Homeland Security and Justice to deploy additional enforcement \nresources, including immigration judges, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement attorneys, and asylum officers, as well as expanding the \nuse of the alternatives to detention program.\n  Instead of ensuring that we provide these necessary resources to \naddress this crisis on our border, some of our colleagues are actually \nproposing that the solution is to actually weaken Federal child \ntrafficking law and to roll back protections for unaccompanied child \nrefugees seeking asylum. The proposal introduced by our colleague from \nTexas Senator Cornyn would weaken the 2008 William Wilberforce \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act and short-circuit justice in order \nto deport refugee children faster and without the due process afforded \nunder our law.\n  According to a poll released Tuesday by the Public Relations Research \nInstitute, 69 percent of those surveyed believe that U.S. authorities \nshould treat the children as refugees and allow them to stay in the \ncountry if it is determined it is not safe for them to return to their \nhome country.\n  Some would use this crisis to eliminate crucial child trafficking \nprotection, punish some of our Nation's brightest DREAM Act students, \nand promote a narrow border-enforcement-only agenda. I believe we are a \nbetter nation than that, frankly.\n  Let's step back and remember that just 1 year ago the Senate passed a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill that included provisions to \nfurther strengthen the border but that would also protect refugee \nchildren and crack down on smugglers and transnational criminal \norganizations. Notably, the bill was widely supported by both Democrats \nand Republicans in the Senate. Public support and good economics have \nnot been enough to convince House Republican leaders to hold a vote on \nimmigration reform, but they cannot turn a blind eye to the current \nhumanitarian crisis along our southern border.\n  The bipartisan Senate bill that passed more than a year ago includes \nprovisions for family reunification and for the protection of children \nwho have been the victims of human trafficking. The bill also includes \nmeasures that would address refugee and asylum laws.\n  The public, including faith-based organizations, educators, local \nelected officials, small businesses, and many others, overwhelmingly \nsupports this balanced approach to immigration reform. However, here we \nare more than 1 year later, and House Republicans are still unwilling \nto even hold an up-or-down vote on the Senate's proposal. Each day the \nHouse fails to act on serious solutions to our broken immigration \nsystem is another day our Nation and our economy suffer.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reported that last year's bipartisan \nimmigration reform bill that passed this body would reduce the budget \ndeficit by $197 billion--billion with a ``b''--over the next decade and \nabout $700 billion in the second decade. In a companion analysis, CBO \nalso estimated\n\n[[Page S5104]]\n\nthat fixing our broken immigration system would increase our country's \nGDP--our economic output--by 3.3 percent in 10 years and 5.4 percent \nafter 20 years.\n  The evidence is clear. Immigration reform is good for our economy, \ngood for our workforce, and it is good for the future of the American \nmiddle class.\n  I am familiar with the promise America represents to its families. My \nfather fled from Nazi Germany in the 1930s as a young boy. As the son \nof an immigrant, I know how hard immigrants work and how much they \nbelieve in this country and how much they are willing to give back to \nour Nation. Those of us who represent border communities understand the \ndifficult challenges we face, but there are solutions before us that \nare pragmatic, bipartisan, and that uphold rather than compromise our \nAmerican values.\n\n  In the short term we must approve the Senate's emergency supplemental \nbill, and in the long-term we should partner with Honduras, Guatemala, \nand El Salvador to stabilize their nations and end the cycle of gang \nviolence we see there. A key part of our long-term solution is for \nHouse Republicans to finally put the Senate's immigration reform bill \non the floor for an up-or-down vote.\n  We in Congress have a historic opportunity to pass comprehensive \nimmigration reform and to address root causes rather than just symptoms \nfor a change. I believe we will have failed if the only immigration \nlegislation we pass as a body in this Congress is to weaken legal \nprotections for refugee children. With this in mind, I will continue to \nwork with my colleagues to ensure that we address this humanitarian \ncrisis and fix our immigration system once and for all. Let's seize \nthis opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I see that I have been joined on the floor by the \nSenator from Florida, and I would ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with Senator Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his leadership, \nand I wish to ask my colleague if he is aware of the testimony the \ncommanding general of U.S. Southern Command, General Kelly--a marine \nfour-star general--gave to the Armed Services Committee and to the \nForeign Relations Committee recently, in the last couple of weeks?\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I am aware of the testimony of General \nKelly, but given his role at SOUTHCOM and in particular its location in \nFlorida and the fact that the Senator from Florida was there for the \ntestimony, I would ask him to remind us exactly what General Kelly had \nto say about how we are or in some cases are not interdicting and \ndealing with the flow of narcotics and particularly cocaine that has \nbeen at the root of so much of the instability and violence we see in \nthese three Central American countries today.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico has put his \nfinger on exactly the root cause of the problem. It is the substantial \nloads of cocaine that are coming into these three Central American \ncountries; that because of the violence, because of the killing, the \nparents have three choices when their child gets on up toward their \nteenage years. Their first choice is to let their kid join the gang.\n  These gangs are criminal gangs, and they are tied in with the drug \nlords. The drug lords have taken over the country because of all the \nmoney that is being made from these big shipments that come in.\n  The parents have three choices: No. 1, let their kid join the gang; \nNo. 2, go to their child's funeral; or No. 3, they become subject to \nthe subtle and direct plea by the coyotes: Oh, for $1,500, $5,000, we \ncan get your kid to the border and your child will be safe in America.\n  Why those three countries? Why are the children who have been showing \nup in the last several months at the border not coming from Belize, \nNicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama? They are coming from three countries--El \nSalvador, Guatemala, and Honduras--because that is where the big \nshipments of drugs are coming from--from South America into those areas \nin a boat with 1 to 3 tons of cocaine. Once they get on land, they \nbreak them down into small packages, and they go through a very \nefficient distribution system that is drugs and criminal elements--they \ncan distribute just about anything they want, including trafficking in \nhumans. And they are going north.\n  So if Honduras is the murder capital of the world and if El Salvador \nand Guatemala are not far behind, how do you get at that immediately to \nstop the flow of children going north? You more effectively interdict \nthe drug shipments. That is why the United States has been so \nsuccessful.\n  General Kelly, the commanding general of Southern Command, tells us \nthat sadly he has to sit there with his Joint Interagency Task Force--\nall the agencies of the U.S. Government arrayed together and \nheadquartered in Key West--and they have to watch 74 percent of \nprimarily these boats--not so much the flights; primarily boats because \nthey can carry big loads of cocaine--get through.\n  If it gets to the point of voting for the supplemental, I would \ncertainly vote for it, but it doesn't get to the root cause of the \nproblem. What we have done--and I have shared this with as many people \nas I can, consulting with General Kelly. They boiled this down to $122 \nmillion out of the President's request of $3.7 billion, and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has pared that down to $2.7 billion.\n  This Senator is asking for $122 million, and it will cover such \nthings as $31 million for U.S. Government interagency task force \nmaritime patrol craft; $40 million for maritime patrol requirements to \ndeploy U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement detachments; $15 million for \nintelligence surveillance and reconnaissance by putting up contractor-\nowned Predators 24 hours a day, 5 days a week. That contract is being \ndrawn up. If we did this, General Kelly could execute that contract \nimmediately, and then you would start to see some results.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. If I understand the Senator from Florida correctly, \nGeneral Kelly simply does not have the resources to do the job we have \ndone historically in terms of interdicting cocaine moving north for the \nmarket that, frankly, is in North America--\n  Mr. NELSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. --in the United States and Canada. They have to \nliterally sit there and watch these narcotics go by without having the \nresources to stop them in their tracks.\n  Mr. NELSON. The Senator is correct. Whereas General Kelly--and I am \njust using him as the symbol since he is a four-star general. It is the \nJoint Interagency Task Force in Key West that is actually headed by a \nCoast Guard admiral. They can interdict, and do interdict, about 25 \npercent of those big shipments coming from South America. They go \nthrough the Caribbean on the east and also through the Pacific on the \nwest. And because they have been effective at 25 percent of the \nshipments, what we are seeing is a shifting of those shipments. They \nare now actually sending more of them to the east--not only to the \nDominican Republic and Haiti, but now to Puerto Rico, which is a U.S. \nterritory. When they get those drugs into Puerto Rico--and that is \nAmerican territory--they can ship them by mail from there to the rest \nof the United States and avoid detection.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. My understanding is that the resource situation in \nSouthern Command has changed so dramatically in recent years that not \nonly is this interagency task force limited, but they have literally \ncanceled more than 200 engagement activities and multilateral exercises \nwith our partners in the region who can multiply that effect and \ninterdict even more narcotics as they are moving forward.\n  Mr. NELSON. The Senator is correct. As a matter of fact, the staff of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, with whom I have consulted, is \nvery familiar with the great operation of the Joint Interagency Task \nForce to go after these drugs. As the Senator from New Mexico said, you \ncan imagine their frustration when they know about the boat shipment, \nand sometimes they can watch it from their overhead assets, and they \ncan't do anything about it.\n  As a result, look at what has happened over the last several months. \nWe are trying to solve the problem on the border. We have all of these \nchildren\n\n[[Page S5105]]\n\nshowing up at the border. We ought to solve that problem. We need to go \nback to the very beginning and stop what is causing this problem.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. The Senator from Florida also brought up another issue \nthat I think is worth exploring. It is my understanding that he was \nrecently briefed on the relationship that exists between these drug \ncartels and the entities that are actually engaging in human \ntrafficking and moving people, for a fee, through Central America and \nMexico and to the U.S. border. Can the Senator tell us a little bit \nabout the nature of that relationship?\n  Mr. NELSON. The Senator is correct on how all of these things are \ninterlocked. You can imagine how a sufficient quantity of drugs, which \nis worth so much, is a corrupting influence on any kind of law and \norder. As a result, the systems of governments--and Senator Kaine and I \nboth met with the President of Honduras. He is trying as hard as he \ncan. He has a bounty on his head by these drug lords because he is \nopposing them. The judicial system is corrupted. The local police are \ncorrupted. When that happens, then you can imagine when other criminal \nactivities occur, in addition to other drug activities, such as human \ntrafficking, and terrorists potentially being utilized in these \nefficient delivery networks, then it is all the more a threat to the \nnational security interests of the United States.\n  I think the U.S. Congress and the U.S. administration better wake up \nto the fact of what is happening right under our nose and get at this, \nin addition to solving the problems that we see that are a symptom, \nultimately, of the root cause--the creation of a whole criminal network \nthat is, in large part, fueled by the drug trade.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. If the Senator from Florida will yield for a minute, \nthe sad thing is it didn't used to be that way in this part of Central \nAmerica, and I know that for a fact because my wife and I traveled \nthere 15, 16 years ago. We traveled extensively in Honduras, and at \nthat time these gangs simply did not have the influence. They did not \nhave this level of destabilization and they did not have this murder \nrate.\n  I always joke about trying to drive into Tegucigalpa, and I would not \nrecommend it to anybody who has not had time to acclimate to the speed \nand crush of cars in that capital city, but it was a completely \ndifferent country at the time. We traveled extensively in urban areas \nin San Pedro Sula and rural areas such as Santa Rosa de Copan, and it \nwas an economically challenged country.\n  For those folks who have claimed that all of these immigrants are \nsimply heading north out of economic desperation, the economic \nsituation has not changed all that much. It is worth looking at the \nrest of Central America. The surrounding countries, such as Belize and \nCosta Rica and other countries in Central America, are also seeing \nrefugees from these countries.\n  Nicaragua, which has substantial economic challenges right now, is \nlosing economic immigrants, and those immigrants are not making it to \nour southern border in any substantial numbers. In fact, less than a \nyear ago, I was in Costa Rica and many Nicaraguans are working in Costa \nRica because the economy is better there. Yet we don't see them showing \nup--especially the unaccompanied minors, 7, 8, 12-year-olds--at our \nborder by themselves. They are not being driven out by the extreme \nviolence we have seen in these three nations where the drug cartels \nhave such a disproportionate influence on their country's stability.\n\n  Mr. NELSON. If the Senator will yield, to underscore his point, we \ncan look at the extraordinary success of Plan Colombia. Outside of \nCentral America--if you go a little further south, you are on the \ncontinent of South America. And lo and behold, 15, 20 years ago, a \nlarge part of Colombia was controlled by elements that were controlled \nby the drug lords. With the assistance of the United States and \nextraordinary heroism on the part of the Government of Colombia, we \nhave seen the Government of Colombia take back control of most of its \ncountry. Even though cocaine is still grown there and the FARC is still \noperating, their criminal element is a diminished insurrection of what \nit used to be. If you visited a place like Bogota, the capital city, it \nwas not safe to go out alone and walk on the streets. Now you can \neasily walk on the streets. The situation there has changed.\n  We are seeing the same replicated now in Central America where the \ndrug lords have basically taken over by buying off people with \nconsiderable money, and therefore it makes it very difficult to have \nthe rule of law in those struggling governments, as it is for the \nPresident of Honduras, who is trying so hard to bring back his country.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. If the Senator from Florida will yield for a moment, \nhaving formerly served on the House Armed Services Committee, I know \nthe Department of Defense budget is somewhere in the order of $550 \nbillion. Surely SOUTHCOM must have a substantial amount of resources to \nbe able to meet this, right?\n  Of that $550 billion, does the Senator from Florida know how much \nactually goes to Southern Command?\n  Mr. NELSON. What this Senator knows is that before the sequester \nstarted hitting the defense budget--even though we were conducting a \nwar in two countries, Afghanistan and Iraq--with all of the \nmultiplicity of threats that are around in the region, including what \nwe see now with ISIS between Syria and northern and western Iraq, the \nDepartment of Defense had to make some hard choices. They had to cut \nback because of this mindless budgetary meat ax called the sequester, \nand as a result they had to set their priorities.\n  When they came down to it, they had to support the troops out in the \nfield and had to cut back on other commands. The U.S. Southern Command \nis one of those commands that was cut back. But now we are seeing the \nlack of wisdom to these budgetary policies--sequester--and the scarcity \nwhen you cannot allocate the defense resources to other agencies. \nRemember, this is a Joint Interagency Task Force. We are now seeing the \neffects of that in what has been on the front pages of the newspapers \nwhich is reporting all of the children coming to the border.\n  By the way, the children are just a diminutive percentage of the \ntotal people still coming to the border. I can't remember if it is 20 \npercent or 40 percent, but it is something well less than half of all \nof the people who are still coming to the border. But, of course, the \nchildren, because of the humanitarian crisis for them, are the ones who \nhave received the attention.\n  If we know there is a problem, how do we fix the problem? Well, we \nneed to go back to the root cause, and that is the case I have been \nmaking on that side of the aisle and on this side of the aisle. Yet we \nare at this point of impasse, and needless to say, it is very \nfrustrating to this Senator.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I thank the Senator from Florida for continuing to be \nan advocate for this cause. I know that Southern Command's annual \nbudget now is about $1 billion--literally $1 billion out of $550 \nbillion in the Department of Defense. Given the necessity of engaging \nwith Central and South America on these issues, I think it is time to \nreevaluate, in terms of resources but also in terms of priorities, how \nwe look at Central and South America, to reengage with our neighbors \nand try to address some of these issues at the root level instead of \nalways at the symptom level.\n\n  I see we have been joined by our esteemed chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Mikulski of Maryland. So I thank the Chair for \nallowing the Senator from Florida and I to indulge in this colloquy. \nAnd, once again, I wish to say how much I hope we take this opportunity \nto do something, not just about the symptoms of the current crisis \nwhich has to be dealt with, but also the underlying causes of this \ncrisis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I think we have just heard something \nreally interesting and I think--excuse me. The way the Senator from New \nMexico concluded--was the Senator from California scheduled to speak \nnext?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe so.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thought I was at 4:52. I didn't mean to jump the \nline. I really do want to hear from the Senator from California, the \nchair of the intelligence committee, as well as the chair of the \nSubcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and Border Security of the \nJudiciary Committee. She is a Senator with a lot of experience, and I \nlook forward to her remarks.\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I wish to begin by saying the \nAppropriations Committee is in very good hands. Chairman Mikulski has \ndone an excellent job, and I strongly support this supplemental that \nshe has put together.\n  I wish to give my colleagues just some brief background of my \ninvolvement in the unaccompanied alien children issue. It began around \n1999. On Thanksgiving Day, a 5-year-old in an inner tube off the coast \nof Florida, 3 miles out, was picked up by a fisherman. His name was \nElian Gonzalez. The fisherman rescued him and he was taken to a \nhospital, but his mother and 11 others on the raft had drowned in their \nattempt to come to the United States from Cuba. That launched in this \ncountry a major debate about an unaccompanied alien child, whether he \ngoes back to his father or whether he remains with his uncle in Miami.\n  Then, secondly, I am home one day and I turn on the television set, \nand I see a 15-year-old Chinese girl who had been placed on a container \nship from China by her parents to flee China's rigid family planning \nlaws. She came to this country. She was alone. She was desperate. She \nwas picked up.\n  I saw her asylum hearing. She was unrepresented. She was shackled, \nher wrists were bound, and big tears were rolling down her face. She \ncouldn't understand a single word that was spoken. She was held in a \njail cell for eight months and in another detention facility for \nanother four months after that. She eventually received asylum in our \ncountry, but she unnecessarily faced an ordeal no child should undergo.\n  At the time, she was only one of 5,000 other foreign-born children \nwho were apprehended in the United States in need of protection. I \nremember thinking that that such treatment was terrible, and I had to \ndo something.\n  In 2000, I introduced the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act. I \nalso pushed for the change in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which \nsuccessfully transferred the responsibility for the care of \nunaccompanied alien children from the former Immigration and \nNaturalization Service to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  However, that change by itself was not enough to ensure that \nunaccompanied children were properly treated. Therefore, over the next \n6 years, I continued to consult with relevant Federal agencies, \nchildren's advocates, immigration attorneys, House Members such as Zoe \nLofgren on the House Judiciary Committee, and fellow Senators.\n\n  Finally, in 2008 the legislation was included, amazingly enough, by \nvoice vote in both Houses, as part of a larger trafficking bill, the \nWilliam Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. \nIt was signed into law by President Bush on December 23, 2008. It took \neffect 6 months later. That year, the number of children was in the \nvicinity of 8,000. It provided the framework for how unaccompanied \nchildren would be treated while in the United States and for their safe \nand orderly return to their home countries without undue delay if they \ndid not qualify to stay.\n  We now have a dramatically escalated situation that was not \nforeseeable at that time. Last fiscal year 2013, 24,000 unaccompanied \nchildren arrived in our country. This year more than 62,000 \nunaccompanied children have arrived in our country, and the Department \nof Homeland Security is preparing for as many as 90,000 such children \nto arrive in the country by the end of this year.\n  The numbers are so great and so unprecedented that our Federal \nagencies understandably are having difficulty carrying out the \nprocedures and timelines in place. I have sent members of my staff in \nCalifornia to every Office and Refugee Services shelter in the State, \nand they have sent me photos and their impressions. I wish to take a \nmoment to thank all our people, whether it is Border Patrol or ICE of \nHomeland Security or anybody else--such as Health and Human Services--\nfor the excellent job they are doing. I saw 8 to 10 facilities through \npictures and reports, where children were in bright rooms, had beds \nwith covers, and a day program. So, every effort has been made.\n  But the numbers are so great and unprecedented that the difficulties \ncontinue. When we run out of money, there is going to be a different \nstory.\n  But we must remember that the children at issue, who are \nunaccompanied, are primarily from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, \nthree Central American countries which are deeply troubled. Many have \nentered as victims, I am sorry to say, of rape, abuse, poverty, and \nabove all, violence.\n  They are alone, subject to abuse and exploitation. Many are young and \nunable to articulate their fears, their views, or testify about their \nneeds as accurately as adults can. Considering this, there is no other \noption but for us to help and continue to treat them humanely, with \ncompassion and due process. That is what this supplemental does.\n  I have met with Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, and the \nhead of the Department of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Burwell, \nand both tell us their agencies run out of funds by September. We must \nresponsibly fund these agencies, for not only are they managing the \ncurrent humanitarian crisis at our border, but they are also charged \nwith protecting human life and our homeland security.\n  With this funding, not only can we preserve our commitment to treat \nchildren as the children that they are, we can improve the way that the \ncurrent law is being administered and more efficiently put our \nresources to work.\n  Earlier today, I met with immigration judges from the U.S. Department \nof Justice's Executive Office of Immigration Review. They informed me \nthey are desperate for increased resources with which to handle not \nonly the influx of children's cases but also a current backlog of \n375,000 cases. Due to there being only 243 immigration judges across \nthe country, immigrants today wait 587 average days for a hearing. That \nis one year and 7 months before they have the opportunity to come \nbefore an immigration judge.\n  With adequate funding from this supplemental, which provides for \nimmigration judge teams, legal representation and services, government \nimmigration litigation attorneys and courtroom equipment, among other \nthings, this crisis can be managed and make the processing of children \nmore efficient.\n  One of the judges who sits in Miami told me that through her court \nwhere a child has representation, a voluntary return to the country of \norigin was able to be achieved in a majority of her cases. So the \nmajority of children actually took voluntary departure and returned to \ntheir countries. A judge can't make a phone call, but a counsel can--\nthe attorneys could make the calls to do the necessary preparation and \nsee that a safe home could be arranged. Because of this representation, \ncases are processed more quickly and children could safely return.\n  I understand there has been concern that unaccompanied children will \nnot appear for their immigration court proceedings. That is simply not \ntrue. The fact is, whether represented or not, 60.9 percent do appear, \nand the number increases to 92.5 percent when represented by counsel. \nSo these children do get before a judge--60.9 percent of them, and if \nthey have a lawyer, 92 percent.\n\n  With this supplemental funding, the immigration courts, with help \nfrom legal representatives, would be able to hear more quickly \nimmigration cases and determine with justice who may stay and who must \ngo.\n  I was contacted recently by Winston Lord, a former U.S. Ambassador \nand Assistant Secretary of State, who is all too familiar with managing \nsituations of international crises while preserving our national \ninterest. In reflecting on the current crisis, he acknowledged the need \nfor effective border control and immigration enforcement to ensure \nnational security and a comprehensive solution. However, he also \nidentified the heart of the matter here: ``These challenges . . . need \nnot be met by using ineffective and indiscriminate approaches that harm \ninnocent children.''\n  He is right.\n  We are a great Nation, capable of safeguarding our national security \nwhile simultaneously proceeding with humanity in addressing this \ncrisis, and any future challenges that this country faces. This problem \ndemands action now to provide these agencies with the funds they need \nto meet this crisis.\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\n  Now, if we don't pass this, and if these departments run out of \nmoney, and if facilities have to be closed, and if there is nowhere for \nthese children to go, let us think for a moment what happens to them. \nShould they experience the same thing in this country they have back \nhome? What will they do? And what does that do to our conscience?\n  I think this supplemental is well put together. The chairman of our \ncommittee has gone through it with a fine tooth comb. She has reduced \nit in size. I think it is well representative of the situation that \ndramatically needs funding. So I really hope there is a heart in this \nbody and that this supplemental appropriation is approved.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, to the Senator from California, I thank \nher for her excellent statement. She brings such experience and \nexpertise. It is very much appreciated. Has the Senator looked at my \nsupplemental recommendations where we have actually added money for \njudges and then support to pro bono lawyers willing to represent \nchildren?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Well, that is exactly right. The chairwoman's \nsupplemental does that. That is really what makes the difference for \nthe child. If a child can't speak the language and if a child is held \nin a jail cell and if a child is shackled and handcuffed before a \njudge, and a child has nobody to help them and no one they know in this \ncountry, what can they do except cry? That is what I saw directly \nmyself, and that is what sort of awakened me then to a problem, which \nwas just 5,000 a year in the start of this. Now we are at 54,000, and \nprobably 90,000 before the end of the year.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is right.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So I thank the Senator for her support and her energy \nand effort that she has put forward.\n  I hope this body does the right thing.\n\n\n                    Remembering Admiral Chuck Larson\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to continue the discussion \non the urgent supplemental. But before I do, I want to say that the \nsenior Senator from Arizona is on the floor, and I want to say \nsomething heartwarming to my colleague. I say to the Senator from \nArizona, you are a graduate of the Naval Academy, class of 1958. We \nboth have a very dear friend who has passed away, ADM Chuck Larson.\n  Admiral Larson served with distinction in the Navy. He did many tours \nof duty in the defense of our country but also did two tours of duty at \nthe U.S. Naval Academy, where I came to know him, and then subsequent \nto that there was the wonderful role that he played in education and \ntransformational leadership.\n  I know he was a good friend of the Senator from Arizona too. So I \nwould like to express my condolences to you and to the--of course, then \nit was guys only at the Naval Academy--class of 1958. I was the class \nof 1958 at Mount Saint Agnes College. We probably saw each other at a \ntea dance or two. I was the chunky one over there, not in the corner, \nthough. But I just wanted to express my condolences. What a great class \nthat seems to be. I hope we can work together on something that would \ntruly recognize Chuck Larson and the great transformational leader he \nwas.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a colloquy \nwith the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say first of all to the Senator from Maryland, on \nbehalf of all Naval Academy graduates and all of us who love the Naval \nAcademy, your support of the Naval Academy has been consistent, \nunswerving. You have been probably the staunchest supporter of the U.S. \nNaval Academy I have ever had the privilege of encountering. I want to \nalso tell the Senator that the devotion she has extended to the Naval \nAcademy is reciprocated by the Naval Academy and its graduates to her. \nI thank her for that.\n  Yes, Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Maryland, a dear and \nbeloved friend, ADM Chuck Larson passed away. I would be honored to \njoin with her in any way that we could to honor his memory. I would \njust like to point out that the Senator from Maryland was heavily \ninvolved when there was a very serious cheating scandal at the Naval \nAcademy. Senator Mikulski led the investigation and demand for \ncorrecting that situation, and Admiral Larson was called back from \nretirement to be the Superintendent of the Naval Academy, on the \nrecommendation of the Senator from Maryland--the only naval officer in \nhistory who served as Superintendent twice. And he put the Naval \nAcademy back on the right track.\n  I would like to say, again, that he mentioned to me often the \nconsistent support for reform, for the institution, and they are \nincredibly proud of her representation not just of the people of \nMaryland but specifically of that wonderful institution. I know I speak \nfor Chuck Larson when I say that.\n  I thank you.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator very much. I love our U.S. Naval \nAcademy. But when you have great leaders, we want to in some way be \nable to memorialize them in a way that they inspired this ongoing, this \nnext generation, and the generations to come about really what a great \nleader is and what value-driven leadership is all about.\n  So I look forward to working with the Senator from the Naval Academy \nand the State of Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to continue the discussion on the \nurgent supplemental and the crisis--many people call it the crisis--at \nour border. Well, we have a surge of children at our border because of \nthe crisis in Central America. The crisis is in Central America, \ncreating a surge of children desperately coming across our borders to \nseek political asylum.\n  I would hope that when we look at this urgent supplemental, we \nunderstand what we are trying to do. Yes, provide humane care for the \nchildren, real support for judges and other legal assistance to \ndetermine their legal and asylum status and, at the same time, to do \nthe prevention in Central America, by going after what the surge is all \nabout. The surge is about the escalating narco criminal-driven violence \nin these countries.\n  People will say: Well, what does that mean? It means that when you \nlook at where the children are coming from, they are not coming from \nevery country in Central America. They are coming from three countries \nin Central America. They are coming from Honduras, Guatemala, and El \nSalvador, but they are not coming from Nicaragua and they are not \ncoming from Panama and they are not coming from Costa Rica. Why is \nthat? The reason is because the violence rate is not as high. Yes, in \nthese countries, particularly in Nicaragua, the poverty rate is the \nsame as the other three. So why are they coming? They are coming \nbecause of the violence, and this is what we need to be able to deal \nwith.\n\n  Last week, along with many Senators, I met with the Ambassadors from \nthe three countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. At the \ninvitation of Senator Menendez, the chair of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I met with the President of Honduras, the President of \nGuatemala, and the President of El Salvador to talk about these issues, \nto say: What is it that we need to do to deal with these issues?\n  This is what they talked about. They talked about the violence coming \nfrom the drug cartels and organized crime--organized crime--drug \ncartels fueled by America's insatiable demand for drugs. They have \nworsened in these three countries.\n  Then there is the recruitment. The narco criminals have gone after \nthe children to recruit them, either for their profit or for their \npleasure. I have to talk about this in a way that civilized people \nshould not have to hear that this is going on against children in our \nown hemisphere. This is our own hemisphere. When I talk about the \nrecruitment of children for profit or for pleasure, that is exactly \nwhat they are talking about--to recruit the children to be part of \ngangs, violent gangs, gangs to engage in narco trafficking, to engage \nin extortion, to engage in murder, to engage in intimidation. This is \nthe particular targeting of boys--the particular targeting of boys to \nrecruit them for the gangs. And if the boys do not want to join the \ngang and they resist, they hide, they try to run away,\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\nthey are often grabbed, many sometimes are kidnapped, threatened with \ntorture or their mother or their grandmother or their sister is \nthreatened with either death or violent sexual attack. All sexual \nattack is violent, but they talk about it in ways that I will not \ndiscuss on the Senate floor.\n  Then there is the recruitment for profit--yes, to make sure that \nmaybe they are couriers for the drug trade, but also to recruit, nab or \nforce young children to be involved in human trafficking and sexual \nslavery.\n  But we have to deal with this. We have to stop the violence with a \ntough battle. We have to go after the cartels, and we have to also \nreally begin to deal seriously with our addiction to cocaine and to \nheroin.\n  When you talk to the President of Honduras about the drugs in his own \ncountry bound for the United States, he talks about how they smuggle \ndrugs, and they smuggle children along the same trade routes. It is \ngood trade to traffic in drugs and it is also good trade to traffic in \nwomen and children. You see, to the drug dealers, to the narco \ntraffickers, to the seven organized crime units--and, yes, we know who \nthey are and where they are; we just need to marshal the resources of \nour country and the hemisphere to go after them. We know who they are, \nwhere they are, what they do, and how they do it. They look at women \nand children, boys, as well as girls, as commodities to be sold across \ncountries and across borders. My God. And we want to blame the \nchildren?\n  We hear: Let's send them back. Send them back to what? This is why \nthese children are on the go. This is why these children are on the \nmarch. And the children do not care how they get here, as long as they \nescape the violence.\n  This is why we have included money of over $112 million to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for enforcement--no, not National Guard \nat our border, but really moving assets to Central America to deal with \nlaw enforcement, to strengthen the courts, and to be able to deal with \nthe issues of narco trafficking and organized crime in their own \ncountry.\n  We also know that while we are doing this type of intervention down \nthere to go after the smugglers, coyotes, and human traffickers, we \nalso need to deal with the fact that when these children are here, they \nhave the right to seek legal asylum. Now, as Senator Feinstein pointed \nout, there are only 240 immigration judges in the country. The fact is \nthere is a backlog of over 100,000 cases. These kids move to the front \nof the line, but even if they move to the front of the line, it could \nbe as much as 2 or 3 years before their cases are heard. This is not \nright. It is not right for them and it is not right for our country.\n  So I have more money in this bill for more immigration judges to \nresolve the asylum cases, additional legal representation for the \nchildren, including bilingual representation, and the kind of backup \nand support where pro bono lawyers are coming to the aid to be able to \ndo this.\n  I hope we pass this supplemental so we can do this.\n  Second, I made the trip to the border. I will talk about this on \nanother day. I know my time is exceeded, but what I wanted to emphasize \ntoday is why these children are coming, the legal services we need to \npresent here, and I look forward to talking more about this. I know my \ntime is up, and I do want to be courteous to my colleague from the \nother side of the aisle.\n  So let's pass this bill. Let's do the interdiction in Central \nAmerica. And let's enforce our laws here and provide the legal \nrepresentation the law requires.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business for as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, quite often--on numerous occasions--I have \ncome to the floor of the Senate to talk about the ongoing tragedy of \nSyria, not in the belief that any action may be taken of any real \nimpact, although it has always been my hope and prayer, but because my \nconscience dictates that I come to the floor of the Senate and discuss \none of the great and unfortunate and shameful chapters in our history.\n  Last February I came to the floor to appeal to the conscience of my \ncolleagues and fellow citizens about the mass atrocities that the Assad \nregime is perpetuating in Syria. I brought with me at that time a \nseries of gruesome images that documented the horrors the Assad regime \nhas committed against political prisoners in its jails across that \ncountry. Those images were smuggled out of the country by Caesar--\nCaesar--a Syrian military policeman who risked his life and the lives \nof his family and friends to show the world the real face of human \nsuffering in Syria today.\n  At the time I had hoped that those images would cry out to our \nnational conscience and compel our great Nation to help end the \nsuffering and genocide of the Syrian people. How could anyone--how \ncould anyone--look at those pictures and not press for immediate \naccountability and an end to those mass atrocities?\n  In the months since those images were first made public, United \nStates and European investigators have pored over the images and \nconcluded that not only are these images genuine but they are evidence \nof an industrial-scale campaign by the Assad regime against its \npolitical opponents. According to the State Department, these \nphotographs are evidence of systematic atrocities not seen since \nHitler's Nazi regime exterminated millions during World War II.\n  Stephen Rapp, the State Department's Ambassador-at-Large for War \nCrimes, stated that:\n\n       This is solid evidence of the kind of machinery of cruel \n     death that we haven't seen frankly since the Nazis. It's \n     shocking to me.\n\n  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, after a \nbriefing to the U.N. Security Council members, stated, ``The gruesome \nimages of corpses bearing marks of starvation, strangulation and \nbeatings and today's chilling briefing indicate that the Assad regime \nhas carried out systematic, widespread and industrial killing.''\n  Despite the statements from these and other senior officials, the \nadministration has yet to finish its investigation. Perhaps when the \nadministration does complete its forensic analysis of the evidence \nprovided by Caesar, President Obama will decide it is finally time to \ntake action in Syria and prevent the continuation of mass atrocities \nthat according to his Presidential Study Directive on Mass Atrocities \nis ``a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility \nof the United States.''\n  I have to tell my colleagues I am not hopeful. In the time that the \ninvestigation to prove what we all know to be true has been underway, \napproximately 40,000 more people have died, another 1 million people \nhave been forced from their homes, and over half of Syria's population \nis now believed to be in dire need of food, water, and medicine.\n  The Assad regime continues to bomb northern Syria, using crude \ncluster munitions known as barrel bombs with the sole purpose of \nterrorizing and killing as many people as possible when \nindiscriminately dropped from Syrian Government aircraft on schools, \nfactories, and mosques. It continues to raze entire neighborhoods for \nno military purpose whatsoever, simply as a form of collective \npunishment of Syrian civilians.\n  It continues its ``surrender or starve'' famine campaign, starving \npeople to death by denying entire neighborhoods any access to food or \nwater. Just last month the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical \nWeapons, which has been tasked with destroying Syria's chemical \nstockpiles, announced there is credible evidence that toxic chemicals \nare still being used in a systematic manner in Syria.\n  Indeed, this kind of inhumane cruelty is a pattern of behavior for \nthe Syrian government. As early as August 2011, a damning 22-page \nreport was issued by the United Nations human rights office, which \nconcluded that Syrian Government forces had committed crimes against \nhumanity by carrying out summary executions, torturing prisoners and \nharming children, the evidence of which we now see clearly in those \nimages.\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\n  The report prompted President Obama to issue a statement calling for \nPresident Assad to step down. The President declared:\n\n       We have consistently said that President Assad must lead a \n     Democratic transition or get out of the way. He has not led. \n     For the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for \n     President Assad to step aside.\n\n  That was 2 years ago. The President ended this statement by saying, \n``It is clear that President Assad believes that he can silence the \nvoices of his people by resorting to the repressive tactics of the \npast, but he is wrong.''\n  Following the President's statement, there was no shortage of \nadministration officials publicly professing that President Assad's \ndays were numbered. In December 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton told a NATO gathering that Assad's fall was ``inevitable.'' She \nlater repeated, ``It is time for Assad to get out of the way.'' That \nwas from our then-Secretary of State.\n  That same month White House spokesman Jay Carney echoed Clinton's \nproclamation stating:\n\n       Assad's fall is inevitable. As governments make decisions \n     about where they stand on this issue and what steps need to \n     be taken with regards to brutality of Assad's regime, it is \n     important to calculate into your consideration the fact that \n     he will go.\n\n  He went on to say, ``The regime has lost control of the country and \nhe will eventually fall.'' In May 2012, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey told FOX News that ``escalating \natrocities would likely trigger a military intervention following a \nmassacre that left more than 100 dead.''\n  One hundred dead--that was back when we were talking about Syria's \ndead in hundreds rather than thousands and tens of thousands. One month \nlater, in June 2012, then-Secretary of Defense Panetta stated:\n\n       I think it's important when Assad leaves--and he will \n     leave--to try to preserve stability in that country . . . I'm \n     sure that deep down Assad knows he's in trouble, and it's \n     just a matter of time before he has to go. I would say, if \n     you [Assad] want to be able to protect yourself and your \n     family, you better get the hell out now.\n\n  That was in June of 2012 by our Secretary of Defense.\n  Where are we now? Three years after President Obama and his \nadministration rightly decided it was time for him to go, President \nAssad remains in power, and I know of no one who believes Bashar Assad \nis going to negotiate his departure. In fact, he just orchestrated \nanother ``reelection.'' I remember when an American President said that \na foreign leader must go, it conveyed a commitment to doing something \nabout it. But instead of taking decisive action in support of the \nPresident's declared policy, the administration has simply moved away \nfrom calls for Assad to step down over the past year.\n  In fact, instead of being forced to step down, Assad has continuously \ngotten the administration to treat his regime as a central \ninterlocutor, first with the chemical weapons agreement through which \nAssad forced the United States into acknowledging its legitimacy and \nensuring that he would remain in place until the agreement was carried \nout, then by serving as the sole authority on distribution of aid \nwithin the country, and now by presenting himself as critical to the \nfight against terrorism and the Al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of \nIraq and Syria.\n  So as it turns out, President Obama was right that Assad's violence \nand repressive tactics could not silence the voices of the Syrian \npeople who even in the worst imaginable conditions have continued to \nfight for freedom and a Democratic Syria. Instead, it has been the \nvoice of President Obama and other administration officials that \nPresident Assad has managed to silence. We cannot be silent, but we \ncannot allow words to replace action either.\n  What has become exceedingly clear in the wake of recent events is \nthat even if we can ignore the moral imperative to act, the growing \nthreat to American national security interests means that doing nothing \nis now out of the question. The conflict in Syria is largely to blame \nfor the resurgence of Al Qaeda in Iraq, which has grown into the even \nmore dangerous and lethal Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, commonly \nreferred to by the acronym ISIS or ISIL.\n  Top officials testified in last week's Foreign Relations Committee \nhearing that ISIS represents a threat that is ``worse than Al-Qaeda.''\n  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Iraq and Iran Brett McGurk \nstated that ISIS is no longer simply a terrorist organization but ``a \nfull blown army seeking to establish a self-governing state through the \nTigris and Euphrates Valley in what is now Syria and Iraq.''\n  The Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the FBI, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General have all \nwarned repeatedly about the threat posed by ISIS's state-like sanctuary \nin Syria and Iraq and the largest safe haven for global terrorism in \nthe world.\n  If the September 11 attack should have taught us anything, it is that \nglobal terrorists who occupy ungoverned spaces and seek to plot and \nplan attacks against us can pose a direct threat to our national \nsecurity. That was Afghanistan on September 10, 2001. That is what \nthese top officials are now warning us that Syria is becoming today.\n  Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said, ``Syria is now a \nmatter of homeland security.'' FBI Director James Comey recently warned \nCongress that the terrorist threat from Syria against the United States \nis ``metastasizing.'' Their assessments were confirmed earlier this \nmonth by Attorney General Eric Holder, who said that recent \nintelligence reports of terrorists from Syria partnering with Yemeni \nbombmakers are ``more frightening than anything I think I've seen as \nattorney general. It's something that gives us really extreme, extreme \nconcern.''\n  He added:\n\n       If they--\n\n  Meaning ISIS--\n\n     are able to consolidate their gains in that area, Iraq and \n     Syria, I think it's just a matter of time before they start \n     looking outward and start looking at the West and at the \n     United States in particular. So this is something that we \n     have to get on top of and get on top of now.\n\n  It is clear President Assad's strategy is to convince the \nadministration that we only have two options, him or Al Qaeda-linked \nterrorists. It is a sad testament to the administration's leadership on \nSyria that Assad's strategy seems to be working. According to a report \nby the Daily Beast, administration officials are debating whether to \nabandon the President's goal of toppling Assad and enter into a de \nfacto alliance with the Assad regime to fight ISIS or other Sunni \nextremists in the region.\n  Such a decision would represent the height of folly. Nobody--nobody--\nshould believe Assad is an ally in the fight against terrorism. Former \nAmbassador to Syria Robert Ford, who resigned in May after asserting \nthat he could no longer defend American policy in Syria, made it clear \nhow foolish such thinking is. He said:\n\n       The people who think Bashar Assad's regime is the answer to \n     containing and eventually eliminating the Islamic-based \n     threat do not understand the historic relationship between \n     the regime and ISIS. They do not understand the current \n     relationship between Assad and ISIS and how they are working \n     on the ground together directly and indirectly inside Syria.\n\n  He added,\n\n       If this administration wants to contain the Islamic State \n     on the ground, they are going to have to help the Free Syrian \n     Army.\n\n  After more than 3 years of horror and suffering and devastation and \ngrowing threats to our national security, the conflict in Syria \ncontinues to get worse and worse, both for Syria and for the world, but \nthe United States has no effective policy to bring this conflict to a \nresponsible end. The outcome of the administration's disengagement has \nbeen a consistent failure to support more responsible forces in Syria \nwhen that support would have mattered.\n  The descent of Syria into chaos and growing regional instability, the \nuse of Syria as a training ground for Al Qaeda affiliates and other \nterrorist organizations, the ceding of regional leadership to our \nadversaries, and the shameful tolerance of war crimes and crimes \nagainst humanity--in short, all of the horrible things the critics said \nwould happen if we got more involved in Syria--have happened because we \nhave not gotten more involved. Now President Obama finds himself in a \nposition where the United States will have to do far more today to \nstave off disaster in\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\nSyria than we would have needed to do in 2012. The administration seems \nto have finally come around to the idea that we must arm, train, and \nequip the moderate opposition in Syria. But arming moderate FSA units \nis only one element of what must be done for a much broader strategy \nthat includes both Syria and Iraq.\n  I will be the first to admit there are no good options left, if good \noptions ever existed to begin with. But as bad as our options are, we \nstill have options to do something meaningful in Syria.\n  The conflict in Syria is reaching a critical point. Government forces \nare advancing on Aleppo, effectively cutting off routes into and out of \nthe city from the south and west, exercising a stranglehold on the \npeople of Aleppo. More than 6 months of punishing daily air strikes \nhave killed thousands of residents and forced tens of thousands more to \nflee. But at least 500,000 residents remain in Aleppo, and they are \nbeing slowly asphyxiated by Assad's forces as they brace for Aleppo's \nupcoming siege.\n  Meanwhile, disillusioned fighters, starved of the resources and \nequipment they need, have been drifting from the front lines and, in \nsome cases, joining the better funded and equipped extremist groups.\n  It is a moral outrage to watch the destruction of what remains of \nAleppo and refuse to do more to help those fight against our enemies in \nthe region. Worse still, the government's campaign has been aided and \nabetted by ISIS, which is attacking the Free Syrian Army from the \nnortheast in an attempt to take control of two vital supply lines from \nTurkey and forcing the moderate opposition to fight simultaneously on \ntwo fronts.\n  Such activists are suggesting that the fall of Aleppo could be the \nnail in the coffin for the modern opposition, and the situation for \ncivilians still living in Aleppo has become so disastrous that the \nUnited States recently authorized the delivery of cross-border \nhumanitarian aid without prior approval from the Assad regime.\n  These efforts are a bandaid on a bullet wound. It will not be enough \nto mitigate the dire crisis unfolding in the city, and we must offer \nquick support to the moderate opposition as they battle the Assad \nregime and extremists from the Islamic state before it is too late.\n  The rise of ISIS, combined with the events in Gaza and Ukraine, has \nplaced Assad's assault on Aleppo safely outside of the headlines. With \nthe international community distracted by these disturbing events in \nother parts of the word, Assad will again manipulate time and terror in \nhis favor.\n  President Obama, who spent much of his time in recent weeks at \nfundraising events, said nothing about Syria or Iraq during recent \nappearances to discuss Gaza and Ukraine.\n  Worse still, details of the sole initiative proposed by the \nadministration on Syria since the collapse of the Geneva peace talks \nreveals a plan that would train less than a battalion-sized unit of \n2,300 individuals and wouldn't begin until the middle of next year. By \nthat time Aleppo may be lost and there may be no more units left in \nSyria to support.\n  The conflict in Syria is a threat to our national interests, but it \nis more than that. It is an affront to our conscience. Images such as \nthese should not just be a source of heartbreak and sympathy, they \nshould be a call to action. For the sake of our national security we \nmust move quickly to help the moderate opposition now before it is too \nlate. For the sake of our national conscience, we must do more to help \nthe 150,000 political prisoners who remain in Assad's prisons and put \nan end to the suffering of the Syrian people.\n  It is with great sadness that I met with Caesar yesterday and had to \ntell him the truth: that although our great Nation could have done more \nto stop the suffering of others, that we could have used the power we \npossess--limited and imperfect as it may be--to prevent massive \natrocities and the killing of innocents, it is with everlasting shame \nthat we have not.\n  Shame on all of us for our current failure. If there ever was a case \nthat should remind us that our interests are indivisible from our \nvalues, it is Syria, and we cannot afford to go numb to this human \ntragedy.\n  I have seen my fair share of suffering and death in the world, but \nthe images and stories coming out of Syria haunt me most. But it is not \ntoo late. The United States is still the most powerful Nation in the \nworld today, and we have the power and capabilities to act when brutal \ntyrants slaughter their people with impunity. No one should believe \nthat we are without options even now. I pray that we will finally \nrecognize the costs of inaction and take the necessary actions to end \nAssad's mass atrocities and to help the Syrian people write a better \nending to this sad chapter in world affairs.\n  I note the presence of our distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee. I urge my colleagues--among many reasons--to \nsupport him in his effort to bring the National Defense Authorization \nAct before this body. Part of that act also authorizes for the training \nand equipping of the Free Syrian forces.\n  I thank my friend and colleague the Senator from Michigan and the \nchairman of our committee, whose unstinting effort has made this \nNational Defense Authorization Act something that deserves the \nattention, debate, amending, and passage from the Senate.\n  I thank my colleague from Michigan.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my statement on \nthe National Defense Authorization Act following the remarks of Senator \nLevin and Senator Inhofe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. CASEY. I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I inquire of the Senator from Pennsylvania how long he \nintends to speak?\n  Mr. CASEY. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. After the Senator from Pennsylvania concludes, I would ask \nthat the Senator from Oklahoma and I be recognized for 20 minutes, \nevenly divided, to talk about the need to get the Defense authorization \nbill to the floor, and each one of us would control 10 minutes under \nthis unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                              Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I rise to speak about a topic that we don't talk about \nenough, which is what is happening in Afghanistan with regard to women \nand girls.\n  I know the senior Senator from Arizona was speaking about Syria \nbefore I had recognition, and I am grateful to him for the work we have \ndone together. He is working with me and others on the best way forward \nfor us to have a constructive impact on what is happening, working to \nget more dollars and more efforts in the direction of supporting the \nwell-vetted Syrian opposition. I am grateful to him for his compassion \nand his commitment on this issue, and we look forward to working with \nhim going forward.\n  I rise today to talk about an issue that we don't focus on enough \nhere and that is the outlook for Afghan women and the children who have \ngrown up during the past 13 years of war in Afghanistan. Children all \ntoo often are the innocent victims of the conflict.\n  According to a recent report by the U.N. Secretary General to the \nSecurity Council in Afghanistan, child casualties increased by 30 \npercent between 2012 and 2013.\n  While reporting was limited by the security environment, there were \nat least 790 documented incidents in which 545 children were killed and \n1,149 were injured. That is just a snapshot of the horror that so many \nchildren have suffered in Afghanistan. Armed opposition groups such as \nthe Taliban are responsible for a majority of the recorded child \ncasualties.\n  I have spoken on the floor a number of times about the substantial \nimprovements that have been made in Afghanistan, with significant \nUnited States support. Our tax dollars, our people, and our government \nhave helped enormously to get greater numbers of Afghan children, \nespecially girls, into school. Where there were once only a few \neducational opportunities, now more than 8.3 million children are in \nschool, boys and girls. By\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\none assessment, up to 40 percent of those 8.3 million children are \ngirls.\n  The security situation and persistent Taliban aggression in \nAfghanistan continue to threaten this progress. According to the same \nU.N. report, there were at least 73 reported attacks on schools. In \nsome especially horrifying incidents, improvised explosive devices--we \nknow them as IEDs--were planted inside school premises. The American \npeople should be proud of the sacrifices that have already been made by \nour fighting men and women and our diplomats who have served in \nAfghanistan and the progress--which I have just mentioned--that has \nbeen made. As the political transition approaches and we prepare for a \nfull security transition, this issue merits continued focus.\n  In 2013 and 2014, I led a bipartisan effort with Senator Ayotte to \ninclude language in the National Defense Authorization Act that \nhighlights the security issues Afghan women and girls face and promotes \nthe recruitment and retention of women in the Afghan National Security \nForces.\n  I focused on the issue because I believe the future of women and \ngirls is critical, essential, to the stability of Afghanistan going \nforward and consequently our own national security interests in the \nregion. According to the Institute for Inclusive Security: ``There is \nevidence that women in uniform are more likely than their male \ncolleagues to de-escalate tensions and less likely to use excessive \nforce.''\n  Some improvements have been made to recruit and retain women in the \nAfghan National Security Forces. For example, earlier this month, 51 \nwomen graduated from the Afghan National Police Academy. These women \ndefy the Taliban's threats by serving as police officers.\n  During the elections earlier this year, female police officers and \nsearchers helped secure polling stations for women, and their effect \nwas tangible: significant turnout by female voters despite serious \nsecurity threats.\n  Although significant progress has been made in women's rights and \nsecurity, there are still far too many horrific incidents of violence \nagainst women and children.\n  I was particularly disturbed, as I know many women were, by an \narticle that ran in the New York Times on July 19 entitled: \n``Struggling to Keep Afghan Girl Safe After a Mullah is Accused of \nRape.'' That is the name of the article dated July 19.\n  The article describes how a 10-year-old Afghan girl was raped by a \nmullah in a mosque. A local women's shelter took in the young girl \nafter the attack to protect her from her own family, who were planning \nto carry out an honor killing. The activists at the shelter received \ndeath threats in addition to the threats to the girl.\n  Once the young girl recovered, she was returned to her family. \nHowever, as the article concludes: ``Those caring for the girl said she \nhad been terribly homesick and wanted to return to her family, but no \none had the heart to tell her they had been conspiring to kill her.''\n  To say that this story is heartbreaking doesn't begin to translate \nthe horror of what some young girls have to face in Afghanistan and \nother parts of the world as well. Extremists will no doubt continue to \nthreaten women leaders and target innocent children in an effort to \nterrorize the Afghan people during this transition. We should send an \nunequivocal message that the United States continues to stand with \nAfghan women and children and that we see them as an important part of \nbuilding a stable and secure Afghanistan.\n  In an effort to honor the sacrifices of the American people and our \nservice men and women, and to make sure those sacrifices are \nremembered, we have to make sure that we take steps in the Senate. I \nfiled an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, and I am \ngrateful again for the work Senator Ayotte has done with me. We were \njoined most recently by several cosponsors, Senator Shaheen, Senator \nWarner, and Senator Boxer.\n  This amendment will address three main issues:\n  No. 1, continue to prioritize recruitment and retention of women in \nthe Afghan National Security Forces.\n  No. 2. Support police units that are specially trained to work with \nfemale or adolescent victims and increase the number of female security \nofficers specifically trained to address cases of gender-based \nviolence. This would include ensuring Afghan National Police's Family \nResponse Units have the necessary resources and are available to women \nacross Afghanistan.\n  No. 3. Finally, emphasize the need to maintain the female searcher \ncapabilities that were established in the April 2014 Presidential \nelections and for the 2015 parliamentary elections.\n  We must ensure that the gains made by Afghan women in every sector of \nsociety are preserved in a post-2014 Afghanistan. It is in our national \nsecurity interests to help prevent Afghanistan from ever again becoming \na safe haven and training ground for international terrorism.\n  We have seen from the recent events in Iraq what happens after a \nsecurity transition if some groups are marginalized. As we approach \ntransition in Afghanistan, women and young people should not just be \nthe target of Taliban violence; they should be full partners in \nbuilding a stable Afghanistan.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                         Defense Authorization\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, along with \nSenator Inhofe--Senator McCain was here before--to express the hope \nthat the Senate will be able to take up the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 during our September work \nperiod.\n  In June Senator Inhofe and I came here to urge Senators to begin the \nprocess to file amendments to our bill, and many amendments have been \nfiled. We have been working to clear as many amendments as possible in \npreparation for Senate consideration of our bill. The amendment \ndescribed just a few moments ago by the Senator from Pennsylvania is \nthe type of amendment that we believe we can clear and would strengthen \nour bill and strengthen the position of our Nation.\n  When the Defense authorization bill is brought to the floor, our goal \nis first to be in a position to offer a package of cleared amendments. \nOur second goal--probably as important, perhaps more important than our \nfirst--is to see if we can identify specific relevant amendments that \ncould be included in an unanimous consent agreement ready to be debated \nand voted on or, in the alternative, to craft the unanimous consent \nagreement with a limited number of relevant amendments, leaving it to \nthe managers and the leaders to identify which relevant amendments \nwould be brought to a vote.\n  Given the small number of days that are left for legislative action \nin this Congress, we must all--all of us individually and as a body--\npull together if we are going to get our Defense bill completed. In my \njudgment, the course I have outlined will facilitate that conclusion.\n  I know there is a backlog of important nominations the Senate must \nstill address, and these nominations have been taking up much of the \nSenate's time. But we have enacted a national defense authorization act \nevery year for 52 years.\n  The bill this year--S. 2410--was reported out of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee on the 2nd day of June with a strong bipartisan vote \nof 25 to 1. It provides critical authorities, funding, assistance, and \nguidance for our military, for our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies, at a time when they face a wide array of threats around the \nworld.\n  In our national defense authorization bill, we enact authorities and \nprograms that would create important initiatives that would be \nunnecessarily delayed if we do not adopt this bill.\n  If we fail to enact this bill, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines will not receive many important special pays and bonuses. These \ninclude the critical skills retention bonus; enlistment and \nreenlistment bonuses; bonus and special pays for health professions, \nincluding those in critically short wartime specialties; and many other \nbonus and special pays that enable the military services to shape the \nforce as we draw down that force.\n\n[[Page S5112]]\n\n  If we fail to enact this bill, we will not be able to slow the growth \nof military personnel costs and the Department will not be able to use \nthe savings, as planned, to make up for readiness shortfalls that \nundermine our military's ability to respond to emerging national \nsecurity crises. The committee-reported bill includes over $1.8 billion \nin savings in 2015 and over $20 billion in savings over the Future \nYears Defense Program. If this bill doesn't pass, those savings will \nnot be achieved and the readiness and modernization accounts will be \neven further depleted.\n  If we fail to enact this bill, we will risk delaying the \nimplementation of programs to address the mental health of our Armed \nForces by developing a standard method for collecting, reporting, and \nassessing suicide and attempted suicide data for members of the \nNational Guard and Reserves. Our Presiding Officer is very active in \nthat particular area, in trying to address the suicide problems we have \nin our Armed Forces.\n  If we fail to enact this bill, we will delay a much needed \nreorganization of the Department's prisoner of war/missing in action \ncommunity to enable the Department to more effectively accomplish its \nmission of accounting for POWs and MIAs.\n  If we fail to enact this bill, school districts all over the United \nStates that rely on our supplemental impact aid to help them educate \nmilitary children will no longer receive that money.\n  If we fail to enact this bill, we are unlikely to authorize the \nNational Commission on the Future of the Army--a critical step to \nenable the Army to ensure that its forces--including its Active-Duty, \nReserves, and Army National Guard components--are properly structured \nand supported to meet current and future threats.\n\n  If we fail to enact this bill, no new military construction projects \nwill be authorized for fiscal year 2015 and our Armed Forces will too \noften continue to live, train, and work in substandard facilities.\n  Previous years' national defense authorization acts have been \nstrengthened and enhanced through a debate on the Senate floor, and \nthat includes the opportunity for Members to offer amendments. Debating \nand enacting those authorizations are critical not only to our national \nsecurity but to ensure that our Nation keeps its sacred vow to provide \nfor our armed servicemembers and their families.\n  Senator Inhofe and I will do our part, but we urge our colleagues to \ncontinue to file amendments colleagues would like to see in the bill, \nand we will do our best to clear them. We will also do our utmost to \ndraft a unanimous consent agreement for consideration by our leadership \nthat would provide for some contested relevant amendments so that we \ncan show our leaders we can deal with this bill in a day or two.\n  We will do all that we can, but we need 98 other Senators to help us. \nSo we urge our colleagues, please continue to bring amendments to us. \nPlease help us craft a unanimous consent agreement that would allow for \na reasonable number of contested relevant amendments to be debated and \nvoted on. This is the best way we are going to be able to persuade our \nleaders and our colleagues that we can bring the bill to the floor, \nhave a reasonable period for debate, dispose of at least some relevant \namendments, and pass the critically needed National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  Our troops and their families deserve maximum effort on the part of \nall of us. I hope that will be forthcoming so we will not miss in the \n53rd year a passage of a bill that is so critical to our national \nsecurity.\n  Before I yield, I wish to thank my good friend from Oklahoma, our \nranking member, who has worked so closely with me. Our staffs worked so \nhard on this bill. Together, as partners, we have been able to bring \nthis bill to the floor. I thank him for the very strong leadership he \nhas shown in the security area and on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I thank my good friend, the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Levin.\n  It is true that we have worked so closely together--not just the two \nof us but our staffs directly, the minority and majority staff. It is \nrare that we have a difference of opinion. When we do, we sit down and \nwork things out, debate, and get things done. So there is a reason, as \nSenator Levin said, that we have passed this bill for 52 consecutive \nyears.\n  There are a lot of bills that hit the floor, and some are important, \nsome are not. Some are more important to different Members than others. \nThis is important to everybody. There is not one Senator here who \ndoesn't want to pass a defense authorization bill. When Senator Levin \nmentioned that it passed by 25 to 1--we have been ready to go since \nthat time. That is why we are encouraging people and have been \nencouraging people to bring amendments down.\n  Let me mention that I personally went--as did Senator Levin--to both \nthe majority and the minority leader.\n  They said: Well, go ahead. You have our go-ahead to get these people \nto bring down their amendments.\n  This is very important. And I have to say that one of the problems we \nhad last year was there are a lot of Republicans--and I am on the \nRepublican side. A lot of Republicans had amendments that they didn't \nthink were going to be able to get heard. Well, this is their chance to \ndo that right now.\n  The count as of today is that 94 amendments have been filed. Of that, \n73 are Democratic amendments and only 21 are Republican amendments. So \nI appeal now to the Republicans because what I don't want to happen is \nfor us to come back and maybe go into some type of lameduck session and \nfind ourselves in the same position we were in last year. Now is the \ntime to preclude that from happening by getting their amendments down. \nI think we can do it. We have 4 or 5 weeks during this August recess \nfor our staff to work on these. As the chairman said, a lot of these \nare going to be put together and are going to be accepted and be in the \nmanager's amendment--but not unless Members get them down right now.\n  We know that right now we are probably in the most perilous situation \nwe have ever been in as a country. I sometimes say that I look \nwistfully back to the days of the Cold War when we had two superpowers \nand we knew what they had and they knew what we had and we assured \ncertain destruction if they did anything to us. Now there are places \nled by people with certainly questionable character and abilities. We \nhave North Korea, Iran, and all these countries developing nuclear \nweapons. Our intelligence is good but not good enough to be able to \nknow when it is going to come our way. So we have to be ready. That is \nthe primary function of this committee.\n  We rely on all the people making our Nation safe right now, and they \nare looking at what we are doing. We need to take care of them in \ntraining, readiness, pay, benefits. These are things that are going to \nhappen.\n  The other day the President came out with the OCO request for $59 \nbillion. In there, he mentioned two programs that--frankly, I have \nnever heard of--either one of them. One was $4 billion to go to the \nCounterterrorism Partnerships Fund, and the other was $1 billion for \nthe European Reassurance Fund. I don't know what these are.\n  This is the forum we will use when we start debating the NDAA. It is \ngoing to be to get to all these programs that are new on the horizon, \nto see whether we really want to devote any of our scarce resources to \nsome of these programs. We don't know. When we get the bill on the \nfloor, we will know.\n  It is too important to our troops to do what we did last year. Not \npassing it will send a terrible signal to them. But I think it is more \nimportant to realize how close we came last year to not having the bill \nby December 31. If we didn't have it by December 31, just think of what \nwould have happened. If we could not have corrected the situation, we \nwould have had combat pay stopping. We would have had incentive pay for \nsome of the doctors and all that come to a conclusion.\n  We also would have reenlistment bonuses. Looking at the some of our \nairmen who are flying sophisticated equipment, people don't realize \nthat to train a new person to get to the level of an F-22 costs about \n$15 million. However, a reenlistment bonus is about $250,000.\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\n  So we look at what we can do by doing the right thing and passing the \nbill.\n  We have a lot of serious questions we need to debate on problems in \nSyria, as Senator McCain was talking about a few minutes ago, and Iraq \nand Ukraine and Afghanistan. That is why we need to have the NDAA \ntended to, hopefully as soon as we get back from this recess. The later \nwe put it into the year to act, the more likely many of these \nprovisions could be rolled into one massive Omnibus appropriations \nbill. We all know how that would play out. It would be rammed through \nthe Senate without amendments and open debate. We want transparency. We \nwant people to have an opportunity to bring their amendments out, and \nthe more we can get between now and when we go into this recess, the \nmore it can be worked out by the staff because they are going to be \nworking all during the recess to get this done. We have all these \npeople risking their lives on our behalf. They certainly deserve to \nhave this bill in a well-thought-out manner.\n\n  Right before we came on, Senator Casey was talking about the Afghan \nwomen and girls, some of the real tragedies that are taking place right \nnow over there. These are things, the language of which we can correct \nin this bill. So there is no reason to put it off. We don't want to go \nthrough what we went through last time, and now is the time to prepare \nfor that, and all we have to do is get the amendments in. No one should \ncomplain later on in November or December about not being able to have \ntheir amendments heard if they are not out there right now, bringing \ntheir amendments now.\n  With that, it is my understanding that Senator McCain was going to \nparticipate in this plea we are making, but he has a statement he will \nbe submitting for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today to urge the \nmajority leader to bring to the floor for debate one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation that comes before this body each year--\nthe National Defense Authorization Act.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee version of the Fiscal Year 2015 \nNational Defense Authorization Act provides $514 billion for national \ndefense in Fiscal Year 2015. This includes $496 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense, DOD, base budget and $17.7 billion for national \nsecurity programs.\n  This bill contains several important provisions. It includes a \nprovision to keep the A-10, a vital close air support combat aircraft. \nThis provision would strictly prohibit the U.S. Air Force from retiring \nA-10 airplanes for 1 year and fully fund the flight hours, pilot \ntraining, fuel, maintenance, and operations for all A-10 pilots and \ncrew through 2015.\n  Additionally, this bill contains three different provisions that \nwould improve the prospects of competition for military space launch \nand help move the Pentagon away from using taxpayer dollars to purchase \nrocket engines from Russia.\n  Finally, this bill includes a provision that would eliminate wasteful \nspending in Department of Defense, DOD, IT systems. Before DOD is \nallowed to spend millions of dollars on new IT projects, the department \nmust identify and eliminate old IT systems first.\n  These are just a few of the important provisions that have been \nincluded in this year's NDAA.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee began consideration of the \ndefense authorization bill immediately after the President submitted \nhis fiscal year 2015 budget request. Over the course of 4 months, the \ncommittee conducted several hearings, held countless briefings, and \nthen met for 3 solid days in markup to produce this legislation. The \nbill was approved by the committee on May 22 and is ready to be \ndebated, amended, and passed so that we may conference with the House \non their version of the bill.\n  I strongly urge the majority leader to bring this important bill to \nthe Senate floor for debate. A failure to move to the defense \nauthorization bill as soon as possible is a failure to recognize the \ncritical national security importance signified through the strong \nbipartisan support this bill has enjoyed in this Chamber over the past \nfive decades.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Highway Trust Fund\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an amendment \nthat I filed with the Highway and Transportation Funding Act. While my \namendment did not get a vote, the issue it addresses is very important \nto my home State so I want to take a minute today to talk about the \nissue and the need to address a situation that was created when we \npassed the MAP-21 conference report in 2012.\n  The conference report undid a carefully constructed compromise on the \nAbandoned Mine Land Program that was put together in 2006. It took \napart the work that we had done by limiting the total annual payments \nof AML funds to $15 million per year. That is a change that only \naffected the State of Wyoming. We usually don't do legislation that \nonly affects one State when a number of them receive funds.\n  What was worse, the provision was not in the House or Senate highway \nbill. It was added in the dead of night without consulting anyone from \nthe Wyoming congressional delegation. I was extremely disappointed that \nthe provision was included in the conference report because Senators \nfrom other coal-producing States and I spent years working on this \nissue.\n  When the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was passed in \n1977, a tax was levied on each ton of coal that was produced. The \npurpose of that tax was to reclaim the coal mines that had been \nabandoned before the enactment of the reclamation laws. Half of that \ntax was promised to the States where the coal was mined. That was known \nas the State share. The other half went to the Federal Government to \nadminister the reclamation program and to provide additional funding to \nthe States with the most abandoned coal mines.\n  It was a simple enough concept. Unfortunately, like many things in \nWashington, while the concept was good, clear, and well-intentioned, \nits implementation was a nightmare and the program did not work as \nCongress intended. For years States were shortchanged and the \nreclamation work was not done or the States did it themselves at their \nown expense, expecting to get reimbursed. That is the case in Wyoming. \nAt one point the Federal Government owed the States more than $1.2 \nbillion, while more than $3 billion in reclamation programs remained \nincomplete and unfinished.\n  The issued pitted the East against the West and the debate was always \nthe same. When Members from the East would argue that we should send \nmore money to the States to support reclamation efforts, my colleagues \nfrom the West were just as certain that we needed to keep the Federal \nGovernment's promise to the States to provide the revenue they were \nentitled to under the provisions of the Surface Mining Control and \nReclamation Act.\n  In 2006, a bipartisan coalition of Senators--including me--fixed the \nbroken AML structure. It started with Senator Santorum approaching me \nwith a proposal that had the support of a number of local coal \ncompanies, also the United Mine Workers of America, several \nenvironmental groups, and other businesses. After listening to the \nproposal, I laid out a set of principles that had to be included in \ntheir proposal if they were going to gain my support.\n  First I wanted to see the return of the money owed to the States, \nwhich included $550 million owed to my State. Because Wyoming is a \ncertified State, I also wanted to see the money that came from the \nFederal Government with no strings attached. The legislation \naccomplished that goal by guaranteeing that Wyoming was to receive the \nmoney owed from the Federal Government over a 7-year period.\n  This is money in a trust fund. Trust funds are kind of interesting to \nthe Federal Government. We put money in the drawer and then we take \nmoney out and put bonds in the drawer. Think\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\nabout that in Social Security. It is another one of our trust funds, \nand I am one of the protectors.\n  This was a trust fund but there were only bonds in there, so it was \ndifficult for us to get any money. I wanted to guarantee that future \nmoneys would be paid to States such as Wyoming where significant \namounts of coal were produced. We are where most of the Federal half of \nthe tax comes from.\n  Third, it was important that more money be directed toward \nreclamation in the States where it was needed. More money was needed.\n  And fourth, there had to be a provision for orphan miners' health. \nSometimes that is kind of overlooked, but Senator Byrd and Senator \nRockefeller were very adamant on that.\n  What is an orphan miner? That was a miner who was promised health \ncare and then their mine went out of business. So there is no company \nto pay in anymore so they can get their health care, and we made a \nprovision to take care of that.\n  The legislation that we put together accomplished all four of those \ngoals. We continued our efforts as a bipartisan group, and in December \n2006 we passed the AML reauthorization as part of the Tax Relief and \nHealth Care Act of 2006. The coal industry and the United Mine Workers \nof America supported the bill. Members from certified States less \nWyoming supported the compromise, as did members from uncertified \nStates such as Pennsylvania and West Virginia.\n\n  As a Senator, President Obama voted in favor of the legislation that \nincluded this compromise. From all signs it appeared we had finally \nfixed our problem and helped strengthen our State economies at the same \ntime. Unfortunately, appearances are often deceiving.\n  By limited AML payments in the MAP-21 conference report, Congress \nonce again made clear that taxpayers could not count on a Federal trust \nfund to meet its obligations to administer the tax dollars it collected \neach year in a proper and legislatively mandated manner. This has been \ncontested and successfully defended year after year to preserve this \nmoney, and it was supported by a supermajority from this body until--\nuntil--it was included in this highway bill and included in the highway \nbill in the conference report, not when we had an amendment on the \nfloor that we could once again successfully defeat with a \nsupermajority. It came in the middle of the night, and the next day we \nhad an opportunity to vote for the highway bill.\n  The highway bill is probably one of the most crucial bills to any \nState in the Nation, and if all you get to do is vote yes or no, you \nare not going to take a look at a little portion of the bill where we \nsteal a trust fund from one State--Wyoming--and that is exactly what \nhappened, and it passed.\n  My amendment to the highway bill this time will address the problem \nand put things back together the way they were meant to be. Simply put, \nit will ensure that when a State has been promised it will receive AML \nfunds, it will receive them. Fortunately, I have the intent of Congress \nand the support of many colleagues on this matter of such great concern \nto Wyoming and to all the coal-producing States.\n  I want to particularly thank Senators Hatch and Wyden for their \ncommitment to address this issue created by the MAP-21 conference \nreport. This isn't just a problem for Wyoming, because the next time a \nconference committee goes looking for some money, they can steal it \nfrom another AML State.\n  My amendment also encouraged the production of energy right here at \nhome by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates such an effort will increase \ngross Federal receipts by $5 billion over 10 years. That is more than \nwe need to make this payment. There are other possibilities for offsets \nas well, but that is one that is rather meaty, and that is more than \nenough to pay the funds that were stolen from Wyoming over 10 years and \nto pay for 2 years' worth of transportation projects, not just a short-\nterm fix on transportation.\n  I know my colleagues will see the importance of this matter for \nWyoming and to all the coal-producing States. It is important we take a \nlook at this and protect the validity of trust funds that we set up and \nnot redo them without adequate debate or an actual vote on the trust \nfund that we are violating. We have done that on a couple of other \ntrust funds as well.\n  One of the ones that we also did was to impose an additional tax on \nthose companies that have private pension funds, because we have a \nPension Benefit Guaranty trust fund that is designed so that if a \ncompany goes out of business a worker who works for one of those \nbusinesses will get at least 60 percent of what they were supposed to \nget in their retirement. That is why it is called the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty trust fund. We increased the amount that had to be put in by \n$80 per employee for each of the companies involved, and that was going \nto the trust fund to make sure those funds would be available. But we \ndiverted those funds before they got to the trust fund because the \nactual money could be replaced by bonds in the drawer of the trust \nfund. That money went to highways, and that is just another example of \nhow we are taking money from 10 years' worth of trust funds and using \nit for 2-year projects. We have to change that, and my amendment will \nbe one of the ways of making that change.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Does the distinguished Senator from Utah seek \nrecognition?\n  Mr. HATCH. I was told 6 p.m.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The Senator from Utah may proceed, if he wishes.\n  Mr. HATCH. How long will the Senator from Rhode Island take?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will take approximately 20 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized after the Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my gracious colleague. He is one of the better \npeople here, and I have a great friendship with him as well. I \nappreciate it.\n\n\n                             Patent Trolls\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about the importance of our patent \nsystem and how it continues to be abused by patent trolls.\n  Most Members in this body are fully aware of the crippling effect \npatent trolls are having on innovation and growth upon all areas of our \neconomy--ranging from Main Street businesses to America's largest \ntechnology companies. Through abusive and meritless litigation, patent \ntrolls--often shell companies that do not make or sell anything--extort \nsettlements from innovators throughout the country.\n  How do they do it? Take, for example, the small coffee shop down the \nstreet that provides Wi-Fi service to its customers. The shop owners \nare using a technology exactly as it is intended to be used, but \nthousands of miles away a patent troll purchases broad patents \npreviously issued to someone else. Next, the patent troll sends vague \nand hostile demand letters to the coffee shop, and thousands of similar \nbusinesses, accusing them, often improperly, of infringing their \nquestionable patents.\n  Many trolls target small businesses that they hope will agree to \nsettle even though they have done nothing wrong simply because they do \nnot have the resources to defend themselves in court. These settlements \ndivert capital that could otherwise be used for research and \ndevelopment or to create jobs. In many cases, it costs around $2 \nmillion to fight one of these cases. So they are forced into settling \nwith whatever they can pay rather than doing what they would hope to \ndo; that is, prove that there was an unmeritorious claim.\n  The sad reality is that many businesses often have little choice \nother than to settle rather than to expend the far greater resources \nrequired to fight them in court. Those who do fight back are forced to \nspend millions in litigation costs, often with no chance of enforcing a \ncourt-ordered award against a judgment-proof plaintiff.\n  How big of a problem is this? Mr. James Bessen, writing in the \nHarvard Business Review, confirms that ``the economic burden of today's \npatent lawsuits is, in fact, historically unprecedented. Research shows \nthat patent trolls cost defendant firms $29 billion per year in direct \nout-of-pocket costs; in aggregate, patent litigation destroys over $60 \nbillion in firm wealth each year.''\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\n  Mr. Bessen further cites three studies on patent lawsuits currently \nin the works by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, Rutgers, Harvard, and the University of Texas. Based upon \npreliminary findings, Mr. Bessen states:\n\n       A consistent picture is emerging about the effects of \n     patent litigation: it costs innovators money; many innovators \n     and venture capitalists report that it significantly impacts \n     their businesses; innovators respond by investing less in \n     R and venture capitalists respond by investing less in \n     startups.\n\n  I agree with Mr. Bessen. The evidence from these studies cannot be \nignored. Patent trolls do hurt innovation, and it is past time for \nCongress to do something about it.\n  For the better part of a year, Congress worked toward a legislative \nsolution to combat patent trolls. In December we overcame the first \nlegislative hurdle when the House of Representatives passed the \nInnovation Act by a vote of 325 to 91. The White House endorsed the \nbipartisan legislation by stating: ``The bill would improve incentives \nfor future innovation while protecting the overall integrity of the \npatent system.''\n  Here in the Senate, I worked closely with a bipartisan group of \nSenators to craft a compromise bill that could pass the Senate. \nCountless hours of negotiation yielded encouraging results on key \nlitigation reform provisions, including fee shifting, heightened \npleading and discovery standards, and a mechanism to ensure that \nrecovery of fees will be possible against shell companies.\n  In the spirit of bipartisanship, my Republican colleagues and I were \nwilling--albeit very reluctantly--to lower the bar on fee shifting if \nwe maintained strong litigation reforms elsewhere. I continue to \nbelieve mandatory fee shifting is the best way to discourage patent \nlitigation in cases where a plaintiff's or defendant's case is so weak \nit should never have been brought or defended in the first instance. \nThat is why I included mandatory fee shifting in the Hatch-Leahy Patent \nReform Act of 2006 and why I will insist on its inclusion in future \nlegislation.\n  Fee shifting alone gives a prevailing party little relief against \npatent trolls who litigate in the name of shell companies while their \nfinancial backers or interested parties purposefully remain beyond the \ncourt's jurisdiction.\n  Thus, there must be a mechanism to ensure that recovery of fees will \nbe possible even against judgment-proof shell companies. The recovery \nof award provision I drafted is intended to ensure that shell companies \nprimarily in the business of asserting and enforcing patents and \nlitigation cannot escape potential liability for attorneys fees if they \nare found to have pursued an unreasonable case. Those deemed interested \nparties may either voluntarily submit to the court's jurisdiction and \nbecome liable for any unsatisfied fees awarded in the case or opt out \nby renouncing sufficient interest related to the litigation or do \nnothing.\n  In my view fee shifting without such a recovery provision is akin to \nwriting a check on an empty account. You are purporting to convey \nsomething that is not there. Fee shifting, coupled with this recovery \nprovision, would stop patent trolls from litigating and dashing--\ndashing away, I might say.\n  There is no question that America's ingenuity fuels our economy. We \nmust ensure that our patent system is as strong and vibrant as \npossible, not only to protect our country's premier position as a world \nleader in innovation but also to secure our own economic future. \nPatents encourage technological advancement by providing incentives to \ninvent, invest in, and of course develop new technology.\n  It bears repeating that the governance of patents and copyrights is \none of the essential, specifically enumerated powers given to the \nFederal Government and our Nation's founding. In my view it is one of \nthe most visionary, forward-looking provisions in the entire U.S. \nConstitution. Unfortunately, at least in the 113th Congress, it is \nunlikely that this body will act to end the abuses by patent trolls.\n  It is shameful that even intellectual property bills are now among \nthe latest casualties of our current partisan gridlock.\n  As Senators prepare to return to their home States for the August \nrecess, I hope they will hear from people who represent the hotel, \nrestaurant, retail, real estate, financial services, and high-tech \nindustries--just to mention a few--about the urgent need to pass patent \ntroll legislation.\n  I hope Senators will be reminded about the opportunity the Senate \nabandoned to pass important bipartisan, bicameral legislation that was \nsupported by the White House but pulled from the Senate's agenda by the \nmajority leader.\n  I hope Senators will recognize we must end the multibillion-dollar \nassault on American businesses and workers--because that is what it is.\n  Through commonsense reforms to our patent laws, we can ensure that \nAmerican resources are used to innovate and create jobs and not wasted \nto settle or litigate frivolous claims.\n  I am disappointed that during the 113th Congress the Senate has \nfailed to act to address this critical challenge. Legislation to combat \nabusive patent litigation will be among my top priorities in the next \nCongress. I intend to do everything in my power to get such legislation \npassed for the good of the economy and the good of this country.\n\n\n                                 Israel\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak out in strong support of Israel's \nright to self-defense. This is not a partisan issue. Whether Republican \nor Democrat, we should all stand behind America's loyal ally as it \nfaces Hamas's cowardly terrorism. In this time of frequent domestic \npolitical division, it is encouraging to witness the remarkable degree \nof unanimity among my colleagues on this issue.\n  The wide support for Israel's self-defense here in Congress reflects \nthe unique bond between the United States and Israel. It is an interest \nwe share for many reasons, including our kinship with Israel as a free \nsociety and a democracy, our close economic and cultural ties, \nespecially for those of us who consider support for Israel a deeply \nspiritual matter, our respect for the many virtues of the Israeli \nsociety--from its industriousness to its tolerance--our appreciation \nfor Israel's unique stability in an unstable region full of failed and \nstressed states, and our recognition that Israel wants nothing more \nthan to live in peace with its neighbors.\n  When Hamas fires constant rocket barrages indiscriminately at \nIsrael's cities and seeks to infiltrate Israel with teams of murderers \nand kidnappers, Israel has every right to defend itself against this \nterrorist threat.\n  In the realities of urban warfare against a guerrilla opponent, some \ncivilian casualties are unavoidable. But in its military actions, \nIsrael has acted with admirable and unprecedented concern for \nPalestinian civilians--making phone calls, sending text messages, \ndropping leaflets to warn of impending attacks against military \ntargets, aborting critical airstrips to avoid civilian casualties, and \nundertaking numerous other measures to protect Palestinian civilians, \neven at the expense of Israeli military objectives.\n  While the Israeli Defense Forces act with great courage not only to \nprotect Israeli civilians but also to avoid harming Palestinian \ncivilians, what does Hamas do?\n  Similar to all terrorists, they hide behind civilians--building \nbunkers and tunnels to protect its fighters but refusing to shelter \ncivilians; using civilian buildings, including schools, hospitals, and \nplaces of worship, to launch rockets and hide other weapons; and even \nordering civilians to ignore Israeli warnings and instead turning them \ninto human shields.\n  In the face of this barbarism, Israel deserves our strongest support \nas it seeks to root out the infrastructure of terror Hamas has built in \nand around Gaza. The Israeli people have a right to live free from fear \nof constant rocket attack. While we should applaud the success of the \nIron Dome system in protecting Israeli citizens from the Hamas rocket \nthreat, Israel is acting responsibly by seeking to eliminate the means \nby which Hamas perpetuates that threat.\n  Above all else, we must recognize that supporting Israel is truly \nabout supporting peace in the Middle East. Israel wants peace--not \npeace at any price but a just, secure, and enduring peace. As long as \nHamas terrorists hate Israel more than they love their own children--to \nparaphrase Golda Meir--Israel must occasionally resort to force\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n\nof arms in self-defense. In this endeavor our ally deserves our \nstrongest support.\n  I thank my dear colleague from Rhode Island for allowing me to \nproceed on these two short but very important sets of remarks. I \nappreciate that and wish him well in every way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The distinguished Senator from Utah is one of the \nmost distinguished and ablest lawyers ever to serve in this Senate, and \nhis comments about the patent trolls and patent litigation are entitled \nto great weight.\n  I thoroughly agree with him that the use of these shell corporations \nis something we could and should act quickly to get rid of. I think the \nprotection of an end user, such as a coffee shop or a florist or \nsomebody who is not a competitor with a manufacturer or the patent \nholder, is something we could and should address. I think policing \nthese often extortionate demand letters is something we could and \nshould address. I look forward to working with the distinguished \nSenator in those areas.\n\n  I think when it comes to fee-shifting, that is a very significant \nstep. The principle in the American system of justice that a party pays \nhis or her own lawyer is so deeply engrained in our system of justice \nthat it is actually known as the American rule. To depart from that is \nsomething that I think we should do only with a very--let's put it this \nway. It is a very grave step and I am not sure it is justified in this \ncase. But certainly we could move on the bill that got rid of shell \ncorporations, that protected end users, and that went after these \ndemand letters, and get into conference and, with any luck, something \ncould be done there. But I very much appreciate Senator Hatch's long \nand sincere interest in this issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. I wish to thank my colleague for those comments.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today for the 76th time to urge \nmy colleagues that it is time for us to wake up to the growing threats \nof climate change. Not a single State remains unaffected by the \nunprecedented changes we are already seeing, driven by the excessive \ncarbon pollution we continue to dump into our oceans and atmosphere.\n  Yet in Washington, our Republican colleagues either parrot the \npolluter line that climate change is just a hoax, or stay silent. No \none will step forward.\n  It was not always this way. Environmental protection was once a top \npriority of the Republican Party. It seems remarkable now, but it is \ntrue. In the early 1970s, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and \nthe Endangered Species Act were all passed with broad bipartisan \nsupport and signed by a Republican President. In the 1980s and 1990s, \nbipartisan majorities voted to strengthen those laws, led by Rhode \nIsland's Republican Senator, John Chafee, who served as chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and whose seat I now have the \nhonor to hold.\n  Conservation and stewardship were once fundamental principles of \nAmerican conservatism. From seminal thinkers of the conservative \nmovement to great Republican leaders of the 20th century, the \nconservative ideal included a commitment to the interests of future \ngenerations. Today, under a relentless barrage of unlimited corporate \nspending in our elections, much and perhaps most of it by polluters, \nthe interests of future generations have taken a backseat to the \ninterests of the oil companies and coal barons.\n  The disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision let polluters \ncast their dark shadow over Republicans in Congress who might otherwise \nwork with Democrats on curbing their carbon pollution.\n  Edmund Burke, an Irish-born member of the British Parliament, is \nconsidered by many the father of modern conservatism. Sir Winston \nChurchill called him ``a foremost apostle of liberty.'' Burke was a \nstaunch defender of our American Colonies and his statue stands here in \nWashington today. His 1790 conservative manifesto, ``Reflections on the \nRevolution in France,'' cautioned that we are but ``temporary \npossessors'' of our society. If individuals are ``unmindful of what \nthey have received from their ancestors or of what is due to their \nposterity,'' he wrote, ``no one generation could link with another. Men \nwould become little better than flies of summer.''\n  In our case, flies of a carbon-fueled summer.\n  Russell Kirk was a distinguished scholar at the Heritage Foundation \nwho none other than President Ronald Reagan dubbed ``the prophet of \nAmerican conservatism.'' He wrote a 1970 piece for the Baltimore Sun: \n``Conservation Activism Is a Healthy Sign.'' Kirk wrote: ``Nothing is \nmore conservative than conservation.''\n  The noted essayist and Kentucky farmer Wendell Berry, known for what \nthe American Conservative magazine called his ``unshakeable devotion to \nthe land, to localism, and to the dignity of traditional life,'' wrote \nin 1993:\n\n       Our destruction of nature is not just bad stewardship, or \n     stupid economics, or a betrayal of family responsibility; it \n     is the most horrid blasphemy.\n\n  Berry would also remind us in this Chamber that ``[w]hether we and \nour politicians know it or not, Nature is a party to all our deals and \ndecisions, and she has more votes.''\n  No figure in American history embodied the conservative value of \nconservation more than President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt resented \nthe ``malefactors of wealth,'' as he called them, the timber and mining \ninterests whose ``selfish and shortsighted greed seeks to exploit our \nnatural resources in such fashion as to ruin them and thereby to leave \nour children and our children's children heirs only to an exhausted and \nimpoverished inheritance.'' To Roosevelt, this great land of ours was \nthe birthright of all Americans--past, present, and future--to be used, \nto be sure, in achieving our destiny, but not wasted.\n  He wrote to Congress in 1907:\n\n       To waste, to destroy our natural resources, to skin and \n     exhaust the land instead of using it so as to increase its \n     usefulness, will result in undermining in the days of our \n     children the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand \n     down to them.\n\n  That is a sentiment echoed by Republican Presidents throughout our \nhistory, including President Dwight Eisenhower, whose 1961 farewell \naddress invoked this national legacy. Here is what he said:\n\n       As we peer into society's future, we--you and I, and our \n     government--must avoid the impulse to live only for today, \n     plundering, for our own ease and convenience, the precious \n     resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets \n     of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their \n     political and spiritual heritage.\n\n  Republican President Gerald Ford, who once worked actually as a \nNational Park ranger, said this in 1975:\n\n       We have too long treated the natural world as an adversary \n     rather than as a life-sustaining gift from the Almighty. If \n     man has the genius to build, which he has, he must also have \n     the ability and the responsibility to preserve.\n\n  And, of course, no one is more revered by today's Republican Party \nthan Ronald Reagan. His conservative credentials are unassailable and \nGOP candidates for elected office strive mightily to out-Reagan each \nother at every turn. In 1984, Reagan put this question to his fellow \nRepublicans:\n\n       What is a conservative after all but one who conserves, one \n     who is committed to protecting and holding close the things \n     by which we live? . . . And we want to protect and conserve \n     the land on which we live--our countryside, our rivers and \n     mountains, our planes and meadows and forests. That is our \n     patrimony. That is what we leave to our children. And our \n     great moral responsibility is to leave it to them either as \n     we found it or better than we found it.\n\n  President Ronald Reagan's words would make him a fringe liberal \ncandidate in today's extremist Republican Party.\n  In Congress, we have been boxed in by a barricade of special interest \npropaganda and we refuse to admit the plain evidence piling up before \nour eyes. We know with ever greater certainty what our carbon pollution \nis doing to the climate, what it is doing to our atmosphere, what it is \ndoing to our oceans. And we know with ever greater certainty what that \nmeans for the planet and future generations. What do Republicans in \nCongress today have to say to our heirs, to our children and \ngrandchildren?\n  ``Catastrophic global warming is a hoax,'' says one of my Republican \ncolleagues.\n  ``It's not proven by any stretch of the imagination,'' says another.\n\n[[Page S5117]]\n\n  A third dismisses the issue altogether, saying, ``A lot of this is \ncondescending elitism.'' That is the voice of today's Republican Party.\n  But what does the next generation have to say back to these \nRepublican voices of denial? More than half of young Republican voters \nsaid they would describe a politician who denies climate change is \nhappening as ignorant, out of touch, or crazy--not my words, their \nwords in the poll: ignorant, out of touch, or crazy. That is what the \nnext generation says back to the Republican voices of denial.\n  Unfortunately, if one is a Republican in Congress today, it is more \nlikely than not that one either holds that view or is afraid to say \notherwise. According to one analysis, 58 percent of congressional \nRepublicans in the 113th Congress have denied or questioned the \noverwhelming scientific consensus that the Earth's oceans and \natmosphere are changing in unprecedented ways, driven by our carbon \npollution. This includes, I am sad to report, every single Republican \nmember of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. And \nwhere there is not denial, there is silence.\n  Outside these barricaded walls, it is different. Outside Congress, \nmore and more Republicans acknowledge the threat of climate change and \ncall for responsible solutions. Former Members of Congress, free now \nfrom the polluters' thrall, implore their colleagues to return to their \nconservative principles. Former Representative Bob Inglis, for example, \ninvokes the tenets of conservative economics. Here is his quote:\n\n       If you're a conservative, it is time to step forward and \n     engage in the climate and energy debate because we have the \n     answer--free enterprise. . . . Conservatives understand that \n     we must set the correct incentives, and this should include \n     internalizing pollution and other environmental costs in our \n     market system. We tax income but we don't tax emissions. It \n     makes sense to conservatives to take the tax off something we \n     want more of, income, and shift the tax to something we want \n     less of, emissions.\n\n  Sherwood Boehlert and Wayne Gilchrest, former Republican \nrepresentatives from New York and Maryland, also argue for a market-\nbased approach to reducing carbon pollution. Here is what they said:\n\n       We could slash our debt by making powerplants and oil \n     refineries pay for the carbon emissions that endanger our \n     health and environment. This policy would strengthen our \n     economy, lessen our dependence on foreign oil, keep our skies \n     clean, and raise a lot of revenue.\n\n  Top advisors to former Republican Presidents have joined the chorus. \nWilliam D. Ruckelshaus, Lee M. Thomas, William K. Reilly, Christine \nTodd Whitman all headed the Environmental Protection Agency during \nRepublican administrations. They all recently testified before the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee that it is time to get serious \nabout climate change. Here is how they put it in a New York Times op-\ned. They wrote:\n\n       As administrators of the EPA under Presidents Richard M. \n     Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, we held \n     fast to common-sense conservative principles--protecting the \n     health of the American people, working with the best \n     technology available and trusting in the innovation of \n     American business and in the market to find the best \n     solutions for the least cost.\n\n  These former officials recognize both the wisdom of properly pricing \ncarbon and the truculence of the opponents who stand in the way of \nprogress. ``A market-based approach, like a carbon tax, would be the \nbest path to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions,'' they say--``the best \npath''--``but that is unachievable in the current political gridlock in \nWashington. . . .'' I would interject that political gridlock is the \nproduct of big-spending polluters who profit from the gridlock that \nthey create. But let me continue with what the EPA Administrators said: \n``But we must continue efforts to reduce the climate-altering \npollutants that threaten our planet. The only uncertainty about our \nwarming world,'' they wrote, ``is how bad the changes will get, and how \nsoon. What is most clear is that there is no time to waste.'' Four \nRepublican EPA Administrators.\n  One day folks are going to look back at this time and we are all \ngoing to be judged very harshly with all the dread power that history \nhas to inflict on wrong. The polluters and their instruments will be \njudged harshly, and the Republican Party will be judged harshly for \nletting itself be led astray by polluters from its most basic \nconservative values. Unless they step up, Republicans will leave--to \nborrow language from Russell Kirk--``[t]he principle of real leadership \nignored, the immortal objects of society forgotten, practical \nconservatism degenerated into mere laudation of private enterprise, \neconomic policy almost wholly surrendered to special interests.'' That \nis about as good a description of where they are right now as I could \nmuster, and it comes from the conservative Russell Kirk.\n  We cannot do this alone, not with the numbers that we have. \nRepublicans and Democrats alike must approach this climate problem head \non with the full conviction of our ideals, but working together, \nworking in good faith, and working on a common platform of fact and \ncommon sense to protect the American people and our American economy \nfrom the looming effects of carbon pollution.\n  We must rise to our duty here and place our own natural resources, \nour own American international reputation, and our legacy to future \nAmerican generations first, ahead of the poisonous influence of the \npolluters that so dominates this debate now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, thank you very much for recognizing \nme.\n  I also wish to thank the Presiding Officer for his leadership on \nenvironmental issues which are so immensely pressing and important for \nour country, and I am proud and honored to join with him in that cause, \nwhich he has helped to lead so often on the floor, but also privately \namongst our colleagues and in so many ways across the country. I hope \nto continue our work together on that issue, and I thank him for \npresiding now and for continuing that leadership.\n  Mr. President, I am speaking today, after listening to the people of \nmy State, on an issue that perplexes and challenges us in so many ways. \nThe situation on our southern border perplexes us because it is a \nproblem without easy or ready solutions. It is a challenge to America \nin the resources that it requires and the spirit that it evokes. Our \nresources are scarce. Our spirit and our inner strength are boundless. \nMany have expressed to me in my State of Connecticut concerns about \nthose resources, about the limits on those resources, in facing a \nseemingly endless challenge, as children come to our borders and \nstretch the capacity of this Nation to accept them. I am sympathetic \nwith the folks who wonder whether we are capable, very simply, of \ncaring for these children--but I know we can--the children who are \ncoming here because of the humanitarian crisis they face in their \ncountries.\n  Our supplemental legislation, so ably guided by Senator Mikulski, \nprovides a path for providing the resources that are necessary. This \nsupplemental is a thoughtful and significant document that addresses \nthis situation without either breaking the bank or sacrificing American \nvalues.\n  I am immensely impressed and inspired by the spirit that has been \nevoked, again, among citizens of Connecticut in saying: We must care \nfor those individual children who need asylum because returning them to \nthe countries of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala would be a death \nsentence for many of them. And we must respect our law which provides \nfor individual consideration and assessment of those children in \nwhether they deserve and need asylum and that status of fleeing \npersecution and death that many of them, in fact, have faced in those \nlands.\n  We must place those individuals, according to law, with their \nfamilies, if possible. Many of them have parents here, and the vast \nmajority have some family, moms and dads, aunts and uncles. They need \nto be screened under the law. Their placement has to be in a\n\n[[Page S5118]]\n\nsafe and secure home with people, in my view, who are here legally. \nThat screening has to be, as the law requires, to assure their safety \nand security as children. The United States has a responsibility to \nfollow the law, and so do we as citizens and as lawmakers. As torn as \nwe may be, as conflicted as we may feel, as vehement as those \nconflicting feelings may be felt and expressed by fellow citizens, let \nus uphold the law and afford due process and individual consideration \nto those children who, under the law, deserve that individual \nassessment, individual treatment, individual consideration for the \nstatus of asylum in this Nation.\n\n  People speak about these children as if they were a mass, \nindistinguishable, a single societal challenge or problem. A Member of \nthe House of Representatives even referred to them as an ``invasion.'' \nWhat I saw at the border when I visited there with two of my \ncolleagues, Senator Hirono and Senator Murkowski, joined by a third, \nSenator Cornyn, all friends and distinguished colleagues, hammered home \nfor me that these children are individuals and they should be treated \nas such.\n  The vast outpouring of spirit and generosity in this country is \nmirrored by countless organizations--we heard about them during our \nvisit--that want to help these children, want to volunteer and give of \nthemselves, their time, money, goods and services, everything from \nblankets, to furniture, to pizza, to you name it. America is pouring \nout its heart for these children.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to \nSecretary Johnson and Commissioner Kerlikowske from Save the Children, \na Connecticut organization that has offered, very generously, its help \nand support in very specific and concrete ways, along with a briefing \nnote that outlines what it perceives the children's needs at the border \nto be.\n  Let's end one doubt: the need for and the urgent justification for \nindividual due process consideration and the full and adequate \nscreening of these children and a fair judicial proceeding. I would \ndescribe just a few stories.\n  Girls are fleeing sexual violence at the hands of gangs in Honduras \nand El Salvador. I will give just a few examples.\n  Ms. L was raped by more than a dozen gang members in Honduras. After \nreporting the gang rape to police, her family began to receive death \nthreats.\n  There are only three shelters in Honduras for rape survivors, and two \nof them actually operate as brothels. The one remaining shelter \ndeclined to take Ms. L because it could not protect her or the other \nshelter residents from gang violence. She had no choice but to flee \nHonduras.\n  Carlita is a 13-year-old who fled gang violence in El Salvador. She \nwas kidnapped by the Zetas in Mexico, used for sex, and forced to be a \ndrug mule for them before escaping and ultimately reaching the United \nStates.\n  Ms. H survived multiple rapes in Honduras. After she fled she was \nkidnapped by a Mexican gang and raped and tortured. She eventually \nreached the United States.\n  Ms. N and Ms. O, ages 15 and 8, fled El Salvador. Their older female \ncousins had been forced to work as sex slaves for gang leaders. The \ngangs threatened to kill Ms. N and were placed in removal proceedings.\n  Ms. E fled El Salvador when she was 8 years old. Gang members had \nkidnapped her and two older sisters. The girl's mother did not want her \n8-year-old daughter to suffer the same fate, so she arranged for her \ndaughter to be brought to the United States.\n  Many gangs use sexual violence as a part of the price or rent \ndemanded of girls.\n  Ms. X fled an area of El Salvador controlled by gangs. Her brother \nwas killed for refusing to join a gang that forcibly tried to recruit \nhim. She was raped by two men, became pregnant as a result, and then \nwas required to pay ``renta'' to the rapists, which increased over \ntime. She fled El Salvador and was attacked by Mexican robbers during \nher journey, before arriving in the United States.\n  Many of these girls are victims of forced prostitution and human \ntrafficking. I have other stories that will be printed in the Record. \nThese stories come from personal experiences of advocates and others \nwho have interviewed them at length as well as our own officials. Many \nof these girls are sexually assaulted during the treacherous journey \nnorthward. Those stories are not imagined or fictionalize; they are \ngraphic and dramatic. Rape is so prevalent that many girls begin the \njourney by taking birth control injections before they leave home from \nCentral America as a precaution against pregnancy.\n  I refer to these stories because they illustrate and illuminate the \nneed for a thoughtful humanitarian approach, especially to these young \ngirls whose stories are so real and so inspiring, not just in the \ntreacherous journey they overcome, not just in the torture and abuse \nthey suffer, but in the dignity and self-worth and strength and \nresoluteness they continue to have. A thoughtful humanitarian approach \nis what is required. It is the approach that this supplemental \nexemplifies in providing resources.\n  There is an oath that doctors take: ``First do no harm.'' Let that be \nthe approach of this body in approving basic amounts of money, reduced \nby the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, so that it meets \nappropriately and frugally the needs of these children to be placed in \nhumane circumstances with families who are screened for their safety \nand security and their being here legally.\n\n  I will close with one last experience. In one interview I watched at \nthe border, I saw a 7-year-old girl crying quietly as she tried to \nanswer the questions of an armed border guard. The border guard did his \nbest. He was obviously caring in his approach. But neither his training \nnor the experience of any border guard equips them really to play this \nrole with a 7-year-old-girl. They are in uniform, a police uniform, \nwhich for this girl's whole life has meant fear, potential rape, bodily \nharm. These children have learned from hard experience that that fear \nis often justified. They are distrustful of adults generally and \nauthority figures in particular.\n  Nobody could watch this scene without feeling a sense of compassion \nfor those guards and, of course, most especially the girl, separated \nfrom her family, sitting on a bench, her legs swinging free because she \nwas not big enough to reach the floor. The look on her face revealed \nnot just terror but a fervent desire to please, inspired by fear. She \ncould not communicate openly with the border guard.\n  What she needed was someone trained and equipped to elicit the facts \nof her background, the reason she had fled, the motivation for her \nescape, the facts and her feelings about it. That kind of individual \nassessment is the reason we have the law passed by Congress in 2008, \nunanimously. This Trafficking Victims Protection Act was designed for \nthese girls and boys coming from noncontiguous countries facing those \nfears, those threatening conditions if they were to be returned. They \nface a near certain death, many of them, if they are returned without \nthe individual assessment and consideration. Call it due process, call \nit judicial, call it humane questioning--the title matters less than \nwhat happens.\n  I know this Nation cannot be expected to rescue all of the children \nof the world from all of the harsh and inhumane conditions they may \nface. We are not limitless in our capacity to do good. But I know and I \nbelieve we have the resources to do what is just and right under the \nlaw considering every one of those children and every one of the \npotential threats they face if they are returned to their countries.\n  It is an American value that we follow the rule of law, that we grant \nasylum under the law to people who deserve it and need it. That much we \ncan do. I know we have the resources to do it. I believe we have the \nwill to do it. The heart of America and its citizens is big. We are a \nbig country. We are not limitless in our resources, but we are \nboundless in our capacity for generosity and doing what is right.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Save the Children,\n\n                                                    July 22, 2014.\n       Dear Secretary Johnson and Commissioner Kerlikowske: Like \n     you and your team, we are deeply concerned about the \n     thousands of unaccompanied minor children crossing our \n     southern border. To address the humanitarian crisis, I am \n     writing to offer our support and propose ways that Save the \n     Children can be of immediate assistance to improve the \n     conditions for children.\n\n[[Page S5119]]\n\n       Save the Children has nearly a century of experience \n     working with displaced children around the world and has \n     responded to serve children in the face of every natural \n     disaster in the US for the past decade. In the US, we have \n     been a leading partner of the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency (FEMA), supporting the needs of children. We have been \n     operating for the past month in McAllen, TX serving children \n     and mothers after their release from Customs and Border \n     Patrol (CBP) custody and have trained more than 80 FEMA Corps \n     members to begin offering basic child programming within the \n     CBP detention and overflow sites. However, we know we can do \n     more to improve the conditions and outcomes for these \n     children.\n       Your Rio Grande Valley CBP Team, under the leadership of \n     Chief Kevin Oaks, has been a great ally to us as we try to \n     support and assist in this unprecedented situation, offering \n     us tours and being open to dialogue about the needs of \n     children in their custody. However, he has been unable to \n     grant us permission to provide technical assistance and \n     professional child programming onsite without higher \n     authority--it is to you we appeal for this permission.\n       The conditions in which the children and mothers are being \n     detained are designed for accused criminals, not mothers and \n     children. Save the Children would like to work with you and \n     your team to be a part of the solution. We have the expertise \n     needed to give the children the unique support needed under \n     the current difficult circumstances.\n       I am writing to propose that Save the Children work with \n     you to immediately help improve conditions for children and \n     address children's urgent needs for care and mental health \n     supports. This would support the safety, protection and \n     wellbeing of the children--and it would relieve stress on the \n     CBP agents. All of these programs could be established at no \n     cost to you--or, if required through DHS/CBP policies and \n     procedures, Save the Children could be reimbursed for this \n     support.\n       Here is what Save the Children is proposing:\n       1. Save the Children is offering to immediately provide \n     care for the young children at the CBP detention sites, \n     including the new McAllen overflow site, while their cases \n     are being processed.\n       Save the Children would provide our Child-Friendly Spaces \n     program, a signature program that we use to support \n     children's mental health and safety in crisis in the U.S. and \n     around the world. This care would be customized to fit the \n     CBP space availability in each border detention site. We \n     would be able to provide basic programs directly in the \n     holding cells or in whatever space may be available. Our \n     teams are trained to provide this program in the U.S. and in \n     challenging, high-risk environments all over the world. For \n     example, we are currently providing this program in Iraq, \n     South Sudan, and the countries bordering Syria.\n       2. Save the Children is requesting your permission to \n     provide professional staff at each site that has FEMA Corps \n     members, whom we are now supporting to provide urgently \n     needed programming for children in custody. Our professional \n     staff would lead the work with children and provide ongoing \n     support and guidance to the FEMA Corps members while they are \n     in the CBP stations. This will help ensure that there is \n     consistent quality and safety for the children while they \n     participate in the program activities.\n       Through our partnership with FEMA, the Corporation for \n     National and Community Service and FEMA Corps, this week, \n     Save the Children is training the FEMA Corps teams who are \n     deployed to serve in the CBP stations. Until now, the FEMA \n     Corps members were not trained to work with children and have \n     not been supplied with materials or program activities, \n     specifically activities that support children's emotional \n     wellbeing. We know that many of the children had arduous \n     journeys at the hands of smugglers and traffickers. The \n     children need to receive psychosocial support from the moment \n     of their arrival to ensure their wellbeing. Save the Children \n     will be training and providing ongoing technical support to \n     the FEMA Corps members to help them in their mission \n     assignment to support the children in CBP custody.\n       3. Save the Children is also offering to provide \n     psychosocial support programs to the CBP agents and their \n     families to help relieve their stress and support their \n     emotional wellbeing during this crisis. We know that many of \n     the border agents are heavily stressed by this crisis. By \n     supporting the psychosocial and mental health needs, and the \n     needs of their families, you will help ensure their longer-\n     term wellbeing. I am attaching a fact sheet about our Journey \n     of Hope program.\n       4. Save the Children is offering to distribute comfort kits \n     to the mothers and children. We have customized the kits to \n     be age appropriate for mothers, infants and toddlers, young \n     children and school-aged children. They include items such as \n     pacifiers, wipes, baby blankets, plush toys, and bilingual \n     storybooks. We would be happy to work with CBP to ensure that \n     the items provided meet with CBP security regulations. We are \n     ready to immediately provide 5,000 comfort kits for the \n     children, 1,000 infant and toddler kits, and 2,000 kits for \n     the mothers.\n       5. Save the Children is offering to conduct a multi-sector \n     assessment of needs and provide ongoing monitoring to ensure \n     the programs for children support CBP's mission and the \n     children's needs.\n       Save the Children is uniquely qualified to address the \n     needs of these children in collaboration with CBP and the \n     U.S. government during this crisis. We are reaching out \n     across all relevant federal and state agencies to both \n     advocate for the needs of these children and to offer our \n     support. Thank you again for your attention to this \n     humanitarian crisis and I appreciate your review of our \n     request to work with you and your team for the benefit of \n     all.\n           I look forward to working together,\n                                                    Carolyn Miles,\n     President & CEO, Save the Children USA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Briefing Note: Meeting the Needs of Children on the U.S. Border\n\n\n                               The Crisis\n\n       For years, children and minors from Guatemala, Mexico, El \n     Salvador, Honduras and other Central American nations have \n     sought refuge in the United States. However, their numbers \n     have increased dramatically since late 2013 because of \n     violence, extreme poverty and other factors that make their \n     and their families' lives untenable. Between October 2013 and \n     May of this year, nearly 50,000 children, many unaccompanied \n     by a parent or guardian, arrived at the U.S. border. This is \n     a 92 percent increase from the prior year, according to U.S. \n     Customs and Border Protection. Projections suggest that the \n     number of children arriving will increase to between 60,000 \n     and 90,000 by the end of 2014.\n\n\n                         The Impact on Children\n\n       Children are always among the most vulnerable in any \n     emergency. Many of the children arriving at the border are \n     suffering from physical illnesses, diarrhea and dehydration, \n     and some have been victimized during their long and arduous \n     journey. They are in urgent need of protective adult care, \n     supportive supervision, medical and hygiene care, and \n     nutritious meals.\n       With intensive overcrowding at the border stations, reports \n     about sanitation and living conditions for children are \n     extremely disturbing. We have heard stories that children as \n     young as age six are being separated from their mothers for \n     days and kept in border detention sites that are ill-equipped \n     to meet the basic needs of children. Our staff in Texas has \n     also heard first-hand from women that they are fleeing \n     communities because of threats that have been made by gangs \n     to harm their families.\n\n\n                            Recommendations\n\n       The large influx of migrants poses huge challenges for \n     local communities and Border Patrol agents charged with \n     protecting the border. Despite these challenges, it is \n     critical for local communities and U.S. government agencies \n     to:\n       Provide adequate sanitary conditions, and basic needs such \n     as food, water, blankets and places to sleep in the shelters, \n     detention centers and transit centers housing children;\n       Prevent traumatic separation of mothers from young children \n     where at all possible; and\n       Facilitate basic health services and mental health support \n     for children who are in need of psychosocial support.\n        NGOs like Save the Children have decades of experience in \n     addressing the needs of fleeing children in some of the \n     hardest hit areas of the world. In order to ensure that \n     children are receiving treatment and care that is up to \n     international standards, we urge the U.S. government to:\n       Allow NGOs with expertise in child protection issues to \n     gain access to border detention sites; and\n       Permit NGOs with expertise in child protection issues to \n     assess the needs of children and their families to devise \n     strategies that will ensure their well-being.\n       It is both important and obligatory under current U.S. and \n     international law to uphold the legal rights of children, \n     especially those with a possible claim to refugee status. To \n     this end, we ask the U.S. government to:\n       Provide unaccompanied children with adequate screenings and \n     a fair judicial process to ensure that they are not being \n     returned to life-threatening situations;\n       Uphold provisions in existing laws that provide due process \n     for unaccompanied children so that those with the right to \n     stay are not short-changed and lost in the shuffle; and\n       Ensure children and their families are made aware of their \n     legal protections and options.\n       Finally, any viable long term strategy must include a \n     robust effort to address the root causes for the surge and \n     not focus only on its symptoms. To this end, we request that \n     the U.S. government:\n       Dedicate funding to address issues of violence and poverty \n     that drive migration from the countries of origin and not \n     only on border security and deterrence.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich.) The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Children in Need\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am especially grateful to the senior \nSenator from Connecticut for his words tonight and the challenge those \nwords present to us. We are grateful for his efforts to stand for \nchildren.\n  I rise tonight to speak about children here in the United States. I \nspoke earlier about issues that related to women\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n\nand girls and children generally in Afghanistan. But I wanted to \nhighlight a report that came out recently by one of the leading \norganizations in the country that charts the well-being of children \nover time and advocates on their behalf. The name of the organization \nthat many here have heard of, I am sure, is the Annie E. Casey \nFoundation--no relation to me--a foundation that has made it its \nmission to advocate on behalf of children. We cannot be an effective \nadvocate--none of us--unless we chart their progress and find out what \nis working. So I am going to briefly summarize tonight the findings of \nthe 2014 Kids County Report by the Casey Foundation.\n  I have here at the lectern kind of a color-coded chart which I will \nnot hold up because I do not have an enlarged version of it. I will not \nbe able to have it printed in the Record.\n  I want to summarize it. Basically, what is in front of me is a \nsummary of various categories that the Annie E. Casey Foundation has \ndeveloped to chart the well-being of children. They separate the \ncomparisons into four sections, and then they determine whether over \ntime--whether it is over 4 or 5 years or over a longer period of time--\nwhether for children the indicators have worsened or improved. It is a \nvery basic set of metrics.\n  The categories they track for children are the following four \ncategories: first, economic well-being, and I will talk about some of \nthe indicators there; second, education; third, health; and fourth, a \ncategory they call family and community.\n  The basic indicators for the entire United States--of course, they \nhave a breakdown for how the children in every State are doing on those \nindicators. For example, in terms of what is getting better, we should \nhighlight and note when there are improvements made. I think the fact \nthat we have improvements on these indicators for children over time \nindicates that public policy matters, what happens here in the Congress \nmatters, what happens across the country in nonprofit organizations and \nadvocacy organizations that fight every day for children and say over \nand over again, as the advocates tell us, that children are not small \nadults--we need specific strategies for children, whether it is for \nhealth care or for early education or to make sure they get enough to \neat or to protect them from predators. Whatever the issue, we have to \nhave specific strategies for children.\n  Let's go through a couple of areas where there has been improvement--\nnot dramatic improvement, not enough improvement for us to say we have \nachieved a measure of success on one metric and we can move on.\n  In the area of education, just by way of example, eighth grade \nchildren--eighth graders not proficient in math, so it is kind of \nalmost a negative indicator the way it is phrased. In 2005, across the \nUnited States, 72 percent of eighth graders were not proficient in \nmath--a very high number, 72 percent. When they looked at it again in \n2013, it was down to 66. So it has improved by 6 percentage points, but \nthankfully it is moving in the right direction. But we can't be \nsatisfied with 66 percent of eighth graders not--not--proficient in \nmath, but it is good news it is moving in the right direction.\n  Another bit of good news and maybe a more urgent issue in terms of \nwhat happens to very young children--in this case, low birth weight \nbabies--there is an improvement there from 2005 to 2012. So over 7 \nyears, the percentage of low birth weight babies, according to this \ndata, has gotten better, but the unfortunate part is it only went from \n8.2 percent to 8 percent--not much of an improvement but an \nimprovement.\n  We have a long way to go in the greatest country in the world when we \nsay that there has been an improvement but still 8 percent of babies \nare low birth weight. So there is an improvement, but there is a lot \nmore work to do.\n  Maybe the best area indicator of improvement--and then I will move on \nto areas where there has been a worsening--children without health \ninsurance. We hear a lot of discussion about health insurance, health \ncare, and the Affordable Care Act in Congress, but in 2008 when that \nmeasurement was taken, 18 percent of children did not have health care. \nSo in 2008 it was 10 percent, and as of 2012 it is down to 7 percent. \nSo there is a substantial diminution or reduction in the number of \nchildren without health insurance. But if we do the math, 7 percent of \nthe children of the country don't have health insurance. That is a big \nnumber. So it is getting better, substantially better, better than \nalmost any other metric in terms of growth or progress, but we have to \ndo a lot more to make sure that it is not 7 percent--that number should \nbe zero--make sure that every child has health insurance. That has to \nbe the goal, and that has to be what we are determined to achieve in \nthe Senate.\n  I will go through a couple of areas that have worsened, but \nthankfully, of what is 16 categories, there are more improvement \ncategories than worsening categories. Unfortunately, we have to go \nthrough some of the areas where it is worse.\n  One that is particularly disturbing is children in poverty. That has \nworsened between the years 2005 and 2012--19 percent in 2005 was the \npercentage of children in poverty. As of 2012 that went up to 23 \npercent. So prior to the great recession and then some time after the \nrecession ended, the 2012 number was 23 percent. So that is a worsening \nnumber, and it should give us not just pause, but it should be an \nimpetus to action to reduce that number--23 percent of the children in \nthe country in poverty as of 2012. Children whose parents lack secure \nemployment--that number got worse. Children living in households with \nhigh-housing-cost burden--that number got worse, unfortunately.\n  I will give two more, and then I will conclude my remarks. Children \nin single-parent families--that number got worse between 2005 and 2012. \nFinally, children living in high-poverty areas--that was measured over \na different time period--2000 versus a time period between 2008 and \n2012. That number got worse as well.\n  What this report indicates--and I won't go through the State \nnumbers--is that first and foremost we have to keep records and we have \nto track progress. But it also indicates that even when there is an \nimproving metric, when the numbers are getting better, say, for \nexample, on low birth weight babies, that improvement is in many cases \nvery slight and not nearly adequate or acceptable.\n  I think both on the worsening numbers and on the improvement numbers, \nit should be a call to action. I believe that if we are doing the right \nthing for our children, if we are living up to what the Scriptures tell \nus about justice, where the Scriptures talk about ``Blessed are they \nwho hunger and thirst for justice, for they shall be satisfied,'' if we \nthink of how we treat children as a measure or as an indicator of \njustice and our commitment to justice, we cannot say that these numbers \nare in any way acceptable, that our hunger and our thirst for that kind \nof justice cannot be satisfied with these numbers.\n  We should be committed to not just tracking and making marginal or \nincremental progress, we should be committed to the full measure of \njustice for our children.\n  Hubert Humphrey said--and he may have said it on this floor when he \nrepresented Minnesota--``It was once said that the moral test of a \ngovernment is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of \nlife, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; \nand those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the \nhandicapped.'' He said that was the moral test of a government.\n  So if we are talking about what Humphrey said about children in the \ndawn of their life, we have to reflect upon and be motivated by the \nfindings of the Annie E. Casey Foundation report. It is one of those \nreports that remind us how we can improve when it comes to the well-\nbeing of our children, but it also reminds us and I think alarms us \nabout areas where we have not improved and we have a ways to go.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nPresident's emergency supplemental request of $615 million to fight \nwildfires throughout the United States.\n  We have witnessed increasingly large and devastating wildfires over \nthe last few decades.\n  Nationwide, the costs of fighting wildfires has increased from $200 \nmillion in 1986 to $1.7 billion in 2013. In\n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\nthat same time, the amount of acres burned has increased from 2.7 \nmillion acres in 1986 to 4.3 million acres in 2013.\n  In many parts of the U.S., fire seasons are now 60 to 80 days longer \ncompared to three decades ago and in some places like Southern \nCalifornia, the fire season never ends.\n  This is leading to seasonal firefighters being hired several months \nearlier than normal and federal agencies spending more to make sure our \nfirefighters are prepared and have the necessary resources available \nfor the entire year.\n  So far this year, California has experienced a 35 percent increase in \nfire activity and a 16 percent increase in acres burned over an average \nyear. These alarming statistics translate to more than 4,000 wildfires \nin my State already that have burned more than 52,000 acres since the \nbeginning of the year.\n  Right now, brave firefighters in California are battling five \ndifferent large fires. The largest is the Sand Fire, which has burned \nover 4,000 acres east of Sacramento. This fire has already destroyed 19 \nhomes.\n  Although it has already been an unprecedented fire season in \nCalifornia, we are not at all out of danger yet as the significant \nwildland fire potential remains above normal for most of the State \nthrough October of this year. It is also above normal in Oregon, \nWashington, Idaho, Nevada, and parts of Arizona.\n  Adding to the difficulty of battling these enormous fires is the \nconstrained fire suppression budget we are currently operating under.\n  Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the \nDepartment of Interior announced that wildfire-fighting costs this \nsummer are projected to run about $400 million over budget.\n  In fact, since 2002, the United States has overspent its wildfire \nsuppression budget every year except one--and in three of those years, \nwent over the suppression budget by nearly $1 billion. This chronic \nunderfunding of our firefighting accounts cannot continue.\n  When we fail to budget for fire suppression, the Forest Service and \nthe Department of Interior are forced to transfer money from fire \nprevention accounts to make up the difference. That makes no sense!\n  We are taking money from the very programs that help reduce the \nthreat of wildfires--such as hazardous fuel removal programs.\n  In my State, plans to remove dry brush and dead trees in the Tahoe \nNational Forest and the Plumas National Forest have been delayed \nbecause wildfire prevention funding is not available.\n  The President's supplemental request not only adds funding for fire \nsuppression during this fiscal year, it solves the problem in the \nfuture by creating a Wildfire Suppression Cap Adjustment so that \nextraordinary fire costs are treated in the same way as destructive \nhurricanes, tornadoes, or earthquakes are funded.\n  This means that money to fight the largest fires would not be subject \nto discretionary budget caps much like FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund.\n  As our fire seasons become longer, hotter, and endanger more \ncommunities, we must act now to change how wildfire suppression is \nfunded so that we can reduce fire risk and increase the resiliency of \nthe Nation's public lands, forests, and the surrounding communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this emergency supplemental funding \nand address the growing crisis of wildfires.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5121-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, every time I go by the children's library \nat Kellogg-Hubbard Library in my hometown of Montpelier, VT, it brings \nback happy memories. I would like to have printed in the Record an \narticle 1 wrote about the library and its wonderful librarian, Miss \nHolbrook.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Times Argus, June 13, 1996]\n\n            Montpelier Boy Realizes Miss Holbrook Was Right\n\n                           (By Patrick Leahy)\n\n       The 100th anniversary of the Kellogg-Hubbard Library \n     triggers memories for all of us who have lived in Montpelier. \n     And they are great memories.\n       While I was growing up, Montpelier did not have television. \n     We children did not have the advantage of cable TV with 10 \n     channels giving us the opportunity to buy things we didn't \n     need and would never use or another 10 offering blessings or \n     redemptions for an adequate contribution.\n       Deprived as we were, we made do with the Lone Ranger and \n     Inner Sanctum on the radio and Saturday's serials at the \n     Strand Theater on Main Street. For a few minutes on Saturday \n     afternoon, we could watch Hopalong Cassidy, Tarzan, Flash \n     Gordon, Jungle Jim or Batman face death-defying predicaments \n     that would guarantee you would be back the next Saturday, 14 \n     cents in hand, to see how they survived (and I recall they \n     always did).\n       Having exhausted radio, Saturday matinees, the latest comic \n     books (I had a favorite) and childhood games and chores, we \n     were left to our own imagination.\n       That was the best part.\n       We were a generation who let the genies of our imagination \n     out of the bottle by reading. Then, as now, reading was one \n     of my greatest pleasures.\n       My parents had owned the Waterbury Record Weekly newspaper \n     and then started the Leahy Press in Montpelier, which they \n     ran until selling it at their retirement. The Leahy family \n     was at home with the printed word and I learned to read early \n     in life.\n       At 5 years old I went down the stairs of the Kellogg-\n     Hubbard Children's Library, and the years that followed \n     provided some of the most important experiences of my life.\n       In the '40s and '50s, the Kellogg-Hubbard was blessed with \n     a white-haired children's librarian named Miss Holbrook. Her \n     vocation in life had to be to help children read and to make \n     reading enjoyable. She succeeded more than even she might \n     have dreamed.\n       She had the key to unlocking our imagination.\n       With my parents' encouragement, the Kellogg-Hubbard was a \n     regular stop every afternoon as I left school. On any day I \n     had two or three books checked out. My sister Mary, brother \n     John and I read constantly.\n       In my years as U.S. senator, it seems I never traveled so \n     far or experienced so much as I did as a child in Montpelier \n     with daily visits to the library. With Miss Holbrook's \n     encouragement I had read most of Dickens and Robert Louis \n     Stevenson in the early part of grade school.\n       To this day, I remember sitting in our home at 136 State \n     St. reading Treasure Island on a Saturday afternoon filled \n     with summer storms. I knew I heard the tap, tap, tap of the \n     blind man's stick coming down State Street and I remember the \n     great relief of seeing my mother and father returning from \n     visiting my grandparents in South Ryegate.\n       Miss Holbrook was right. A good and an active imagination \n     creates its own reality.\n       In my profession, I read computer messages, briefing \n     papers, constituent letters, legislation and briefings, the \n     Congressional Record--and an occasional book for pleasure--in \n     all, the equivalent of a full-length book each day.\n       Interesting as all this is, and owing much of my life to \n     those earlier experiences at the library, the truest reading \n     pleasure was then.

Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 30th \nanniversary for two excellent charities in my home State of Kentucky, \nthe Ronald McDonald House Charities. The Ronald McDonald House \nCharities of Kentuckiana in Louisville and the Ronald McDonald House \nCharities of the Bluegrass in Lexington both first opened their doors \nto needy families in 1984.\n  Since then, each house has served more than 25,000 families. In the \nlast\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\nyear alone, more than 1,100 Kentucky families have spent nearly 15,000 \nnights in the two homes operated by these charities. The two homes \noperate thanks to the generosity of Kentucky's McDonalds' owners, a \nbroad swath of Kentucky businesses, countless individual donors, and \nthe hundreds of thousands of hours given by tireless volunteers.\n  For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with the Ronald \nMcDonald House, it serves as a home away from home, at low or no cost, \nfor the families of children who are hospital patients. At a time when \na family is undergoing such a crisis as the illness of a child, infant, \nor newborn, the last thing these families need to worry about is \nfinding housing near the hospital. The Ronald McDonald House eases that \nneed by providing a home away from home for families of children \nreceiving health care at area medical facilities while also lending \nsupport to other organizations that aid children. Today there are 125 \nlocal chapters in 55 countries.\n  The Ronald McDonald House Charities of Kentuckiana first opened in \nLouisville in September 1984. Since their most recent expansion in \n2009, they feature 36 guest rooms, each accommodating up to four \npeople.\n  In 1992, the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Kentuckiana helped \npioneer one of the first Ronald McDonald Family Rooms in the world--a \nsmaller version of a Ronald McDonald House located inside a hospital so \na parent is only steps away from their seriously ill child. Today there \nare Ronald McDonald Family Rooms in three Louisville hospitals.\n  The Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Bluegrass in Lexington \nsimilarly opened their doors in 1984, and have since expanded to 20 \nrooms. In 2005, through a partnership with the University of Kentucky, \nthe Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Bluegrass began the Ronald \nMcDonald Care Mobile to offer eastern Kentucky's children free \nprofessional dental care and education aboard a state-of-the-art mobile \nclinic. Centered in Hazard, KY, the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile cares \nfor underserved children in their own neighborhoods and schools.\n  Together, the Ronald McDonald House Charities of both Kentuckiana and \nthe Bluegrass have accomplished a great deal for the Commonwealth and \nhelped thousands of Kentucky families. Kentucky residents and \nbusinesses are proud to have supported them for 30 years, and I know \nwill continue to do so for many years more. I want to thank the Ronald \nMcDonald House Charities of Kentuckiana and the Bluegrass for serving \nas the home away from home for distressed families with a child in the \nhospital for 30 years. Kentucky is proud of these institutions and the \nmany people behind them who make them work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5122-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JIMMY RUSSELL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend \nand legendary Kentuckian, Wild Turkey Distillery's Master Distiller \nJimmy Russell. This year marks the 60th year Jimmy has been making \nBourbon for Wild Turkey, a fact that the distillery is rightfully proud \nto celebrate. As a 60-year Bourbon veteran, Jimmy is the longest \ntenured active spirits master distiller in the world.\n  Kentucky is, of course, the birthplace of Bourbon. The drink itself \nis named for Bourbon County, KY, in the heart of the Bluegrass State, \nwhere the product first emerged. Kentucky produces 95 percent of the \nworld's Bourbon supply, and Kentucky's iconic Bourbon brands ship more \nthan 30 million gallons of the spirit to 126 countries, making Bourbon \nthe largest export category among all U.S. distilled spirits. Not only \nis Kentucky the overwhelming producer of the world's Bourbon, Bourbon \ngives much back to Kentucky. It is a vital part of the state's tourism \nand economy.\n  Jimmy grew up only 5 miles away from the Wild Turkey Distillery, \nlocated in Lawrenceburg, KY. His passion for Bourbon led him to study \nunder whiskey luminaries, including Bill Hughes, Wild Turkey's second \nmaster distiller; and Ernest W. Ripy, Jr., great-nephew of distillery \nfounder James Ripy and Wild Turkey's third master distiller. Jimmy \nrecalls being taken under Bill's wing and learning everything about the \nbusiness from the ground up. Since becoming master distiller in the \nmid-1960s, he has traveled the world as an unofficial ambassador of \nBourbon, introducing people from as far and wide as Japan and Australia \nto American's native spirit.\n  Over the past 60 years, Jimmy has been responsible for the launches \nof several new Wild Turkey brands and expressions, such as Tradition, \nTribute, 17-year-old Wild Turkey for Japan, Rare Breed, American \nSpirit, Kentucky Spirit and Russell's Reserve, which he cocreated with \nhis son and distilling partner Eddie Russell. Jimmy broke new ground in \n1976 with the first honeyed Bourbon, at the time called Wild Turkey \nLiqueur. The evolution of that product today is known as American \nHoney. Jimmy is also responsible for overseeing the production of Wild \nTurkey 101, the distillery's flagship brand. This fall, Wild Turkey \nreleased a commemorative Diamond Anniversary limited-edition Bourbon \ncreated by Jimmy's son, distilling partner and Bourbon Hall of Famer \nEddie Russell. As for Jimmy himself, he is known to enjoy his Bourbon \nneat or with a touch of branch water.\n  As a legend in the distilled spirits industry, Jimmy is a member of \nthe Kentucky Bourbon Hall of Fame. He is a member of the Whiskey Hall \nof Fame and a whiskey judge for the International Wine and Spirits \nCompetition. He has been honored by the Commonwealth of Kentucky \nGeneral Assembly, been anointed a Kentucky Colonel, and received the \nkey to the city from the mayor of Lawrenceburg.\n  When not hard at work at Wild Turkey, Jimmy spends time with his wife \nJoretta. They have three children, Eddie, Mike, and Kathy, six \ngrandchildren and one great-grandchild. An avid sports fan, Jimmy is a \nlifelong supporter of local Anderson County High School athletic \nprograms for girls and boys.\n  I want to congratulate Jimmy Russell for reaching his 60th \nanniversary of work at Wild Turkey Distillery. His lifetime of \nachievement in the distilled spirits industry is certainly something to \nbe proud of. I know my Senate colleagues join me in commending Jimmy \nfor decades of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5122-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5122-S5123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARCUS ADAMS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to SPC \nMarcus Adams. Adams hails from Magoffin County, KY, and proudly served \nhis country on a tour of duty in Iraq.\n  Adams graduated from Magoffin County High School, and after his \nfreshman year in college he decided to enlist in the U.S. Army. Because \nof the strong military tradition in his family--his father, \ngrandfather, and two uncles all served--he felt it was an easy decision \nto carry on that legacy.\n  After completing his basic training and advanced individual combat \ntraining, Adams was assigned to the 555th Engineer Brigade. In \nSeptember of 2008, he and his brigade were sent to Balad, Iraq, where \nthey would remain for the duration of their yearlong tour of duty.\n  In Iraq, Adams was responsible for all of his brigade's technology. \nManaging the computer networks, servers, and radios were tasks that all \nfell under his purview.\n  Adams is now happily back in his old Kentucky home with his wife \nAsh'leigh and his son Alistair and will soon be joined by his first \ndaughter Hermione.\n  For his honorable service to this country, he is well deserving of \npraise from this body. Therefore, I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues \njoin me in honoring SPC Marcus Adams.\n  The Salyersville Independent recently published an article detailing \nAdams' service in Iraq. I ask unanimous consent that the full article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Salyersville Independent, July 3, 2014]\n\n                      Quick Decision Leads to Iraq\n\n                           (By Heather Oney)\n\n       One ``drop of the hat'' decision took Marcus Adams all the \n     way to Iraq.\n       Adams, a graduate of Magoffin County High School, was 19 \n     years old and had completed one year of college when he came \n     in one afternoon in February 2007 and told his wife, \n     Ash'leigh Nicole Prince Adams, he had joined the Army.\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\n       ``There were no objections,'' Adams laughed. ``She stayed \n     in college at Morehead and I went to basic training.''\n       Adams said given his family's history, with his dad, \n     grandfather and two uncles serving in the military, it was a \n     no-brainer.\n       ``With 9/11, I felt because everyone else in my family had \n     served, I felt the responsibility to at least do a minimum \n     tour,'' Adams said. ``I didn't feel productive in college and \n     the Army could give me steady employment and healthcare.''\n       Adams finished his basic training at Fort Jackson, South \n     Carolina, then his Advanced Individual Training (AIT) at Fort \n     Gordon, Georgia. He was then assigned to the 555th Engineer \n     Brigade, based out of Fort Lewis, Washington.\n       His primary job with the brigade, which he stayed in all \n     through his enlistment, was to be the computer guy, Adams \n     said. He was responsible for the computer networks, servers, \n     radios--any technology--the engineers needed.\n       In September 2008, only seven years after 9/11, Adams and \n     his brigade were sent to Balad, Iraq, where the team would \n     stay a year.\n       ``The War in the Middle East we have been engaged in for \n     the past 10-plus years is open-ended by its very nature,'' \n     Adams said. ``In Vietnam, we had an actual bad guy, in \n     uniform and everything. In Iraq and Afghanistan, when the \n     enemy is terror, who is that? There's no way to define \n     victory.''\n       Despite recent developments in Iraq, Adams said, ``I'm \n     proud of the work we did. Less than 1 percent of U.S. \n     Americans ever serve in any capacity. The importance of \n     serving and the things I got from it turned me into the \n     person I am.''\n       Adams said the majority of the time he remained on base, \n     which was a former Iraqi Army base where temperatures got up \n     to 130 degrees in the day.\n       ``It's hard to express how hot that is,'' Adams remembered.\n       He had one mission off-base, where he said he saw how big \n     the gap was between the poor and the rich in Iraq.\n       ``Here, the poorest people get food stamps and aid,'' Adams \n     said. ``I've seen Iraqi men walking around bare naked, \n     picking up garbage, and the guys working with us are wearing \n     suits and eating lobster. We saw people working at a dump in \n     a junk-yard, building shelters out of it.''\n       While their truck was armored with additional plates, he \n     said a man threw a Russian RKG-3 anti-tank grenade between \n     the truck and the plate, causing damage to the truck, but no \n     one was hurt.\n       At one point Adams and a few other men received four-day \n     passes and they went to Doha, Qatar, to unwind. Located on \n     the Persian Gulf, Qatar is more of a tourist country, with \n     only 30 percent of the people in the country at any given \n     time actually being residents. Since they were there during \n     Ramadan, when it is illegal to be caught eating or drinking \n     during the daylight hours, Adams said they had to be careful \n     to stay hydrated. They would pull the curtains on the bus \n     they were traveling on and drank anyway in order to not \n     dehydrate in the well over 100-degree temperatures.\n       In September 2009, he came back to the states, getting to \n     travel all around the country. He worked in Fort Irwin, \n     California, twice, Fort Campbell, Kentucky and Yakima \n     Training Center, Washington.\n       The hardest part, he said, was reintegrating with his wife.\n       ``It's weird when you leave that long when you've been the \n     head of the household,'' Adams said. ``You have to leave and \n     hand it all over to her--the bills and all the decisions--and \n     when you come back, you try to come back in the same role, \n     but she's like, I've got this.''\n       Adams said for the first month back, all the soldiers had \n     to report for a daily briefing set up to help them with the \n     reintegration process, but he saw many dealing with \n     infidelity issues when they returned, as well as Post-\n     Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n       ``People can get really messed up and they used to just \n     tell us, Suck it up and deal with it,' but I think they are \n     seeing now that's not the best policy.''\n       Thankfully, for him, he said they never had to deal with \n     either issue.\n       He could have gone to Afghanistan for another tour, \n     however, his contract would have had to be extended past the \n     usual six years. Since he was now the father of one, he took \n     the Army's offer for an early honorable discharge, leaving \n     three months early to be with his son. He was ranked as a \n     Specialist, under the E4 pay grade.\n       Marcus and Ash'leigh Adams have one son, Alistair Dean \n     Adams, who is three years old, and one daughter on the way \n     (at press time), Hermione Sue Adams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5123-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5123-S5124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CYPRUS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in 1974, 40 years ago this month, Turkish \ntroops invaded the Republic of Cyprus. By August they had taken control \nof more than one-third of the island. Turkey's invasion had immediate \nconsequences, such as the confiscation of property and the displacement \nof Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike.\n  The invasion has also had more enduring consequences--consequences \nthat are still felt today. The so-called green line, a demilitarized \nUnited Nations buffer zone, still cuts a jagged path across the island, \ndividing one part of the country from the other. It even bisects the \ncapital city of Nicosia. In 1983, Turkish Cypriots declared a separate \ncountry in the northern third of Cyprus--a country recognized to this \nday by Turkey alone.\n  Vice President Joe Biden visited Cyprus in May, and he spoke of being \ncalled the White House optimist for his belief that the best days are \nyet to come. Well, by that standard, my colleagues here must think me \nthe Senate optimist. But I really do believe that the future is bright \nfor Cyprus and that most Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots want to \nput aside decades of division and move forward together.\n  I was pleased to read that leaders issued a joint declaration in \nFebruary calling the status quo ``unacceptable'', and I am encouraged \nby the resumption of high-level negotiations on a comprehensive \nsettlement. I think the United States, with its deep ties to Cyprus and \nTurkey, can play a productive role in facilitating these discussions. I \nalso urge the Government of Turkey to step up and be a constructive \npartner throughout this process.\n  It has been my experience that intractable problems rarely have \nsimple or easy solutions, so I am not under any illusions about this. \nBut I have seen what folks can accomplish when they set ideology aside, \nand I remain a believer in a just settlement that brings an end to 40 \nyears of division and reunites Cyprus.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, in my capacity as chairman of the Helsinki \nCommission, I wish to draw attention to the fact that July 20 marked \nthe 40th anniversary of the invasion of Cyprus by a Turkish army. \nSadly, this year also marks more than 50 years since a power-sharing \narrangement between the two communities on Cyprus collapsed following \nindependence from Britain. As the situation in the eastern \nMediterranean and the wider Middle East is becoming more volatile and \nfragile, it is time to end the forcible division of Cyprus, which has \nendured for far too long.\n  The continued presence of Turkish troops in the northern part of \nCyprus exacerbates a number of human rights concerns including property \nrestitution, restrictions on freedom of worship, and damage to \nreligious and archeological sites. I have consistently raised these \nconcerns and want to emphasize that all religious sites in the north \nmust be protected.\n  It is gratifying that the Government of Cyprus remains fully \ncommitted to the U.N.-sponsored process to reach a sustainable and \nenduring settlement that would reunify Cyprus based on a bizonal, \nbicommunal federation in accordance with relevant U.N. Security Council \nresolutions.\n  The joint statement agreed to by Greek Cypriot President Anastasiades \nand Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu on the island in February of \nthis year lays a solid foundation for results-oriented talks. The basic \nparameters for a solution laid out in the statement should be fully \nrespected.\n  I applaud the efforts of both leaders to move this process forward. \nFollowing the signing of the joint statement in February, President \nAnastasiades called the chance for peace a ``win-win situation.'' ``I \nbelieve that a solution that would be accepted by the Greek Cypriots \nwould create stability in the region. Greater cooperation with Turkish \nCypriots will contribute to foster growth . . . to do that you have to \nhave a settlement that is not at the expense of one community or to the \nbenefit of the other,'' he said.\n  After meeting in April with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \nTurkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu said that during negotiations with \nGreek Cypriot President Anastasiades, ``we'll try to bridge our \ndifferences and find a comprehensive settlement in the shortest \npossible time.'' ``We can finalize a settlement and take it to a \nseparate simultaneous referenda in 2014.''\n  Many observers believe the discovery of vast offshore oil and natural \ngas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean could be a game changer in \npressing negotiations forward and could potentially also act as a \nstabilizing and unifying factor in the eastern Mediterranean. The \ncheapest and most expeditious way of exporting the reserves, discovered \nfirst by Israel and then by Cyprus, would be through an underwater \npipeline to Turkey. I certainly\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\nhope this potential for economic empowerment for all of the people of \nCyprus will help both communities to visualize and then implement a \nfinal settlement.\n  In keeping with the numerous U.N. resolutions on Cyprus and the \nprinciples enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act, it is time for Turkey \nto remove its troops from the island. The people of Cyprus cannot wait \nanother 40 years for reconciliation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5124-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MONHEGAN, MAINE QUADRICENTENNIAL\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in 1614, 6 years before the Pilgrims \nlanded at Plymouth, Captain John Smith--explorer, soldier, navigator, \nand adventurer--landed at Monhegan Island off the coast of Maine. I \nwish to commemorate the 400th anniversary of that discovery and to \ncongratulate the people of a truly remarkable community as they \ncelebrate their quadricentennial.\n  In the very first sentence of his remarkable journal of that voyage, \nCaptain Smith names the ``Isle of Monhegan,'' the Wabanaki Indian word \nfor ``island of the ocean.'' In reference to the shared latitude with \nhis home country, he coined the term ``New England.''\n  As the Wabanaki had known for centuries, the fish were plentiful. In \naddition, Captain Smith used the stands of timber to make small boats \nto explore the inlets and rivers on the mainland coast. So, Monhegan \ncan rightly claim to be the birthplace of three industries that built \nthe State of Maine--fishing, boatbuilding, and logging.\n  Certainly, there were disappointments. The whales proved elusive, and \nthe gold Captain Smith sought was nonexistent. But the potential was \neverywhere.\n  In addressing the question of what it would take to settle the \nuntamed region, the captain's log contains these lines that define \nMonhegan today. It would take, Captain Smith wrote, ``the best parts of \nart, judgment, courage, honesty, constancy, diligence, and industry.''\n  Maine's island communities are an essential part of our State's \nidentity. They survive and thrive because of the qualities Captain \nSmith so wonderfully described.\n  The island's lobster industry is a shining example. More than 90 \nyears ago, long before conservation was a watchword, Monhegan's \nlobstermen voluntarily established their own ban on harvesting small \nlobsters. To the list of Monhegan's firsts--fishing, boatbuilding, and \nlogging--we can add lobster management.\n  By mutual agreement, rather than government edict, Monhegan \nlobstermen set trap limits to prevent overfishing. They established \ntheir own management zone to ensure that this generations-old fishery \nwill sustain the generations to come. Most remarkable of all is the \ntradition of Trap Day, now October 1, when all boats, captains, and \ncrews wait for each other and head to their fishing grounds together at \nthe crack of dawn. The ethic that ``no one goes until everyone goes'' \nis the very definition of community.\n  For more than a century, Monhegan also has been a magnet for artists. \nIn 1902, Samuel Triscott became the first artist to live there year-\nround, and he found the subject matter enticing enough to stay the rest \nof his life, nearly one-quarter century. From Rockwell Kent to Andrew \nand Jamie Wyeth, this singular place has inspired some of the best \nartists to create their greatest work.\n  There is no question that the magnificent scenery is part of the \nattraction. But as we look at the powerful works of art the island has \ninspired, it is clear that the people of Monhegan, their judgment, \ncourage, honesty, constancy, diligence, and industry, enhance the \nnatural beauty of the island so that it represents something more \nprofound than crashing surf on rocky shores.\n  Captain Smith concluded his journal of that voyage four centuries ago \nwith these words: ``We are not born for ourselves, but each to help the \nother. Let us imitate the virtues of our predecessors to be worthily \ntheir successors.'' Those words are fitting for a celebration of the \npast that looks with confidence to the future, and I congratulate the \npeople of Monhegan, Maine, on this landmark anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5124-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5124-S5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CAMPOBELLO INTERNATIONAL PARK\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I wish to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of Roosevelt Campobello International Park. This beautiful \nand historic park preserves the summer home that Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt enjoyed both as a boy and as president. It was established by \ntreaty between the United States and Canada and is the only memorial to \nan American president on Canadian soil.\n  The 2,800-acre park on Campobello Island, New Brunswick, was opened \non August 20, 1964, by Canadian Prime Minister Lester Pearson and \nAmerican President Lyndon Johnson. It is jointly owned and managed by \nboth countries and is a beautiful and historic testament to a legacy of \nfriendship. Like all true friendships, the friendship commemorated at \nRoosevelt Campobello International Park is based not upon expedience or \nself-interest, but upon shared values.\n  It is a legacy of friendship between two men: one of America's \ngreatest presidents and one of Canada's greatest prime ministers. \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt and Mackenzie King could not have been more \ndissimilar in personality--one gregarious and outgoing, the other \nreticent and intensely private--yet they saw beyond the superficial \ntraits and into the depths of character. Together, they led their \nnations out of the Great Depression. Together, they led their nations \nthrough the Second World War and made North America the arsenal of \ndemocracy so crucial to victory. Although only one lived to see the \npeace, together they forged an alliance that has allowed that peace to \nendure.\n  It is a legacy of friendship between two communities. By land, \nCampobello Island is accessible only from Lubec, ME, our Nation's \neasternmost town, via the FDR Memorial Bridge, itself a stunning \nexample of international cooperation and friendship. The people of \neastern Maine and western New Brunswick share a past, a present, and \nthe future. They are bound together by a rugged yet rewarding way of \nlife, by personal and family ties, by commerce and by mutual \nassistance. They earn their livelihoods from the land and from the sea, \nand they care for this special place so that those livelihoods may \ncontinue for generations to come.\n  It was at Campobello, his ``beloved island,'' that young Franklin \nRoosevelt learned to guide a sailboat through the challenging Lubec \nNarrows and developed the inner strength and self-reliance that enabled \nhim to meet any challenge. Among the proud and determined people on \nboth shores of the narrows, he felt the power of committed individuals \nworking together in common cause.\n  In 1933, during his first return visit as President, with First Lady \nEleanor at his side, FDR recalled his happy childhood memories and \nagain thanked the islanders who taught him to sail. Then, in words that \nstill ring true today, he described the region as, ``The finest example \nof friendship between Nations--permanent friendship between nations--\nthat we can possibly have.''\n  The United States and Canada share the world's longest undefended \nborder, a common history and culture. In trade, we are each other's \nbest customers. We are, as one of the park's permanent exhibits \ndeclares, ``Good Neighbours--Best Friends.''\n  George Washington wrote that, ``True friendship is a plant of slow \ngrowth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity.'' The \nfriendship between the United States and Canada is the hardiest of \nplants with the deepest of roots. The adversities are but minor shocks; \nthey are no match for the values of freedom, human rights and the rule \nof law that bind us together.\n  Those values are the foundation of this legacy, and they are our \nguarantee that this friendship will endure. They are what make the 50th \nanniversary of Roosevelt Campobello International Park an event so \nworthy of celebration.\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5125-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to honor the U.S. Marshals \nService on the occasion of the 225th anniversary of its founding. Since \nits establishment in 1789, the Marshals Service has distinguished \nitself as not only the oldest, but one of the most effective law \nenforcement agencies in the United States. In recent years, the \nMarshals Service has demonstrated its versatility through Operation \nFALCON, a nationwide fugitive apprehension initiative. In this program, \nresources of Federal, State, city, and county law enforcement agencies \nare combined to locate and apprehend criminals wanted for crimes of \nviolence. Since its inception in 2005, Operation FALCON has made 91,086 \narrests and cleared 117,874 warrants and is the single most successful \ninitiative aimed at apprehending violent fugitives in U.S. law \nenforcement history. Congratulations to the Marshals Service on 225 \nyears of service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5125-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          McDONALD NOMINATION\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my office continues to receive an \ninordinate number of complaints about persistent problems with the \ndelivery of health care services and other benefits by the Department \nof Veterans Affairs to those who have served in our Armed Forces. This \nis very troubling to me.\n  Evidence of serious and systemic mismanagement and negligence within \nthe Department led to the resignation of a former Secretary of the \nDepartment and a call for a thorough assessment of how to better serve \nour veterans. We should take very seriously our responsibility to those \nwho have served in our military. Robert McDonald, the next Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, will face many challenges to improve the VA system. \nHe will have the support of many of us in Congress as he assumes this \nimportant position.\n  I have recommended on several occasions continued, vigorous oversight \nby the Department of Veterans Affairs during the implementation of a \ncorrective action plan at the G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery VA Medical \nCenter in Jackson, MS. Reports from VA patients, their families and VA \nhospital officials in Mississippi have served to guide corrections and \nimprovements at the facility.\n  I support measures to correct the VA's problems and improve the \nquality of, and access to, care for veterans. I am hopeful that the \npending VA reform legislation and the confirmation of a new Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs will be reassuring steps toward enhancing the \ndelivery of health care services to our veterans.\n  We can and should do better for those who have devoted themselves to \nserving our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5125-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING ADMIRAL CHARLES R. LARSON\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to an \nexceptional leader, public servant, patriot, and friend. Earlier this \nweek, ADM Charles Larson passed away after a 2-year battle against \nleukemia. This morning, we said goodbye to him as he was memorialized \nand laid to rest at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis. \nAlthough it is always hard to lose a friend, and it is certainly proper \nto mourn, I also want to celebrate his life and his tremendous \naccomplishments and contributions to the Navy, Naval Academy, and \nNation.\n  Chuck and I were good friends, flight school roommates, and both \nmembers of the Class of 1958. An Eagle Scout, brigade commander and \nclass president, he continued his meteoric trajectory, becoming the \nfirst naval officer selected as a White House Fellow and the second \nyoungest officer to be promoted to the flag rank. On top of his \noperational commands, he also served as naval aide to President Richard \nNixon. Chuck was bright, extremely talented, and never shied away from \na challenge. For instance, after earning his pilot wings and doing a \ntour aboard the USS Shangri-la, he decided to go to nuclear power \nschool to become a submariner and be at the tactical tip of the Cold \nWar. Similarly, instead of pursuing a lucrative civilian job after \nfinishing his tour as the commander in chief, U.S. Pacific Command, he \ntook on what he considered his most challenging but rewarding job of \nhis career, returning to his alma mater for a second tour as the \nsuperintendent.\n  A man of unparalleled character and vision, Admiral Larson wanted to \nrefocus the academy to be ``an ethical beacon for the nation.'' He \nestablished the Character Development Division and implemented \ninnovative ethical and character-enhancing programs and initiatives to \nboth the curriculum and student life. His devotion to the academy and \nmidshipmen went beyond his two tenures at the helm, serving as the \nchairman of the U.S. Naval Academy Foundation for nearly a decade after \nhis retirement.\n  Chuck was more than a renowned four-star admiral; he was a friend to \nmany, husband to Sally, father to Sigrid, Erica, and Kirsten, and \ngrandfather to seven beautiful children. I join many past and present \nmembers of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Class of 1958, the \nNaval Academy family, and thousands of military personnel who have \nserved under and alongside Chuck in extending our most sincere \ngratitude for his legacy of excellence and ethical leadership.\n  Fair winds and following seas, Admiral Larson. You will be missed, \nbut not forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5125-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5125-S5126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation that the \nSenate has passed H.R. 4028, a bipartisan bill Representatives Grace \nMeng and Doug Collins introduced that amends the International \nReligious Freedom Act of 1998 to include the desecration of cemeteries \namong the many forms of violations of the right to religious freedom. \nLast month, Senator Risch and I introduced a Senate companion bill, S. \n2466, to H.R. 4028.\n  In 1998, Congress passed the International Religious Freedom Act to \naffirm America's commitment to religious freedom, enshrined both in the \nU.S. Constitution and in numerous international human rights \ninstruments. The act acknowledges the pressure and persecution that \nmany people around the world face because of their religious beliefs \nand requires the Department of State to issue an annual report on \ninternational religious freedom.\n  Freedom of religion requires respect for those practicing their faith \nalone as well as in community with others. It also requires protection \nfor those who identify as members of a religious community, for the \nsymbols of the community, for the houses of worship, and for other \ninstitutions of the community. The defacing or destruction of a \ncemetery based on an affiliation with a particular religious or \nspiritual group should not be tolerated by governments and must factor \ninto our international religious freedom reporting. This bill, H.R. \n4028, will ensure inclusion of these acts in the annual State \nDepartment reports and will better aid those of us working to monitor \nand combat anti-Semitism and other religious discrimination.\n  There is no question that we need to report on these crimes. In \nrecent years, we have witnessed with growing concern a number of cases \ninvolving the desecration of Jewish cemeteries in the Netherlands, \nHungary, Russia, Poland, France, Germany, Georgia, Moldova, and \nArgentina. This legislation is even more important and timely given the \nrise in anti-Semitism across Europe. In just the past few weeks, large-\nscale anti-Semitic protests have taken place in major cities across \nEurope. In this year's European Union elections, extremist parties \nespousing anti-Semitic platforms have made alarming progress. And in \nHungary and Greece, extremist parliamentary parties associated with \nstreet militias have been successful in elections.\n  I have served on the Helsinki Commission for nearly 20 years. During \nmy tenure, I have worked tirelessly to combat anti-Semitism and \nreligious discrimination. Ensuring that religiously motivated cemetery \ndesecration is reported is the first important step to combating this \nserious crime.\n  I thank Senator Risch for his leadership on this issue. I also thank \nSenators Menendez and Corker for taking up H.R. 4028 and moving it \nquickly through the Senate Foreign Relations\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\nCommittee. Finally, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nsupporting this bill and for helping to recognize the desecration of \ncemeteries as a violation of the right to religious freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5126-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING JEFFREY B. WESTERFIELD\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize and honor the \nextraordinary service and ultimate sacrifice of Gary, IN police \ndepartment officer Jeffrey B. Westerfield. Dedicated, loyal, and above \nall compassionate to those in need, Officer Westerfield served with the \nGary Police Department, GPD, for 19 years.\n  On Sunday, July 6, 2014, Officer Westerfield was found shot and \nunresponsive in his patrol car. Sadly, despite the best efforts of his \nfellow officers, EMTs, and medical personnel, Officer Westerfield, 47, \nsuccumbed to his wounds.\n  A native of Owensboro, KY, Officer Westerfield joined the U.S. Army \nat the age of 18. Jeffrey was stationed in Georgia for basic training, \nwhere he earned the nickname ``Rambo'' after sustaining a leg injury \nand surviving alone in the wilderness for 2 days during a training \nmaneuver.\n  After being honorably discharged from the U.S. Army, Jeffrey began \nhis career in law enforcement. In August 1995, Jeffrey fulfilled his \ndream when he was sworn in as an officer with the Gary Police \nDepartment. Officer Westerfield served in various capacities during his \ncareer with the GPD, including with the patrol division, traffic \ndivision, K-9 handler, and as a field training officer.\n  Known for his quiet demeanor, Officer Westerfield was a man of few \nwords and genuine in his actions. ``He was very soft-spoken. He was \nlike a huge teddy bear. [H]e was able to actually go to any situation, \nand calm the situation down immediately, just by his presence and his \nvoice,'' said Gary deputy police chief Gary McKinley.\n  Officer Westerfield is survived and deeply missed by his fiancee \nDenise Cather, and his five children: Allie, Katie, Cheyenne, Rachel \nand Brady.\n  Officer Westerfield loved his work, and he gave his life to serve and \nprotect the citizens of Gary. He was a quintessential Hoosier and a \ntrue American hero. Let us always remember and treasure the memory of \nthis stalwart, brave man and honor him for his selfless commitment to \nserving his fellow citizens. My thoughts and prayers, along with those \nof fellow Hoosiers, are with Jeff's family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5126-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Benjamin Prange\n\n  Ms. FISCHER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and \nsacrifice of U.S. Army SSG Benjamin G. Prange, who was killed in action \non July 24 while serving in Kandahar Province in Afghanistan. Staff \nSergeant Prange ``Ben'' to his friends and family--was a soldier in the \n4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, CO. He repeatedly answered the \ncall to deploy, serving three tours in Afghanistan in 6 years.\n  Ben was born and raised in rural Nebraska south of Lincoln, near \nHickman and Roca. He was no stranger to adversity early in life, \novercoming the deaths of both of his parents before he turned 16. He \nwas raised by his grandparents, Kent and Carolyn Prange, who live just \nwest of Roca, NE.\n  Ben attended Norris High School, where he met his future wife \nElizabeth. Ben is remembered as a ``good, solid kid'' by his high \nschool superintendent Roy Baker. Liz and Ben married a year after his \ngraduation. They would have celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary \non July 26. He enlisted in the Army in January 2007 to fulfill a dream \nof becoming an infantryman. Liz is left to care for their two sons, \nCorbin and Dillon, who I hope will understand in time the tremendous \ndebt of gratitude this Nation owes to their father for selfless \nsacrifice to protect all that we hold dear.\n  Ben served our country with distinction. He was a four time recipient \nof the Army Commendation Medal and a recipient of the Combat \nInfantryman Badge for service under direct enemy fire. He was also \nawarded an Army Achievement Medal, two Good Conduct Medals, a National \nDefense Service Medal, a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, an \nOverseas Service Ribbon, and two NATO Medals, in addition to his \nAfghanistan Campaign Medal with three campaign stars for his tours of \nduty.\n  My thoughts and prayers remain with his family, friends, and his \nfellow soldiers who have lost a great father, soldier, and friend. His \nsacrifice will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5126-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             VICTIMS OF CHILD ABUSE ACT REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I wish to speak on S. 1799, the Victims of \nChild Abuse Act Reauthorization Act of 2013, which recently passed the \nHouse of Representatives and is awaiting the President's signature. In \naddition to the bill's support for Child Advocacy Centers, it contains \nan important provision that bears mentioning. S. 1799 makes Congress' \nintent clear that money from the Crime Victims Fund should only be used \nto assist victims of crime. Since the funds for the Crime Victims Fund \nare derived from fines collected from those convicted of Federal crimes \nrather than tax revenue, Congress directed the funds to only be used \nfor crime victims. I offered the provision clarifying this intent as an \namendment to the Justice For All Act, and it was accepted unanimously \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am pleased the sponsors of S. 1799 \nagreed to include it at my request.\n  Crime victims can face a confusing and sometimes overwhelming system, \nand so it is important for someone to explain their rights and address \nother victim-centered issues. Encumbering victim advocates with other \nnon-victim-related tasks could delay or prevent the resources needed to \nmeet victims' needs such as assisting victims with impact statements \nand collecting restitution information and associated receipts. It \ncould also delay or prevent ongoing safety assessments for the victim. \nVictim specialists, also referred to as victim advocates, along with \ntheir supervisors, victim witness coordinators, should be improving \nservices for the benefit of crime victims and not tasked with other \nduties, such as arranging travel for witnesses.\n  My amendment makes clear it is Congress' intent that the funds \nauthorized for victims services are limited to those dedicated to \nvictims services and their direct support staff. This will ensure that \nthat none of the funds available is used for purposes that do not \nbenefit crime victims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5126-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5126-S5127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    CONGRATULATING PATRICIA ZULKOSKY\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Patricia \nZulkosky for her outstanding years of service to the State of Alaska \nand congratulate her on the occasion of her retirement from the \nDepartment of Juvenile Justice.\n  Born into and raised by a large Polish family in northern Minnesota, \nPatricia moved to Alaska in 1978, making her home in the western tundra \ncommunity of Bethel. After quickly falling in love with the Yup'ik \nEskimo and rural Alaska lifestyle, she took to subsistence fishing and \ngathering. Patricia built lifelong friendships in Alaska. After 6 \nyears, she began her family by welcoming the arrival of her first and \nonly daughter, Tiffany.\n  Patricia started working for the State of Alaska in 1985 as a clerk \ntypist for Alaska Public Health Nursing, but it wasn't until Patricia \nwas hired by the Department of Juvenile Justice in December 1988 that \nshe would come to know her passion for working with troubled youth and \nthe families of rural Alaska. Hired as a youth counselor, Patricia's \nwork ethic, commitment, and enthusiasm would quickly help her move up \nin the ranks. Not letting life get in the way, Patricia pursued her \nbachelor's degree in social work while being a single mom of a young \ndaughter and working several other jobs to make ends meet.\n  After graduating in 1996, she returned to Alaska fulltime where she \nwould hold supervisory positions before becoming the Bethel Youth \nFacility superintendent. Under her leadership as superintendent, the \nBethel Youth Facility has become an exemplary facility in Alaska for \nutilizing subsistence\n\n[[Page S5127]]\n\nways of life as a form of treatment. They have successfully hosted a \ncommunity-based Cultural Heritage Week and begun to undergo a long-\nplanned expansion. Patricia's love of community, culture, and hard work \nhas resulted in a public service career that exemplifies the Alaska and \nAmerican dream.\n  I would like to extend my deepest appreciation to Patricia for her \nmany years of service to the people she has come to call family. I wish \nthe absolute best for her and her family as they begin this next stage \nin their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5127-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING MINNESOTA POLICE OFFICERS\n\n Mr. FRANKEN.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Commander \nJohn W. Stroud from Hawthorne, NV, on being named the National \nCommander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States for \n2015. I am proud to honor a Nevadan who has dedicated his life to \nserving our country and is committed to ensuring that our Nation's \nheroes receive the care that they deserve.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I recognize \nthe important role the Veterans of Foreign Wars plays for combat \nveterans and military servicemembers from the Active, Guard, and \nReserve forces. This distinguished national group of veterans has been \na constant influence, furthering the voice of all of our Nation's \nheroes. On July 23, 2014, at the 115th National Convention, John Stroud \nwas elected as VFW national commander. This is the second time in VFW \nhistory that a Nevadan has been elected commander. John has served the \nVFW in many leadership positions, and I have no doubt that he will work \ntirelessly in his new position as commander towards the VFW's mission \nto ensure that veterans are respected for their service, always receive \ntheir earned entitlements, and are recognized for the sacrifices they \nand their loved ones have made on behalf of this great country.\n  Graduating from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University with a bchelor \nof science degree in professional aeronautics, Commander Stroud decided \nto serve his Nation by joining the U.S. Air Force, where he went on to \nenjoy a distinguished career. Upon joining the Air Force, he was sent \noverseas for a tour in Korea with the 51st Fighter Wing at Osan Air \nBase as a flight operations superintendent. For his service, he was \nawarded four Meritorious Service Medals, three Air Force Commendation \nMedals, three Air Force Achievement Medals, the Korea Defense Service \nMedal, and the National Defense Service Medal. Commander Stroud's \naccomplishments extend far beyond his numerous commendations; he has \nalso been recognized for his service to the community. He dedicates \nmuch of his time as a member of many volunteer organizations, like the \nAmerican Legion and the Elks, and is a Life Member of the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, the Military Order of the Cootie, and the VFW \nNational Home for Children.\n  I want to extend my deepest gratitude to Commander Stroud for his \ncourageous contributions to the United States of America and to \nfreedom-loving nations around the world. His service to his country and \nhis bravery and dedication earn him a place among the outstanding men \nand women who have valiantly defended our Nation. As a member of the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize that Congress has a \nresponsibility not only to honor these brave individuals who serve our \nNation but also to ensure they are cared for when they return home. I \nremain committed to upholding this promise for our veterans and \nservicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation.\n  I am both humbled and honored by Commander Stroud's service and am \nproud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing Commander Stroud for all of his accomplishments and \nwish him well in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5127-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING EDIE JOHNSTON AND ELDERTIDE LLC\n\n Mr. KING.

Located in Dresden, ME, \nEldertide harvests and produces elderberries for medicinal purposes. \nAlong with Eldertides sister company, Maine Medicinals, the business \ncreates various herbal supplements with the elderberry product. Fueled \nby the belief that natural, native elderberries are nutritionally \nvaluable, Eldertide has successfully marketed and sold their Maine-made \nsupplements nationwide and around the world.\n  With just two employees and 6 years of business experience, the \ncompany is expanding vastly. Their antioxidant-rich elderberry juice \nconcentrate is now being distributed nationally and internationally. \nMaine Medicinals, which serves as the retail branch of the company, \nrecently reached an agreement with Whole Foods to sell their \nsupplements.\n  Eldertide and Maine Medicinals not only represent a successful \nentrepreneurial spirit, but they also strive to impact Maine, the \nUnited States, and the world with an emphasis on innovation and \neducation. The company has contributed to two university research \ninitiatives through the University of Southern Maine and the University \nof Maine-Orono and has also engaged Kennebec Valley Community College \nstudents in valuable research to examine the health effects of \nphytochemicals from whole foods such as elderberries. Specifically, \nthis research has examined the impact of elderberry juice on chronic \ndiseases such as type 2 diabetes.\n  In addition, Mrs. Johnston founded the Elderberry School, an \ninstitution where family farmers interested in the science and business \nof herbal supplements can learn the process that has propelled \nEldertide to where it is today.

He was born in Chamberlain, SD in 1928 \nto Morris and Ione Reynolds. He grew up during the Second World War, a \ntime--\n\n[[Page S5128]]\n\nas we sometimes forget--of tremendous sacrifice for our entire Nation. \nHe observed that this experience shaped his entire life.\n  He graduated from Chamberlain High School in 1946 and subsequently \nmoved to Colorado, where he attended the University of Denver. In 1950, \nthe year after his graduation, North Korean forces invaded South Korea. \nWithin 24 hours of hearing the news, Marc went to the Air Force \nrecruitment office in downtown Denver and signed up for the aviation \ncadet program. He trained at Perrin and Vance Air Force bases and \ngraduated from pilot training as a second lieutenant. He subsequently \nattended jet interceptor training at Moody and Tyndall Air Force bases.\n  All of General Reynolds' moving and training was part of the American \nDefense Command's initiative to build forces in response to the ever-\ngrowing threat of tyranny and oppression from the Soviet Union. In \n1952, he was assigned to the 83rd Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and \nHamilton Air Force Base and moved with the squadron to Paine Air Force \nBase.\n  In 1953, near the end of the Korean war, he was transferred to \nOkinawa, where he flew F-94Bs on fighter-interceptor missions. After \nthe war was over, he was assigned to the 437th Fighter-Interceptor \nSquadron as the tactical flight commander out of Otis Air Force Base. \nHe later became a maintenance officer with the 602nd Consolidated \nMaintenance Squadron, also at Otis.\n  General Reynolds then transitioned to reconnaissance, joining the \n19th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron in Europe as flight commander. He \nserved at various posts around the world and completed Air Command and \nStaff College in 1966.\n  During this time, war was being waged in Indochina and a proxy war \nbetween the United States and the Soviet and Chinese Communist regimes \nwas beginning to form. General Reynolds was assigned to the 460th \nTactical Reconnaissance Wing at Tan Son Nhut Air Base near Saigon in \nSouth Vietnam. He arrived on December 7, 1966. In reference to the \nanniversary of Pearl Harbor, he occasionally joked that it was ``a good \nday to go to war.''\n  General Reynolds' achievements and endurance during this time are \nremarkable. Throughout his 10-month deployment to Vietnam, he flew 230 \ncombat missions--a majority being flown at night. He also flew many \nmissions over North Vietnam, which was heavily defended by Viet Cong \nradar, antiaircraft guns, and surface-to-air missiles. Flying 10 of \nthese missions up north would merit month off of the year-long \ndeployment.\n  In an interview with KUED, he recalled his first mission in Vietnam:\n  I had one of these ten-mile squares that was probably 80 or 90 miles \nsouth of Saigon, so it was deep down in the south. It's flat down there \nwith no mountains, so they put the starter guys down there, where they \nwon't run into a mountain. I had an experienced navigator, but it was \nmy first mission. We went down there, and we found the target area. We \nstarted running up and down these preplanned lines, and I noticed on \nthe third line what I'd call--well, I'd seen a little bit of flak in my \nlife, but this was obviously a .50 caliber or 20 millimeter gun. I'd \nsee these tracers go over my head. So I did . . . three of these lines, \nand of course, the back-seater's got his head buried in the scope, and \nhe's concentrating seriously on keeping the airplane in the right place \nin the target area. When I got the end of a line, I came around and I \nsaid, ``Hey, why don't you pull your head out of the scope a minute and \ntake a look at what's going on up here.'' And he used immediately, a \nlong series of four letter words to describe how he felt about what was \ngoing on, but the last thing he said is like, ``Get outta here.'' I \nsaid, ``Well, he's been here longer than I have,'' so we went back to \nSaigon, and we talked about it. But that was my first mission.\n  He subsequently served in Japan as a deputy chief of the \nReconnaissance Division and then as a commander of the 16th Tactical \nReconnaissance Squadron. Upon his return to the United States in \nFebruary 1971, he was assigned to Shaw Air Force Base, where he served \nas assistant deputy commander for operations in the 363rd Tactical \nReconnaissance Wing. He graduated from the Naval War College in August \n1973 and was subsequently assigned to Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill \nAir Force Base, initially as the director of distribution and later as \ndirector of maintenance.\n  In July 1976 he transferred to McClellan Air Force Base, CA, as \ndirector of materiel management, Sacramento Air Logistics Center. In \nMarch 1978 he became the center's vice commander. General Reynolds \nmoved to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in May 1980 as vice commander \nof the Air Force Acquisition Logistics Division and took command of the \ndivision in October 1981. In July 1983 he was appointed commander of \nOgden Air Logistics Center. General Reynolds subsequently received his \nthird star and was assigned as the vice commander of the Air Force \nLogistics Command at Wright-Patterson, where he served until his \nretirement.\n  General Reynolds logged over 5,200 (with 475 combat) flying hours in \nhis career--most of which were spent in physically-taxing small fighter \nand reconnaissance jets. His military decorations and awards include \nthe Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying \nCross, Meritorious Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Air Medal with \n15 oak leaf clusters and Air Force Commendation Medal with two oak leaf \nclusters.\n  In this storied 36-year career, General Reynolds lived all over the \nworld, but, according to those who knew him, one of his favorite places \non earth was the Hill Aerospace Museum near Ogden, UT. After he retired \nfrom the Air Force, he became a member of the Utah Aerospace Heritage \nFoundation board, on which he served for 26 years. He was a driving \nforce behind making the Hill Aerospace Museum one of the premier \naviation museums in the country. He was appointed chairman of the board \nand served in that position for more than 20 years. General Reynolds' \nwork in preserving Air Force history was awe-inspiring and will \npositively affect many generations to come.\n  Those who worked with General Reynolds describe his conduct and \ncharacter as that of a perfect gentleman. His smile was infectious and \nhe always treated those around him with tremendous respect and dignity. \nI have been told that he lifted everyone around him and was committed \nto excellence in all that he did.\n  I offer my deepest sympathies to his dear wife Ellie and to his \nchildren: Pam, Barbara, Scott, Lisa, Kristan, and Karine, and to his 15 \ngrandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. I was told that the date on \nwhich he passed turned out to be a bit ironic. This great patriot-\nstatesman had a weakness, which I am sure many of us share, in that he \nhad trouble remembering his and Ellie's anniversary date. However, in \nwhat seems to be coincidence, may have been an act of providence: Marc \nwas able to show his love on this last mortal anniversary by his \ndetermination to hold on just one-half hour into the day of their 30th \nanniversary before passing. Whatever the case may be, the timing offers \na sweet thought.\n  I praise Lieutenant General Reynolds' life as an example to all \nAmericans. I pray that we constantly remember those who serve, who have \nserved, and who have given all that we might maintain our rights and \nenjoy the blessings of liberty. As citizens of a nation made great by \nthose who serve her, like Lieutenant General Reynolds, it is our duty \nto honor those who have gone before by living our lives with excellence \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5128-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5128-S5129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING rosieMADE LLC\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, it is imperative to distinguish the \noriginality of women-owned small business owners who take a leap of \nfaith and invest in an idea that not only awards their own creativity \nbut also inspires other women throughout the Nation. Across the United \nStates, women-owned companies employ 7.9 million people, generate $1.4 \ntrillion in sales, and are the fastest growing segment in our economy. \nToday, I am proud to recognize rosieMADE of Meridian, ID, a women-owned \nsmall business committed to selling products made in the U.S.A. by \nwomen.\n  In November 2012, Alicia Vanderschuere launched rosieMADE, an online \nmarketplace that features vendors offering quality products made in the \nU.S.A. by women-friendly companies. After 15 years of experience in\n\n[[Page S5129]]\n\nretail and corporate merchandising, Alicia Vanderschuere decided to \nfollow her dreams in pursuit of owning her own business and reached out \nto the Idaho Women's Business Center, WBC, to help get started. The \nSmall Business Administration's WBCs represent a nationwide network of \neducational centers designed to assist women entrepreneurs in starting \nand growing their own businesses.\n  Inspired by the iconic champion for women Rosie the Riveter, \nrosieMADE aims to increase the number of women engaged in \nentrepreneurship while supporting homegrown products. In addition, \nrosieMADE offers services beyond that of selling products. The business \npromotes business prosperity through opportunities including training \nand information sessions on leadership, balancing home and work life, \nand various elements of small business. The roiseMADE team strives to \ninspire women to pursue their own business ventures by featuring women-\nowned business leaders and sharing their stories. As a resource for \nwomen nationwide, women who have successfully overcome obstacles in the \nbusiness environment are honored regularly in the ``Real Life Rosies'' \nsection of the Web site. These success stories are aimed to encourage \nother women to take a risk and start their own businesses.\n  Within a few short years, Alicia Vanderschuere and rosieMADE have \nalready achieved an outstanding reputation for quality, as well as that \nof a unique Idaho gem. It is not surprising that in 2013 Alicia \nVanderschuere was featured on the cover of the Idaho Women's Journal \nand is currently listed as one of the Idaho Women's Journal's ``Who's \nWho of Idaho Women.'' In addition, in February 2014 Alicia \nVanderschuere received the Women of the Year Award from the Idaho \nBusiness Review. With rosieMADE's commitment to female small business \nowners, I hope they will inspire more women throughout the Nation to \nbecome entrepreneurs.\n  I would like to recognize rosieMADE on their mission to promote \nproducts made by women in the U.S.A. and their willingness to take a \nrisk in inspiring future entrepreneurs. I congratulate the entire \nrosieMADE team and wish them great success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5129-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SCOTT AND JAMIE NAGY\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Scott and Jamie \nNagy of Brookings, SD, as my nominees for the 2014 Angels in Adoption \nAward. Since 1999, the Angels in Adoption program, through the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption Institution, has honored more than \n2,000 individuals, couples, and organizations nationwide for their work \nin providing children with loving, stable homes.\n  In 2006, after being married 14 years, Scott and Jamie, along with \ntheir four children Nick, Tyler, TJ, and Natalie, adopted their \ndaughter Naika from Haiti when she was 2\\1/2\\ years old. Jamie, who was \nadopted as an infant, found the process helped her better understand \nher own adoption story. Through their journey with Naika, the Nagys \ndecided to help others understand adoption and the needs of children \naround the world. In 2009, Scott was one of the first coaches in the \ncountry to coach barefoot at a basketball game to help raise awareness \nfor Samaritan's Feet, an organization that provides shoes to orphans \nand impoverished children in developing countries. Scott cites his \ninterest in helping Naika's home country as a source of inspiration for \nparticipation in the program.\n  Scott and Jamie's story demonstrates how parents and families can \nfoster patience, grace, and understanding as they grow their families \nand open their hearts and homes. Their desire to help others understand \nthe effect of overwhelming change on both the child and the family and \nlearn how to overcome those challenges speaks to their strength of \ncharacter. I commend their efforts to assist other families navigate \nthe adoption process and raise awareness of the needs of children \naround the world. It brings me great pride to honor South Dakotans \nScott and Jamie Nagy, my nominees for the 2014 Angels in Adoption \nAward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5129-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOSH CURRY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I would like to honor the centennial \nof a unique historical landmark in my home State. The Pittock Mansion \nin Portland, OR, educates Oregonians and tourists from around the world \nabout the city's history and the legacy of the family who once owned \nit.\n  When Henry Pittock completed construction of the large 46-room house \nin the West Hills of Portland in 1914, there was nothing like it in the \nregion--and arguably, there still isn't. Henry came to Oregon by \ncovered wagon with little in his pocket but grew to become a respected \nlocal businessman and the owner of our State newspaper, the Oregonian. \nHis wife Georgiana was a philanthropist who was known for serving the \nneeds of the elderly, women and children, and for her famous rose \ngarden. Georgiana often hosted garden parties where she would showcase \nher famous roses and is credited with kick-starting the first Portland \nRose Society and the tradition of the Portland Rose Festival, which now \ndraws thousands of people from around the world each summer.\n  When Henry and Georgiana built their mansion, they hired Oregon \ncraftsman and artisans and used northwest materials, helping their \ncommunity and contributing to the bourgeoning city in a variety of \nways. They lived a long, happy life together and had 6 children and 18 \ngrandchildren, including some who lived in the mansion up until it was \nput up for sale in 1958.\n  Today, the mansion serves as a historical museum. The interior of the \nhouse and the surrounding property are publicly owned and preserved by \ndedicated staff and volunteers. Tourists, locals, and schoolchildren \nare often seen wandering through the home and along the paths around \nthe large property learning about the historic significance of the \nmansion and of Portland.

Mr. President, this week is the opening of the \n101st Benton County Fair and Rodeo. For more than a century, the \ncitizens of Benton County, OR, have come together to show off the \nliteral and metaphorical fruits of their yearlong labor, display their \ntalents, and enjoy a few diversions.\n  The roots of the Benton County Fair actually run as far back as those \nof the State of Oregon. Just 7 months after Oregon achieved statehood, \nthe Benton Agricultural Society began holding small fairs. In the early \n1900s, Benton County had an outstanding showing at the Oregon State \nFair, handily winning the State fair's blue ribbon for its display of \nproduce five times--in 1907, 1908, 1910, 1911, and 1912. In 1912, J.F. \nYates, the mayor of Corvallis, announced a public holiday to celebrate \nBenton County's outstanding showing at the Oregon State Fair. The \nfollowing year, the county had its own celebration on the grounds of \nthe Oregon Agricultural College, later to become Oregon State \nUniversity. That year, the county brought out its finest produce, \nlivestock, and technology, starting a tradition that will be continued \nthis week.\n  The Benton County Fair and Rodeo found its current home in 1957, when \nthe county purchased 20 acres of land for the fair in Corvallis. In \n1958, the Future Farmers of America and 4-H joined the thriving county \nfair in its longstanding practice of showcasing the region's rich \nagricultural tradition. The fair has matured beyond its roots to \ninclude carnival festivities, rides, and concession stands in addition \nto live music. I know that folks in Benton County will enjoy a \nwonderful week as they take in the region's storied culture.\n  I would like to recognize Betty Malone, the Benton County Fair and \nRodeo's committee chair, for proposing a quilt to be sewn to \ncommemorate the fair's centennial last year, an important date in the \ncounty's history. I would also like to congratulate Dawn Wunder and \nDonna Johnson for leading the charge to make Betty's proposal a \nreality. The centennial quilt will be presented to the region's \nresidents in a ceremony today. Dozens of community members decorated \nthe patches that make up the quilt, a collective celebration of the \ncounty's history. It is a fitting tribute to folks in Benton County who \nfor more than 100 years have graced the region with their strong spirit \nand hard work.\n\n[[Page S5131]]\n\n  It is my pleasure to submit this statement in recognition of the \nBenton County Fair and Rodeo's 101st year. I look forward to the Fair's \ncontinued success for many more years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/30/senate-section/article/S5131-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 12:49 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhad signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1799.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nspecify coverage of continuous glucose monitoring devices, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as the founder and co-chair of the Senate \nDiabetes Caucus, I have learned a great deal about this devastating \ndisease affecting nearly 29 million Americans. Fortunately, due to the \nSpecial Diabetes Program and increased investments in diabetes \nresearch, we have seen some encouraging breakthroughs and are on the \nthreshold of a number of important new discoveries.\n  This is particularly true for the estimated 3 million Americans \nliving with type I diabetes. Advances in technology, like continuous \nglucose monitors, are helping patients control their blood glucose \nlevels, which is key to preventing costly and sometimes deadly diabetes \ncomplications. We are also moving closer and closer to our goal of an \nartificial pancreas, which would control blood glucose levels \nautomatically and revolutionize diabetes care.\n  The National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug \nAdministration have been extremely supportive of these innovations in \ndiabetes care. I was therefore surprised and extremely troubled to \nlearn that insulin-dependent Medicare beneficiaries are being denied \ncoverage for continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, because the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, has determined that they do \nnot meet the Medicare definition of durable medical equipment and do \nnot fall under any other Medicare category. As a consequence, we are \nseeing situations--similar to what we saw with insulin pumps in the \nlate 1990s--where individuals with type 1 diabetes have had coverage \nfor their continuous glucose monitor on their private insurance, only \nto lose it when they age into Medicare.\n  A CGM is a physician-prescribed, FDA-approved medical device that can \nprovide real-time readings and data about trends in glucose levels \nevery five minutes, thus enabling someone with insulin-dependent \ndiabetes to eat or take insulin and prevent dangerous low or high \nglucose levels. As demonstrated by extensive clinical evidence, adults \nusing a CGM have had improved overall glucose control and have reduced \nrates of hypoglycemia or low blood glucose levels. Professional medical \nsocieties, including the American Association of Clinical \nEndocrinologists and the Endocrine Society, recognize this clinical \nevidence and have published guidelines recommending CGM be used in \nappropriate patients with type 1 diabetes. Today, about 95 percent of \ncommercial insurers provide coverage for CGM devices.\n  The ironic thing is that it is only because of advances in diabetes \ncare like the continuous glucose monitor that people with type 1 \ndiabetes can expect to live long enough to become Medicare \nbeneficiaries. I am particularly concerned given the implications that \nthis coverage decision will have for future decisions regarding \nartificial pancreas systems, which will combine a continuous glucose \nmonitor, insulin pump, and sophisticated algorithm to control high and \nlow blood sugar around the clock.\n  I am therefore joining my colleague from New Hampshire and my Co-\nChair\n\n[[Page S5138]]\n\nof the Senate Diabetes Caucus in introducing the Medicare CGM Access \nAct of 2014 to create a separate benefit category under Medicare for \nthe continuous glucose monitor and require coverage of the device for \nindividuals meeting specified medical criteria.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, Ms. Baldwin, and Mr. Walsh):\n  S. 2693. A bill to reauthorize the women's business center program of \nthe Small Business Administration, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I am joining with my colleagues to \nintroduce legislation to empower women entrepreneurs and to help \naddress the persistent challenges women face when trying to start and \ngrow a business.\n  It was just 26 years ago that Congress enacted landmark legislation, \nthe Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 that eliminated requirements \nthat women obtain the signature of their husband or other man to secure \na business loan.\n  Between 1997 and 2013, the number of women-owned businesses in the \nUnited States grew by 59 percent, but significant barriers for women \nstill exist and there is still much more work to do.\n  Last week, the Small Business Committee released a report entitled \n``21st Century Barriers to Women's Entrepreneurship'' that assesses the \ncurrent challenges faced by women-owned businesses. The report also \nmakes policy recommendations to increase economic opportunity for women \nand help to put them on a level playing field with other business \nowners.\n  Our committee report makes four critical findings and includes policy \nrecommendations to help remedy the business climate for women \nentrepreneurs.\n  First, women business owners face challenges in getting access to \ncapital. The report highlights a study by the Urban Institute finding \nthat only 4 percent of the total value of all conventional small \nbusiness loans goes to women entrepreneurs. That means only $1 of every \n$23 is being loaned to a women-owned business. The report also notes \nthat women are forced to rely on personal savings, loans from family or \nfriends, or high interest credit because they cannot get traditional \nsmall business lending from banks.\n  Second, the report finds that women business owners still face \nchallenges in getting access to loans of the right size. Women-owned \nbusinesses have been very successful with the SBA's Microloan program, \nunder which they can obtain loans of up to $50,000 through \nintermediaries that also provide assistance in the development of \nbusiness plans. However, this program has not been updated since 1991.\n  The report highlights the importance of reauthorizing the \nIntermediary Lending Program that expired in 2013 and provided capital \nfor women business owners who were ready to take out loans that \nexceeded the $50,000 provided by the SBA's Microloan Program, but were \nnot yet able to take advantage of the SBA's 7(a) lending program.\n  Third, the report finds that women entrepreneurs face challenges \nobtaining relevant business training and counseling. Women's Business \nCenters provide specialized counseling and training designed to address \nthe unique challenges women face in starting a small business. The \nreport shows that the Women's Business Center program has not been re-\nauthorized since the 1990s and is in need of a 21st century \nmodernization.\n  Last, the committee report finds that women business owners face \nchallenges getting access to Federal contracts. Despite the growing \nnumber of businesses owned by women, the Federal Government has never \nmet its goal of awarding 5 percent of its contracts to women-owned \nsmall businesses. Our report notes that if the government met this \ngoal, women-owned small businesses would have access to additional \nmarket opportunity worth up to $4 billion a year.\n  That is why we are introducing the Women's Small Business Ownership \nAct. This legislation follows the policy recommendations made in the \ncommittee report and helps to address the glass ceiling many women \nentrepreneurs still encounter in the 21st century. While women-owned \nbusinesses as a whole continue to grow and succeed, to do so many women \nmust overcome barriers men do not face.\n  The Women's Small Business Ownership Act increases the flow of \ncapital to women business owners by modernizing the SBA's Microloan \nprogram and reauthorizing the Intermediary Lending Program. Women have \nbeen particularly successful in using microloans, which are loans of \nunder $50,000, and receive about half of all SBA Microloans.\n  The Microloan program would be modernized by increasing the total \namount lenders can loan, as well as allowing lenders to provide \nflexible terms and improved technical assistance to better suit the \nneeds of borrowers.\n  The Intermediary Lending Program is also an important program, which \nthis legislation reauthorizes to address a gap in lending options for \nsmall businesses, including women-owned small businesses that are \nunable to obtain financing from traditional lenders. The Intermediary \nLending Program offers low-interest loans of between $50,000 and \n$200,000 and closes the gap that can exist for small businesses that \nhave outgrown the SBA's Microloan program, but are not yet able to take \nadvantage of SBA's other lending guarantee programs.\n  This legislation removes barriers to the federal contracting \nmarketplace by allowing sole source contracts to be awarded to women-\nowned small businesses. Every other small business in a unique \nsocioeconomic category, including HUB Zone firms, service-disabled \nveteran-owned small businesses, and small disadvantaged businesses, can \nreceive a non-competitive or sole source contract, but women's small \nbusinesses cannot. Women-owned companies deserve parity with other \nprograms and a fair shot to grow their businesses.\n  The Women's Small Business Ownership Act ensures that the SBA's \nWomen's Business Centers are adequately and effectively meeting the \nneeds of women entrepreneurs in the 21st century. It provides the \nresources for Women's Business Centers to provide the technical support \nand counseling tailored to the unique challenges for women-owned \nbusinesses.\n  Women make up 51 percent of the population and have tremendous \npotential as business owners and job-creators. We need to empower women \nto break through the glass ceiling so it will be easier for even more \nwomen to succeed in the 21st century, grow the U.S. economy and create \nmore U.S. jobs.\n  When women have equal opportunity to access capital, obtain the right \nbusiness counseling, and compete for federal contracts, the economy \ngrows and the country moves forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2693\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the award of Federal Government contracts \nto inverted domestic corporations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier today I, along with Senator Dick \nDurbin and Senator Jack Reed, introduced the No Federal Contracts for \nCorporate Deserters Act. Our bill will put a stop to companies that \nrenounce their U.S. citizenship but come back to try to seek taxpayer \nfunded government contracts. There is an existing law on the books that \nis supposed to ban Federal contracts with inverted corporations, but \njust like with the tax code, after about a decade of lawyers looking \nfor loopholes in the law, a number of corporations have found them. \nThis bill would bring that ban up-to-date.\n  Over the last few months, there has been a growing rush of U.S. \ncorporations seeking to swear off their U.S. citizenship and move their \nmailboxes, for tax purposes, to a low-tax jurisdiction. I don't think \nthat is right, and it is time we put a stop to it, which we can do by \npassing the Stop Corporate Inversions Act I introduced 2 months ago \nwith 22 cosponsors.\n  Most Americans agree with us that taxpayer dollars shouldn't be used \nfor contracts with companies that move their addresses abroad to dodge \nU.S. laws. And because of that, Congress has passed a series of \nrestrictions on contracting with inverted corporations over the last \ndecade. We passed one in 2002, and another in 2006 and 2007. Since \nfiscal year 2008, a government-wide provision has been included in \nevery annual appropriations bill banning contracts with inverted \ncorporations.\n  Our bill would strengthen that ban by closing a number of loopholes \nin the current law. Those loopholes have allowed some inverted \ncorporations to continue collecting revenue from American taxpayers, \nwhile at the same time, shifting their tax burden onto those same \nAmerican taxpayers. Our bill also makes the existing ban, which has \nbeen included in annual appropriations bills, permanent.\n  Some may say that the real reason for inversions is that our tax rate \nis too high. It is true the top corporate rate is 35 percent. But the \neffective tax rate--what corporations really pay--is about 12 percent. \nWhen companies can go to places like Ireland or the Caribbean and \nnegotiate sweetheart deals to pay little or no taxes, there will always \nbe tax incentives for companies to abandon their country instead of \npaying their tax bill, no matter what our tax rate is.\n  Some may say that we should wait for tax reform to address this \nissue. There are two reasons why we shouldn't. First, if it happens at \nall, tax reform is months or years away; these inversions are happening \nnow. Second, this is a bill about contracting. This bill doesn't amend \nthe tax code. I expect it will be referred to the Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs Committee, not to the Finance Committee. So even \nSenators who believe that fixing the tax inversions problem should wait \nuntil comprehensive tax reform should be able to support this bill.\n  In the past, in similar circumstances, Congress has chosen to act--\noverwhelmingly, and in a bipartisan fashion. This should not be a \npartisan\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\nissue. This is about fairness. It is simply unfair to businesses who \ndon't invert to have to compete with companies that do invert. This is \nabout putting American families who work hard and pay their share. We \nshouldn't sacrifice the interests of those families. We shouldn't ask \nthem to send their hard-earned tax dollars to contractors who skip out \non their tax obligations. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto move this bill forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2711. A bill to reauthorize the United States Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the United States \nCommission on International Religious Freedom, USCIRF, Reform and \nReauthorization Act of 2014.\n  This legislation would reauthorize the U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom, also known as USCIRF, while making \nimportant reforms to the Commission to encourage bipartisanship, \nenhance coordination with the State Department, and improve \nCongressional oversight.\n  I strongly support USCIRF's mission of promoting and protecting \ninternational religious freedom. My legislation will help USCIRF to \nmore effectively pursue this mission.\n  In 2011, I authored a number of reforms in the previous USCIRF \nreauthorization legislation, including term limits for Commissioners; a \nprohibition on employee discrimination; a requirement that \nCommissioners follow federal travel regulations; and maintaining nine \nCommissioners, rather than five Commissioners, as called for by the \nHouse-passed reauthorization. I have heard from USCIRF that these \nreforms have strengthened the Commission, and the legislation I am \nintroducing today will build on these reforms.\n  The USCIRF Reform and Reauthorization Act is supported by a broad \nswath of religious and civic leaders and faith organizations, \nincluding, Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good; the Evangelical \nLutheran Church of America; United Methodist Church, General Board of \nChurch and Society; HIAS; Muslim Public Affairs Council; Cardinal \nTheodore E. McCarrick, Archbishop Emeritus of Washington and former \nUSCIRF Commissioner; Dr. William J. Shaw, Immediate Past President of \nthe National Baptist Convention, USA. Inc. and former USCIRF \nCommissioner; former Congressman and USCIRF Commissioner Sam Gejdenson; \nSister Simone Campbell, Executive Director of NETWORK, A National \nCatholic Social Justice Lobby; Rateb Rabie, President of the Holy Land \nChristian Ecumenical Foundation; Dr. Azizah Al-Hibri, former USCIRF \nCommissioner and Founder and Chair of KARAMAH: Muslim Women Lawyers for \nHuman Rights; Rev. Drew Christiansen, S.J., Distinguished Professor of \nEthics and Global Development at Georgetown University; Dr. Alfred \nRotondaro, Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress; Dr. Laila \nAl-Marayati, former USCIRF Commissioner; and Benjamin Palumbo, Board of \nTrustees, Catholics United.\n  There is bipartisan agreement about the need for our government to \npromote and protect international religious freedom. USCIRF is, by \ndesign, a bipartisan organization, with Commissioners appointed by the \nPresident and Congressional leaders, and USCIRF can most effectively \npromote religious freedom by doing so on a bipartisan basis. This issue \nis too important to be stymied by the excessive partisanship which too \noften leads to political gridlock in Washington.\n  It is to be expected that the members of a bipartisan Commission will \nnot always reach consensus. However, I am troubled that some \nCommissioners have on occasion engaged in partisan rhetoric that is not \nconducive to USCIRF's bipartisan mission and does not represent \nUSCIRF's official views.\n  For example, one Commissioner recently appeared on Fox News' Hannity \nprogram, and, after identifying himself as a member of USCIRF, claimed \nthat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had failed to take steps \nto combat Boko Haram in Nigeria and accused the Obama Administration of \nhaving ``no strategy'' for combating terrorism. Mother Commissioner \ntestified in Congress on behalf of USCIRF and said that the Obama \nAdministration ``sends a message to other countries that we don't \ncare'' about religious freedom.\n  The USCIRF Reform and Reauthorization Act will facilitate \nbipartisanship by taking a number of steps. First, the legislation will \ncodify USCIRF's existing procedures for the election of a Chair and \nVice Chair so that these positions rotate annually between \nCommissioners appointed by elected officials of each political party. \nThis will help ensure continued bipartisan leadership at the \nCommission.\n  Second, this bill will establish a dedicated bipartisan staff as a \ncomplement to nonpartisan professional staff. The legislation permits \nCommissioners appointed by elected officials of each political party to \nappoint designated Staff Directors and three designated staff members. \nThis will help foster a bipartisan environment at USCIRF.\n  Third, the bill will codify procedures for publishing the views of \nthe Commission. The bill encourages Commissioners to reach consensus on \nstatements on behalf of the Commission. When consensus is not possible, \nthe bill requires a statement to be approved by at least six of the \nnine Commissioners. This supermajority requirement is current USCIRF \npolicy for the approval of statements that are circulated \nelectronically. Codifying this policy will ensure that at least one \nCommissioner of each political party supports every Commission \nstatement.\n  USCIRF has noted that it is the only organization of its kind in the \nworld. The Government Accountability Office, GAO, recently issued a \nreport on USCIRF which highlights some of the challenges inherent to \nUSCIRF's unique mission.\n  The GAO notes that there are two governmental entities charged with \npromoting international religious freedom: USCIRF and the State \nDepartment's Office of International Religious Freedom. The GAO found \nthat these overlapping missions and ``the lack of a definition \nregarding how State and the Commission are to interact has sometimes \ncreated foreign policy tensions that State has had to mitigate.'' The \nGAO notes that State Department officials highlighted several instances \n``when the Commission's approach with foreign government officials \ncreated bilateral tensions.''\n  The GAO's concerns about the overlap between State and USCIRF are \nserious enough that it included USCIRF in its annual duplication \nreport. As my colleagues know, Senator Coburn authored legislation \nrequiring GAO to issue this report to identify unnecessary duplication \nin the federal government.\n  I am concerned that the lack of coordination between the State \nDepartment and USCIRF may undermine our government's efforts to promote \ninternational religious freedom by sending mixed messages to foreign \ngovernments and human-rights activists who are fighting to defend \nreligious freedom in their countries.\n  Consider another example. The State Department and USCIRF both \nproduce an annual report on international religious freedom. Under \ncurrent law, USCIRF is required to publish its report ``[n]ot later \nthan May 1 of each year,'' but the State Department's report is often \nnot completed before May 1. This forces USCIRF to issue its report \nprior to publication of the State Department report, which leads to \nunnecessary duplication of efforts, saps USCIRF's limited staff \nresources, and prevents USCIRF from opining on the State Department \nreport.\n  The USCIRF Reform and Reauthorization Act will enhance cooperation \nbetween USCIRF and the State Department with two measures. First, it \nclarifies that the Ambassador at Large for International Religious \nFreedom, as an ex officio member of USCIRF, is permitted to attend all \nCommission meetings. GAO's duplication report specifically highlights \nthe failure to define the role of the Ambassador at Large as an ex \nofficio member of USCIRF.\n  Second, this legislation requires USCIRF to publish its annual report \nafter reviewing the State Department's annual report on International \nReligious Freedom. This division of labor takes advantage of the State \nDepartment's worldwide presence and much larger staff to draft a \ncomprehensive report. It also takes advantage of\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\nUSCIRF's unique role to provide an independent and bipartisan \ncommentary on the State Department report.\n  USCIRF is a part of the legislative branch and it is ultimately the \nresponsibility of Congress to oversee USCIRF's work and ensure that it \nis effectively pursuing its mission. The need for greater Congressional \noversight of USCIRF has been highlighted by concerns about USCIRF's \npractices, including, for example, the work environment at USCIRF for \nreligious minorities, particularly prior to the 2011 reauthorization.\n  In the past, human rights advocates made allegations about financial \nimproprieties at USCIRF, particularly that USCIRF Commissioners had \nmade lavish travel arrangements. As a result, in 2011 I authored a \nprovision clarifying that USCIRF Commissioners are subject to Federal \ntravel regulations.\n  I was troubled to learn about more allegations of financial \nirregularities at USCIRF only a few weeks after the last \nreauthorization. In early 2012, USCIRF staff notified my office that \nUSCIRF's office manager had been involved in embezzlement and fraud for \nseveral years. The office manager subsequently pled guilty and was \nsentenced to 20 months in prison for embezzling $217,000 from 2007-\n2011. This is a significant amount of taxpayer money in any \ncircumstance, but particularly for a small organization like USCIRF.\n  I am also concerned about unresolved claims that USCIRF, an \norganization charged with protecting religious freedom, discriminated \nagainst a former employee on the basis of her religion.\n  In 2011, I included language in the last USCIRF reauthorization \nproviding anti-discrimination protections to USCIRF employees and \nallowing pending civil rights claims to proceed. The impetus for this \nprovision was a lawsuit filed by a former USCIRF employee, who claimed \nthat her permanent employment offer was rescinded after the \nCommissioners learned of her prior job with a Muslim civil rights \norganization. USCIRF did not deny the discrimination claim. Instead, \nthey argued that USCIRF employees do not have federal civil rights \nprotections.\n  Unfortunately, the lawsuit is still pending. I understand that \nUSCIRF's lawyers have refused to enter into settlement negotiations \nwith the Commission's former employee and instead are aggressively \nlitigating the case.\n  As Christianity Today said, ``the trial will be one of the most \nironic in American history, with the congressional commission charged \nwith monitoring religious freedom around the world defending its own \nemployment practices in court.''\n  In light of these concerns, the USCIRF Reform and Reauthorization Act \nwould improve Congressional oversight by reauthorizing the Commission \nfor two years. A 2-year reauthorization period will allow the \nCommission to continue to pursue its important mission while Congress \nclosely monitors USCIRF's activities to assure the reforms in this \nlegislation are fully implemented.\n  I strongly support the mission of the U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom to protect and promote international \nreligious freedom. I believe the reforms in my legislation will help \nUSCIRF more effectively pursue this mission.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the USCIRF Reform and Reauthorization \nAct so that USCIRF can quickly be reauthorized with these important \nreforms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2711\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act \nof 1965 in order to allow adjunct faculty members to qualify for public \nservice loan forgiveness; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I introduced the Adjunct Faculty \nLoan Fairness Act, a bill that would make adjunct professors eligible \nto participate in the Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness Program.\n  Contingent faculty members are like full-time instructors. They have \nadvanced degrees. They teach classes and spend many hours outside the \nclassroom preparing for class. They hold office hours, grade papers and \ngive feedback to students. They provide advice and write letters of \nrecommendation. Students rely on them. Since most adjuncts have \nadvanced degrees and, as almost 75 percent of graduate degree \nrecipients have an average of $61,000 in student loans, they are also \namong the 40 million Americans with student debt.\n  The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is meant to encourage \ngraduates to go into public service by offering student loan \nforgiveness for eligible federal loans after ten years of full-time \nwork in government or the non-profit sector. Public service fields like \nnursing, military service, and public health qualify. And many \neducation jobs qualify, including full-time work at public universities \nand part-time work at community colleges in high-needs subject areas or \nareas of shortage. But other faculty members who work part-time are not \neligible for loan forgiveness because the law requires an annual \naverage of 30 hours per week to qualify for the program. For adjunct \nfaculty working at several schools on a contingent basis, this \nrequirement can be difficult or impossible to meet, even when they are \nputting in more than 30 hours of work each week.\n  The number of faculty hours given for each class is calculated \ndifferently at different schools. Some give one hour per hour in the \nclassroom while others actually take into consideration the time \nrequired outside the classroom. So, even as these faculty members are \nworking hard and as their options for tenured, full-time positions \nbecome slimmer, more of them are overworked and undervalued for their \nwork in public service.\n  The Adjunct Faculty Loan Fairness Act of 2014 would solve this by \namending the Higher Education Act to expand the definition of a \n``public service job'' to include a part-time faculty member who \nteaches at least one course at an eligible institution of higher \neducation. They would still have to meet all the other requirements to \nqualify for the program, including making 120 on-time payments while \nemployed at a qualifying institution, and they could not be employed \nfull-time elsewhere at the same time.\n  This bill would benefit someone like David Weiss, an adjunct \nprofessor from St. Paul, Minnesota, who graduated with $48,000 in \nstudent debt and, after 12 years of on-time payments, has $35,000 left. \nLike most adjuncts, David has dealt with uncertain job security. In \ngood years, he is able to teach 5 to 7 courses a year, but recently he \nhas only been offered two to three courses. He supplements his income \nfrom teaching with other part-time work. This bill would ensure that \nDavid and many thousands like him, could obtain credit towards PSLF for \npayments made while teaching whether or not he was teaching one course \nor 7.\n  Unfortunately, for all their contributions to the college programs \nand the students they work with, adjunct faculty don't have the same \nemployment benefits or job security as their colleagues. The number of \nclasses they teach every semester varies. To make ends meet, these \nprofessors often end up teaching classes at more than one school in the \nsame semester, getting paid about $3,000 per class and making an \naverage annual income that hovers around minimum wage. This also means \nthat, in some parts of the country, they spend as much time commuting \nas they do teaching.\n  Nationally, \\2/3\\ of all higher education faculty work on a \ncontingent basis, with low pay and little or no benefits or job \nsecurity. In the past, these were a minority of professors who were \nhired to teach an occasional class because they could bring experience \nto the classroom in a specific field or industry. Over time, as \nuniversity budgets have tightened and it has gotten more expensive to \nhire full-time, tenure track professors, higher education institutions \nhave increasingly hired adjuncts.\n  From 1991 to 2011, the number of part-time faculty in the U.S. \nincreased two and a half times from 291,000 to over 760,000. At the \nsame time, the percentage of professors holding tenure-track positions \nhas been steadily decreasing--from 45 percent of all instructors in \n1975 to only 24 percent in 2011. The number of full-time instructors, \ntenured and non-tenured, now makes up only about 50 percent of \nprofessors on U.S. campuses. The other 50 percent of the 1.5 million \nfaculty employees at public and non-profit colleges and universities in \nthe U.S. work on a part-time, contingent basis.\n  Illinois colleges rely heavily on adjuncts. In 2012, 53 percent of \nall faculty at public and not-for-profit colleges and universities in \nthe State, more than 30,400 faculty employees, worked on a part-time \nbasis. This is a 52.6 percent increase in part-time faculty in Illinois \ncompared to a 13 percent increase in full-time faculty since 2002.\n  Not surprisingly, in Illinois, 69 percent of all part-time faculty \nwork in Chicago, where the cost of living is 16 percent higher than the \nU.S. average. Based on an average payment of $3,000 per class an \nadjunct professor must teach between seventeen and thirty classes a \nyear to pay for rent and utilities in Chicago.\n  They would have to teach up to 7 classes to afford groceries for a \nfamily of four and two to four classes per year just to cover student \nloan payments. Because they are part-time, they are not eligible for \nvacation time, paid sick days, or group health-care. So they would have \nto teach an additional two to three classes to afford family coverage \nfrom the lowest priced health insurance offered on Get Covered \nIllinois, the official health marketplace.\n  Even though these professors are working in a relatively low-paying \nfield, teaching our students, their part-time status also means they \naren't eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.\n  This bill does not completely fix this growing reliance on part-time \nprofessors who are underpaid and undervalued. But it would ensure that \nmembers of the contingent faculty workforce are no longer excluded from \nthe loan forgiveness program for public servants. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in the effort to provide this benefit to faculty members \nwho provide our students with a quality education.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2712\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SUPPORT FOR SECURITY OF AFGHAN WOMEN AND GIRLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Through the sacrifice and dedication of members of the \n     Armed Forces and civilian personnel, as well the American \n     people's generous investment, oppressive Taliban rule has \n     given way to a nascent democracy in Afghanistan. It is in our \n     national security interest to help prevent Afghanistan from \n     ever again becoming a safe haven and training ground for \n     international terrorism and to solidify and preserve the \n     gains our men and women in uniform fought so hard to \n     establish.\n       (2) The United States through its National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace, and Security has made firm commitments to \n     support the human rights of the women and girls of \n     Afghanistan. The National Action Plan states that ``the \n     engagement and protection of women as agents of peace and \n     stability will be central to United States efforts to promote \n     security, prevent, respond to, and resolve conflict, and \n     rebuild societies''.\n       (3) As stated in the Department of Defense's July 2013 1230 \n     Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in \n     Afghanistan (in this section, the ``1230 Report''), the \n     United States Government ``recognizes that promoting security \n     for Afghan women and girls must remain a top foreign policy \n     priority''. The November 2013 1230 Report also highlights \n     this priority and further states, ``A major focus of DoD and \n     others working to improve the conditions of women in \n     Afghanistan is now to maintain the gains made in the last \n     twelve years after the ISAF mission ends.''\n       (4) According to the November 1230 Report, female \n     recruitment and retention rates for the Afghan National \n     Security Forces fell short of the Ministry of Defense (MoD) \n     and Ministry of the Interior (MoI) female recruitment goals. \n     In regards to women serving in the ANP, the November 1230 \n     report also states, ``Low female recruitment is due in part \n     to the MoI's passive female recruitment efforts, which has no \n     specific female recruitment strategy or plan.''\n       (5) According to the Special Inspector General for Afghan \n     Reconstruction (SIGAR) April 2014 report, despite more women \n     showing an interest in joining the security forces, women \n     still make up less than 1 percent of the ANA and AAF. Also, \n     according to the SIGAR report, ``As in prior quarters, the \n     number of women in the ANP is increasing, but progress has \n     been slow toward reaching the goal to have 5,000 women in the \n     ANP by the end of 2014. This quarter, ANP personnel included \n     1,743 women-226 officers, 728 NCOs, and 789 enlisted \n     personnel-according to CSTC-A. This is an increase of 539 \n     women since August 22, 2011.''\n       (6) According to Shaheen Chughtai, Oxfam's deputy head of \n     policy and campaigns, ``This lack of policewomen, and \n     effective policewomen, is one of the main reasons why \n     violence and threats against women and girls in Afghanistan \n     are under-reported. It's why prosecutions are so rare and \n     it's why the culture of impunity continues.''\n       (7) According to the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs \n     report released in January 2014, of 4,505 cases of violence \n     against women in 2013, which include issues such as forced \n     marriage, fewer than 10 percent were resolved through the \n     legal process.\n       (8) According to the International Crisis Group, there are \n     not enough female police officers to staff all provincial \n     Family Response Units (FRUs). United Nations Assistance \n     Mission Afghanistan and the Office of the High Commissioner \n     for Refugees found that ``in the absence of Family Response \n     Units or visible women police officers, women victims almost \n     never approach police stations willingly, fearing they will \n     be arrested, their reputations stained or worse''.\n       (9) FRUs are a core component of strategies for how to both \n     strengthen the roles of women in the police force and ensure \n     attention to crimes of sexual and gender-based violence \n     (SGBV). However, FRUs have been under-resourced and under-\n     utilized, making it difficult for them to fulfill their \n     mandate.\n       (10) The Government of Afghanistan, with support from \n     United States-led coalition forces, recruited, trained, and \n     contracted over 13,000 female searchers for the 2014 \n     presidential election thereby ensuring many women-only \n     polling centers would be operational on election day.\n       (11) The Presidential election on April 5, 2014, saw \n     unprecedented levels of female voter participation. According \n     to the SIGAR quarterly report published on April 30, 2014, \n     approximately 35 percent of those votes were cast by women.\n       (b) Sense of Congress on Promotion of Security of Afghan \n     Women.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the United States Government's national \n     security interests to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming \n     a safe haven and training ground for international terrorism;\n       (2) as an important part of a strategy to achieve this \n     objective and to help Afghanistan achieve its full potential, \n     the United States Government should continue to regularly \n     press the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan \n     to commit to the meaningful inclusion of women in the \n     political, economic, and security transition process and to \n     ensure that women's concerns are fully reflected in relevant \n     negotiations, such as the upcoming NATO summit and the \n     Afghanistan Development Conference of 2014 in London;\n       (3) the United States Government and the Government of \n     Afghanistan should reaffirm their commitment to supporting \n     Afghan civil society, including women's organizations, as \n     agreed to during the meeting between the International \n     Community and the Government of Afghanistan on the Tokyo \n     Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF) in July 2013; and\n\n[[Page S5152]]\n\n       (4) the United States Government should continue to support \n     and encourage efforts to recruit and retain women in the \n     Afghan National Security Forces, who are critical to the \n     success of NATO's Resolute Support Mission.\n       (c) Plan to Promote Security of Afghan Women.--\n       (1) Reporting requirement.--The Secretary of Defense, in \n     conjunction with the Secretary of State, shall include in the \n     report required under section 1227--\n       (A) an assessment of the security of Afghan women and \n     girls, including information regarding efforts to increase \n     the recruitment and retention of women in the ANSF; and\n       (B) an assessment of the implementation of the authority \n     under section 1531 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     of Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 113-66; 127 Stat. 937), as \n     extended by section 1523 of this Act, for the recruitment, \n     integration, retention, training, and treatment of women in \n     the ANSF, including the challenges associated with such \n     implementation and the steps being taken to address those \n     challenges.\n       (2) Plan to promote security of afghan women.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall, to the \n     extent practicable, support the efforts of the Government of \n     Afghanistan to promote the security of Afghan women and girls \n     during and after the security transition process through the \n     development and implementation by the Government of \n     Afghanistan of an Afghan-led plan that should include the \n     elements described in this paragraph.\n       (B) Training.--The Secretary of Defense, working with the \n     International Security Force (ISAF) and NATO Training \n     Mission-Afghanistan (NTM-A), should encourage the Government \n     of Afghanistan to develop--\n       (i) an evaluation of the effectiveness of existing training \n     for Afghan National Security Forces on this issue;\n       (ii) a plan to increase the number of female security \n     officers specifically trained to address cases of gender-\n     based violence, including ensuring the Afghan National \n     Police's Family Response Units (FRUs) have the necessary \n     resources and are available to women across Afghanistan;\n       (iii) a plan to address the development of accountability \n     mechanisms for ANA and ANP personnel who violate codes of \n     conduct related to the human rights of women and girls, \n     including female members of the ANSF; and\n       (iv) a plan to develop training for the ANA and the ANP to \n     increase awareness and responsiveness among ANA and ANP \n     personnel regarding the unique security challenges women \n     confront when serving in those forces.\n       (C) Enrollment and treatment.--The Secretary of Defense, in \n     cooperation with the Afghan Ministries of Defense and \n     Interior, shall seek to assist the Government of Afghanistan \n     in including as part of the plan developed under subparagraph \n     (A) the development and implementation of a plan to increase \n     the number of female members of the ANA and ANP and to \n     promote their equal treatment, including through such steps \n     as providing appropriate equipment, modifying facilities, and \n     ensuring literacy and gender awareness training for female \n     recruits and male counterparts.\n       (D) Allocation of funds.--The $25,000,000 allocated from \n     the Afghan Security Forces Fund pursuant to section 1523(b) \n     for the recruitment, integration, retention, training, and \n     treatment of women in the ANSF, may be available for \n     activities, including the provision of--\n       (i) appropriate equipment for female security and police \n     forces;\n       (ii) modification and refurbishment of facilities to \n     support the recruitment and retention of women within the \n     forces;\n       (iii) security provisions for high-profile female police \n     and army officers;\n       (iv) mechanisms to address sexual harassment within the \n     forces;\n       (v) support for ANP Family Response Units; and\n       (vi) training to include literacy training for women \n     recruits as well as gender awareness training for male \n     counterparts.\n       (3) Staffing at polling stations.--The Secretary of Defense \n     should assist the Afghan MOD and MOI in maintaining the \n     female searcher capabilities that were established for the \n     April 2014 presidential elections for the 2015 parliamentary \n     elections, which may include--\n       (A) providing assistance in the development of a \n     recruitment and training program for female searchers and \n     security officers to staff voting stations during the 2015 \n     parliamentary elections;\n       (B) working with the Ministry of Interior to ensure that \n     female ANP officers and previously recruited searchers' \n     training is maintained and that those searchers already \n     recruited and trained are reassigned to provide security for \n     polling stations;
