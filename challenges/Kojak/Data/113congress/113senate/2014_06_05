The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                          Invasion of Normandy\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am aware of the remarks I am about to make \nin recognition of the Presiding Officer who has, prior to coming to \nthis body, led hundreds of troops into Iraq during some of the most \ndifficult combat that any soldiers faced during that conflict.\n  When I first came to the Senate, we had many combat veterans, but \nthat has changed over the years, quite remarkably.\n  We all look to Senator McCain as someone who certainly understands \nwhat it means to be in a conflict in war, but things have changed since \nwe lost Medal of Honor winners: Dan Inouye on his passing; Bob Kerrey \nas a result of his retiring; Fritz Hollings, a Silver Star winner, \ncombat veteran of World War II; Ted Stevens flying airplanes into the \nFar East, a dedicated heroic pilot; and many other people, so there \naren't many left anymore.\n  That is why I focus attention on the Presiding Officer today, because \nhe is representative of the best of people who fight for freedom.\n  On June 6, 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt began his national \nradio address in a very unusual way, one not entirely common then or \nnow, because the Commander in Chief, the President of the United \nStates, asked the American people to join him in prayer. Why\n\n[[Page S3434]]\n\ndid he do that? His prayer was not for himself but for the 156,000 \nallied soldiers who, as he spoke, were fighting their way onto the \nbeaches of Normandy.\n  As he implored the American people on behalf of those soldiers, he \nsaid:\n\n       They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without rest \n     until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by noise \n     and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the violence of \n     war. For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. \n     They fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end \n     conquest. They fight to liberate.\n\n  That was part of his request, that the American people pray for these \nvaliant soldiers. Of course, while this battle for Europe was going on \nthroughout the South Pacific, people were dying as he spoke. Virtually \nall of the troops who stormed the beaches of France that day were not \nprofessional soldiers. They were schoolteachers, farmers, ranchers, \nmechanics, and clerks. These fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers were \npulled away from their peaceful lives and instead were sent to liberate \nan entire continent. They fought courageously for liberty. They hurtled \nthemselves into the line of fire to defeat tyranny.\n  We can probably all look back at people who fought in World War II. \nThey were our relatives, our neighbors, and I mentioned a few whom I \nserved with in the Senate.\n  From the little town I come from in Nevada, Searchlight, there was a \nman there named Junior Cree. His name was Junior Cree. That was his \ngiven name. I grew up there as a little boy.\n  He had a service station, a little bar, and did a number of different \nthings. He was an entrepreneur, as was his dad.\n  Many years after I was no longer a little boy, he came to my home in \nSearchlight and wanted to see my new home. Junior and I sat and talked \nwith his daughter Sandy. I had asked him: Junior, what did you do in \nthe invasion of Normandy? He proceeded to tell me. Yet at this time he \nwas an 80-year-old man.\n  He told me he had fought in the North African conflict first. He was \nin the infantry. He was not in the first wave to go onto the beaches, \nbut he was in one of the first, in one of the amphibious vehicles. \nThere were about 35 or 40 people on one of those.\n  His job--he had his rifle of course but his job was to carry signs--\nhe was a big man--into the water onto the beaches, and he had \ninstructions on what to do with the signs, to designate who they were \nand what they were supposed to do. The water was much deeper than \nanyone said. Well, this man, who was well over 6 foot, went right to \nthe bottom and nearly drowned because these signs were so heavy. He \nmade it onto the beach and found security under a damaged half-track, I \nthink he called it. He was shot in the rear end, and that ended his \nmilitary adventures during World War II.\n  These people were everyplace. Junior Cree was one of 156,000 people \non those beaches. They were all heroes. They were all people just like \nJunior Cree. They fought courageously for liberty. As I have indicated, \nthey hurtled themselves into the line of fire. Can you imagine going \nonto the beach with the machine gun fire coming down on top of you.\n  Tomorrow is the 70th anniversary of D-day. On that day 156,000 heroic \nsoldiers turned the tide against Adolf Hitler's savagery and unshackled \nthe nations of Europe. This afternoon there are about 10 or 11 Senators \nwho are going to go to that 70th anniversary which is being held on the \nbeaches of Normandy. President Obama will be there, world leaders will \nbe there, and I appreciate very much those Senators going and \nrepresenting the Senate, as well as the Presiding Officer.\n  Proof of these soldiers' bravery can be seen in faraway France today, \nevery day, not just for the celebration that is going to take place \nrecognizing the 70th anniversary of this conflict--every day--because \nthere are massive graves there, all over Europe. These seemingly \nendless rows of white headstones testify to their valor. Crosses and \nStars of David are reminders of the debt we owe to those who refused to \nbalk in the face of the evil, and that was Hitler. Adolf Hitler's Nazis \nwere evil.\n  May we always honor their sacrifice and never forget the price they \npaid to protect, not only this Nation but the entire world.\n\n\n                           Honoring Veterans\n\n  One of the ways in which we honor soldiers in our democracy is to \ncare for our veterans. As we celebrate the 70th anniversary of D-day, \nit is fitting that Members of this body are working on a bipartisan \nbasis to ensure that American veterans get the help they need and \ndeserve. In light of the disturbing reports of the practices of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs hospitals and other facilities, chairman \nBernie Sanders, of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, is leading \nthe effort to craft a bill to improve care at VA hospitals.\n  I applaud his efforts. I applaud the efforts of Senator McCain. As we \nspeak, they are meeting to try to come up with some bipartisan solution \nto the problems of wait times at VA facilities. I am hopeful an \nagreement will be reached that guarantees American veterans are \nreceiving the care we as a grateful nation have promised. It is the \nleast we can do for these gallant men and women who have fought to \nprotect our great country.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Normandy Invasion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Tomorrow marks the 70th anniversary of the invasion of \nNormandy, a day known across the world as D-day.\n  On this fateful day, which proved to be such a decisive turning point \nfor the allied victory in Europe, thousands of allied forces were \nkilled or wounded in the invasion. While we are sadly losing more and \nmore members of the ``greatest generation'' with each passing year--\nincluding the last of the original Navajo code talkers whom we lost \njust yesterday--the heroism of these brave Americans can never be \nforgotten.\n  I have one constituent, Bob Williams from Boone County, KY, who \njumped on D-day, jumped again 50 years later, and was on the front \ncover of Time magazine. I saw him earlier this year, and he says he is \nnot going to jump again because his wife will not let him, but Bob \nWilliams is still in good shape 70 years after the day he jumped into \nthe night of D-day.\n  Tomorrow I will be honored to commemorate the most important \nanniversary by meeting with a number of Kentucky heroes--veterans from \nWorld War II and the Korean war--who will be visiting the national \nmonuments built here in the Nation's Capital to honor their service and \nsacrifice. They will be making a trip with the help of the Bluegrass \nChapter of the Honor Flight Program, which has already brought more \nthan 1,000 veterans--mostly from Kentucky--to Washington for this very \npurpose. The program provides transportation, lodging, and food for the \nveterans.\n  Without Honor Flight, many would not be able to visit the World War \nII Memorial--a memorial erected to honor the sacrifice of the men and \nwomen who served on D-day and throughout that era.\n  I have met with groups of Honor Flight veterans before, and it is \nalways a moving experience. It is gratifying to see these heroes \nreceive the recognition they deserve. Many of them never thought they \nwould be able to make the trip, and for every veteran who does, I am \nsure they hold cherished memories of their fellow soldiers in arms who \ndid not.\n  I look forward to greeting them tomorrow and thanking them for their \nextraordinary service to our country. I am proud and honored that \nKentucky is home to so many of these brave heroes.\n\n\n                           BURWELL NOMINATION\n\n  Today the Senate will vote on President Obama's newest choice to head \nthe Department of Health and Human Services--in other words, the person \nhe will be sticking with the impossible task of trying to make \nObamaCare work.\n  By most accounts Sylvia Burwell is a smart and skilled public \nservant, but her embrace of ObamaCare calls her policy judgment into \nquestion. When it comes to the task of implementing this ill-conceived \nand disastrous law, the President may as well have nominated Sisyphus \nbecause, as I indicated, Ms. Burwell is being asked to do the \nimpossible.\n  ObamaCare has already inflicted tremendous pain on the lives of \ncountless middle-class Americans, including\n\n[[Page S3435]]\n\nmany thousands in my own State. It is increasing costs for families all \nacross the country--despite endless promises to the contrary. It has \nreduced access to the doctors and hospitals my constituents relied on--\ndespite endless promises to the contrary. It has caused Kentuckians to \nlose the plans they liked and wanted to keep--despite endless promises \nto the contrary.\n  A constituent of mine from Pulaksi County wrote to tell me that as a \nresult of ObamaCare he lost his insurance and that he was ``floored'' \nwhen he saw the cost of the ObamaCare-approved plan to replace it. With \na spike in his premium and a $6,300 deductible, he wrote to ask me how \n``[he] or any working man [could] afford the Affordable . . . Care \nAct.'' He makes an important point.\n  Nearly every major ObamaCare promise from several years ago is a \nbroken ObamaCare promise today. Even more recent promises from the \nadministration can't be relied on either. In January the Secretary \ncertified to Congress that she would verify that people were actually \neligible for ObamaCare subsidies before they were sent out. In recent \nweeks we learned from media accounts and testimony that many of the \nsystems needed to protect taxpayers against inaccurate or fraudulent \npayments still have not been built, tested, or used. Yesterday we \nlearned that nearly one in four applications may have an inconsistency \nthat could affect the accuracy of these payments from American \ntaxpayers. Any wasted tax dollar is a problem, but when you consider \nthat many of these are dollars raised from tax increases or raided from \nMedicare to make payouts by mistake or through fraud, it is enough to \nmake your head spin.\n  This is just the kind of thing everyone warned about as Washington \nDemocrats tried to ram this law through, and it will only get worse if \nwe give up now and just accept the giant mess they have made of our \nhealth care. I mean, if they can't even get a Web site fixed after \nspending hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars, how can they \npossibly regulate such a huge sector of our economy in any effective \nway?\n  How can any administration official possibly repair all the broken \nObamaCare promises? The question answers itself: They can't. The \nnominee before us can't. No one can. The problem is the law itself. \nObamaCare is what prevents the successful implementation of ObamaCare. \nAnd Americans don't want it. They want real health reforms--reforms \nthat can actually lower costs, increase choice, and help the middle \nclass. So, in my view, the Senate shouldn't be focusing on a new \ncaptain for the Titanic; it should focus on steering away from the \niceberg.\n  As HHS Secretary, the nominee would oversee many important programs \naimed at protecting public health, promoting medical research, and \nproviding a safety net for seniors and working families, but she would \nalso be the chief operating officer of ObamaCare implementation--a law \nthat is doing incredible damage to middle-class families in our \ncountry. Her embrace of this disastrous law is reason enough to oppose \nher confirmation.\n  I will be voting against this nominee because I think we need to \nfocus on repealing and replacing this law, not trying to do the \nimpossible by pretending we can make it work.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                  Staff Sergeant Christopher T. Stout\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to mourn the loss and celebrate the life of one \nbrave soldier from Kentucky who died while serving this country. SSG \nChristopher T. Stout of Worthville, a chaplain's assistant, was killed \non July 13, 2010, in Kandahar City, Afghanistan, from wounds suffered \nwhen the enemy attacked his unit with rifles, rocket-propelled \ngrenades, and small-arms fire. He was 34 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Sergeant Stout received several medals, \nawards, and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple \nHeart, two Army Commendation Medals, the Army Achievement Medal, three \nArmy Good Conduct Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, two \nAfghanistan Campaign Medals with Bronze Service Stars, the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas \nService Ribbon, the NATO Medal, and the Combat Action Badge.\n  Staff Sergeant Stout's commanding officer, chaplain CPT Ludovic O. \nFoyou, said this of his fallen comrade:\n\n       Staff Sergeant Christopher Stout was not just a chaplain \n     assistant; he was my friend, brother and shield of armor. His \n     immensely pure love for his fellow paratroopers epitomizes \n     the spirit of the Army Chaplain Corps. His love for his wife \n     Misty and three princesses, Jacqueline, Audreanna, and \n     Kristen, always kept a radiant smile on his face.\n\n  Christopher's hometown pastor, the Reverend Raymond Sharon of \nWorthville United Pentecostal Church, added:\n\n       [Chris] was just a fantastic good boy all the way around. \n     Faithful to church, faithful to his family, his wife.\n\n  Chris was born on New Year's Day in 1976 in Louisville and graduated \nfrom Carroll County High School.\n  His mother, Sharon Neuner, remembers Chris's childhood fondly:\n\n       We had some hard times because I was a single parent . . . \n     but those things just brought us closer together. Our song \n     name was ``You and Me Against the World.'' I remember you \n     used to want name-brand things that we couldn't afford, so \n     you went to work in an elderly woman's flower garden. You \n     weeded, painted, and mowed lawns to get money for those name-\n     brand things. In doing so, you learned that it isn't the \n     clothes or the shoes that make the man, but who you are as a \n     person that makes you a great man.\n\n  Chris was an accomplished singer and often preached the gospel at \nWorthville United Pentecostal Church. He joined the Army in 1997 and \noriginally served as a parachute rigger with the 782nd Main Support \nBattalion at Fort Bragg, NC. In September of 2006, at his request, he \nwas reclassified as a chaplain's assistant. From 2007 to 2008, he \ndeployed with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 82nd Airborne \nDivision, until in 2009 he was reassigned to 1st Battalion, 508th \nParachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne \nDivision, based out of Fort Bragg. It was with this unit that Chris \ndeployed to Afghanistan for what would be his final deployment.\n  In late July 2010, shortly after he was killed, his family, friends, \nand those who wished to pay their respects gathered at the veterans \nmemorial in General Butler State Park in Carrollton, KY, to remember \nChristopher Stout.\n  Daughter Jacqueline Stout sang ``Amazing Grace'' in his honor to a \ncrowd of nearly 500.\n  Chaplain LTC David Graetz told the crowd that Chris lived by the \nchaplain's motto ``Pro Deo et Patria''--Latin for the phrase ``For God \nand Country.''\n  The Reverend Raymond Sharon of Chris's hometown church also spoke. \n``He is a hero,'' Reverend Sharon said of Chris. ``He has set an \nexample for all the young people here today. Nothing can stop you from \naccomplishing in life a great place in society, as Chris has done. \nChris stood for the truth. He lived it. He talked it.''\n  With that, the crowd stood at respectful attention for the firing of \na three-volley salute by the American Legion Post No. 41, followed by a \nbugler playing ``Taps.'' Then the Carroll County judge-executive \nunveiled for Chris's family a brick to be placed in the veterans \nmemorial to honor his sacrifice.\n  His mother said:\n\n       Thank you, Chris. You gave your all. I hope my mind stays \n     healthy so that I always have my memories of your smiling \n     blue eyes, your warm smile, those dimples and freckles, and \n     our time of you and me against the world. Those will have to \n     do me until we meet again at Heaven's gates.\n\n  We are thinking of Chris's family today as I share his story with my \ncolleagues, including his wife Misty, his daughters Jacqueline, \nAudreanna, and Kristen, his parents Sharon and Billy Neuner, and many \nother beloved family members and friends. I wish for them to know that \nthis Senate is privileged to pay tribute to SSG Christopher T. Stout \nfor his life of service in honor of the ideals of ``Pro Deo et \nPatria''--``For God and Country.'' We recognize his service, and we \nhonor his ultimate sacrifice. He truly was a man of God who died \ndefending our country. Kentucky is proud to call this good and faithful \nservant one of our own, and we mourn his loss.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, while Senator McConnell is still here in \nthe Senate Chamber, I wish to follow up on his comments about the loss \nof Christopher Stout.\n  My wife and I have a son of our own named Christopher. He is roughly \n10 years younger than Christopher Stout at his death. So as soon as \nSenator McConnell began talking about the loss of his life, it \nresonated with me as a father. It also resonated with me as a former \ncommander chief in the National Guard for 8 years and as a Navy veteran \nwho served three tours in Southeast Asia in the Vietnam war.\n  Sometimes we don't focus enough on what is being accomplished by our \nservice men and women such as Christopher Stout and their service to \nour country in Afghanistan and our purpose there. Our role has been to \ngo into a place in which 9/11 attacks were conceived and guided, \nkilling thousands of Americans. Our purpose is, as we draw down on our \ntroops there at the end of this year, to be down to about 9,800 troops, \nroughly half a year from now, and even fewer in the years to come. But \nour goal is threefold; that is, when we leave, we leave behind not only \na place that is less likely to foment and launch attacks against this \ncountry or any other country, but also we leave behind a country that \ncan feed itself, defend itself, and govern itself.\n\n  The Presiding Officer was adjutant general for the State of Montana, \nand he understands full well, having served in combat and for a long \nperiod of time, the importance of the role the Christopher Stouts have \nplayed and the reverence we hold for them and for their service in life \nand beyond.\n  I also hasten to add in following up on the minority leader's \ncomments, there are some things we had in the military. I served 5 \nyears Active Duty, 18 years Reserve as a P-3 aircraft naval flight \nofficer and later as a mission commander. There are some things we had \nin the military that frankly a lot of people in this country haven't \nhad for too many years. Until last year about 40 million people in this \ncountry did not have health care. They did not have access to health \ncare, and we have changed that. We have changed that dramatically.\n  Does everybody have access to affordable health care today? No, but \nwe no longer have 40 million people anxious to get access to health \ncare. That has been cut by roughly one-quarter. We will reduce it again \nthis year and again next year, but among the things we had in the \nmilitary is an annual physical. The idea is that you actually get an \nannual physical in your birthday month. My birthday month is January. I \ngot my first annual physical, I think, when I was 17 from a Navy \ndoctor, and I got them for years and years after that.\n  A lot of people in this country, including people on Medicare--they \ncould have lived to be 105--and until about 3 years ago with the option \nof the Affordable Care Act they got one annual physical paid for by \nMedicare when they turned 65 and joined Medicare. That was it. It was \ncalled the Welcome to Medicare physical. If they could have lived \nanother 40 years, they would have gotten another one paid for by \nMedicare.\n  The reason the military provides annual physicals for its members, \nActive Duty and Reserve, is in order to catch health care problems when \nthey are small, when they can be treated, and we do this to save money. \nI served in the military and in and out of military bases all over the \ncountry, all over the world, and in almost every one of them there was \nnot just a doctor, a Navy corpsman and so forth, but there was a place \nto go--if you had a problem and needed medical attention, you could get \nit--a clinic. Today we have thousands and thousands of clinics all over \nthis country where people, whether they have 5 cents or $5 or $50 to \ntheir name, have health care coverage. They can go get primary health \ncare. They can get primary health care. We have grown dramatically \naccess to primary health care in places all over America, not just \nDelaware but all the other 49 States as well.\n  There has been a lot of attention on the VA, some of the very \ndisappointing circumstances that are going on in Phoenix and other \nplaces such as that in terms of waiting lists, and they need to be \naggressive and they will be, but one of the great innovations the VA \ncame up with 15 or more years ago was electronic health care records.\n  When I was in the Navy and on Active Duty, and the Presiding Officer \nmay remember, we used to carry around with us--roughly this size--a \nbrown manila folder, and it included my medical records for years, from \nthe time I got my first physical as a 17-year-old Navy midshipman until \nmy last one. People on Active Duty don't carry these around anymore. We \nhave electronic health records pioneered by the VA and now we have them \nin the Department of Defense. The reason we have them is because it \nenables us to better coordinate delivery of health care to people who \notherwise may not have it. The Affordable Care Act actually introduces \nfor the first time for millions of people electronic health care \nrecords, not for them to carry around or access necessarily--although, \nin some cases they can--but so the people providing care for them can \ndo it in a better coordinated and smarter way and a more cost-effective \nway, providing better results for less money.\n  The other thing we had in the military was the medicine. If someone \nneeded to take medicine, prescription medicines or that sort of thing, \nthey could actually get a medicine that was going to help them, keep \nthem well or help them stay well, be productive. We adopted about 7 or \n8 years ago the primary Medicare Part D prescription drug program in \nMedicare which has turned out to be a great success, although they had \na big problem with it when people would fall into the doughnut hole. A \nlot of folks who got pretty good coverage for maybe the first half of \nthe year would lose their coverage and have to pay. They didn't get any \nhelp from Medicare Part D. We started fixing--filling the doughnut \nhole--with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and over the next 6 \nor 7 years we will complete fixing that doughnut hole and people will \nnot fall off the cliff, the Medicare Part D participants, as they have \nbeen, because of what is in the Affordable Care Act. Do you know who \npays for that? The pharmaceutical companies pay for that, not the \ntaxpayers. The pharmaceutical companies pay for that expansion, making \nMedicare Part D a good program, cost-effective, under budget, and 85 \npercent of the people who use it like it. All of those things coincide \nwith the benefits we enjoyed in the military, and they are made \navailable in part and parcel for more people through the adoption of \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  Are there problems with the Affordable Care Act? Sure there are. Are \nthere things we need to fix? Sure we should. Will Sylvia Mathews \nBurwell help us fix those? She will provide great leadership. She and \nI, interestingly, have our lives intertwined in a strange way. We found \nout when I first met her. I called Erskine Bowles. I learned over 1 \nyear ago the President had nominated Sylvia Mathews Burwell to be \nPresident Obama's OMB Director. I noticed she had worked in the Clinton \nWhite House with Erskine Bowles when he was Chief of Staff to President \nClinton the second term.\n  So I called Erskine, and I said: Tell me about Sylvia Mathews \nBurwell.\n  He said: I will tell you about Sylvia Mathews Burwell. I have known \npeople as smart as Sylvia. I have known people who are as good at \nworking with other people as Sylvia is. I have known people as good as \nSylvia at getting things done. I have not known one person who does all \nthree of those things as well as she does.\n  He told me a story when she was working as Bob Rubin's right-hand \nperson, top assistant. Bob Rubin was then the Secretary of the \nTreasury. President Clinton was meeting with Chief of Staff Erskine \nBowles, Bob Rubin, the\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\nSecretary of the Treasury. Bob Rubin had one of his top aides with him, \nSylvia Burwell. Erskine recounted the story of how the President was \ngrilling Treasury Secretary Rubin on a particular issue and Secretary \nRubin was kind of struggling to respond in an appropriate way to the \nPresident's inquiries. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the assistant, wrote a \nnote, and when the President was not looking, handed it discreetly to \nadvise Bob Rubin, who glanced at the note and then reengaged the \nPresident on the issue, and the President said: That is a brilliant \ninsight. That is really a brilliant insight, Bob.\n  Erskine Bowles, not to be deterred, said to the President: Mr. \nPresident, Sylvia wrote a note and gave it to him. That is how he was \nable to give you that answer.\n  If I had people as smart as Sylvia on my staff, I would look a lot \nsmarter too. But she covered herself with glory in those years at the \nWhite House. She finished up. This is a gal who grew up in Hinton, WV, \na little coal mining town on the New River where I lived when I was 4 \nyears old. Her husband Stephen proposed to her at the Blue Stone Dam on \nthe New River where my grandfather and father used to take me as a \nlittle boy to fish.\n\n  She later graduated from Hinton High School, a public high school, a \nlittle coal mining town. Where did she go to school? She went to \nHarvard. After that where did she go to school? She was a Rhodes \nScholar. She went to Oxford, and she came out and she went to work for \na great consulting company, McKinsey & Company, and started working in \nthe White House doing all kinds of things during the Clinton \nadministration, higher and higher responsibilities, ending up as OMB \nDeputy Director the last part of the year, when we actually had four \nbalanced budgets in a row, if you will recall.\n  She knows how to manage. She knows how to manage people, she knows \nhow to manage financial resources, and she is terrific working with \npeople. That is why Senator Tom Coburn, my wingman in terms of \nleadership on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental \nAffairs, actually came along with Senator Jay Rockefeller from West \nVirginia, actually came, a Republican and a Democrat, to introduce her \nfor her confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, on \nwhich I served, to endorse her candidacy. I thank Dr. Coburn for doing \nthat. One would expect Senator Rockefeller to do that. He has been a \nlongstanding huge fan, but Senator Coburn and I have only gotten to \nknow her for the last year and a half and have loved working with her \nand think she has done a terrific job at OMB and that she will do a \nterrific job at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  I wish to say a special thank-you to her parents who are still alive \nand who still live in Hinton, WV, a real thank-you for raising not one \nbut two young women, including Sylvia's younger sister Stephanie, for \ninstilling the kind of values and the kind of education in them that \nhas enabled them both to go on and do extraordinary things with their \nlife.\n  I say thank you to Stephen, who proposed marriage to then-Sylvia \nMathews at that Blue Stone Dam on the New River all those years ago. I \nthank him for sharing his wife with our country. These are tough jobs, \ndemanding jobs, and in some cases thankless jobs, and he is willing to \ntake on some extra responsibility as a dad in helping to raise their \nchildren, both under the age of 10. I think Helene is about 6 and I \nthink the younger daughter is maybe 4 years old. They know their mom is \nchanging jobs. They know she still has a job. If we confirm her today, \nit is a huge job.\n  Is there work to do? Sure, there is. Is there work to do in \nimplementing the Affordable Care Act? Sure, there is. Is there work to \ndo in tweaking it and making it better? Sure, there is.\n  I will close with this for my Republican friends--and I love them \nall. For my Republican friends who moan and groan about the enormous \nburden the Affordable Care Act is putting on the American people, let \nme say this: I have a friend who if you ask him: How are you doing, \nsays: Compared to what?\n  If things are so bad now with the Affordable Care Act, let's just \nsay: Compared to what?\n  Here is where we were 3 or 4 years ago. The country of Japan spends 8 \npercent of their GDP on health care. We spent 18 percent, until \nrecently, with the Affordable Care Act. They get better results, higher \nrates of longevity, lower rates of infant mortality, arguably better \nresults than we did until at least a couple of years ago, and in Japan \nthey cover everybody. Until this year we had about 40 million people \nwho went to bed at night who did not have health care coverage.\n  I regret that anybody who is inconvenienced or disadvantaged all \nbecause of the adoption of the Affordable Care Act. I regret it for \nevery one of those people, but you know what. I regret that all those \nfolks in this country, tens of millions of them, didn't have access to \nhealth care. I regret the fact that all those people on Medicare never \ngot a second physical, and if they had gotten one, they would have a \nmuch better life. I regret that all the folks in the Medicare \nprescription drug program--millions of senior citizens--fell into the \ndoughnut hole and stopped taking their medicines and got sick, had to \nbe hospitalized, and ended up in nursing homes. It cost a lot of money \nand they died with not a happy life. I feel badly for them.\n  My dad used to say to us, rather than moan about our problems, fix \nthem--fix them. There are plenty of things we can do to make the \nAffordable Care Act better. I know what they are. But the idea about \ngoing back to where we were? That dog doesn't hunt. It is not a good \nthing in Delaware and I don't think it is a good thing in Kentucky, \nwhere Gov. Steven Beshear has led, provided great leadership in his \nState to make sure the hundreds of thousands of people who needed \nhealth care have it today who didn't have it before.\n  We want to make sure the opportunity they have realized in Kentucky \nand those States that don't have that opportunity, that have no \nexchange to sign up in--they have no expansion of the Medicaid \nProgram--my hope is they will look to Kentucky as an example and to \nDelaware as an example, to see what we can do for our people.\n  Last point. Most of the people who serve here are people of faith--\nsome are Protestant, some are Catholic, some are Jewish, different \nreligions. Most people here are people of faith. Most of our sacred \nScriptures have a couple things in common. One of the things they have \nin common is the Golden Rule. Chaplain Barry Black, who gives the \nopening prayer most days the Senate is in session, likes to say that \nthe Golden Rule is: Treat other people the way you want to be treated, \nlove thy neighbor as thyself. He says those are the CliffsNotes of the \nNew Testament. As it turns out, the Golden Rule is the CliffsNotes of \nevery major religion in the world. I don't care if you are Protestant, \nCatholic, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, almost all of them have \nsomething like the Golden Rule in their sacred Scriptures.\n  In the New Testament, in the Book of Matthew, Matthew 25, there is \nsomething we have all heard. Not everybody knows where it came from or \neven that it is in the Bible, but it is. The Scripture talks about, \nwhen I was hungry, did you feed me? When I was thirsty, did you give me \nto drink? When I was naked, did you clothe me? When I was sick and in \nprison, did you come to see me?\n  Matthew 25 doesn't say anything about when I had no health care, and \nwhen I had to depend on the emergency room for health care when I got \nvery sick and ran up a big tab that somebody else had to pay for \nbecause I was hospitalized for a while--a long while. It doesn't say \nthat in Matthew 25, but the intent is the same.\n  Where were you? We were here, and we voted to try to do something \nabout it, to make sure people did have better access to health care, \nand we can improve on what we have done and we need to do that. We have \na moral imperative to the least of these in our society to look out for \nthem, to help them look out for themselves as well. We also have the \nfiscal imperative given our budget constraints to meet that moral \nimperative in a fiscally responsible way. Sylvia Mathews Burwell \nunderstands that as well as anybody I know. She has demonstrated that \nin her leadership in OMB. She will demonstrate that if we confirm her \ntoday to be the Secretary at the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will follow the \nleadership of Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, and his \nwingman Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware, in supporting this \nnomination.\n  With that, I yield back the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this afternoon we are going to vote on \nthe nomination of Ms. Burwell to be the Secretary of HHS. I am going to \nsupport that nomination. I am here on the floor to alert people to some \nof the problems she will face and hopefully she can correct.\n  For starters, I hope that everybody remembers the government has \nchecks and balances. Congress passes laws, the executive branch \nenforces them, and it is our responsibility to make sure that those \nlaws are enforced according to the intent of Congress. When they are \nnot enforced, we have a responsibility to point that out, and that is \nwhat I will be doing. I hope she will be able to correct the issues \nthat my colleagues and I will be pointing out this morning.\n  We also have a situation where Congress passed the Affordable Care \nAct, and in that process the President has done a lot of things that \nsome of us think are illegal and in some cases even unconstitutional. \nHopefully, she, as the new director, will make sure that those \npractices don't continue.\n  When Ms. Burwell was nominated, I said that anyone put in charge of \nObamaCare would be set up to fail. The theme of this law has really \nbeen ``by any means necessary.'' In other words, it doesn't really \nmatter what the law says, do whatever it takes to get this program \nunderway: the President can fix it later. He has done that 38 times--\nand surely sometimes contrary to what the law says and contrary to the \noath he took to uphold the laws of this country: The legislative \nprocess was certainly, by no means, necessary; if you want to change \nit, change it.\n  The implementation of this law has operated similarly. The department \nwe are considering Ms. Burwell to lead has ignored the plain read of \nthe statute whenever it was considered necessary. In other words, don't \nbother to come to Congress to correct something you think is not \nworking; just correct it yourself. Deadlines were considered to be \nwritten in pencil.\n  If the statute needed to be creatively reinterpreted to make the \nprogram work, the Department of HHS did so, and that still continues \ntoday. Consequently, that is why I am pleading with Ms. Burwell to \nchange things.\n  The Department is supposed to implement the employer mandate, which \nis a year overdue, and it has been significantly altered from the \nstatute. The Department is supposed to implement risk corridors this \nyear, although the legal authority to distribute funds is questionable \nand the standards used to make those distributions will likely be kept \nvery quiet.\n  Speaking of things that will be kept quiet, Congress is going to want \nto know what the premiums will be next year for health insurance. We \nconsider the information very important and relevant.\n  My State of Iowa is considered to be one of the States most at risk \nfor premium spikes. The Department will want to use any means necessary \nto hide the premiums until after the November elections unless, of \ncourse, the premium numbers are good, and then I am sure the Department \nwill shout them from the rooftops, much as they did with enrollment \nnumbers.\n  We have heard over and over about enrollment numbers, but the \nenrollment numbers don't tell the whole story--not even close. I was \nunder the impression that the law was supposed to increase coverage and \nlower costs. So far that is not the case. The independent research firm \nMcKinsey found that 74 percent of the people getting coverage through \nObamaCare plans were previously insured. If those numbers are accurate, \nthat means one in four people getting coverage was previously \nuninsured. Certainly that is what I hear from my constituents. They \nhave had to change their coverage, and often that coverage has been \nmuch more expensive.\n  Furthermore, the McKinsey research also found that the majority of \npeople who shopped for an ObamaCare plan but did not purchase that plan \ncited affordability as the No. 1 reason for not buying that insurance.\n  A poll released by the Kaiser Foundation found that roughly 4 in 10 \nuninsured Americans named affordability as their primary reason for \ngoing without health insurance. It is not working as it was intended.\n  I hope Ms. Burwell will change the relationship the Department has \nwith Congress. I hope she will be willing to break the ``by any means \nnecessary'' mindset that we have seen for the last 5 years. I hope she \ndoesn't disappear into the bunker over there in that office building \nand that we will never hear from her again.\n  Her challenge is very severe. The law appears to be shifting around \nthe previously insured more than it is covering the previously \nuninsured. The previously uninsured are citing costs as a primary \nreason for not purchasing insurance.\n  I will support the nomination of Ms. Burwell today and hope that down \nthe road--several months from now--I am not sorry I did that. I think \nshe is a person who has the capability of turning things around, and \nthat she will do that. But the law remains far from being worthy of \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the ObamaCare train wreck just keeps \nrolling on. Every day it seems there is another story about another \nObamaCare failure.\n  Mr. President, 80,000 Oregonians must reenroll in health plans after \nthe State's ObamaCare exchange site failed. The health care coverage of \n2 million Americans enrolled on the exchanges could be in jeopardy.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says there have been so many delays \nand changes to ObamaCare that it can no longer estimate the fiscal \neffects of the law. And that is just the ObamaCare news from yesterday. \nThe Democrats' victory lap is a distant memory replaced by the constant \nflow of stories about ObamaCare's many failures. Americans are losing \ntheir health insurance, Americans are losing their doctors, Americans \nare unable to obtain medications, employers are facing higher costs, \nand employees are facing higher costs. The list goes on.\n  The President promised that his health care law was going to be a \nsolution for American families. If they liked their health care plans \nand their doctors, they could keep them. If they didn't like their \nhealth care or if they didn't have health care, they would be able to \nget an affordable plan. Those were the promises that were made.\n  Unfortunately, Americans quickly discovered those promises were not \nto be kept. Millions of Americans were forced off their health care \nplans and into the exchanges where they frequently found they were \npaying more and getting less. Too many Americans discovered their new \nhealth care coverage meant losing doctors and hospitals they liked and \nthat their choice of replacement was limited.\n  When the President was campaigning for his health care law, he \nclaimed families would see their health care premiums drop by $2,500. \nIn fact, health care premiums have increased by almost $3,700 under the \nPresident, and they are still going up.\n  Middle-class Americans are hurting. The past 5\\1/2\\ years of the \nObama administration have brought higher prices and fewer \nopportunities. Gas prices have almost doubled. Food prices have risen. \nMeanwhile, Americans' household income has declined by more than $3,500 \non the President's watch. So Americans who once confidently expected to \nbe able to put their children through college and retire comfortably \nare now struggling to make ends meet. Too many families are living \npaycheck\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\nto paycheck, desperately praying they won't be faced with any \nunexpected bills. ObamaCare was supposed to make things better for \nthese families. It was supposed to make health care more affordable and \nease Americans' health concerns. Instead, it is making things much \nworse.\n  Today the Senate will vote on Sylvia Burwell's nomination to be \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. As much as \nDemocrats might want it to be true, a change in personnel at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services won't make the mess ObamaCare \nhas created disappear. Changing HHS Secretaries isn't going to lower \nAmericans' health care costs or give them back the doctor or the health \nplan they lost. It is not going to help the small businesses that are \nstruggling under ObamaCare's burdensome mandates or restore the $1 \ntrillion Americans will lose in wages, thanks to the health care law. \nIt is not going to bring back the jobs that have been lost as a result \nof ObamaCare.\n  Every Senator who voted for this law owes the American people an \nexplanation. Every Senator who voted for this law ought to be telling \nAmerican families what he or she is going to do to fix this mess. \nAmericans deserve better than ObamaCare, and we could give them better \nthan ObamaCare, if Members of the Senate would decide this was the \nwrong approach and decide to go in a different direction. I hope \neventually they will come to that conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with huge \nconcerns about the Obama health care law. I do it as a physician, as a \ndoctor, who has taken care of families all around the State of Wyoming \nfor a couple of decades; as a past president of our State medical \nsociety; as someone committed to preventive care, coordinated care; as \nthe medical director of the Wyoming health fairs to give people low-\ncost screenings for health care around the State Those continue today. \nThere is one in the small community of Afton, WY, this very Saturday--2 \ndays from today. So the effort continues to actually make sure people \ncan get prevention, early recognition of problems, and actual care.\n  The President's health care law hasn't done that. The President keeps \nfocusing on the word ``coverage'' instead of what people wanted, which \nwas care. It is interesting today, because in the Wyoming Tribune \nEagle, front page, today's newspaper, headline: Health-care law plagued \nby inconsistencies. At least 2 million people, the headline says, \nenrolled in insurance have problems with data that could affect their \ncoverage. This is an Associated Press article on the front page of the \nWyoming Tribune Eagle. A huge paperwork headache for the government \ncould also be jeopardizing coverage for some of the people who just got \nhealth insurance under the President's health care law.\n  The President went on television 4 days before the kickoff of the \nexchanges and said this is going to be easier to use than amazon.com. \nHe said that. It is cheaper than your cell phone bill. And, of course, \nhe said people could keep their doctor if they liked their doctor.\n  When people see how this rolled out and the problems they have had \nwith it, they now have huge concerns about whether they can actually \ntrust the Federal Government with anything. They see all of the \nproblems coming out of Washington and they are saying, Why should we \ntrust the government, the Washington-based government, with anything?\n  Let's take a look at some of the States that set up their own \nexchange. Yesterday's Wall Street Journal: State Exchanges Seek Costly \nFix. Five States that launched health exchanges under the Affordable \nCare Act expect to spend as much as $240 million to fix their sites or \nswitch to the Federal marketplace.\n  Not one person is going to get care because of that. That is $240 \nmillion to fix the bad sites that have already wasted money. How can \npeople in these States of Oregon, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Maryland, \nNevada--how can they say this is good for them? This health care law--\nfor people who wanted the care they need from a doctor they choose at \nlower cost find more wasted government money--in Oregon alone, $255 \nmillion, money previously spent. The FBI is investigating them now in \nOregon because of this. They say they want more money to upgrade the \nsystem. Minnesota: $141 million. What are we hearing from Minnesota? We \nare hearing school districts say we have to pay a lot more, so we are \nnot going to be able to pay for teachers. We are not going to be able \nto pay for bus drivers. We are going to have to take it away from \nstudents to pay for the mistakes of this administration, this \ngovernment, this law forced down the throats of the American public and \nvoted for by many in this Chamber who never read it. They never read \nthe bill, because they trusted Nancy Pelosi. She said, First you have \nto pass it before you get to find out what is in it.\n  We don't have to turn the clock back very far to go to the June 4 \narticle posted in Roll Call, the local paper. Headline: Fiscal \ndiagnosis--now, as a physician we do a physical diagnosis, but they are \ntalking about a fiscal diagnosis: Fiscal Diagnosis Only Gets Tougher \nfor Health Care Law. The first paragraph says, For Democratic lawmakers \nwho were hesitant to sign onto this sweeping 2010 health care law, one \nof the most powerful selling points was that the Affordable Care Act \nwould \nactually reduce the federal budget deficit . . .\n  Four years later, headline: Fiscal Diagnosis Only Gets Tougher for \nHealth Care Law.\n\n  So we can talk about all of those numbers, but I want to talk about \npeople who have actually been hurt by the health care law. There are \npeople who have been helped, but there are many who have been hurt. \nPeople in my State--thousands and thousands--have had letters of \ncancellation. If they have gone onto the Web site and bought insurance, \nthey found they paid a lot more for what they had to buy, because a lot \nof times it wasn't actually what they needed for themselves or for \ntheir family or what was best for them; it included coverage they would \nnever use and don't want but still had to pay for, because the \nPresident seems to think he knows better what that family in Wyoming \nwants or needs than they do. That is not what America was built on--the \ngovernment telling people what they have to buy, what they have to \nchoose, what they have to have as their health insurance or their care.\n  It is interesting that even National Public Radio has a story about a \ncouple, a family--because one of my colleagues from Connecticut comes \nto the floor and says he thinks ObamaCare is working. This couple says \nit doesn't work--does not work. ``Frustrated By The Affordable Care \nAct, One Family Opts Out.'' This is a family in Texas, reported on \nNational Public Radio. Rachel's husband wanted to make sure they had \ninsurance. Rachel was skeptical, but Nick, her husband, went on line \nand started shopping. He had a lot of trouble getting through the \nglitchy Web site at first, but eventually he found a plan that would \nwork just for his wife. He was concerned about his wife. She was \npregnant. So this past January, as soon as the plan began, Nick printed \nout a list of obstetricians from the plan's Web sites. He said: I \nhanded it to Rachel, fully confident, fully feeling like I had \naccomplished something for her, I had come through for my wife.\n  Well, they called obstetricians because she was pregnant. Some would \njust say, We don't take Obama. One of the best was: ``The doctor takes \nit here in the actual practice, but whatever hospital you use''--none \nof those hospitals take ObamaCare.\n  She said: It was mind numbing, because I was sitting there thinking, \nI am paying close to $400 a month just for me to have insurance that \ndoesn't even work. What am I paying for?\n  How could this not be working, her husband said. The United States \nGovernment has set this up. It is this whole big deal, he said. They \nare having commercials everywhere saying we need to use this, and these \npeople are just saying, no, no, no, and it just made me so mad.\n  So, as the headline says, they opted out.\n  That is what the President has given the American people; not \naffordable care, not available care, not quality care, not access to \ncare but a lot of promises not delivered upon. Many people across this \ncountry have been hurt by this health care law.\n\n[[Page S3440]]\n\n  I am going to continue to work on ways to reform health care in \nAmerica in a way that is good for patients as well as the providers who \ntake care of them, and responsible for the American taxpayers.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Wyoming, Dr. Barrasso, \nhas been talking about a lot of the issues related to the Affordable \nCare Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare. He has talked about the fact \nthat the mandates in this legislation don't work for many Americans. \nThe one-size-fits-all approach that was taken doesn't work in my State \nof Ohio and around the country.\n  He also spoke about the cost. Unfortunately, it is not the Affordable \nCare Act; it tends to be, for a lot of people, the unaffordable care \nact. Costs have gone up already too high. We are now finding a lot of \nsmall businesses in my home State of Ohio are simply squeezed to the \npoint where they are worried whether they will be able to provide \nhealth care at all, given the huge increases in cost.\n  These are all very serious concerns and reasons that I think we need \nto repeal and replace with policies that work better to provide people \nmore choices and provide people lower cost of care so they can get \nhealth care for themselves and their families.\n  I want to talk about a very specific aspect of ObamaCare and its \nimplementation that concerns me. I came to the floor a couple of days \nago to talk about this because I had just learned, actually from some \npress reports, about some potential problems with implementation. \nUnfortunately, since that time it has been confirmed through other \nsources that many of my concerns are legitimate. The concern is very \nsimple: That despite assurances by the administration to the contrary, \nthey have yet to put in place a mechanism to assure that the people who \nare getting the subsidies under ObamaCare are eligible for them. This \nis a major problem because we are talking about billions and billions \nof dollars. It is a surprise, probably, to a lot of my constituents and \nother folks who might be listening today that the administration hasn't \neven put in place the basic processes, the mechanisms we would expect \nin an automated system, to ensure that when people apply for these \nsubsidies--which are substantial; up to 400 percent of poverty, \nremember, and up to 10,000 bucks for a family of 4, for instance--that \nthey may or may not be eligible and yet they may be getting these \npayments. Some people may be overstating their income and some people \nmay be understating their income, and some folks may get a very \nunfortunate surprise of a big tax bill because of it.\n  It is unbelievable that after a few years of implementation, still \nthere is not in place some sort of a system to ensure that the right \npeople are getting these huge amounts of taxpayer dollars. Improper \npayments of these subsidies may be going, we are told, to over a \nmillion people who aren't eligible to receive them. Yesterday the \nAssociated Press reported that the number is actually closer to 2 \nmillion people who are receiving subsidies, despite apparent \ndiscrepancies between what they are submitting--the data they are \ngiving about their income information--and what the IRS already has. By \nthe way, the Health and Human Services folks and CMS confirmed this \nreport yesterday when they said: ``The typical family of four generated \n21 separate pieces of information that required verification, and all \nwere attested to under penalty of perjury.'' Given that we expect this \nsubsidy program to cost about $36 billion this year alone, these \nimproper payments would likely result in billions of wasted taxpayer \ndollars.\n  So at the very least, I am concerned that folks are going to find \nthey have some very unpleasant and unexpected tax bills coming up, and \nthe most we are seeing is a lot of taxpayer dollars that aren't going \nto the intended purpose.\n  It is not as if we did not anticipate this problem. This is obviously \nsomething a lot of people thought about and talked about. In fact, we \nknew it would be difficult to verify all these dozens of pieces of \ninformation we just heard about from CMS. That is why last year \nCongress acted in a bipartisan fashion to require the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to certify that it had these controls in \nplace to verify the eligibility of subsidy recipients. We enshrined \nthat requirement in law as part of what was called the Continuing \nAppropriations Act--better known as the Ryan-Murray budget agreement--\nat the end of last year. Part of the Ryan-Murray budget agreement was \nto say that CMS at HHS had to have in place these controls to ensure \npeople were getting the funds that were appropriate for them.\n  On January 1, as required by law, Secretary Sebelius certified to \nCongress ``that the American Health Benefit Exchanges [the so-called \nmarketplaces] verify that applicants for advance payments of the \npremium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions are eligible for such \npayments and reductions, consistent with the requirements of [the \nAffordable Care Act].'' So Secretary Sebelius made certain commitments \nthere. She also further told Congress that the exchanges had \n``implemented numerous systems and processes to carry out'' their \nverification responsibilities, including their income verification \nresponsibilities. So this is an assurance given to us by the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services. We are now learning through reports in \nthe press--which were spurred by confidential sources within HHS, by \nthe way--that these verification methods are not in place or, if they \nare, they are very poorly functioning at best. In fact, HHS is planning \nto begin the verification process--here we are 5 months later--for some \nof this information by hand at some point in the future.\n  When I learned of these reports--and they have been in the Washington \nPost and they have been in Politico--I hoped they were mistaken. So I \nwrote to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. I also wrote to \nthe IRS Commissioner--this was last month--asking if these allegations \nwere true and, if they were, what HHS was planning on doing about them.\n  If the Post or Politico got the story wrong, I would have expected a \nquick response saying: No, these reports are wrong. The internal \nreports they are referring to are inaccurate.\n  But instead I did not get an answer. I gave them until June 1 to give \nme an answer, to give them some time to get back to me. It is now June \n5 and I have received nothing--nothing to address my concerns. In fact, \nI have received no answer at all. I know some of my colleagues have \nraised similar concerns without receiving answers. Like so many issues \nthat have arisen with the implementation of ObamaCare, the \nadministration's response has been nothing but silence and \nstonewalling--no transparency.\n  We do not have time for political games. The American people do not \nhave time for it. We have true budget pressures. Folks are already \npaying a lot in terms of income taxes. They do not want to pay more. \nThey certainly do not want the income taxes they are paying going to \nfolks who are not eligible for this $36 billion worth of benefits going \nout this year.\n  Since the administration refuses to voluntarily provide the \ninformation we need to do our job overseeing the expenditure of these \nfunds, I think serious action is necessary. That is why today I am \nmaking a formal written request to HHS Inspector General Daniel R. \nLevinson to begin an investigation into these reports which call into \nquestion the accuracy of the Secretary's certification required, again, \nby the Continuing Appropriations Act, the Ryan-Murray legislation at \nthe end of the year.\n  I know the IG is scheduled to provide a report to Congress next month \nregarding how effective HHS has been in preventing subsidy payments on \nthe basis of inaccurate or fraudulent information, but in light of the \napparent inconsistencies between the Secretary's certification and the \nrecent media reports, I think a more in-depth and targeted \ninvestigation is warranted. The IG's office has promised that \n``ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent for their intended \npurposes'' under ObamaCare is its ``top priority.'' That is what that \nsaid. So these allegations certainly should strike at the very heart of \nthat mission.\n  If it is true that HHS has failed to implement a modern, effective \nsystem\n\n[[Page S3441]]\n\nfor verifying the eligibility of folks seeking subsidies, we need know \nabout it. They say sunlight is the best disinfectant. Well, I think \nthat is the case here. The best way to ensure that these tax dollars \nare not wasted is to simply get the information. Let us know what is \ngoing on.\n  I hope the Obama administration and, after her confirmation--I think \nshe will be confirmed--Secretary Burwell will show their commitment to \nresponsible government by joining me in calling for this investigation \nand responding quickly and accurately to whatever shortcomings it \nuncovers. But if the administration does not, then it will fall to \nthose of us in this Chamber on both sides of the aisle to take action. \nI sincerely hope it will not come to that.\n  I plan to support Director Burwell's nomination today because I think \nshe is a manager, and I think that is what we need right now at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. I would say this ought to be \none of her top priorities as the new manager at HHS--to ensure that the \nproblems we have seen with the implementation of ObamaCare do not \ncontinue and specifically that we are not seeing huge amounts of \ntaxpayer dollars being misspent, being wasted through inaccurate \nverification of these subsidies.\n  With that, I yield the floor for my colleague from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, at the very start of my comments, let me \nmake it clear that the nominee we are voting on today will have my \nsupport. I like her from a personal standpoint. I think she is \ncompetent. I think she is able to do the job that is before her. But I \ndo believe the problem she is going to face is that this law is so \nfatally flawed that she cannot be successful in implementing it.\n  The simple fact is that it is deeply flawed, and it was from the \nbeginning. The policy simply does not work. We know now that ObamaCare \ndrives up costs, it comes between the doctor and the patient, and it \nlimits health care choices for individuals and for their families. But \nI urge the new head of HHS--when and assuming she is confirmed--to \naddress all those things that are within her control.\n  It is critical that the new leader work to restore the transparency \nand accountability that has been lacking at this Department. One of the \nlatest has been mentioned in other comments by Senators, but it is \nespecially disturbing. It comes from the Washington Post. The article \nfrom the Post said: ``The government may be paying incorrect subsidies \nto more than 1 million Americans.'' Mr. President, 1 million Americans \nare getting incorrect subsidies. The article goes on to say that the \ncomputer systems necessary to verify individuals' income were either \ndefective or they were not even built. That calls into question \nSecretary Sebelius's commitment to Congress in January that, in fact, \nthe systems were ready and they were working.\n  Senator Moran and I wrote a letter. We asked for answers from HHS \nabout this news report. Well, nothing but crickets, no response \nwhatsoever.\n  Just yesterday the Associated Press reported that more than 1 in 4--\nor at least 2 million--ObamaCare exchange enrollees have data \ndiscrepancies, casting even more doubt on HHS's competency to \nadminister the ObamaCare subsidies.\n  Families could be in for a shock next April when the IRS notifies \nthem that they must repay money to the Treasury because HHS \nmiscalculated their subsidy. This is troubling because Nebraskans are \ndefinitely feeling the effect of ObamaCare, just like citizens across \nthe country. Let me talk about a couple of stories quickly.\n  A college instructor from Nebraska wrote to me saying:\n\n       Due to ObamaCare, I will be unable to teach more than two \n     courses per term.\n       Overall, I am losing at least 20 percent of my adjunct \n     income, and I will definitely be in a rough situation with \n     zero money coming in this summer.\n\n  Regarding ObamaCare, she explains:\n\n       We have a one-shoe-fits-all situation, and I don't wear \n     that shoe.\n\n  A young college student in Nebraska shared identical or similar \nconcerns. She says:\n\n       Through my job, I was previously able to work 32 hours a \n     week, but am now only allowed 28 hours.\n       That is a very significant amount of my already small \n     college student budget.\n\n  Americans like these constituents do not want a law that decreases \ntheir earnings and mandates Washington-prescribed insurance that costs \nmore with fewer benefits.\n  My colleagues and I stand ready to work toward a better health care \nalternative. We are committed to vigilant oversight of ObamaCare \nbecause Americans' health care and trillions in taxpayer dollars are at \nstake.\n  But it is my hope that Ms. Burwell, if confirmed, will reverse these \ntroubling patterns at HHS and provide Congress and the American people \nwith the responsiveness, the accountability, and the transparency this \npost requires.\n  With that, I yield the floor for my colleague, Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleague.\n  I serve as the ranking member of the Budget Committee and have worked \nwith Ms. Burwell in her now just 13 months, I think, of service in the \ntremendously important position of Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget. I do not believe she has the background, the qualities, and \nexperience--proven managerial leadership--required at that huge \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. She has 500 people working in \nthe budget office, and that is an important office. At HHS there are \nover 70,000. She once served on a board of a local hospital. She simply \nis not the person whom we need today to bring order out of the disarray \nwe have in the health care system of this country and the total \ncollapse of integrity and consistency in the implementation of \nObamaCare.\n  There are a couple things I care about, but I really think it time \nfor this administration to stop moving around insiders, political \nallies, and put some people in these critical positions capable of \noperating them at the highest possible level.\n  Ms. Burwell violated the Medicare trigger, for example. If the \ntrustees of Medicare issue a report that it is heading to insolvency, \nit is a critical matter. The administration by law is required within 2 \nweeks to submit a plan to fix Medicare. They have been submitting this \nreport for years.\n  As the President's director, under 31 U.S.C. 1105, Ms. Burwell was \nthe person responsible for submitting Medicare legislation to Congress. \nWe asked her about that before she was confirmed. During her hearings, \nshe said she would ``do everything in her power'' to comply with the \nFederal law. Yet, despite this assurance, she refused to comply with \nthe law and never submitted a plan. Don't we need a plan to fix \nMedicare? Don't we need the Chief Executive of America, through the \nbudget director, to submit a plan to fix it?\n  She also violated the law and denied Congress needed transparency \nwith respect to the health care law, the ObamaCare law. The Omnibus \nappropriations bill signed into law in January required HHS to include \nin its fiscal year 2015 budget a detailed accounting of spending to \nimplement the health law. But neither the budget director, Ms. Burwell, \nnor the agency she now will head submitted sufficient information to \ncomply with that.\n  My time is up, but I will say that I am very much taken with Ms. \nBurwell. She is a delightful person. Many of my colleagues think highly \nof her, and some, like our West Virginia Senators and others, really \nthink she will do a good job. But this is not the right position for \nher. This government is drifting into disarray in a whole host of ways. \nWe need the strongest possible, capable leader, with proven health care \nmanagerial experience for the good of America and for the good of \nPresident Obama. This is not the right nominee.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first let me comment on Sylvia Burwell, \nthe nominee who is before us. She has done an excellent job as the \nDirector of OMB. Her credentials are incredible. She is acknowledged by \nboth Democrats and Republicans as being an outstanding manager, a \nperson who is fully capable to manage HHS, an extremely important \nagency that has over 70,000 workers who work for Health and Human \nServices, has a\n\n[[Page S3442]]\n\nbudget of over $1 trillion, and 11 Federal agencies. Sylvia Burwell is \nthe right person to manage that agency and to move it forward in \ncarrying out the very important work of our country.\n  For Maryland, I take pride because some of the agencies are \nheadquartered in my State. The National Institutes of Health--world \nclass. The best research in the world is done right here as a result of \nU.S. leadership, and that comes under HHS.\n  The FDA, which insures us safe products in food and drugs, is \nheadquartered in Maryland. But, again, that is world class--the best in \nthe world. It is important that we get the very best person as our \nSecretary, and Sylvia Burwell is that person.\n  CMS is headquartered in Baltimore, with Medicare and Medicaid--over \n100 million people. Again, it is the best in the world. So I am very \npleased that Sylvia Burwell is willing to step forward at this time to \nhead that agency. I encourage my colleagues to confirm her nomination. \nWe will have that vote a little later today.\n  I wanted to take a moment to thank Secretary Sebelius for her service \nto our country. Through very difficult times--and these have not been \neasy political times--she has steered a very steady ship at HHS and did \nthis country proud. I thank her very much for her service to our \ncountry and for helping the hundreds of millions who have benefited \nfrom the services at HHS.\n  But a significant part of the mission at HHS is the implementation of \nthe Affordable Care Act of 2010. I have heard my colleagues talk about \nit, so let me point out how much progress we have made. What a \ndifference the Affordable Care Act has made. I would urge the people in \nthis country to look at the facts. My colleagues make comments that \njust are not true. Look at the facts. The growth of health care costs \nhas gone down. The projected expenses are less today than they were in \n2010 when we passed the Affordable Care Act.\n  We have bent the cost curve of health care. Yes, the Affordable Care \nAct has helped us do it. One of the reasons is we have more people who \nhave health insurance today and who have third-party payment. They go \nto doctors rather than emergency rooms. That brings down the growth \nrate of health care costs. We are keeping people healthier. That was \nthe whole concept of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Unfortunately, for my friends on the other side of the aisle, their \nanswer is: Repeal, repeal, repeal. They have no plan for health care. \nWe have seen under the Affordable Care Act that we have implemented \ndelivery system reforms that keep people out of hospitals, keep \nreadmission rates down, that provide preventive health care, so that we \nkeep people healthy. That was the concept of the Affordable Care Act. \nNow that we are implementing it--and it takes time to implement it \nbecause it is a complicated law when you are dealing with health care.\n  It would have been more helpful if we had had support to look at ways \nthat we could make it even better. But we have not had that type of \ncooperation in the Congress.\n  So more people are insured. The cost rates have been brought down. We \nreduced the debt and deficit of this country. But for the passage of \nthe Affordable Care Act, our deficits would be larger today. That is \nnot one Member saying that. Look at what those who are charged with \ndoing the projections for this country have said. They have said that \nthe debt today is smaller as a result of the passage of the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  As far as those who pay the costs, the consumers who pay the health \ninsurance premiums and pay the doctor bills and hospital bills, they \nhave seen relief under the Affordable Care Act. There is guaranteed \nvalue for their insurance premium. At least 80 to 85 percent of that \npremium dollar must go to direct benefits. As a result, millions of \nAmericans in 2012--over 8 million Americans--received rebates from \ntheir insurance company. They actually got checks back equaling about \nhalf a billion dollars.\n  Consumers are getting better value for their dollars. We know it is \nnot easy at times for actuaries to be able to predict the exact costs \nof health care. But now we have protection in the code. If the premium \nthey charge you is too much, you will get a rebate for the excess that \nyou paid--real protection.\n  I must tell you, as I go around the State of Maryland--I know the \nPresiding Officer finds the same thing in the State of New Jersey--\nfamilies are happy they can keep their adult children on their \ninsurance policies until the age of 26. Millions of Americans have \ntaken advantage of that provision in the Affordable Care Act. They are \nvery happy about that.\n  I cannot tell you how many people I have talked to in Maryland who \nhave benefited from the elimination of preexisting conditions or the \nfear of losing their insurance policy because someone has gotten sick. \nInsurance companies can no longer do that. So if you have a child with \nasthma and you are trying to get insurance, before the Affordable Care \nAct they would not have covered the cost of taking care of that child's \nasthma. Today you get full coverage.\n  We have eliminated preexisting conditions because that is what \ninsurance should do. It should cover your needs. Now it does. Before \nthe Affordable Care Act, there were limits, caps--no longer caps. \nPeople had insurance and still had to file personal bankruptcy. Those \ndays are over thanks to the Affordable Care Act. It is being \nimplemented in a way that Americans are benefiting from the passage and \nimplementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n  In regard to our seniors and our disabled population who are covered \nunder Medicare, they are very happy the preventive health care benefits \nare now without any copayment. They can take care of their health care \nneeds. They can get the care they need.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, when we passed the prescription drug \nplan, we had what is known as the doughnut hole, which is a coverage \ngap. After you incurred a certain amount of cost, then 100 percent was \nyour expense. Many seniors had to leave prescription drugs on the \ncounter at the drug store because they could not afford to pay for the \ncost of prescription drugs, even though they thought they had coverage.\n  Thanks to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, that is being \neliminated today. We are providing full coverage. Despite the claims on \nthe other side of the aisle, take a look at the facts. Medicare is more \nsolvent today than it was before the passage of the Affordable Care \nAct. We helped ensure the future of Medicare by the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act. That is the fact. That is the record.\n  We are on this path to improve our health care system. It is working. \nWe have reduced hospital readmissions. The accountable care \norganization is a provision where we take the creativity of private \noperators where they can work together to figure out how they can help \npeople be healthier. In my State of Maryland, there are several that \nare working, that are figuring out ways they can use community \nfacilities and health care to keep people healthier and to reduce the \ncost of health care and make it more efficient by delivery system \nreform. It is working. It is working.\n  We strengthened the primary care network. We all talk about that. We \nknew we had to provide more primary care doctors and nurses. We have \ndone that under the Affordable Care Act. It takes time. But we are \nalready seeing the benefit of that. We have increased dramatically \ncommunity health center budgets. I have visited the community health \ncenters in my State. I now see where they have mental health services \nbeing provided in the community that was not being provided before the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  They now have dental services that are being provided in underserved \nareas that were not being provided before the Affordable Care Act. We \nnow have prenatal services that are being provided in communities that \ndid not have that service before the passage of the Affordable Care \nAct. What is the result? For low birth-weight babies we have reduced \nthat number. Infant survival rates are increasing.\n  I take pride that in supporting the Affordable Care Act I helped \nbring about those results. We are providing more resources in our \ncommunities. That is the record of the Affordable Care Act. That is \nwhat we have been able to do. I am particularly proud of the fact that \nunder the essential health benefits, we now provide pediatric dental \nbenefits. That is a little personal to\n\n[[Page S3443]]\n\nus in Maryland, because in 2007 we lost a youngster, a 12-year-old, \nDeamonte Driver.\n  He lived not more than 10 miles from here. His mom tried to get him \nto a dentist. He had a tooth problem. She could not get him to a \ndentist. Nobody would treat him. He had no insurance. His tooth decay \nbecame an abscessed tooth. That problem went into his brain. He had two \nemergency surgeries costing a quarter of a million dollars. He should \nhave had $80 of dental care. That would have taken care of his needs. \nAs a result of that, he lost his life.\n  This bill is making a huge difference. My point is this. For small \nbusinesses, they have greater choice and they have credits available to \nmake it easier. We have expanded Medicaid. We have done a lot. We have \nthe best health care in the world that is provided right here in the \nUnited States. We are now on the path of having the best health care \nsystem in the world. The Affordable Care Act helps us get there. We can \ntake a giant step in that direction by approving the nomination of \nSylvia Burwell as Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, on April 29 of this year, Louisiana's \nHouse Republican delegation wrote a letter to Senator Landrieu, as well \nas myself, urging us to represent a majority of Louisianan's opinions \nand oppose the nomination of Sylvia Burwell to become HHS Secretary \nunless significant changes were made to the path we are on regarding \nthe implementation of ObamaCare.\n  They asked us to oppose Ms. Burwell's nomination until an agreement \nis reached to provide for the equitable treatment and protection of all \nAmericans under ObamaCare, and until the administration, including Ms. \nBurwell, committed not to pick and choose what parts of the law they \nwould implement; not to pick and choose what deadlines they would meet, \nwhat deadlines they would ignore; not to pick and choose mandates they \nwould enforce, such as the individual mandate, and what mandates they \nwould ignore, such as the employer mandate.\n  This is that letter dated April 29. I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record. I agreed with that sentiment. I agreed with \nthose concerns. So I responded shortly thereafter in a letter dated May \n19 that I would oppose Ms. Burwell's nomination because of those \nconcerns, because there is no evidence that Ms. Burwell would put an \nend to any of that, would put an end to the administration's common \npractice of creating special rules for big business, special rules for \nWashington insiders, for not simply following the law, not simply \nimplementing the law but picking, choosing, and doing parts of the law, \nsuch as delaying parts of the law when it was politically convenient.\n  The Senate's consideration of Ms. Burwell's nomination to become \nSecretary of HHS invited a conversation to discuss all of that, to \ndiscuss her responsibilities for the full, impartial, fair, legal \nimplementation of ObamaCare. I paid attention very much to that \ndiscussion. I was hopeful about it. Unfortunately, it was \ndisappointing, in my view, in terms of her responses.\n  During the nomination process, Ms. Burwell was asked on a number of \noccasions how she would continue to implement and enforce various \naspects of ObamaCare. Again, these concerns obviously arose because of \nthe administration's decisions to make more than 20 unilateral changes \nto the law as written, to timing, to applicability of various \nprovisions.\n  One of these decisions which was particularly highlighted in my House \ncolleagues' letter of April 29 was to give big business relief from the \nemployer mandate while there was no relief for individuals. Millions \nwill face a steep penalty--face it right now under the individual \nmandates. Not only did Ms. Burwell punt to the Treasury Department, her \nresponse failed to even acknowledge that the administration has failed \nto execute the law as written because the law is broken.\n  The American people have really had enough of the administration \npassing blame through certain Federal agencies or to bureaucrats or to \nCongress or to political parties. They have had enough of the blame \ngame. They have had enough of finger pointing. What I find even more \nhypocritical in this regard is that the administration worked with many \nMembers of Congress behind closed doors to give Congress and Washington \ninsiders special treatment under ObamaCare, to give them a way to avoid \nhigher costs and lower quality care, the way Americans are suffering \nfrom that.\n  So I will also oppose Ms. Burwell's nomination until the American \npeople get the same relief from ObamaCare as the Washington elite, as \nthe Washington exemption from ObamaCare, as the Congressional subsidy. \nTo date, at least 4.7 million Americans, including 92,000 Louisianans, \nhave had their health insurance plans canceled as a result of the \nmandates of the law.\n  Many of these folks were then dealt with a choice of going without \nhealth insurance or taking the gamble of purchasing an expensive plan \non the government-run ObamaCare exchange.\n  Again, the law, as written, was intended to make every Member of \nCongress and our staff walk in those same shoes, but the \nadministration, again, was fast and loose with the law and created a \nspecial rule contrary to statute. Ms. Burwell was part of that \nadministration, creating a special exemption, a special subsidy, a \nspecial rule not found in the statute.\n  So in contrast to that experience of many Louisianians, millions of \nAmericans, Members of Congress, and congressional staff can get out of \nthat mandate of ObamaCare. Many congressional staff have been exempted \nfrom having to go to the exchange, which is clearly a requirement under \nthe statute. Members of Congress and staff who do go to the exchange \nget a huge taxpayer funded subsidy--nowhere in the statute and nowhere \navailable to any other American at the same income levels.\n  For all of these reasons, because of this disparate treatment, \nbecause of ignoring the law, because of amending the law over and over \nby administrative fiat, I have to oppose Ms. Burwell's nomination.\n  She gave no indication in any of her testimony or in any discussions \nleading up to this confirmation vote that she would change any of that, \nand it is pretty clear she will not.\n  I will oppose the nomination.\n  If Ms. Burwell is passed by the Senate as Secretary of the HHS, I \nurge her to take heed of these calls. We have a law before us. We need \nto follow the law--not in some cases but in all cases, not implement \nhere but not there, not give some folks special treatment and special \nexemptions not found under the statute but implement the law as \nwritten.\n  That will be her responsibility as much as anyone in the \nadministration. I urge her to be a true leader in the administration, \nto start doing that in an appropriate, legal way.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the April 29, \n2014, and May 19, 2014, letters I referred to previously.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2014.\n     Senator Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu and Senator Vitter: We write to \n     respectfully request that you place a hold on the nomination \n     of Ms. Sylvia Burwell for Secretary of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services until an agreement is reached to \n     provide for the equitable treatment and protection of all \n     Americans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The \n     President's signature health care law, which contains a \n     laundry list of job-killing mandates and taxes, is wreaking \n     havoc on our economy and creating hardships for hardworking \n     taxpayers who received cancellation letters for their health \n     insurance policies due to unworkable ACA requirements. To \n     date, at least 4.7 million Americans, including at least \n     92,000 Louisianans, have had their health insurance plans \n     cancelled as a result of this law. In addition to losing \n     their health insurance coverage, Americans across the country \n     are seeing their health insurance premiums and deductibles \n     skyrocket while their provider networks become narrower. In \n     Louisiana, some individuals are seeing premium increases \n     greater than 100%.\n       Since the passage of the ACA, the Obama Administration, \n     through the Department of\n\n[[Page S3444]]\n\n     Health and Human Services and the Department of the Treasury, \n     has unilaterally delayed or changed the law at least 20 \n     times. For instance, the Administration has delayed the \n     enforcement of the employer mandate for large employers until \n     2015 and for businesses with between 50 and 99 employees \n     until 2016. In December, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services decided to vastly expand the ``hardship exemption'' \n     to include individuals who ``received a notice saying that \n     your current health insurance plan is being cancelled, and \n     you consider the other plans available unaffordable.'' These \n     actions, among many others, are tacit admissions that the \n     Obama Administration knows this law is both unworkable and \n     unpopular. Unfortunately, the Administration has yet to \n     provide this relief to all Americans.\n       Families across Louisiana have faced cancelled health \n     insurance plans, rising health insurance premiums, and the \n     loss of access to doctors and hospitals while watching the \n     Administration pick political favorites through selective \n     exemptions from the ACA. It is wholly unfair for families to \n     still be threatened with penalties from the IRS at the same \n     time as insurance companies and businesses are granted \n     unilateral relief. Please join us in calling for fairness for \n     all under the law by placing a hold on Ms. Burwell's \n     nomination until she agrees to provide equitable treatment \n     for all Americans under the Affordable Care Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steve Scalise,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Bill Cassidy,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Vance McAllister,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Charles Boustany,\n       Member of Congress.\n     John Fleming,\n       Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2014.\n     Congressman Steve Scalise,\n      House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Congressman Charles Boustany,\n     House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Congressman Vance McAllister,\n     House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Congressman Bill Cassidy,\n     House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Congressman John Fleming,\n     House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Louisiana Congressional Colleagues: I write in \n     response to your letter asking to hold the nomination of Ms. \n     Silvia Burwell for Secretary of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services until an agreement is reached to provide the \n     American people the same treatment under Obamacare as large \n     businesses. 1 share your opinion that the Administration's \n     decision to give large businesses relief from the employer \n     mandate while millions still face a penalty under the \n     individual mandate is both unfair and drives a deeper wedge \n     between the American people and those with powerful lobbyists \n     and access to power. What I find even more hypocritical is \n     that Congress worked behind closed doors to give themselves \n     special treatment under Obamacare to avoid higher costs and \n     lower quality care. I will oppose Ms. Burwell's nomination \n     until the American people get the same relief from Obamacare \n     as the Washington elite and their corporate allies.\n       Like you, I have heard from hardworking Louisianans every \n     day on skyrocketing premiums, higher out of pocket costs as a \n     result of lower quality health plans being offered on the \n     federal exchange, and limited access to their doctors. \n     Members of Congress and their staff would be facing these \n     exact consequences had they not bent the rules last summer to \n     keep their generous employer-based, taxpayer funded subsidy \n     to avoid higher costs and only make available high-quality, \n     gold level health plans to ensure they were able to keep \n     their doctors.\n       To date, at least 4.7 million Americans, including at least \n     92,000 Louisianans, have had their health insurance plans \n     canceled as a result of this law. Many of these people were \n     then dealt with the choice of going without health insurance \n     or taking the gamble of purchasing an expensive plan on the \n     government run Obamacare exchange. In contrast, high level \n     Congressional staff who often negotiate directly with the \n     Administration were able to alleviate the inconvenience of \n     procuring their health insurance on the broken federal \n     exchange and keep the plan they liked on the Federal Employee \n     Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).\n       I join your efforts in calling for fairness for all under \n     the law, and will oppose Ms. Burwell's nomination and any \n     other bureaucrat that puts the needs of the political elite \n     before the American people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Vitter,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. I rise today also to speak about health care issues, the \nAffordable Care Act, and Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the nominee to be \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  The Affordable Care Act has completed its first year of open \nenrollment. Despite some significant technical challenges, 8 million \nAmericans have used the State or Federal health insurance marketplaces, \nas created by the ACA, to access insurance.\n  I want to talk about the status of the ACA today, some challenges--\nincluding some comments made by my colleague from Louisiana--and then \ntalk about Sylvia Mathews Burwell.\n  Of the 8 million Americans who have used the exchanges to access \nhealth insurance, over 216,000 of them are Virginians. In addition to \nthe 8 million, 3 million more people have been enrolled in Medicaid or \nCHIP as of February--in addition to the marketplaces open--and those \nMedicaid and CHIP expansions were because of the Affordable Care Act \nprovisions.\n  In addition, an estimated 3.1 million young adults have gained \ncoverage by being able to stay on family policies until age 26. The \ncombined number, just in this expansion of coverage, is now more than \n14 million Americans.\n  Let me put that in context. One year in, 14 million Americans have \ninsurance through the ACA. That is more than the total population of \nthe following States: West Virginia, Idaho, Hawaii, New Hampshire, \nMontana, Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. \nOne year in, more people have insurance through the ACA than the \ncombined populations--entire populations--of those 10 States.\n  The number dwarfs the population of New Jersey, which is about 9 \nmillion today--this 14 million number, which is growing every day. So \nimagine a program, even with all the challenges and the rollout, within \n1 year providing insurance to more people than the combined population \nof these 10 States, significantly more than the Virginia population as \nwell.\n  Gallup has polled, since 2008, the percentage of Americans who don't \nhave health insurance--American adults who don't have health insurance. \nThe number was down to 13.4 percent when the poll was last taken in \nApril, which is the lowest monthly uninsured rate since Gallup started \ntaking this poll.\n  Have there been challenges? Sure. Have there been those who have had \nsome difficulty? Sure. We have been dealing with them on the phone--as \nthe Presiding Officer has too. But the uninsured rate is dropping \ndramatically. Even at 1 year with the problems, people are receiving \ninsurance as a result of the ACA.\n  Each one of them has a story. Each one of them has a story of what it \nwas like to live without health insurance and what it is like to live \nnow with the security and comfort of health insurance--not only for \nwhen you get ill but also for when you are going to bed at night \nworried about what will happen to you if you get ill, what will happen \nto you if your spouse is in an auto accident, what will happen to you \nif your children get diagnosed with something that might well be a \npreexisting condition under an earlier day.\n  The stories aren't just about the 14 million who have health \ninsurance because of the ACA. They are also stories of the nearly 20 \nmillion Americans who have received rebates because they overpaid \npremiums and the insurance companies now have to send them money. It is \npeople who cannot be charged discriminatory rates because they are \nwomen. It is seniors who are able to get preventive care under Medicare \nfor free or reduced-price prescription drugs for free. It is all the \nAmericans who had preexisting conditions which would have blocked them \nfrom insurance coverage before the ACA passed.\n  Just briefly, I am one of these stories. When I went onto the open \nmarket to buy health insurance a couple of years ago--and like most \ngood families, when you want to do something, you put this really smart \nperson on it--my wife. She started to call around about health \ninsurance. Two insurance companies said to her: We can write you a \npolicy on four of your five family members.\n  One wouldn't insure me. I think politics is viewed as a dangerous \nline of work.\n  One wouldn't insure one of my children. Well, here is an important \nsafety tip. Don't tell my wife or any wife or mother: We will only \ninsure part of your family.\n  My wife said in each instance: I actually think this is against the \nlaw now. I think you have to provide insurance\n\n[[Page S3445]]\n\nfor everybody, and not just for four of the five. The insurance company \nrep called the boss and then called back and said: We are sorry; you \nare right. We have to write you insurance on every member of the \nfamily.\n  Everybody has a story and increasingly these stories accumulate. \nWhether it's coverage or a preexisting condition ban or equal treatment \nin rates between men and women, these stories are starting to \naccumulate and are showing us that this ACA can and will be successful.\n  Of course, there are measures to improve it that we still need to \nembrace. I am proud to cosponsor today a bill that the lead sponsor, \nSenator Franken, called the Family Coverage Act. It was introduced \ntoday.\n  The ACA requires large employers to offer affordable health care \ncoverage to the employees. The IRS definition of affordability suggests \nthat means that an employee's share of the premiums of individual \ncoverage, rather than family coverage, is less than 9.5 percent of \nfamily income.\n  If the employee has an offer of affordable insurance, the employee in \nthe family cannot receive premium tax credits. If it is not affordable, \nyou can receive tax credits.\n  This measure of affordability, based on what the premium is for the \nindividual, versus what the family premium is, leaves a lot of spouses \nand families cut out from the possibility of receiving tax credits \nunder the ACA.\n  An average plan for an individual costs about $5,600, but according \nto the Kaiser Family Foundation, that average rises to about $15,700 \nfor families. GAO estimates that the currently used definition of \naffordability would prevent nearly 460,000 uninsured kids from \naccepting tax credits, even though their parents qualify for the tax \ncredit under the ACA. This is known as the family glitch. It was sort \nof an unforeseen consequence when the bill was written.\n  The Family Coverage Act, which Senator Franken is championing with \nmany other cosponsors, would change the definition of affordability \nwithin the ACA so that family members of the parent who works for a \ncompany that offers health insurance can qualify for tax credits as \nwell.\n  I have cosponsored fixes and improvements to the ACA in the Small \nBusiness Tax Credit Accessibility Act, a small business tax credit \nenhancement, and in the Expanded Consumer Choice Act. Through a plan \ncalled the ``copper plan,'' it provides all of the coverage but at a \nlower premium, because those choosing the plan will pay more on the \ndeductible so they can buy down their premium by more cost sharing.\n  There is the Commonsense Reporting Act of 2014, introduced by Senator \nWarner, to ease the compliance burden on employers, and the Protect \nVolunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act. Many of us were \ncosponsors of that bill. There is an act called the EACH Act, which is \na technical correction to the religious exemption in the ACA.\n  I have also written a lot of letters to the administration asking \nthem to do things within their administrative purview to make the act \nbetter.\n  This is what we should be doing. We shouldn't be talking about \nrepealing the Affordable Care Act and taking 14 million people who have \ninsurance through the ACA and telling them: Back out into street with \nyou.\n  We shouldn't be talking about stonewalling a wonderful public servant \nfrom coming in and being head of the HHS. We should be engaged in the \nbusiness of reforms and improvements.\n  This is what legislators do. When I was Governor of Virginia, my \nlegislature would pass about 1,000 bills a year. They would come to my \ndesk for my review, editing, amending, signing, and potentially \nvetoing. What I noticed was that of the action of my legislative body, \n800 bills were reforms to existing law. Only about 200 were new laws.\n  What legislative bodies do is they go into existing laws, improve \nthem, fix them, and make them better, and that is what we should be \nabout here.\n  Certainly we have learned, through the bad rollouts and some other \nthings, that nobody can stand back and say this thing is perfect and no \nreforms are needed. Reforms are always needed.\n  But I would also hope my colleagues might have learned something--\nthose who wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Those who were \nwilling to shut down the Government of the United States to advocate a \nrepeal of the Affordable Care Act should also be focused now on reforms \nnot repeals, because repeals mean those 14 million would lose insurance \nand families like mine would now be subject again to being turned down \nbecause of preexisting health conditions.\n  It strikes me that the reform caucus is growing and the repeal caucus \nis shrinking--as it should. Every day finds more and more people who \nhave had this experience and understand that the ACA should not be \nallowed to be repealed. I am thrilled that is occurring.\n  One more item about the Affordable Care Act. It has been stated by \nsome, including some in this Chamber, that the Affordable Care Act has \ndone a horrible thing by allowing Members of Congress and their staffs \nto get a subsidy in their health insurance that the American public \ndoesn't get. Then there are those who have stood and made that case on \nthe floor of this body, on television, and in this country. They have \ntalked about that subsidy as this horrible thing that these \ncongressional staffers--such as those who are sitting here at the desk \nor those who work in my office--shouldn't be getting.\n  The Presiding Officer knows--and I know--that statement is \ninaccurate. The subsidy that anyone gets in this building is an \nemployer contribution to their health insurance premium. It has been a \nlong and standard feature of employer-provided health care plans in \nthis country that employers contribute to the health insurance of their \nemployees.\n  In the private sector, over 55 million Americans have employers who \ncontribute to the health insurance premium of their employees. Hard-\nworking men and women who are working in this Senate or working in the \nHouse or who are working on congressional staffs have every bit as much \nright to have an employer that would contribute part of the premium \ncost for them as do the people who work at newspapers, automobile \nmanufacturers, retail stores, and restaurants. All over this country, \nemployer provision of a portion of the premium is a standard feature of \nhow insurance has been provided for decades.\n  For those who say that Members of Congress are getting some special \ntreatment, some congressional subsidy, when the reality--and they know \nthe reality--is that this subsidy is just the employer-provided share \nof a premium that is standard among all Americans, I find it very \ntroubling.\n  What would they propose? Would they propose that uniquely, if you \nhappen to work for the article I branch--the legislative branch--you \nshould be denied an employer contribution to your health insurance, \njust like other Americans get, because you work for the article I \nbranch that is specified in the Constitution? I think that is \nessentially their argument.\n  I had not intended to get into this topic today, but I think it is \nvery clear we should make plain to the American people that public \nservants who do work in this Chamber and in the House Chamber, and for \nMembers who were elected in the States and districts in this country--\nthey are entitled to the same kind of treatment by their employer, \nwhich is a standard feature of life in most American companies, \nnonprofits, State and local governments, and other institutions.\n  I have known Sylvia Mathews Burwell for 25 years. I met her when she \nwas working for the Clinton administration as a young hotshot West \nVirginia student, educated at Harvard, a Rhodes scholar like some other \nnotable Members of this body.\n  I am proud to support her confirmation to be Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. She has had a strong background not only in the public \nsector, most recently as the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, but she has also had a superb track record in the private \nsector. When dealing with health care issues, we know that strong \nprivate sector experience is very important in an issue that is so \nsignificant.\n  I have been very impressed with Sylvia Mathews Burwell's work in the \nOffice of Management and Budget. I think she brought a more \nbusinesslike\n\n[[Page S3446]]\n\nand regular order approach to the Federal budgeting issues that are so \nimportant, and I think she will take that approach and expertise into \nthe HHS position--not just around matters of the Affordable Care Act \nbut around a whole portfolio of issues which are so critically \nimportant.\n  We have got to be about reforms and improvement. Sylvia Mathews \nBurwell is a person who walks in to work every day, wanting things to \nbe better today than they were yesterday, and she has the experience to \ndo this job. I am proud to stand and support her nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3446-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3446-S3447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, in my home State of Delaware today we have \na problem. Just this week the critical I-495 bridge over the Christina \nRiver in Wilmington--which carries more than 90,000 drivers each and \nevery day, north and south on this critical artery on the east coast of \nthe United States--was closed indefinitely.\n  While engineers and workers were on an unrelated project in the area, \nthey noticed that four of the key pillars holding up the bridge were \nalarmingly slanted, causing widespread concerns about the bridge's \nsafety and prompt action to shut it down.\n  Now as the Delaware Department of Transportation and the Federal \nHighway Administration do everything they can to get to the bottom of \nthis problem and to work to make this bridge safe again, tens of \nthousands of commuters are forced onto already crowded streets and \nhighways, creating even worse traffic for everyone in our area, hurting \nour economy, and taking people away from where they need to be.\n  It is, sadly, yet another example--one that hits particularly close \nto home for me--in a string of major infrastructure emergencies, some \ndue to unforeseeable events, and some due to a long-term critical lack \nof investment that signifies why investment in our infrastructure is so \nimportant.\n  Every day when Americans drive to work or drop off their kids at \nschool, they make a simple bargain, an unconscious bargain with their \ngovernment: They assume the roads will be safe to drive on. They expect \nthat if they drive safely, they will be able to get to where they need \nto go in a reasonable amount of time.\n  Unfortunately, it has been quite clear that while Americans keep \ndoing what they can to move our Nation and our economy forward, we here \nin Congress aren't holding up our end of the bargain. We aren't meeting \nour responsibilities to invest in critical areas that we all know need \nwork. We have a lot of infrastructure needs, but we simply aren't \nkeeping up with them today.\n  This is about the end of the school year for most families with kids \nin school around the country. Like many other parents, I was going over \nwith my kids what they think their grades are at the end of the year. \nWell, the country also gets a grade. We get a grade from the American \nSociety for Civil Engineers. These are the folks whose job it is to \nmanage and supervise and survey the health and capabilities of our \ninfrastructure--our bridges and roads and highways. This group, the \nAmerican Society for Civil Engineers, gave our roadways a D.\n  The Federal Highway Administration estimates that we are dramatically \nbehind in investing in keeping our highways and bridges and tunnels up \nto speed. They say we need $170 billion more in capital investments \nevery year to improve road conditions and performance.\n  That group of civil engineers, the ASCE, has also determined a \nquarter of our bridges are functionally obsolete or structurally \ndeficient. In little old Delaware, that comes to 175 bridges that fail \nto meet what we would all expect of our government--Federal and State \nand county and local governments--that we maintain bridges to the \nhighest level of safety that we would expect.\n  We will always face unforeseen crises and challenges, but this is one \nwe can see coming. There may be hurricanes such as the great Superstorm \nSandy that wiped out a lot of infrastructure in my region or there may \nbe other unforeseeable events that impact our transportation \ninfrastructure. But this one we have been seeing coming for years.\n  This inconvenience in Delaware--the closing of the critical bridge on \n495 that has put so many at inconvenience--was nowhere near the biggest \ntransportation disaster we have had in recent years. Just last year in \nWashington State, the Skagit River Bridge, built in 1955, literally \ncollapsed after a truck drove into its framework. Seventy-one thousand \ndrivers were using that bridge on a daily basis.\n  I think many of us remember, way back in August of 2007, tragedy \nstruck Minneapolis when its I-35 West Bridge, which extends over the \nMississippi River, literally collapsed under the rush hour traffic \nweight. More than 100 cars were thrown into the water, 13 people lost \ntheir lives, and 145 were injured.\n  If we don't act soon--together--we are going to face many more such \ntragic incidents like these. We have to address this problem and get \nover our unwillingness together to invest in infrastructure that we all \ndepend on and value.\n  The simple fact, as I have said, is current Federal investments are \nnot keeping pace with our needs. We are, sadly, months away from \nexhausting the Federal highway trust fund--the trust fund that finances \nmuch of the highway, bridge, and tunnel work around the country on the \nInterstate Highway System--because the gas tax that funds it hasn't \nrisen in 20 years, but the amount of gas being consumed and thus gas \ntax revenue generated has gone down. Yet we don't seem here to have the \npolitical will to implement a solution to this basic problem that folks \nhave been saying is coming at us, hurtling like an oncoming truck for \nyears.\n  We talk a lot about our children--about the kind of world we want to \nleave them, about our hopes for the future, and it is just one of the \nreasons I am so concerned about our Nation's long-term balance sheet. \nMany of us talk about our Nation's deficits and our potentially \ncrippling Federal debt. It is irresponsible of us to continue to rack \nup debt on our national balance sheet and leave it to our children and \ngrandchildren. But I highlight today that when we neglect our \ntransportation infrastructure--our highways and tunnels and roads and \nports and bridges--these are things we use every single day in \ntransporting our families and ourselves or goods to and from work or to \nand from home, to school, to soccer, to vacation. These are critical \npieces of the American infrastructure. We are also racking up a huge \ndebt there too. These investments have to be made one way or the other. \nI know we value these systems because we depend on them every day.\n  So if we can't come together in the short term to fix the highway \ntrust fund, I am left to wonder how we are going to come together on \nthe much larger problem of meeting our broader infrastructure needs, of \nwhich that trust fund is one small but crucial part. We face short-\nterm, medium-term, and long-term problems. As I said, we have to fix \nthis highway trust fund before it runs out of funding this summer. It \nis what often funds 80 percent of State highway work. It is a critical \npart of construction projects already scheduled to go on this summer. \nWe have kept it funded by transferring money from the general fund for \nthe last few years, but that is not how it is supposed to work. So we \nhave got to come to terms with a solution that is responsible and meets \nthis challenge.\n  We have a range of options, but none of them are appealing: \nIncreasing the gas tax, putting a surcharge on vehicles, charging for \nvehicle miles traveled. All of these are unappealing politically, but \nit is essential that we come up with something to solve this long-term \nproblem.\n  I thank Chairman Wyden of the Finance Committee, who is working hard \nwith other members of that committee even today to find a path forward \nand a solution.\n\n[[Page S3447]]\n\n  Second, in the medium term, we have to reauthorize--we have to \napprove--ongoing work for highways, roads, and bridges, and we need to \nhave a reauthorization for surface transportation by this fall. The \nChair and ranking member of the relevant committee--Barbara Boxer of \nCalifornia and Dave Vitter of Louisiana--have shown, as has my senior \nSenator Tom Carper from Delaware, who also serves on this committee, \nthat Federal infrastructure investment is a bipartisan value. They have \nbeen able to come out of that committee with bipartisan \nreauthorizations a number of times over the last couple of years, and \nthat is encouraging to me.\n  We also, a few minutes ago, came out of the transportation \nsubcommittee markup on appropriations, the committee that says: Here is \nhow much we will spend. That came out with a very strong bipartisan \nvote earlier today and will come to the floor in the next few months. \nThis progress is encouraging, but it doesn't mean anything if we don't \nhave a way to pay the bill when the bill comes due. We need to figure \nout how to finance infrastructure for the long term in this country.\n\n  There are several bills with good ideas that have been put forward in \nthis committee and in this Chamber. I have supported two bills. One is \ncalled the BRIDGE Act and the other is called the Partnership to Build \nAmerica Act. These bills will provide the critical steps we need to \nbring private sector money in off the sidelines and facilitate a real \npartnership between government money and private sector money. These \nbills have been led by Senators Warner, Blunt, and Bennet, are \ngenuinely bipartisan, and enjoy support from groups who often don't \nwork well together--from industry to labor, from the AFL-CIO to the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers.\n  There are several strong bipartisan bills that show the way forward, \nbut we don't seem to be able to get them to the floor, get them \napproved, and get them moving forward.\n  Right now, the truth is that the debate on this floor comes nowhere \nclose to matching the reality of the scope of the problems in front of \nus. As I mentioned earlier, we have an enormous infrastructure debt. By \n2020--in just the next 6 years--it is estimated that our Nation will \nneed $3.6 trillion of new infrastructure investment so we can fix and \nmaintain our roads, bridges, rail, transit, drinking water, ports, \nsewers, wastewater treatment, and beyond. This is an enormous debt \nwhich is unpaid and for which we currently have no path forward.\n  I know many of us who serve on the Budget Committee and pay attention \nto the balance sheet of our country are concerned about our structural \nnational debt. I wanted to take a minute today--on a day when everyone \nin my hometown and home State is concerned about how we will tackle the \nproblem of the I-495 bridge--and remind all of my colleagues of the \nscale of this national infrastructure debt.\n  At the heart of this problem and at the heart of so many of the \nproblems we have is our unwillingness to pay for what we want, to pay \nthe bill that is long overdue for our long-overdue improvements to the \ninfrastructure of this great country.\n  Fixing this problem is going to take a great deal of revenue. We can \nreform taxes, we can involve the private sector, we can reprioritize \nfunding, and we can reform the way government works. We don't lack for \ninnovative ideas, but at the end of the day what we currently lack is \nour will.\n  The people of the United States, through us, need to step up to the \nchallenge of paying the bill. In my hometown, just in the last few \nhours and over the last few days, we have become more engaged in this \ndebate than we have been in a long time because a bridge that is \ncritical, a vital artery for our community, has stopped. It is closed \nindefinitely. We need to work together to find the resources to fix \nthis bridge and get America moving together again. It is my hope and \nplea that my colleagues will step up to this challenge, which I know \nevery community in our country faces.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3447-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3447-S3449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 D-DAY\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as all of us know, tomorrow, June 6, marks \nthe 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings, which we have come to \nknow as D-day. D-day, of course, was the greatest military operation in \nhistory--one that brought together 150,000 troops, 5,000 ships, and \n13,000 aircraft in a sweeping attack on Nazi-occupied France and marked \nthe beginning of the end for Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. The \nAllied Powers, of course, united as one and changed the course of \nhistory. It was our troops and our allies who freed a continent from \nthe clutches of tyranny and our troops who helped win a war.\n  As a country, it is important that we recall occasions such as the \n70th anniversary of the Normandy invasion and D-day because the \ngreatest danger is that we forget--we forget about the face of evil and \nwhat it means to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--but it \nalso means we need to remind ourselves on a regular basis about the \nheroism and courage and sacrifice of the people who gave all they had, \nincluding their lives, in order to preserve for us what we now have and \nwhat we too often take for granted.\n  We often hear that freedom is not free, and, of course, we all agree \nwith that, but it almost has become a cliche, and it should not be. \nWhen we think about our freedom, we ought to think about those men who \nstormed the beaches at Normandy, many of whom lost their lives. We must \nalways remember those who fought in places such as Iwo Jima and ran \ninto a buzz saw of enemy fire, many of whom never came back. We need to \nremember those important events on a day such as this, and we need to \ntell the story not only to remind ourselves, but we also need to tell \nthe story to our children and grandchildren because they will, before \nlong, have a responsibility for preserving this great experiment we \nhave had in America for over 230 years--a self-governing democracy that \nhas been purchased by the blood and the treasure of those who have gone \non before. The free world as we know it owes its existence to the \ncourage, grit, and sacrifice of those who fought in places like \nNormandy, and, of course, they will not be forgotten.\n  For me personally, I can't help but think about Normandy--which my \nwife and I had an opportunity to visit a few years ago--without \nthinking of my father-in-law, who landed on Utah Beach on the second \nday of the Normandy invasion. He said that after the first day it was \nmuch easier to get on the beach, but the effort to clear out the German \nArmy and the hedgerows was murderous work and very dangerous. \nThankfully, he came home, like so many, as part of the ``greatest \ngeneration'' that helped to build America into the powerhouse we are \ntoday.\n  My father-in-law passed away recently at the age of 96 and lived a \nlong and rewarding life. But I can't let the occasion pass without \nremembering him as one of those brave men who stormed the beaches at \nNormandy 70 years ago.\n  Of course, there is another chilling number when we think about World \nWar II. Fifty million people lost their lives during World War II. It \nwas the bloodiest conflict in the history of the world--50 million \npeople.\n  During World War II, of course, we recall that brutal dictators and \ntotalitarian ideologies threatened the very existence of the civilized \nworld, and we are reminded of people like Adolf Hitler and what he did \nand what other countries did in response either by way of appeasement \nor by way of challenging his aggression. And then we know about the \nwar, of course, following the Pearl Harbor attack in Hawaii. America \nhad to fight wars on two fronts--one in Asia and the other in Europe.\n  When the United States crossed the Atlantic and joined its allies on \nthe beach of Normandy, the rescue of Europe had begun. History tells us \nthat the weather and conditions that day were harsh. In fact, one \nsoldier described the battle as everything going wrong from the \nbeginning. Without a doubt, they knew what awaited them there, and they \nwere not deterred.\n  You might wonder, as I have from time to time, what it took for our \nmen and women in uniform to charge a beach occupied by the German \nmilitary\n\n[[Page S3448]]\n\nin France. What could have inspired the kind of courage we have seen?\n  Well, I had occasion to read a book a few years ago, as perhaps other \ncolleagues have, written by James McPherson. It is called ``For Cause \nand Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War.'' When you learn about \nthe brutality of the Civil War and how many people lost their lives \nand, indeed, the likelihood of losing your life--being tragically \ninjured, acquiring an infection, and then losing your life in some of \nthe most painful and horrendous ways you can imagine--it was \ninstructive for me to realize not only did they fight for our country, \nbut they fought for each other as well, which, of course, is the lesson \nof all wars--fighting for a cause and fighting for each other.\n  Undeniably, much of the success on D-day was the result of a great \nstrategy and plan by American war planners, including a man born in \nDenison, TX, by the name of Dwight David Eisenhower, who served as the \nSupreme Allied Commander.\n  I see my colleague from Kansas on the floor, and I know Kansas lays \nclaim to Dwight D. Eisenhower, but I want to state here on the floor of \nthe Senate that he was born in Denison, TX, and not in Kansas, although \nwe are proud to share his legacy between both of our States and as a \ncountry.\n  General Eisenhower's address to the troops on the eve of the landing \nstands as one of the most memorable exhortations to bravery in the face \nof evil in the annals of world history. I would like to take a moment \nto read some of those words.\n  Here is what General Eisenhower wrote:\n\n       Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary \n     Force! You are about to embark on a great crusade, toward \n     which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the \n     world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty loving \n     people everywhere march with you.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       The free men of the world are marching together to victory! \n     I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and \n     skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full \n     victory!\n\n  At a different time, Eisenhower once said: ``Morale is the single \nmost important factor in successful wars.'' Morale was what united the \nAllied Powers--not the desire to conquer real estate but the desire to \ndefeat the tyrants of Europe, to liberate the prisoners of war and \nthose in concentration camps, and to forever defeat the evil ideology \nthat motivated Adolf Hitler and his ilk.\n  We know the world we live in is always filled with great uncertainty \nand, unfortunately, with evil men and those who would smash democracy \nand self-government under the boot heel of dictators and tyrants. So \nwhile we always pray fervently for peace, we must also be ready to \ndefeat tyrants, dictators, and those who would crush democracy under \ntheir boot heel. D-day reminds us that the United States can and should \nalways stand with our friends against terror and tyranny.\n  Back home in Texas, we have another reminder of this day. For the \nfirst time since the war, the battle flag that was raised above the USS \nTexas as it entered the waters off Point du Hoc on June 6, 1944, is now \non public display at the Houston Museum of Natural Science in honor of \nD-day's 70th anniversary. Crewman Emil Saul, who was aboard the USS \nTexas, preserved the flag for 48 years and gave it to the museum in \n1992. Now possessing the space and conditions to properly exhibit the \nflag, the museum has made this flag public for the first time in honor \nof the 70th anniversary of D-day. This flag, of course, symbolizes the \nvalor our troops demonstrated that day and makes sure future \ngenerations will never, ever forget their sacrifices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I certainly appreciate the remarks of my colleague, the Senator from \nTexas, in regard to honoring those who served our country so nobly and \nso courageously 70 years ago, as we recognize this weekend the \nanniversary of that invasion of Europe, called D-day.\n  We have many veterans in our country, many military men and women who \ncontinue to serve and many who now are veterans and have served in the \npast, and I am here today to pay tribute not only to those D-day \nmilitary men and women and those who served our country on such a \nspecial occasion in which the course of history was changed, but also \nto pay tribute to all of those who served our country in all \ncircumstances.\n  I am not a veteran. I have great regard for those who are. My life is \nshaped by the fact that the Vietnam war was ongoing during my days as a \nhigh school student, and much of my time was spent talking to those a \nfew years older than I who were volunteering or who were drafted, and \nthose who were a little bit older than that who returned home after \nservice in Vietnam. I clearly remember as a 16- or 17-year-old watching \nthe evening news, ``CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite,'' and every \nday the news was consumed with reports from Vietnam, the consequences \nwe found ourselves in, and the sacrifice men and women were making on \nthat battlefield every day.\n  Again, I didn't serve in Vietnam, but I learned a couple of things \nfrom my time observing our country and seeing the sacrifice and service \nof those who were willing to serve in that war. One of the things I \ntake from that experience is we will always honor, care for, respect \nthose who serve our country in the military in whatever circumstance \nthey have been called to do that.\n  It was a month ago that I was on the floor on this spot, concerned \nabout the Department of Veterans Affairs and the way our veterans are \ncurrently being treated. I asked for a dramatic step of the Secretary \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs to submit his resignation and for \nPresident Obama to accept it. As I indicated a month ago, that was the \nfirst and only time as a Senator that I ever asked a Cabinet Secretary \nto depart his or her position--and I didn't do it lightly--but what had \ntranspired, and what has transpired over a period of time, is a \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs that many veterans no longer believe is \ncapable of caring for them. In fact, what was so discouraging and \ndisappointing to me was the number of veterans, men and women who \nserved our country, who had lost faith, who had lost hope in the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  That Department was created in 1930 for purposes of providing the \nbenefits and health care supporting those who were called to duty, \nthose who responded to their country's call. I certainly know that \nthroughout the course of history the Department of Veterans Affairs has \nhad its challenges, but what seems so compelling to me over the last \nseveral years is the sense that no longer was there a plan, no longer \nwas there the effort to make certain that Department lived up to its \ncommitment to those who previously served our country.\n  A lot has transpired in the last month, and there is now an Acting \nSecretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. And of course we have \nreports from across the country of secret lists, concerns about waiting \ntimes, and the potential of service men and women, veterans, who have \nsuffered as a result of those lists, as a result of having to wait. I \nguess we will know more about that over the course of time.\n  I am surprised and disappointed to learn that Kansas hospitals, \nKansas facilities, the VA hospital in Wichita is on that list where \ninvestigations are now ongoing and where the Department of Veterans \nAffairs has admitted to a list that delayed access to health care. I \nwould not have expected that in our State. I think we are different. We \nare special. But the reality is this challenge and the problems we face \nare systemwide and across the country. What we want is a Department of \nVeterans Affairs that is worthy of the sacrifice and service of the men \nand women who served in our military. We don't want damage control from \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs. What we want is the end of damage \nto those who served our country.\n  The purpose of my conversation on the floor today is to make certain \nwe don't lose sight. The news cycle comes and goes, and while there are \nserious issues our country faces in many facets, I don't want this \nSenate to lose sight of its responsibility to make certain the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs is caring for those who need our care \nand treatment.\n  I am worried, and I hope my worries are unfounded. I have only served \nin\n\n[[Page S3449]]\n\nthe Senate for 4 years. I have been frustrated by being a Member of the \nSenate. I came here to work on behalf of Americans, on behalf of \nKansans. My plea is--my plea is to the Democratic leaders, to \nRepublican leaders, to individual Senators, whatever party they are: \nLet's not follow the path we have followed so many times in the short \nperiod of time I have been here in which there is a Republican plan to \nfix a problem and there is a Democratic plan to fix a problem. Surely \nour veterans deserve something more than each of us being able to say \nwe cast a vote for their benefit. Surely they deserve the opportunity \nto actually have legislation that will address the challenges and \nproblems the Department of Veterans Affairs has. My plea and my request \nof all in this body is, for these veterans, to make certain we conduct \nourselves in a different way than unfortunately I have seen in most \ninstances as a Senator.\n  We have this phrase around here, ``Well, we will get a side-by-\nside,'' meaning there is a Democratic plan and a Republican plan; and \nwhen you talk about that. What that means is we never expect either one \nof those plans to pass. So to the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee, to Senator Reid, the majority \nleader of the Senate: Please take us down a path that demonstrates once \nagain the Senate can rise to the occasion and do something worthy of \nthe veterans who have served our country.\n  Every once in a while in this frustration about the way this place \ndoesn't work, I will put on my running shoes and I will walk down to \nthe Lincoln Memorial. It certainly is an inspiring visit to the Lincoln \nMemorial, but perhaps more importantly on that walk you now go by the \nWorld War II Memorial that memorializes those the Senator from Texas \nwas talking about. You then walk by the Vietnam Wall, the war that was \nongoing in my teenage years. On your way back you come by the Korean \nWar Memorial, the forgotten war. What I am reminded of and what I would \ncall to the attention of my colleagues is not a person recognized in \nany of those memorials volunteered or was drafted for purposes of \nadvancing the cause of the Republican Party or the Democratic Party. \nThere was no interest in partisan politics by those who served our \ncountry. They served their country because they believed in a higher \ncalling. They believed they could make a difference. They believed it \nmattered to their kids and grandkids. It was about freedom and liberty. \nIt wasn't about who scores points in the next election.\n\n  Please, leaders of the Senate, all of my colleagues, make certain we \nrise to the occasion, that we have the same standard, the same \nmotivation, the same reason that we come here every day to be the same \nas theirs: to make America a better place, to make sure our kids and \ngrandkids live with freedom and liberty, to make sure the American \ndream is alive and well. If there is an issue that we ought to be able \nto do that, an issue perhaps different than anything else we deal with, \nsurely we have the ability as a Senate to deal with the issues \nnecessary legislatively to resolve and address the problems of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and to make certain that every veteran \nwho has served our country has the ability to access quality health \ncare provided in a timely fashion, and that once again the Senate \ndoesn't do what it has done too many times, and that is we all cast a \nvote and we can claim we have done something, we supported something, \nbut the end result is that nothing happened. Let's avoid nothing \nhappening.\n  Finally, let me conclude by saying that World War II Memorial is \nspecial to me. I have a 98-year-old father home in Plainville, KS, a \nWorld War II veteran. I walked up to the World War II Memorial 10 years \nago, just a few days before it was being dedicated, and I wanted to see \nwhat it was going to look like. It was an inspiring moment. I happened \nto have my cell phone with me and I walked over to the Kansas pillar \nand thought about those who served our country in that war, including \nmy dad back home. I walked away from the memorial and used my cell \nphone to call my dad at home. The message I delivered to my dad that \nday was: ``Dad, I am at the World War II Memorial. It is a memorial \nbuilt for you. Dad, I want you to know that I thank you for your \nservice. I respect you and I love you.''\n  That conversation, fortunately, took place on an answering machine \nand not in person, and was easier to deliver, although a few minutes \nlater my cell phone rang and it was my dad, who said, ``Gerald, you \nleft me a message, but I couldn't understand it. Could you tell me \nagain?''\n  The point I want to make is, we are called upon as American citizens \nand certainly as members of the Senate to do all that is possible to \ndemonstrate that we thank our veterans for their service, we respect \nthem, and we love them. The Senate needs to rise to the occasion and \nnot let the partisan politics of this place and this country divide us \nin a way in which we only symbolically respond but the end result is \nthat we fail those who served, and we fail our veterans who depend upon \nus just as we have depended upon them for their service to our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3449-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3449-S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BURWELL NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to speak on behalf of Sylvia \nMathews Burwell. We have had a lot of commentary out here that she has \nshown her capability in her time as the head of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, OMB, and she is going to have a similar success \nnow in the Department of Health and Human Services. We are going to be \nvoting on her just before 2:00 this afternoon, and I am certainly \nlooking forward to what is going to be a resounding vote. I think it is \nbecause most people feel she has done an excellent job at OMB.\n  In this Senator's experience with her, discussing with her one of the \nsmaller agencies of government, where this Senator felt as though OMB \nhad targeted that little agency, instead of allowing the experts who \nwere driving that agency--and specifically I am talking about NASA--\npurely from a finance and budgetary standpoint, instead of what we \nwanted to accomplish in the Nation's space program, Ms. Burwell \nunderstood that, and she tried to help out from an agency that is more \nconcerned just with budgetary aspects of government, and she understood \nyou have got to get into what you want the agency to accomplish instead \nof just looking at the budgetary aspects. I appreciated that very \nmuch. I think we are going to have a similar kind of experience at HHS \nwith Ms. Burwell.\n\n  Now, goodness gracious, she takes over an agency that certainly has \nits hands full, as we are, for example, just trying to continue to \nexpand Medicaid and expand it to all of the people in the States that \nhave denied the expansion of Medicaid. So what we asked during the \nconfirmation hearings is that she consider working with the States to \nfind some types of compromises on a way to do that--to expand \nMedicaid--when the States are balking. Twenty-four States have not \ntaken the Federal Government up on the offer to pay the full cost of \nexpansion for the first 3 years, and then after the year 2020 the \nFederal Government will pay 90 percent of the cost of expansion.\n  I offer an example in my own State of Florida. The State of Florida, \nostensibly because they did not want to incur the 10-percent cost of \nMedicaid expansion after the year 2020--that was the reason they gave, \nbut it really wasn't the real reason they didn't want to expand; they \njust didn't want to have anything to do with the Affordable Care Act. \nMany of them labeled it ``ObamaCare.'' As a result, what they have done \nin Florida is denied a population of over 1 million people--\nspecifically 1.2 million people in Florida--the availability of health \ncare by expanding the eligibility for all Medicaid up to the level of \n138 percent of poverty. That level is for a family of four--$32,500 a \nyear.\n  A person thinks of a million people--over a million who otherwise \ncould get health care--and they are making $32,000 or less, we can't \nexpect them to buy health insurance if they are only bringing in \n$32,000 for a family of four. That is not reasonable. That is why we \nexpanded Medicaid in the Affordable Care Act. But politics has a way of \ngetting in the way, and there are 24 States that did not expand.\n\n[[Page S3450]]\n\n  In Florida's case, this means over this period of time there is $51 \nbillion of Floridians' Federal taxpayer money that would be brought to \nFlorida to pay for those additional 1.2 million people who would get \nhealth care. Well, first of all, it is an issue of quality of life. Why \ndon't we want people to have health care who can't afford it? That is \nthe whole idea of increasing the percentage of the poverty level in \norder to make people eligible for Medicaid.\n  But aside from that, if the Federal money is available for providing \nthat health care--in this case, $51 billion--why wouldn't we want to \ntake the Federal money to pay for the health care of the people--and \n``the people'' being a substantial number of people--over 1 million.\n  In addition, if we care about the creation of jobs, we are talking \nabout 125,000 jobs additionally created because of this expansion of \nproviding health care.\n  So all the way around, it is a win-win-win. It provides jobs, it \ncertainly provides quality of life by providing health care, and the \nFederal money is already dedicated.\n  Again, politics gets in the way, and politics got in the way in the \nState of Florida and 23 other States.\n  Now, what to do about it. OK. The stated reason was that we don't \nwant our State to have the obligation of additional spending--10 \npercent--after the year 2020. What we have shown is a program that is \nalready in place in State law to provide for poor people's health care \nthrough the low-income pool and other assistance to hospitals that \nserve that poor population, a tax base that already pays for that, \ntaxes at the local level.\n  We suggested this: We don't have to raise any new taxes to pay the \nState's share of the 10 percent. Those taxes are already being paid. We \nshift the money that is there because we are going to expand Medicaid \nand take care of all the poor people--some of whom are being taken care \nof now--and just use that tax base in place of the State of Florida \nshare of 10 percent.\n  The Legislature of Florida would not buy it in the closing days and \nweeks of the session. It is my hope they will in the future. But that \nis the kind of example that the new Secretary of HHS will be dealing \nwith, as the previous Secretary of HHS has already dealt with in \niterations of how to cover additional Medicaid populations. States such \nas Arkansas and Michigan have worked with HHS to find ways, some of \nthem using the private marketplace to expand coverage.\n  So it is my hope that with the new Secretary, with the obvious need \nof additional health care for people who cannot afford it in the \nprivate insurance market, we will see this turned around in the next \nsession of the legislature; otherwise, every day the State of Florida \nloses $7 million that would be coming to the State for health care for \npeople of low income.\n  I want to say I am very proud of our State. During the open \nenrollment period, nearly 1 million people in Florida signed up for \nhealth insurance coverage in the State exchange that is run under the \nFederal rules. Of the 8 million people nationwide who signed up on the \nState exchanges, almost 1 million of that 8 million were in our State \nof Florida. So it shows us the hunger of folks there, knowing that if \nthey can get health insurance or health care through Medicaid, they \ncertainly want that very much. I hope that under the leadership of Ms. \nBurwell, we are going to be able to make that a reality in the coming \nyear. I know she is going to do a great job as Secretary of HHS.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today the Senate is expected to vote on \nthe nomination of Sylvia Mathews Burwell to be the next Secretary of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. I expect her to be \nconfirmed, and I expect she will receive a fair number of votes from \nboth sides of the aisle. I, for one, plan to vote in favor of \nconfirming Ms. Burwell. I believe she is well qualified and well suited \nfor this position.\n  But let's be clear. If Ms. Burwell is confirmed, she will have a \ndifficult job ahead of her, particularly when it comes to \nimplementation of the so-called Affordable Care Act.\n  While I support Ms. Burwell's nomination, no one should mistake that \nto mean that I have somehow softened in my resolve against ObamaCare. \nIndeed, I am as committed as ever to repealing and replacing this \nhorribly misguided law.\n  I hold this position not due to politics or partisanship but due to \nthe real--very real--problems this law is causing for our citizens, for \nour government, and for our Nation's health care system.\n  I would like to take a few minutes today to talk about some of the \nspecific problems we are seeing with ObamaCare and what some of my \ncolleagues and I are doing to address them.\n  As we all know, under the Affordable Care Act, States are required to \nhave an online exchange where citizens can go to purchase health \ninsurance. The law gives the States the option of creating their own \nexchange, using the exchange provided by the Federal Government or \nusing a hybrid of the two.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services gave every State $1 \nmillion to fund research and analysis to determine what type of an \nexchange they would use. Additional grants were given in two stages--\ntwo stages--for those States that chose to build all or part of their \nown exchanges.\n  On top of that, HHS awarded seven early innovator grants to States \nthat decided early on to build their own exchanges in order to help \nsupport the development and early implementation of the necessary \ninformation technology systems.\n  All told, States received $4.7 billion from HHS to assist them in \nbuilding their exchanges.\n  The problem we are seeing now is that, apparently, this money was \njust handed out with little or no accountability.\n  At least seven States--seven States--have failed to build a \nsuccessful Web site and exchange, even though they received and \naccepted Federal taxpayer dollars specifically for that purpose. Now \nthese States are scrambling to either rebuild their entire systems or \nto transition to the Federal exchange.\n  These seven States received roughly $1.3 billion from HHS to build \ntheir exchanges. That is $1.3 billion--with a ``B''--to just seven \nStates in the Union. That is more than one-quarter of the total amount \nHHS provided to States for the purpose of building their own State \nhealth care exchanges. And apparently these States have little or \nnothing to show for it. In fact, at least three of them are looking to \ndrop their own exchanges entirely and use the Federal exchange instead \nnow.\n  You heard that right, three States--that between them received \nhundreds of millions of dollars from the Federal Government to build \ntheir exchanges--now want to abandon the prospect entirely and join the \nFederal exchange.\n  Let's keep in mind that adding them to the Federal exchange will not \nbe simple, nor will it be cheap. More millions will be spent to \ntransition these States--along with any other States that may choose \nthe same course in the future--into the Federal exchange.\n  This is simply preposterous. Where is the accountability? Where is \nthe outrage from HHS over those lost and misspent funds? There does not \nseem to be any.\n  For her part, the President's nominee to run HHS, Ms. Burwell has at \nleast acknowledged that there is a problem here.\n  During her confirmation hearing in the Finance Committee, I asked her \nwhether States that have negligently mismanaged their exchange funds \nshould be required to reimburse the taxpayers for those losses and for \ntheir failures? Her answer was somewhat encouraging. She said that if \nshe was confirmed she would want to get to the bottom of this problem \nand ``use the full extent of the law to get those funds back for the \ntaxpayers.''\n  Unfortunately, in answer to my followup question--whether she would \ncommit to withholding additional exchange-related funds from those \nfailing States--she was not quite so definitive. Still, I was glad to \nhear her at least acknowledge the problem and make a\n\n[[Page S3451]]\n\ncommitment to recouping taxpayer funds lost in these debacles. If she \nis confirmed, I hope with all my heart she will live up to this \ncommitment, and I expect her to do so.\n  That said, it is clear that, if we are going to make the taxpayers \nwhole on this matter, we are going to need to do something besides \nwaiting around for HHS to address the problem. Indeed, if our \nexperience has taught us anything, it is that commitments made in the \ncontext of a confirmation hearing often fall by the wayside. I do not \nintend to have this one fall by the wayside.\n  That has been particularly true, though, with this administration, \nespecially when the commitments deal with ObamaCare. That is why I have \njoined with the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Grassley, in an investigation into this matter. Congress needs \nto exercise proper oversight on this issue. We need to get answers. We \nneed to get them now. One way or another we are going to get them.\n  Last month Senator Grassley and I sent a letter to CMS Administrator \nTavenner asking for information about CMS's communications with the \nStates with regard to the difficulties they have had setting up \nexchanges and their use of Federal funds. As I said, all told, these \nfailures amount to over $1 billion in lost funds. The American people \ndeserve to know where the money went and why it was so horribly \nmisused.\n  That is not all the American people deserve. They also deserve to be \npaid back for these losses. That is why I have joined with Senator \nBarrasso in introducing the State Exchange Accountability Act, a bill \nto require the States to pay back these wasted funds. Every Senator \nhere, Democrat or Republican, ought to be willing to back that bill.\n  Specifically, if enacted, our bill would require those States that \noperated a State exchange in 2014 and subsequently chose to use the \nFederal exchange to repay all of their establishment and early \ninnovator exchange grants. The bill would give them a 10-year timeframe \nto do so. States would have to enter into an agreement with HHS to \nrepay at a minimum 10 percent of the total grant money they received \nevery year. States that fall under these requirements but fail to enter \ninto such an agreement would see their Federal assistance medical \npercentages, or FMAP, reduced by HHS. The FMAP reduction would be \nuniform and take place over a 10-year period and would be equal to the \namount of exchange grant money the State received.\n  Under the bill, HHS would be explicitly prohibited from reducing the \namount of reimbursement that States owe to the Federal Government. I \nexpect some would deem this approach to be too punitive, but they \nshould not. I do not think anyone can reasonably dispute there is a \nproblem that needs to be dealt with. Our solution is reasonable and \nachievable. All we ask is the States that have wasted taxpayer funds \nrepay them within a reasonable period of time. We give these States 10 \nyears to pay the money back. This is not punitive; it is necessary. \nMore than anything, the failures we are seeing with the State health \ncare exchanges demonstrate that the Affordable Care Act has been flawed \nfrom the beginning. Indeed, it was the law itself that included an \nopen-ended appropriation to help States build their exchanges without \nany mechanism to make States accountable for wasting those funds. Given \nthese fundamental problems, I expect we will see more States take this \nroute, especially if there are no steps taken to make them accountable.\n  Congressional oversight into these failings is vital. I hope the \nadministration will cooperate in our effort to resolve these problems. \nOur legislation is no less important. It is the only way to guarantee \nthe American taxpayers get their money back. But that is not all we \nneed to do. Make no mistake, ObamaCare is doing serious damage to our \nNation's health care system and our Nation's fiscal future.\n  When it comes to his health law, the President's favorite argument is \nthat Republicans have not produced an alternative of their own. \nHowever, this is simply untrue. I suspect the President knows that. \nEarlier this year two of my colleagues and I unveiled a legislative \nproposal that would undo the damage ObamaCare has inflicted on the \nAmerican people. Unlike the Affordable Care Act, our proposal would \nactually reduce costs and shore up our entitlements. It would do so \nwithout all of the harmful distortive mandates and regulations we see \nunder ObamaCare. Once again, in the immediate future, we need to solve \nthis problem with the failed State exchanges. But we also need to keep \nour eyes focused on the long-term goal of repealing ObamaCare once and \nfor all and replacing it with something that will actually work for the \nAmerican people.\n  I hope that as time wears on, more of my colleagues, particularly \nthose on the other side of the aisle, will recognize this is what we \nreally need to do.\n  As I said, I intend to vote today in favor of Ms. Burwell's \nnomination to lead HHS. I have helped that process to go smoothly. I \nwant it to go smoothly. I believe she is a good choice for this job. I \nam hoping with all my heart that she will be that good choice she has \nindicated she is, and I have deduced she is. But I still have a number \nof concerns about the direction the agency is headed. During the course \nof her confirmation hearing, Ms. Burwell made two very important \ncommitments to me. The first commitment she made was to respond \npromptly, within 30 days, to questions and inquiries submitted to HHS \nfrom Members of Congress.\n  This is an important commitment, one I hope she lives up to. Under \nthis administration HHS has been one of the least transparent of all \nFederal agencies. Letters and inquiries oftentimes have been ignored \nentirely. When we do receive letters in return from HHS, they are \nalmost in every case unresponsive. Ms. Burwell is committed to changing \nthat practice. I respect her for it. It is part of the reason I led the \ncharge to have her confirmed. Once again, I surely hope she does help \nchange that practice.\n  I mentioned the other major commitment she made to me earlier in \ndealing with the failed State exchanges. Ms. Burwell committed to doing \neverything in her power to retrieve the wasted taxpayer funds. This \ncommitment is also important, because thus far HHS has refused to \nacknowledge many of the problems they faced in implementing the \nAffordable Care Act. The fact that she made this commitment to me \ndemonstrates she is at least willing to admit there are some major \nproblems with the program.\n  I support Ms. Burwell's nomination in large part because of these \ncommitments she has made. I hope she lives up to them. I think she has \nthe ability to live up to them. I have high hopes of that. No one \nshould misread my vote today as an acknowledgement that all is now \nright in the world of ObamaCare and at HHS, because nothing can be \nfurther from the truth. But Ms. Burwell has, for her part, acknowledged \nthat problems exist and has committed to doing what she can to fix \nthose problems. Under this administration, that is probably the best we \ncan hope for.\n  This is an important nomination. She is a very qualified woman, in my \nopinion. She has had some significant experience in the Federal \nGovernment. I have high hopes that she will turn out to be a wonderful \nAdministrator at HHS. It is almost an uncontrollable, unadministratable \nagency. I am going to give her all the help I possibly can to help get \nthat agency under control and get it right again.\n  This is important. I feel deeply about it. People in the bureaucracy \nknow if they work with me I will move heaven and Earth to try to help \nthem. It is time our government is more responsive to its citizens, \nmore responsive to what people believed when they were confirmed, and \nmore responsive in solving those problems that are so significant, so \ncostly, and so important to the American people.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to speak in strong support of \nSylvia Mathews Burwell, who has been nominated to serve as Secretary of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, HHS.\n  HHS is a $1 trillion agency responsible for, among other things, \nmanaging Medicare, Medicaid, and implementation of the Affordable Care \nAct, ACA. HHS needs a strong leader. I believe Sylvia Burwell is up to \nthe job.\n  President Obama could not have selected a better person to lead HHS \ninto\n\n[[Page S3452]]\n\nfuture. I first got to know Sylvia during the Clinton administration, \nbut I also worked with her when she was at Bill and Melinda Gates \nFoundation and the Walmart Foundation. I really got to know Sylvia more \nrecently as she ran the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. She \nplayed a pivotal role in helping Congress come to agreement on a budget \ndeal last December.\n  Her work at OMB has prepared her to step up to challenge of leading \nHHS. She is a problem solver who knows how to work with Congress. She \nis also a mom with kids. I am confident that Sylvia will be an \noutstanding HHS Secretary.\n  It is my hope that she is confirmed quickly. It is important that HHS \nhas a leader in place. It is important that Congress has a point person \nin place as we work to pass the fiscal year 2015 Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill. And it is important for the country to have a \nSecretary of HHS confirmed so we can move forward with implementation \nof healthcare reform.\n  I would like to take a moment to express my deep appreciation to Ms. \nKathleen Sebelius--our current HHS Secretary. Whether it was as \nSecretary of HHS or Governor of Kansas, Ms. Sebelius has always been a \nbright, hard-working, and devoted public servant. Despite constant and \nrelentless opposition, she fought every day in every way to make health \ninsurance a reality for millions of Americans. She was a phenomenal \npartner and tireless advocate in efforts to improve women's health, \nexpand mental health benefits and services, fight childhood obesity, \nand protect people from dangerous influenza strains. She was a fierce \nadvocate for those most in need and she will be missed. I wish her and \nher family well in all future endeavors.\n  As I mentioned earlier, HHS is a $1 trillion agency. Every single \nperson worldwide benefits from work done at HHS. For instance, HHS \noversees the National Institutes of Health, NIH--our Federal agency \nresponsible for finding cures and treatments for the illnesses and \ndiseases that impact our families. HHS also oversees the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC--our Federal agency responsible for \nprotecting the public health by preventing, tracking, and managing the \nspread of disease. HHS also oversees the Food and Drug Administration, \nFDA--our Federal agency responsible for protecting our Nation's food \nand drug supply. HHS oversees the Administration on Children and \nFamilies, ACF--our Federal agency responsible for running the Head \nStart Program and helping lower income families afford childcare. In \naddition, HHS is responsible for overseeing the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services, CMS--our Federal agency responsible for managing \nMedicare for our Nation's seniors and Medicaid for those in need. These \nare only a few examples of how we rely on HHS agencies.\n  We also rely on HHS for implementation of Affordable Care Act. \nUnfortunately, healthcare reform remains a divisive issue, despite \npassing the House and Senate, being signed into law by the President, \nand being upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States. It also \nremains divisive despite all the benefits we have seen so far: More \nthan 8 million Americans have obtained health insurance thanks to \nhealthcare reform. More than 3 million young adults have been able to \nstay on their parents' health insurance plans. More than 3 million \npeople have been newly enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, CHIP. Thanks to healthcare reform, being a woman is \nno longer a preexisting condition and people can no longer be denied \ncoverage or charged more for preexisting conditions. And thanks to \nhealthcare reform's provisions to close the dreaded doughnut hole, more \nthan 7 million seniors have saved $9 billion in prescription drug \ncosts.\n  Despite the many successes of healthcare reform, there is still much \nto be done, and we need a Secretary in place to get that job done. We \nneed a Secretary focused on ensuring smooth open enrollment periods \nthat are glitch-free. We need a Secretary who is willing and able to \nwork with States who are not yet where they need to be. We need a \nSecretary focused on protecting people's privation information in an \never-dangerous cyber climate, and we need a Secretary focused on \ngetting young people enrolled in health insurance plans and focused on \nkeeping premiums low for individuals and small businesses.\n  Running HHS is a big job. Ms. Burwell is the right woman for the job. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in support of her confirmation to serve \nas Secretary of HHS.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, today we consider the nomination of \nSylvia Mathews Burwell to be the next Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. Ms. Burwell currently serves as Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget, a position to which she was \nconfirmed by a vote of 96-0 in April 2013. Through a dynamic career in \nboth public service and private sector leadership, she has proven \nherself as an effective manager with experience and skill in leading a \nwide range of organizations. During her confirmation hearing in the \nHELP Committee last month, she garnered strong support from Members on \nboth sides of the aisle. Clearly, I am not alone in concluding that she \nis a deeply impressive nominee and is eminently qualified to serve as \nthe next Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  The United States faces serious public health challenges, many of \nwhich require urgent answers. Very often, the entire world looks to HHS \nfor leadership. Just last month, this country confronted the first ever \nincident of MERS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, within our borders. \nHHS responded quickly to educate the public, investigate the situation, \nand develop a path forward.\n  We will count on our next Secretary for exactly that kind of \ninformed, decisive action in the face of future challenges and crises, \nand to provide a steady hand overseeing an incredible range of \nactivities across the Department.\n  For example, she will be responsible for research efforts at the \nNational Institutes of Health, among other agencies. This federally \nsponsored research has made the United States the world leader in \nbiomedical innovation, and has resulted in countless discoveries and \nbreakthroughs, from the extraordinary application of genomics to \ncutting-edge pharmaceuticals to an unprecedented understanding of the \nhuman brain.\n  As Secretary, Ms. Burwell will also be in charge of another long-time \npriority of mine, disease prevention. She will lead our Nation's \nefforts to transform our health care system from a ``sick care system'' \ninto one that focuses on wellness and prevention, not just at the \ndoctor's office but also in our schools, workplaces, and communities.\n  Ms. Burwell will oversee the Food and Drug Administration--a \ncritically important agency that protects and promotes public health by \nhelping to keep our Nation's food and medical product supplies safe, \namong other things. In fact, FDA now oversees items that account for 25 \ncents out of every dollar spent by Americans.\n  The Department also ensures that we can meet the health care and \neducation needs of our most vulnerable citizens through programs like \nthe community health centers, Ryan White HIV programs, and the Head \nStart program.\n  The Secretary is also charged with oversight of programs that support \nmillions of Americans with disabilities. Medicaid makes it possible for \nmany with chronic disabilities to remain in their homes, to go to work \nor school, and to be active members of society. In tandem, the \nAdministration for Community Living implements policies that help \npeople with disabilities to stay in their homes, neighborhoods and \nplaces of work, with the result that people are healthier, happier, and \nhave better quality of life.\n  And of course Ms. Burwell will have the critical role of overseeing \nimplementation of the Affordable Care Act. We can be proud that thanks \nto the Affordable Care Act we have seen over 6 million new Medicaid \nenrollees, and more than 8 million more Americans have signed up for \nhealth insurance in the marketplaces. But there is more work to be done \nto continue successfully implementing the law and reforming our health \ncare system.\n  The list goes on and on, but I have made my point that as Secretary, \nMs. Burwell will shoulder incredibly important responsibilities that \nmatter deeply to the health and wellness of the American people. I have \nno doubt that Ms. Burwell is up for the challenge.\n  Since her nomination Ms. Burwell has met with numerous members of\n\n[[Page S3453]]\n\nthis body to discuss their individual priorities and her personal \nvision for the Department. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of \nMs. Burwell and confirm her as our next HHS Secretary so she can begin \nthe important work of advancing our Nation's health.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. To close for our side, I would like to strongly urge my \ncolleagues in a few minutes to support the nomination of Sylvia Mathews \nBurwell to be the next Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  I want to start with a simple fact. Sylvia Mathews Burwell's \nnomination has a breadth of bipartisan support because she is really \nthat good, she is really that capable, and she is really that \nqualified.\n  I am going to say to colleagues, nobody has to take my word for it. \nWe all know that our colleague on the other side of the aisle, Senator \nCoburn, is a man of strong views. He says what he means, and he means \nwhat he says. As a ranking member of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Coburn has had many \nopportunities to work closely with Ms. Burwell during her service as \nthe OMB Director.\n  For example, he emphasized the nominee's competence, saying: The fact \nis when you have somebody who is confident, competent, and also has \nstrong character, you find a way to get past your differences to try to \nsolve problems.\n  He emphasized she is a good listener and that she is communicative.\n  He said:\n\n       Responsiveness is key for the Congress, and I have to tell \n     you I found her remarkably responsive. The fact is she is \n     going to be committed to do the right thing and to keep \n     Congress involved.\n\n  Finally, in a quote that I thought was particularly striking, Senator \nCoburn said:\n\n       Even when she has made up her mind, which sometimes \n     happens, she will listen to another point of view to get \n     information she might not have.\n\n  Senator Coburn also said:\n\n       That is a characteristic too often that we don't see, as \n     Members of Congress, and in members of the administration, \n     whether they are Republican or a Democrat.\n\n  Senator Coburn is not the only one who is part of this we could call \nit choir of bipartisan support for Sylvia Mathews Burwell.\n  When she went before the HELP Committee, our Republican colleague \nfrom North Carolina, Senator Burr, said:\n\n       I support her nomination. I will vote for her in the \n     Finance Committee, and it is for one primary reason, it is \n     because she doesn't come with a single experience that would \n     make her a good Secretary. She comes with a portfolio of \n     experience that would make her a tremendous asset at \n     addressing some of the challenges the agency specifically and \n     uniquely has.\n\n  Senator Burr continued:\n\n       I look forward to her confirmation being quick and our \n     ability to then work together to be every bit as quick.\n\n  These are statements that reflect a nominee who is going to be, in my \nview, an active agent of bipartisanship. She is somebody who has \nalready shown she can bring Democrats and Republicans together to solve \nbig challenges, and I think she is going to show it at the Department \nof Health and Human Services.\n  Suffice it to say, we know Health and Human Services will need to \nhave strong leadership in the days ahead. We know the debate about the \nAffordable Care Act is going to continue. It is going to continue in \nHawaii, Oregon, and across the country.\n  My hope, as chair of the Finance Committee, is that Sylvia Mathews \nBurwell can help bring together Democrats and Republicans to build on \nthe Affordable Care Act, just as many of us did to work with former \nPresident George W. Bush, to strengthen the Part D Program, the \nMedicare prescription drug program. Many of the first stories about \nMedicare Part D were much like the first stories about the Affordable \nCare Act. Yet Democrats and Republicans came together, were able to \nstrengthen Part D to the point where now--enormous support among \nseniors--it has come in at more than 30 percent below the cost \nprojected by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  So let's all work together with Sylvia Mathews Burwell to do for the \nAffordable Care Act what we did with George W. Bush's program on \nprescription drugs, and that has worked in a bipartisan way.\n  One of the reasons I am so enthused about Sylvia Mathews Burwell is \nwe have big challenges that both sides, Democrats and Republicans, are \ngoing to have to team up on to tackle in the days ahead. For example, \nMedicare in 2014 is dramatically different than Medicare when it began \nin 1965. In 1965, for example, if a senior broke their ankle, if he or \nshe needed to see a doctor, they went perhaps to an outpatient program, \nPart B of the Medicare Program. If they needed more attention--perhaps \nthe ankle needed to be reset--they had to go to the hospital, they \nwould get assistance in the hospital under Part A.\n  Today that is not primarily what Medicare is all about. Today, well \nover 80 percent of Medicare is tackling chronic disease. We are talking \nabout diabetes, we are talking about cancer, we are talking about \nstrokes and heart disease. Certainly if you add Alzheimer's on top of \nit, that is 90 percent of the Medicare Program. That broken ankle, when \nthe senior has one, of course, has to be taken care of. But most of \nMedicare is about chronic disease.\n  What we are going to need is Democrats and Republicans coming \ntogether to tackle an issue that, frankly, has gotten short shrift in \nWashington, DC. It didn't come up a whole lot in the debate about the \nAffordable Care Act on any side, and yet it is going to be the issue \nthat dominates the future of the flagship health care program in this \ncountry, Medicare; and much of what is done for chronic disease for the \nMedicare population will also be copied for the under-65 population, \nsince the trend historically, when Medicare takes bold action, is often \nreplicated in the private sector.\n  Some of this work has begun, but the fact is we need a strong leader \nwith bipartisan support, as I have tried to highlight with Dr. Coburn's \ncomments, Senator Burr's comments, and others. I think it was all \nsummed up when Dr. Coburn and Senator Rockefeller--the senior \nDemocratic Senator from her home State--teamed up that first day and \nset the mood about how this would be a nominee with exceptional ability \nto reach out and tackle the big challenges of our time.\n  Medicare, of course, in my view, is the biggest. But the issue of \nfamily support, the child welfare programs the Department manages, \nthese are programs that are critical lifelines for struggling Americans \nacross the country. So many of our people are now falling between the \ncracks--falling between the cracks into poverty since the recession. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services plays a powerful role \nensuring that we have a strong safety net.\n\n  I have talked about her credentials before, but her education \nincludes a stellar background, a graduate of Harvard and Oxford, where \nshe was a Rhodes scholar. She was a staff director of the National \nEconomic Council. This is someone who is very savvy on the big economic \nchallenges, and she has superb experience. In 1977 she became Deputy \nChief of Staff to the President and moving the following year to become \nthe Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  She also has extensive experience in the nonprofit world. At the \nGates Foundation she led efforts to tackle some of the most pressing \nglobal health challenges of our time.\n  At the Walmart Foundation, where she served in 2011, she offered \noutstanding leadership in the fight against hunger and to improve \neconomic opportunity for women.\n  As Senators consider this nomination in the last couple of minutes \nbefore the vote, I only want to remind--perhaps not subtly--the Senate \nconfirmed Sylvia Mathews Burwell for the position of Director of Office \nof Management and Budget 96 to 0. I think that is a very rare statement \nof bipartisanship for an extremely important position that not\n\n[[Page S3454]]\n\nonly has Sylvia Mathews Burwell discharged very well, she has won \nadditional plaudits for her bipartisan work, as I have indicated today.\n  She is going to respond to the biggest and the big challenges in a \nway that I believe brings Americans together. That is what Senators \nhave said throughout the process, and they have said it whether you \nhave a D or an R next to your name. What the country needs, in short, \nis somebody who is a true agent of bipartisanship.\n  I conclude my remarks by saying I have gotten to know Sylvia Mathews \nBurwell well in the past few years. She is the right choice for the \nright time, and I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to join me this afternoon in supporting her nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3454-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Carolyn Hessler-Radelet, \nof Virginia, to be Director of the Peace Corps.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will vote to confirm the President's \nnominee for Director of the Peace Corps. However, I want explain why I \nobjected to any unanimous consent request relating to this nomination \nin March and why I have withdrawn my objection. I objected because I \nwas informed by the Peace Corps inspector general that she was having \ndifficulty accessing records from the agency. The nominee is the acting \ndirector of the agency. The records relate to sexual assaults reported \nby Peace Corps volunteers.\n  The inspector general is entitled to access these records under the \nInspector General Act and the Kate Puzey Act. Both acts reinforce the \nprinciple that agency operations should be monitored by an independent \nand objective inspector general. The Kate Puzey Act requires the agency \nto better respond to volunteers who report sexual assault and implement \ncertain protections for victims of sexual assault. To ensure that these \nprotections are actually implemented, it also requires the inspector \ngeneral to conduct ``a case review of a statistically significant \nnumber of cases'' of sexual assaults reported by volunteers.\n  However, the agency has gone out of its way to interpret the Kate \nPuzey Act as conflicting with the Inspector General Act. In fact, the \nagency repeatedly stated that certain provisions of the Kate Puzey Act \noverride the Inspector General Act. That was never the intent of \nCongress. But the Peace Corps withheld most of the information that the \ninspector general requested from the agency.\n  Fortunately, the Peace Corps and the inspector general recently \nagreed on a memorandum of understanding, MOU. This MOU was agreed to \nonly after I placed a hold on the Acting Director's nomination, and \nonly after I sent three letters to the agency about the dispute, along \nwith several other Members. Under the MOU, the Peace Corps has agreed \nto provide the inspector general with more information than before. For \nthe time being, the inspector general believes that the MOU will allow \nher to carry out her oversight duties.\n  However, the inspector general has made it clear to me that the MOU \nhas many shortcomings. Most importantly, the Peace Corps still refuses \nto acknowledge the inspector general's legal right to access the \nrecords in question. In addition, the MOU can be terminated by either \nparty at any time. So the inspector general believes that she would be \nback at square one if the parties ever disagree in the future on the \namount of information she needs to independently evaluate how the \nagency handled a specific case of sexual assault.\n  Still, the MOU represents progress. So I am voting in favor of this \nnomination. The law says that the inspector general is entitled to full \nand timely access to the records in question. So I will monitor this \nsituation closely. And I will count on the nominee to guide the agency \ninto full compliance with the law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Carolyn Hessler-Radelet, of Virginia, to \nbe Director of the Peace Corps?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motions to \nreconsider are considered made and laid upon the table, and the \nPresident will be immediately notified of the Senate's actions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                            The Environment\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I rise to talk about the new regulations President Obama \nproposed this week that are obviously aimed at the coal industry, but \nlet's be frank, these regulations go far beyond the President's \ncampaign to put coal out of business. These regulations target energy \nto make it less affordable and less abundant. Once again we are seeing \nhow consumers, students, and low-income families are getting priced\n\n[[Page S3455]]\n\nout of the economy because of government policy. The more the \ngovernment dictates and promotes a one-size-fits-all solution, the more \nit hits folks in their pocketbooks.\n  I don't think I have ever met a single person who said they were \nanti-environment. I cannot think of a single person who likes dirty \nwater or polluted skies, but if we listen to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, we would assume Republicans have made it their \nlife's work to kill the planet. It makes for great sound bites and it \ncan help rally their base; it does not, however, contribute much to the \ndiscussion at hand or make much of a difference.\n  Actions have consequences and these proposed regulations will have a \nreal, tangible, measurable impact on the economy at a time when job \ncreation should be our focus. The truth is coal powers America. Almost \n70 percent of all energy produced in this country came from the ground \nand most of it was coal.\n  Even electric cars are powered by coal, but sadly you won't see that \non a bumper sticker. That is what I call an inconvenient truth. If we \nwere to shut down our coal facilities for even a single day, I think \neven my colleagues from the other side of the aisle would quickly be \ncalling for these plants to be turned back on.\n  In my State coal is one of our largest employers. It provides high-\npaying jobs to our residents, as it does to folks all across the \ncountry. The revenue from energy production even provides scholarships \nfor our students to get an education. For our State coal is not just an \nenergy source, it is a livelihood.\n  The President may want us to run from coal, but I think we should be \nrunning toward it. George Washington Carver developed over 100 products \nfrom peanuts. Think what we could do with coal if we spent more time \nand resources developing our most abundant resource instead of trying \nto destroy it. American ingenuity would lead to our next energy \nrevolution. But that is not happening. Instead, a project that the \nUniversity of Wyoming and the private sector were working on to produce \ncleaner energy from coal was canceled because of the President's \nefforts to kill coal. There is no future in selling the products that \nwould be developed to enhance coal.\n  We have to trust American ingenuity. No one likes to sit in the dark, \nand I imagine most folks like being able to run their air-conditioner \nin the summer. States that rely on coal for their power see an average \nof 30 percent lower electricity costs than States that use other fuels. \nAn increase of that size would be noticed by almost everyone regardless \nof political affiliation.\n  We could learn a thing or two from Germany. They are going back to \ncoal after experimenting with alternative sources. They realized that \ncoal is readily available and will help them bring down energy prices.\n  Incidentally, coal is the only energy source you can stockpile for \nemergencies.\n  The plain fact is that this President is proposing a cap-and-tax \nproposal that already failed in Congress. My colleagues then realized \nthat it is an extremely expensive idea, and the increased costs would \nbe passed along to consumers, who must pay to use more expensive energy \nsources. But the fact that Congress rejected this proposal seems to \nhave encouraged the administration to yet again sidestep Congress and \nimplement another costly backdoor regulation. Even some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle say they are angry about this \ntax imposed on the people without approval from their representatives \nin Congress.\n  I have heard comments about how courageous the President is for \nfinally going after coal. It is not as if the President ever hid his \ndisdain for energy that comes from the ground. He has been targeting it \nwith redtape his entire Presidency. These ideas are purely political \nand will have a heavy impact on the economy with little or no \nmeasurable impact on the environment.\n  The Wall Street Journal pointed out in a recent editorial that \n``based on the EPA's own carbon accounting, shutting down every single \ncoal-fired power plant tomorrow and replacing them with zero-carbon \nsources would reduce the Earth's temperature by about one-twentieth of \na degree Fahrenheit in a hundred years.''\n  Let me repeat that. The Wall Street Journal pointed out in a recent \neditorial that ``based on the EPA's own carbon accounting, shutting \ndown every single coal-fired power plant tomorrow and replacing them \nwith zero-carbon sources would reduce the Earth's temperature by about \none-twentieth of a degree Fahrenheit in a hundred years.''\n  When government tries to pick winners and losers in any part of the \nmarket, everyone loses. Just look at how great our health care system \nis doing.\n  If we as a body allow the President to get his way on this \nregulation, we will be looking at billions in annual economic losses. \nHundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs. We will burden \nour businesses with billions of dollars in costs, all of which will be \npassed on to the consumers in the form of double-digit energy price \nincreases. If you are elderly, a low-income or even middle-class family \nor living on a fixed income, are you willing to pay this energy tax \nthat won't make a dent in CO2 emissions? I can't imagine you \nwould be. These new regulations will only succeed in making the \npocketbooks lighter and the country darker.\n  When we have affordable and abundant energy, America stays \ncompetitive with the rest of the world. Low-cost energy could help \ncreate more than 1 million jobs over the next decade, and it could lure \nmore investment into American manufacturing. The cost of energy is a \nbig factor in manufacturing. We all say we need to put people back to \nwork. Driving up costs to consumers and businesses doesn't seem to \nbenefit anyone.\n  I hope my colleagues from the other side of the aisle will join me \ntoday and say enough is enough. The President is proposing to leave a \npermanent stain on our economy. We should not be putting people out of \nwork or driving up energy prices.\n  I hope every American will call on their representatives to oppose \nthis President's proposal. It is our constituents who keep us \naccountable.\n  The Republican leader has already introduced legislation to stop this \nreckless move by the EPA, and I am proud to join him in that effort. \nOur bill is simple. It requires that the President prove that this rule \nwill not cause job losses, that it will not increase energy rates, and \nthat it will not hurt our country's economic output. We know the \nPresident's regulations will put America at an economic disadvantage, \nbut I worry we won't get a vote on this commonsense bill--or even done \nas an amendment--and that is a real shame because I think a majority of \nthis body would support the bill and oppose the President's proposal.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                                 D-day\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, a momentous occasion is occurring \ntomorrow; that is, the 70th anniversary of D-day. Seventy years ago \ntomorrow, as the American people slept in their beds, the greatest \nnaval invasion in history was underway.\n  On D-day, June 6, 1944, tens of thousands of American soldiers, \nsailors, and airmen joined allies from around the free world to begin \nwhat General Eisenhower called a great crusade--one that sought to free \na continent. They came by amphibious landing craft, and I think my \ncolleague from Louisiana is going to talk more about that in a moment. \nThey also came by gliders laden with men and materiel and by parachutes \ndeployed deep behind enemy lines. At beaches called Omaha and Utah and \nat the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc, they struck a mortal blow to the Nazi \nregime. Thousands would give their lives that day for that noble cause.\n  Like many in this Chamber, I have seen the American cemetery over \nthere with rows of white crosses and Stars of David. They are a stark \nreminder of the price those brave heroes paid for all of us. These men \ndid not go into battle alone. General Eisenhower said to the Allied \nExpeditionary Force on the eve of the battle, ``The hopes and prayers \nof liberty loving people everywhere march with you.'' Eisenhower was \nnot exaggerating. As word of the invasion spread through the predawn \nhours of Tuesday morning, people gathered all over this country in \nchurches, synagogues, meeting houses, public places\n\n[[Page S3456]]\n\nlarge and small, to seek God's blessing on men who were even then in \nharm's way.\n  As the battle raged on that day, President Franklin Roosevelt spoke \nto the Nation. He did not choose to address the American people with a \nspeech; instead, he delivered words of prayer by radio address as the \nfate of Europe and, indeed, the entire free world hung in the balance. \nIt is a very powerful prayer, transcending all faiths. It is a prayer \nthat tells the story of why America fought and makes evident the \nsacrifices we were willing to make to see through to victory with God's \nhelp. It is a prayer that speaks to the horrors of war and the beauty \nof peace. It is a prayer that captures--perhaps better than anything \nelse written since--the magnitude of what happened that day as we hit \nthe beaches of Normandy.\n  I hope that prayer will never be forgotten, and that is why Senator \nLandrieu and I believe that prayer should be added as part of the World \nWar II monument pursuant to bipartisan legislation we have been working \non for a few years. I previously cosponsored it with Senator Lieberman \nand now with Senator Landrieu. It has gone through the Energy Committee \ntwice with unanimous votes. It is called the World War II Memorial \nPrayer Act of 2013. This legislation also passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a significant vote, 286 to 26.\n  I would like to recite that prayer now with my colleague from \nLouisiana. I would like her to begin this prayer. After nearly 70 \nyears, it still has the power to bring us together as a people and \nremind us that while we may have differences at times, there are so \nmany things that do unite us.\n  Mr. President, I defer to my colleague from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for sharing this \nmoment with me on the Senate floor and allowing me to work closely with \nhim to present this bill to the Senate today. He has worked on this for \nseveral years, and I am pleased to join him for any number of reasons.\n  One thing I wish to mention before I share the reading of this prayer \nwith him is that the official World War II museum happens to be located \nin New Orleans, LA. It was initiated by the great historian Stephen \nAmbrose. It has been promoted by an extraordinarily stellar group of \ncivic and political leaders in our Nation. Former Senator Stevens and \nSenator Inouye joined arms together as brothers in the Senate and \nhelped us to establish this official museum. It is almost complete.\n  On the eve of D-day, it is particularly striking that the two of us \nwould be here to remember this prayer and to say to the country that \nthis prayer, in our view, should be on the memorial here in DC.\n  I am also hoping, just as a suggestion, that it will be placed \nsomewhere significantly in this fabulous, extraordinary, beautifully \ndesigned and beautifully executed museum that tells the story of the \nwar--not how it was won but why it was fought. Why it was fought is the \nmost important lesson for our country and the people of the world to \nknow. Some of that is expressed in this prayer. More of that is \nexpressed in the museum itself.\n  The Senator from Ohio would want to know that hundreds of citizens \nfrom New Orleans and Louisiana are actually on their way by boat to \nNormandy, and, of course, many of our elected officials, including the \nPresident, will be celebrating the 70th anniversary.\n  The reason this museum is in New Orleans is because the Higgins boats \nwere actually built in New Orleans, and it is unusual that such a small \ncity would have contributed so much. Eisenhower himself said that \nwithout these landing craft, we never could have gotten to the Normandy \nbeach. They were built by an entrepreneur who had a small factory at \nthe time that then grew, with 43,000 people employed. Men, women, \nAfrican-Americans, and disabled workers were all being paid the same.\n  There is a remarkable story about the boats themselves that landed at \nNormandy, but this effort today is about a memorial prayer that I think \nwe should remember and be reminded of.\n  I will begin by reciting this prayer which was given by President \nRoosevelt, and he asked the American people on that day to join him in \nthis prayer.\n  He said:\n\n       Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have \n     set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our \n     Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free \n     a suffering humanity.\n       Lead them straight and true; give strength to their arms, \n     stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness in their faith.\n       They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and \n     hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. \n     Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return \n     again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the \n     righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph.\n       They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without \n     rest--until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by \n     noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the \n     violences of war.\n       For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They \n     fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end \n     conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice \n     arise, and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They \n     yearn but for the end of the battle, for their return to the \n     haven of home. Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, \n     and receive them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, the prayer continues:\n\n       And for us at home--fathers, mothers, children, wives, \n     sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas, whose thoughts \n     and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty God, to \n     rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of \n     great sacrifice.\n       Many people have urged that I call the nation into a single \n     day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the \n     desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a \n     continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again \n     when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips, \n     invoking Thy help to our efforts.\n       Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to \n     redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the \n     material support of our armed forces.\n       And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail, \n     to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our \n     sons wheresoever they may be.\n       And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee; faith in \n     our sons; faith in each other; faith in our united crusade. \n     Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not \n     the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but \n     fleeting moment--let not these deter us in our unconquerable \n     purpose.\n       With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces \n     of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and \n     racial arrogances. Lead us to the saving of our country, and \n     with our sister nations into a world unity that will spell a \n     sure peace--a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy \n     men. And a peace that will let all of men live in freedom, \n     reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.\n       Thy will be done, almighty God. Amen.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Amen.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, that was the prayer that Franklin \nRoosevelt gave on that fateful day. Of course, many of the men who \nfought that day have gone on to their eternal reward, and some of them \nwill mark tomorrow with quiet remembrances with families and friends.\n  Senator Landrieu has noted that there will be people from Louisiana \ngoing over to the D-day celebrations--it sounds like some by boat--also \nfrom Ohio and from all over the country. Our President will be there. \nSome will go there to retrace their steps and to see where they were on \nthose beaches. Others will go just to see the cemeteries and remember \ntheir fallen comrades. There is a 93-year-old gentleman from Ohio named \nJim Martin. He will be there too. He will be jumping from an airplane \nat 93 years old and parachuting onto the same soil he took back from \nthe Nazis 70 years ago. On behalf of all of us, I wish Jim Godspeed.\n  There is very little we can add to the legacy they have created for \nthemselves, but we can honor it and we can remember it, and that is \nwhat this bipartisan legislation is all about. Again, I crafted it \noriginally with then-Senator Joe Lieberman and now have joined with \nSenator Landrieu to introduce it in this Congress. It directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to install in the area of the World War II \nMemorial a plaque with the inscription of the prayer we have just read.\n  Last Congress, the House of Representatives passed this legislation \nwith an overwhelming vote of 386 to 26, and after a hearing on May 29, \nthey are moving forward with doing so again. Today, on the eve of this \nhistoric anniversary, it is time for the Senate to lead the way toward \nenshrining this\n\n[[Page S3457]]\n\nsingular moment in the history of our great country.\n  Senator Landrieu and I intend to call up Calendar No. 339 later this \nafternoon, and we hope in doing so we will achieve unanimous consent to \nbe able to have the Senate proceed to consideration of this \nlegislation, and then ask unanimous consent for it to be passed by this \nbody. This is legislation we have worked on carefully. It has gone \nthrough the process of working with the Department of the Interior. We \nhave ensured that it is consistent not just with the Department of \nInterior but also specifically with the Commemorative Works Act. It is \nsomething that, again, has been bipartisan and something that helps to \nbring this Congress and this country together during a critical time.\n  I thank my colleague from Louisiana for working with me. I think it \nis an incredibly important opportunity for us, on the eve of the 70th \nanniversary, to pass this legislation here in the Senate, thereby doing \nsomething positive for the future by telling them the importance of the \npast. This prayer is certainly part of that.\n  I yield for my colleague from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me join my colleague in asking for \nunanimous consent for this particular individual bill to pass by \nunanimous consent. It would be lovely if we could do this today because \nof the timing of our D-day celebration tomorrow. For the information of \nour colleagues who have other bills pending that are called lands \nbills, we are still working on a smaller package in addition to this. \nBut we felt that this has such significance and importance and it is so \ntimely today that it would really be important for us to do this.\n  So I hope our staffs can clear this on both sides and we can get this \ndone before close of business today.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana and I \nlook forward to being back on the floor shortly to propound the \nunanimous consent request to pass this legislation and to do so prior \nto this momentous 70th anniversary tomorrow.\n  I yield back my time, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Veterans Care\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I believe every Member of this Senate and \nevery American understands the very deep debt of gratitude we owe to \nthe men and women who put their lives on the line to defend this \ncountry. That should not be a political issue. It should not be a \npartisan issue. I think all of us have been appalled by what we read \nabout in Phoenix and in other locations about people manipulating data, \npretending veterans were getting care in a timely manner when that was \nnot the case.\n  It is my strong belief, as chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, that every veteran in this country is entitled to high-\nquality medical care and that they should get that care in a timely \nmanner. I am going to do everything I can to make that happen.\n  We live, as everybody knows, in a politically divided country and a \ndivided Congress. Reaching agreements is not easy and, quite frankly, \ndoes not take place very often in the Senate. Unfortunately, for \nwhatever reason--without casting blame--it just does not happen. The \nAmerican people understand that and are not happy about that. So \nreaching a compromise among people who look at the world very \ndifferently is not easy, but in this process, Senator John McCain of \nArizona and I have tried our best to come forward with an agreement. It \nis an agreement which I am sure he is not 100 percent happy about and I \ncan fully assure you I am not 100 percent happy about. I would have \nwritten a very different bill. I thank Senator Harry Reid for his \nstrong support for this process, and Chuck Schumer, Patty Murray, and \nDick Durbin for pushing this effort forward. I hope we will be back on \nthe floor to continue the effort to deal with the many unmet needs of \nveterans, but right now we have a crisis on our hands and it is \nimperative we deal with that crisis.\n  To my mind, the essence of the crisis is that we have learned in many \nparts of this country--not all parts but in many parts of this \ncountry--veterans cannot get the timely care they need. They cannot \nwalk into a VA facility and within a reasonable period of time get the \ntreatment they need.\n  So this bill, in a significant way, begins to address that important \nissue. Let me very briefly tell you how it does that.\n  For a start, there are many locations around the country where we \nneed new facilities, we need refurbished facilities, we need expanded \nfacilities. In fact, there are 26 locations in 18 States where that is \nthe case. This legislation would allow the construction of 26 major \nmedical facility leases in 18 States around the country. I believe that \nwill help us in many parts of the country in providing the quality, \ntimely care our veterans deserve.\n  In my view, there are areas of the country where we simply do not \nhave the doctors, the nurses, and the other staff we need to provide \nthe care our veterans deserve. Many primary care physicians get burned \nout by working 12, 14 hours a day. They quit. The turnover rate is too \nhigh. It is my view that the VA, by and large--and this is echoed by \nthe views of the veterans community itself in independent studies--that \nwhen people get into the VA, the quality of care is good. But I will \ntell you, if we do not have the primary care physicians, the other \nphysicians, the nurses we need to treat veterans, they are not going to \nget the care they need.\n  This legislation will target $500 million in unobligated balances for \nthe hiring of new VA doctors and nurses. I see that as a significant \nstep forward.\n  One of the great embarrassments or shocks that all of us feel is that \nwithin the military we have seen in recent years horrendous accounts of \nsexual assault. What this legislation does is say to those women and \nmen who were sexually assaulted in the military that when they get into \nthe VA, there is going to be quality care for their needs.\n  This legislation also touches on a couple of issues that are not \ndirectly related to health care but have overwhelming support in the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  We have heard from many young veterans who are in college as a result \nof the post-9/11 GI bill who right now cannot afford it because they \nare not getting instate tuition. This legislation addresses that issue.\n  I have talked, as I know Senator McCain has, to Gold Star Wives. \nThese are the women who have lost their husbands in combat who, I think \nfor not a sensible reason, are unable to take advantage of the post-9/\n11 GI bill. They want to get their lives together. They want to be able \nto go to college or whatever. This bill addresses that issue.\n  There is another provision which was strongly supported by Senator \nMcCain and other Republican leaders--and Senator McCain, I am sure, \nwill go into it at great length, but essentially what this provision \ndoes is say if someone is 40 miles or farther away from a VA health \ncare facility--a medical center, a CBOC or whatever it may be--they \nwill be able to go to the doctor of their choice, under the strict \nsupervision of the VA.\n  What this will do is prevent people from, in some cases in very rural \nareas--I think this is mostly a bill for people in very rural areas who \nnow have to travel long distances to get their health care--this will \nmake their lives easier. This is a 2-year trial project. We will see \nhow it turns out, but that is in the bill as well.\n  The last point I wish to make is I do not think there is any \ndisagreement in the Senate nor among the American people that when we \nhave incompetent people in the VA or worse--dishonest people in the \nVA--they should be removed from their jobs immediately and that the \nSecretary of the VA should have the power to get rid of them. I do not \nthink there is any debate about that.\n  Where there has been some debate is that in my view those employees \ndeserve due process. I say that because I\n\n[[Page S3458]]\n\ndo not want to see a situation where a new President comes in and for \npolitical reasons fires 400 top executives because they are Democrats \nor because they are Republicans or whatever. I do not want to see a \nsituation where somebody is fired because she is a woman or Black or \nHispanic or maybe gay, and maybe that is the underlying motive and that \nperson has no course of appeal.\n  So what we have done is developed a very expedited process in terms \nof dismissal. We say if someone is dismissed, they are off the payroll \ntomorrow, they are gone, but they are going to have a week to file an \nappeal, and the appropriate body will have 3 weeks to rule on their \nappeal. I think that makes sense. I think when you think about it, it \ndoes make sense.\n\n  There are a few other important provisions. It is important, in my \nview, for the Nation to take advantage of the expertise that is out \nthere in the private sector. How do we develop information technology \nfor people accessing the VA? We want to do that. We have a commission \nthat would help us do that. We have another Presidential commission \nthat will help us with construction, which has been an ongoing problem \nin the VA.\n  That is a brief overview of what is in the legislation. Does it solve \nall of the problems facing our veterans? Absolutely not. Should we come \nback and continue to deal with this issue? Absolutely. But I think, \ngiven the crises we have right now, this is an important step forward.\n  I thank Senator McCain. Senator McCain's views on many issues are not \nmy views. We look at the world differently, but that is what democracy \nis about. Our job was to sit down and work out the best agreement. We \ndid. I think from day one Senator McCain showed absolute good faith in \nthis, a desire to reach a compromise. I hope he feels I did the same. \nWe are where we are today.\n  So with that I yield the floor for Senator McCain and thank him very \nmuch for his efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I would like to say to the Senator from Vermont that I respect a \ngreat deal the work he has done on this legislation. I respect his \ncommitment and his leadership of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I \nrespect the fact that Bernie Sanders is known as a fighter, and it has \nbeen a pleasure to do combat with him.\n  But I also would like to say that at the end of the day with strongly \nheld views on different aspects of this issue, we were able to come \ntogether in a way that will help to relieve this terrible tragedy that \nseems to have befallen our Nation's veterans. It started in Phoenix, \nAZ, as my colleagues know, but it has spread all over the country. It \nbegins with the terrible story of perhaps 40 veterans having literally \ndied for lack of care.\n  I do not need to go through all of the different problems that have \nsurfaced in the ensuing days since that began, but there should be no \ndoubt in anyone's mind that we should accept the word of the inspector \ngeneral who said these are systemic problems. This is not a scheduling \nproblem. These are systemic problems that need to be addressed.\n  Our hope--as we concluded this legislation--was that perhaps we could \nput some of our other differences aside that have beset this body and \nmove forward and address this legislation as quickly as possible and \nbegin to repair the damage because we have, for all intents and \npurposes, in some ways betrayed the brave men and women who were \nwilling to go out and sacrifice for the well-being and freedom of the \nrest of us.\n  So, again, I say to Senator Sanders, I appreciate his leadership and \nI appreciate the fact that we both had to make some very tough \ncompromises, but I have found in my experience that when tough \ncompromises are made, usually that is a sign of bipartisanship and a \nsign that it is a good piece of legislation. I know that is not the \npopular thing to say nowadays in today's political environment, but I \ndo not believe, if compromises had not been made, that we would be \nbringing to the floor of the Senate--and working with the House's \nchairman Jeff Miller over there--that we would be doing what we are \nintroducing today.\n  I would also like to say a word about two other individuals; that is, \nSenator Burr, the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nwhom I admire enormously--he has worked tirelessly on behalf of the \nveterans and he is a most respected member of our conference--and of \ncourse our most unique treasure, Dr. Tom Coburn, who had been my \nnominee to take over the Veterans' Administration, which almost \ndestroyed a long and beautiful friendship, but Dr. Coburn is the \nconscience of our conference. He is the person whom we look up to and \nadmire the most for his integrity, for his honesty, his intelligence. I \nthank both Senator Burr and Dr. Coburn for their enormous work. In some \nways, I am sort of the spokesperson, when they did a great majority of \nthe work.\n  As Senator Sanders pointed out, I would like to just cover several \naspects of this legislation and try to explain a little bit why some of \nthese provisions are there.\n  Of course, a top priority for me for many years has been to give the \nveteran a choice. We ought to give the veteran a choice--the same \nchoice as people who are Medicare recipients, those who have TRICARE; \nthat is, the military health care program--where if they are outside of \n40 miles from the nearest VA facility, if there is a wait time which is \nunacceptable, then they should be able to go to the health care \nprovider right near their home, not have to get in a van and ride for 2 \nor 3 hours for routine medical care.\n  I also want to emphasize what I hope my colleagues understand, that \nthis is in no way a comment on the Veterans' Administration--I will \nleave that to others and other judgments--because there are things done \nin the veterans health care system that only the veterans health care \nsystem can handle: PTSD, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, \nprosthesis, war wounds, that only the VA can do. None of this that we \nare saying in any way denigrates or does anything that is \nuncomplimentary to the outstanding men and women who work in this \nsystem. We are proud of their work. It is the system that needs to be \nfixed. So I do not want anybody who is associated with the Veterans' \nAdministration to believe we are criticizing them.\n\n  We are talking about a system that must be fixed. It is urgent that \nit be fixed. Every single day that goes by a veteran is deprived of the \ncare he or she has earned serving this country is wrong. That is why I \nurge my colleagues: If you have amendments, if you think you can make \nthis bill better, we welcome it. We would be glad to discuss with you \namendments to this legislation. We would be glad, if you know how to \nmake it better.\n  But in the meantime, can we sort of pledge that we are committed to \nseeing this thing all the way through? I would urge my colleagues to do \nthat. Again, I know I speak for Senator Sanders when I say: If you have \na way to make this bill, this legislation, better, come on in. But \nlet's not get hung up on certain other aspects of our differences that \nhave characterized what most people would view as gridlock in this \nbody.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this compromise. It is a compromise. \nIf you think you can make it better, we welcome your input. But also, \nwe would like to have your commitment to seeing this through to the \nPresident's desk. I know that over on the other side of the Capitol \nthey are working hard on this issue too.\n  So we bring up, as I mentioned, veterans should have that card. That \nveteran should be able to go to a facility of his or her choice. \nAccountability. Senator Rubio and others, Congressman Miller and \nothers, have introduced legislation. Senator Sanders has improved on \nit. This calls for the immediate firing--an immediate firing if there \nis evidence of work that is not in keeping with the standards we expect \nof our employees.\n  During that period, under appeal, that person will not receive a \nsalary. That person will have some due process: 7 days to appeal to the \nMerit Systems Protection Board and there are 21 days for that Merit \nSystems Protection Board to render a final decision. Yes, we should \nhave, as many of our colleagues want, accountability. But that \naccountability also in this proposal allows for due process for someone \nto at least have their case heard.\n\n[[Page S3459]]\n\n  There is expedited hiring authority for VA doctors and nurses, and \nadditional authority to hire new providers. There are unobligated funds \nout there. We are going to use unobligated funds to hire more doctors \nand nurses where they are needed. But I would also point out, in some \ncases doctors and nurses have to work harder where they are. Also, \nthere are now pending, over the years, administration requests for 26 \nmajor facility leases to be entered into.\n  This has been the President's request. This has been a bipartisan \nagreement on the need for these facilities. I believe we should proceed \nwith it. I would also point out to my colleagues, this legislation has \nsome expenses. But the major expense is to move forward with the \nconstruction of these major medical facilities all over America. In the \nview of all, it is necessary.\n  This improves the access to health care for individuals who are the \nvictims of military sexual assault. Sexual assault is probably one of \nthe most vexing issues we face in the military today outside of combat. \nWe do not know exactly what causes some of this. We do know many times \nit is because of a lack of discipline. But there is no doubt this is a \nproblem in the military that needs to be addressed; otherwise, mothers \nand fathers will be not agreeable--in fact reluctant--to have their \nsons and daughters serve in the military unless we address this issue \nof sexual assault.\n  There are many efforts going on, in the Defense authorization bill, \nin the military, many other areas where we are working on this issue. \nBut I think this provision in the bill will be very helpful in \nattempting to address that issue.\n  A commission needs to be appointed on scheduling and care. We know \none of the problems is scheduling, and this whole issue of phantom \nlists and waiting lists that disappeared. We have to get to the bottom \nof it. I think the smartest people in America could help us on that. \nThere is another commission on capital planning. What are the needs of \nour veterans?\n  One of the things we do know is we have an aging veteran population \nfrom World War II, those who are, God bless them, still with us, Korea \nand Vietnam. That is an aging veterans population and requires a \ndifferent kind of care than those of Iraq and Afghanistan. To be frank, \na lot of that is geriatric care. To be frank, geriatric care is very \nexpensive. But we have to understand who this population is and what \ntheir needs are, just as we have to understand the Iraqi and \nAfghanistan war veterans and what their needs are.\n  Very frankly, our planning so far has not been very impressive to me. \nWe need to have--this is a pure Senator Sanders initiative--a GI bill \ntuition, eligibility for surviving spouses of those who died in the \nline of duty. It seems to me that is only fair. And a provision also \nthat in-State tuition will be provided for all veterans at public \ncolleges and universities.\n  Again, finally I want to say thank you to Senator Sanders. I also \nwant to say to my colleagues again: This is not a perfect document. We \nare ready to see any changes that we would consider, and perhaps \ngermane amendments. But I would also hope we could focus our attention \non the bill and the efforts to help our veterans, as opposed to other \nissues which seem to be with us on a daily basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I thank Senator McCain again. I think \nhis remarks were right on in terms of describing what is in this \nlegislation. I support his appeal.\n  Look, everybody has an issue. Every time a bill comes up, I have my \npet concerns that I could bring forth amendments on, Senator McCain has \nhis. But what we are appealing to right now is if you have a way to \nimprove this bill for our veterans, bring forth that amendment. But \nplease, please, do not bring forward extraneous amendments. Let's focus \non the needs of veterans. Let's not make them political footballs. I \nhope very much we can proceed in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise to offer a few words about the \ncolloquy that just was completed. I often find, when I am on the floor \nor presiding, that I feel sorry for the spectators in the Chamber. \nEither they are seeing the body not work as well as it should or \nsometimes they are watching a lot of silence, depending on when they \nare here. But I have been in the chair for the last hour. I think the \nspectators have been treated to what the Senate does when we do our \nbest. First Senators Portman and Landrieu put a bill on the floor \ndealing with a commemoration in connection with the 70th anniversary of \nD-day, which is tomorrow. It was a bill they are seeking unanimous \nconsent for. It was a very worthy one.\n  But, second, I know many of us, all of us in the Chamber, have been \nvery discouraged about the recent revelations and challenges within the \nVA. Many of us feared earlier this week that what we would get in this \ndiscussion were competing proposals or bills that would be partisan, \nwhere each side would fall short of doing what they wanted, and the \nveterans would not receive the kind of relief they should get.\n  What we have seen, with Senator Sanders and Senator McCain putting \nthis bill on the floor just now, is exactly how this should work for \nthe veterans, but in the legislative process more generally. So I am \npleased to congratulate my colleagues for taking two different \napproaches to this veterans challenge and working it out so a \nbipartisan bill can be offered. I think we owe it to the veterans, and \nespecially in light of these recent challenges, to show a unified face \nin trying to fix these problems. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I too want to join my colleague from \nVirginia in adding accolades to our Senators from Vermont and Arizona \nin putting together this proposal. I would like to make a few points \nhere. First, the veterans should come first. These are people whom we \nsent overseas to risk their lives for us. When they come back injured, \nnothing should stand in the way of us giving them the best medical care \npossible.\n  Senators McCain and Sanders, of different political philosophies--if \nthey each had to write their own bill would write different bills--came \ntogether, not for their ideology's sake, not for political advantage, \nbut for the good of these veterans. That is the highest duty we have \nhere.\n  The second point I would make is this: In a body that has been \nwracked by partisanship, I was hoping and praying that that \npartisanship would not stand in the way of us helping our veterans. \nBecause of this good work of Vermont and Arizona's Senators, that has \nhappened. That has happened. We are not home yet. We hope no one will \nbe so selfish that they feel their own amendment or amendments have to \nbe voted on if they are extraneous, because that could blow up the \ndeal. We all know how fragile, even for our veterans, bipartisan \nagreements are in this body. This is a higher calling.\n  I talked at length over the last several days with Senator Sanders. I \nknow how heartfelt this is for him. As he said: If he wrote his own \nbill, he would have done a lot more. But each of us writing a bill and \ngiving a speech about it is not going to help a single veteran. The way \nthis body works is, we have to come together. There is no one on the \nother side of the aisle, perhaps no one in this Chamber, who better \nrespects what veterans have gone through than Senator McCain after what \nhe went through himself as a prisoner of war. He was just the right \nperson for the chairman of our Veterans Committee, Bernie Sanders, to \nreach out to. Because they both cared so much about veterans, they came \ntogether. It is now up to the rest of us, the other 98, to do the same, \nto come together, to pass this bill quickly. This does not mean this \nwill be the last thing we will do for veterans. This is an issue we are \ngoing to have to revisit, given the sickness we have in parts of the \nVeterans Administration, given the long waiting lists, given the fact \nthat while most veterans get very good care in our VA, not every \nveteran does. Our goal is to have every veteran get good care in our \nVA.\n  Hopefully this bill will pass. Hopefully maybe this will set a \nprecedent that we can work together on important issues; we can each \nsubmerge some of our heartfelt feelings that it has to be our way and \nreach compromise with the other side. That is\n\n[[Page S3460]]\n\nwhat Senator Sanders has done. That is what Senator McCain has done. I \nsalute them for their patriotism, their good sense, and, frankly, their \ncourage.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            EPA Regulations\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I come this afternoon to speak about \nthe regulations proposed by the administration on Monday relating to \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. This time the agency's target is a \n30-percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from existing \npowerplants by the year 2030.\n  The regulation that has been announced, which has been the subject of \na great deal of conversation this week, should not be confused with EPA \nrules for cooling water intake or for proposed powerplants or for \ncross-state air pollution or for boilers or for ozone or for \nincinerators or for regional haze or for fuel economy or for the waters \nof the United States or for renewable fuels or for cement kilns or for \ncoal ash or for effluent limitations or for any other number of \nregulatory actions that the agency has taken or is expected to take.\n  This rule--and there have been so many of them, it almost feels like \nthis should be EPA's rule of the week or rule of the month--is a \nunilateral effort to bypass Congress and to force into place policies \nthat we in Congress have not approved. The goal is to push our electric \nsupply away from coal and, I think, ultimately, away from natural gas \nas soon as possible.\n  As the ranking member on the energy committee, I can attest that \nenergy is always the flip side of the environmental debate. If we have \na discussion about energy, we always have a discussion about the \nenvironment.\n  I believe we should advance policies that make our energy abundant, \naffordable, clean, diverse, and secure. To that end, our environmental \ngoals must be balanced with our energy needs.\n  Because of this, I have for years expressed concern that EPA's \nrelentless onslaught will harm the affordability and the reliability of \nour electric supply. In fact, I even released a white paper on this \nmatter earlier this year. We still do not have an accurate accounting \nof the cumulative costs associated with all of these EPA rules that I \njust gave in the laundry list, but we do know not to trust their math \nbecause EPA has dramatically underestimated the powerplant retirements \nin very recent past.\n\n  I will give you some examples. For the mercury and air toxic rules, \nEPA estimated only 4.7 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity retirements by \nthe year 2015. But then we see the contrast. The labor unions forecast \nthat MATS alone would result in 55 gigawatts of coal plant retirements \nand the loss of some 250,000 jobs. Government experts have determined \nthat approximately 10 to 20 percent of existing coal capacity could be \nretired by the middle of the next decade. This is a calculation that \nreally dwarfs EPA's number and one that doesn't include the potential \nimpact of the latest proposal.\n  Now, I know that the EPA has an important job to do, and I appreciate \nthat, but I also recognize that it does not and cannot regulate in a \nvacuum. Baseload coal and the ancillary services that it provides \naccount for almost 40 percent of our power. In many instances the EPA's \nregulations will render generating units uneconomic, with compliance \nrequiring retrofitting, the use of best available technology, and \ndowntime for installation. So I am concerned--greatly concerned--that \nthe EPA's rules, particularly when you combine them with one another, \nwill result in a grid that is less stable and less reliable. The \ncumulative effect of federal regulations on baseload capacity \nresources, whether they are coal or nuclear, which produce electricity \non demand has to be looked at. We have to examine and appreciate the \ncumulative effect of this loss of production and not discount or ignore \nit.\n  Many this past winter got a taste of what life in Alaska is like in \nthe wintertime when we experienced the polar vortex here in the lower \n48. The polar vortex caused 50,000 megawatts of powerplant outages. For \none key system 89 percent of the coal capacity that is scheduled for \nretirement next year because of an EPA rule was called upon to meet the \nrising demand.\n  So again, just think about that.\n  We had a tough winter. We had coal-fueled facilities that were able \nto step up and provide for that increased demand--89 percent of that \ncapacity was utilized during this polar vortex. That is fine. But what \nhappens when those facilities are now offline, when they are in \nretirement, when you do not have that backup?\n  The question we really need to be asking is, What happens when that \ncapacity is gone? Hoping for a mild winter isn't a viable strategy. You \ncannot have a hope-and-prayer energy policy, hoping that the weather is \nnot going to be so bad. Our Nation relies on installed dispatchable \npower generation during extreme weather, which is why we need to ensure \ngrid reliability through a diversity of baseload capacity.\n  Today it is unclear how many plants will retrofit to comply with \nvarious EPA regulations--including this most recent one--as opposed to \nmaking a decision to just shut down. It is uncertain if there will be \nenough time--to say nothing of sufficient capital available for \ninvestment--to build these new facilities or other forms of generation \nneeded to ensure the continued reliability of the grid.\n  I have been talking about grid reliability for a long while now, and \nI think it speaks to our system that while we may have been pushed to \nthe edge of getting nervous, we have been able to meet that reliability \nrequirement Americans have just come to expect. They want to know that \nwhen they want to have the lights on or keep cool or keep warm, there \nis that availability. Reliability is key here. I am even more troubled \nthat the EPA, which has conceded that a single rule may result in what \nthey have called a ``localized effect,'' has not sought from our grid \nregulators, FERC and NERC, an analysis of the cumulative impact its \nrules may have. Understanding the impacts of these rules by checking in \nwith our grid regulators, FERC and NERC, as part of a formal process is \nan important part of what needs to go on. Yet we are not seeing that \nfollow-through. Instead, EPA appears to be morphing into an industrial \nplanning agency for the energy sector. That is not what they are \ndesigned to do. This latest rulemaking makes it even more important for \nFERC and the Department of Energy to step up, to really go toe-to-toe \nhere with EPA to protect the reliability and the affordability of our \npower supply.\n  The current chairwoman of FERC, while she has not called for a formal \nofficial role for the commission--as many of us would like--is \ncertainly up to the task in my view. But with that situation at play \nright now within the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, it appears \nthat the White House doesn't want to keep the acting chair in charge. \nIts nominee to serve as chairman is both short on energy experience and \nlargely unaware of the electricity reliability implications of EPA's \nrules.\n  In response to a hearing question about grid reliability from Senator \nManchin, the nominee conceded that he ``has not been following the \ndecisional process at EPA closely enough to know.''\n  I find that response not only disturbing, but I think it raises the \nquestion of whether anyone within the administration is actually \nfollowing the EPA process closely enough to know what will happen to \nour electric grid. I can tell you that I don't think the EPA knows the \nimpact for my State of Alaska. The Agency readily admits that its \nproposal ``fails to account for the expected costs and benefits for \nareas outside of the contiguous United States.''\n  Alaska is one-fifth the size of the country, and we are part of the \ncountry. But the EPA, in advancing these proposed regulations, admits \nthat ``we don't know.'' We don't know the cost-benefit for Alaska. We \ndon't know the cost-benefit for Hawaii. That does not mean that my \nState is exempt from this rule as some reports have led Alaskans to \nbelieve. Instead, without the\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n\nbenefit of any analysis, EPA has directed Alaska to reduce our \nemissions by 26 percent and this while EPA ignores--totally ignores--\nthe likely inflationary costs and increases inherent in requiring the \nrevamping of so much power production likely within a single decade.\n  The EPA has recommended that States work together, work together to \nfigure out how we are going to make these cuts. But again, when you are \nnot part of the contiguous United States, it is a little more difficult \nfor us in Alaska and our neighbors to the south in Hawaii if we are not \npart of an interstate electricity grid. Alaska is really in many ways \non its own. Because of our constant need for Federal approvals or at \nbest Federal cooperation that is too often slow to come, we are not \neven able to develop our clean hydropower.\n\n  Some may ask: Well, I understand that you have about 25 percent of \nyour power in the State of Alaska coming from hydro. That is correct. \nBut because of other Federal policies--whether it is the roadless rule \nor other policies--we are truly hamstrung in our ability to build out \nmore hydro. Based on more than 50 years of delay or broken Federal \npromises, there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop fully \nour abundant natural gas or even our vast renewable resource potential.\n  We have challenges and we acknowledge them. We are working on those \nchallenges. We are working diligently because there is nobody who wants \nto get reliable, affordable, clean diverse energy supplies to our State \nmore honestly and earnestly than myself. But it is challenging. So as \nwe work towards that transition, we need that flexibility. We need that \ntime.\n  Now the EPA has suggested a series of strategies for reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. But of the five powerplants in Alaska that \nare directly impacted by this proposed rule, four are natural-gas-fired \nplants, and they are located near each other and Anchorage. So in the \nwhole State of Alaska there are only five plants that are impacted by \nthis regulation. Everything else is small enough or doesn't sell its \npower. So of the five, four of them are already natural gas. The fifth \nalready has clean coal technology. The proposed strategies of switching \nto natural gas, dispatch changes or retiring plants are really just \nunworkable given the configuration we have in my State. Given that we \nlive in this polar vortex every winter--everywhere is polar vortex in \nAlaska--many of our houses are well insulated to protect from the cold. \nSo efficiency programs will provide comparatively small gains.\n  Having said that, I know that we can and must do more when it comes \nto efficiencies, and I will continue to push on that because that is an \narea where I think we can make a difference. But trying to get to this \n26-percent reduction is a challenge. I am still canvassing my State, \nbut it will be difficult for Alaska to reach our 26-percent emissions \nreduction without serious economic impact.\n  Electricity is already more expensive in Alaska than in most of the \nrest of the Nation. We have to reduce these prices, not engage in \npolicies that will raise those prices even higher. In the lower 48 \nStates, on average, an American family spends a little over 4 percent \nof their household budget towards their energy--keeping the lights on \nand keeping the house warm or cool--depending on the season. In many \nparts of my State of Alaska we have households that pay between 40 and \n50 percent of their household budget to stay warm and to keep the \nlights on. So I am looking at this very, very critically. While I want \nto ensure that our air is clean, that we are working to reduce health \nrisks, we don't have any room in Alaska to increase our energy costs. \nWe have to be working aggressively with one another to reduce those \ncosts.\n  So I look at the proposal that has come out from the EPA this week, \nand I am very concerned about how a State such as mine will achieve the \nlevel that the EPA has imposed on it without extraordinary increases to \ncost.\n  Some have labeled this recent EPA proposed regulation ObamaCare 2.0, \nand in many ways it is. The administration insists that there will be \nno cost increases associated with this rule. All we are missing here is \nan awful Web site and a pledge that if you like your current \nelectricity bill, you can keep it. The President promises the \nelectricity bills will shrink, but I am not buying that. The Wall \nStreet Journal has rightly labeled this a huge tax on the poor and the \nmiddle class, and no one understands what will happen if States perhaps \nrefuse to move forward with their own plans. Again, you have to ask the \nquestion: Does anybody really think that the EPA has the ability to \nimpose its Federal will while simultaneously keeping the lights on and \nkeeping power affordable to all 50 States?\n  Despite negative economic growth last quarter and despite far better \napproaches pending in Congress to promote energy efficiency and energy \ninnovation, such as an energy efficiency bill that my colleague from \nOhio has been working doggedly to try to advance--a measure that I \nthink is smart and sound and built on good policy--to not only help \nStates like mine but all across the country, we do have some good \nproposals out there. We have initiatives we can move forward. But \ninstead the President has decided to push ahead and to propose sweeping \nnew regulations on our still weak economy.\n  We must keep costs and reliability in mind as regulatory mandates \npush more and more baseload coal plants offline. FERC must be the \nunambiguous champion of reliability with a formal and a documented role \nwith respect to EPA's rulemaking process. Powerful regulatory laws must \nbe judicially administered, and only Congress--not the EPA--should \ndecide such consequential changes for our energy supply, our economy, \nand our people. I think anything less is unacceptable and could very \nwell yield significant negative consequences for a wide variety of \nAmerican families and our businesses.\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for her attention and the opportunity \nto discuss a very important issue for our entire country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Alaska, who \nis the ranking member, and thank her for her hard work. She mentioned \nthe energy efficiency bill. I know she strongly supports that bill, and \nI hope it will come back to the floor. It is a more logical way to get \nat some of these issues.\n  I come to the floor to follow up on the conversation I had earlier \nwith Senator Landrieu. She and I announced earlier this afternoon that \nwe were going to offer unanimous consent in the Senate on bipartisan \nand noncontroversial legislation. I had hoped Senator Landrieu would \ncome back to the floor, but apparently she can't, so I will offer this \non behalf of both of us.\n\n\n   Directing the Secretary of the Interior to Install a World War II \n                            Memorial Plaque\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, as if in \nlegislative session, that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 339, S. 1044.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1044) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to \n     install in the area of the World War II Memorial in the \n     District of Columbia a suitable plaque or an inscription with \n     the words that President Franklin D. Roosevelt prayed with \n     the United States on D-day, June 6, 1944.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1044) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1044\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``World War II Memorial Prayer \n     Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PLACEMENT OF PLAQUE OR INSCRIPTION AT WORLD WAR II \n                   MEMORIAL.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior--\n       (1) shall install in the area of the World War II Memorial \n     in the District of Columbia a suitable plaque or an \n     inscription with the words that President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\n     prayed with the United States on June 6, 1944, the morning of \n     D-Day;\n       (2) shall design, procure, prepare, and install the plaque \n     or inscription referred to in paragraph (1); and\n       (3) may not use Federal funds to prepare or install the \n     plaque or inscription referred to in paragraph (1), but may \n     accept and expend private contributions for this purpose.\n\n     SEC. 3. COMMEMORATIVE WORKS ACT.\n\n       Chapter 89 of title 40, United States Code (commonly known \n     as the ``Commemorative Works Act''), shall apply to the \n     design and placement of the plaque within the area of the \n     World War II Memorial.\n\n\n                                 D-day\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, the clerk just read part of the \ndescription of this legislation, and I thank this body on both sides of \nthe aisle for working with us.\n  Tomorrow we mark a momentous occasion. It is the 70th anniversary of \nD-day. It is a day, of course, that will go down in history as one of \nthe greatest naval invasions in the history of our country but also a \nday when we lost many brave American soldiers and one where the country \ncame together to pray for them and give them the strength they would \nneed not just on that D-day but to go through Europe to ultimately \nvanquish the Nazis and liberate that continent.\n  On that day, 70 years ago tomorrow, Franklin D. Roosevelt decided not \nto give a speech at the White House but instead to give a prayer for \nthe troops and for the Nation. This body has just passed legislation to \nmake that prayer a part of the World War II Memorial. That prayer will \nhelp to give it some additional context and interpretation at a \ncritical time. The prayer helps us look at our history and shows how \nour country came together at a critical time. It is a very powerful \nprayer. My dad was a World War II veteran, and I always found it to be \none of the most moving prayers in our Nation's history.\n  I will mention a couple of aspects of this prayer. President \nRoosevelt explained--I thought in very powerful words--why America \nfought. When talking about the troops, he said:\n\n       They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without \n     rest--until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by \n     noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the \n     violences of war.\n       For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They \n     fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end \n     conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice \n     arise, and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They \n     yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the \n     haven of home.\n\n  That is why we fight.\n  Again, I think that prayer is an important part of our history but \nalso an important message for us even today.\n  The prayer also includes a number of other very powerful messages \nthat brought the Nation together in a single day for prayer and \nthanksgiving. It asks for God's help in a number of ways, and one that \nI think is particularly poignant is where it asks God to give us the \nability to deepen our faith.\n  It says:\n\n       And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee, faith in \n     our sons; faith in each other . . .\n\n  Again, I appreciate the work of Senator Landrieu and, before her, \nSenator Lieberman, who was the original cosponsor with me on this \nlegislation.\n  I thank my friends from Ohio, the Christian Alliance, and others who \nhave brought this to my attention over the years.\n  I thank my colleagues in the House, who passed this legislation last \nyear with a resounding vote. I hope they will take up this legislation \nand pass it again in the House this year so we can indeed move to have \nthis inscription placed in the World War II Memorial in order to remind \nus of a day in our Nation's history where our country did come together \nand where we, as Americans--not as conquerors but as liberators--\nprovided for the liberation of a continent and established this \nprecedent for our country that with God so much is possible.\n  I yield back my time and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Veterans Care\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, there is good news for America's veterans \nthis afternoon. Senator McCain and Senator Sanders, the chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, have apparently come to a tentative \nagreement on what we should do to deal with some of the serious \nproblems at the Veterans' Administration.\n  We know a couple of things. First of all, we know that health care in \nthe veterans hospitals, in the VA system, in the community-based \nclinics in places such as Akron and Canton and Youngstown and \nSpringfield and Mansfield and the care in the big hospitals, such as \nWade Park and Dayton, is superb and there is overwhelming support among \nveterans for the care they have earned and deserve and are getting. The \nproblem is getting access to that care in a number of cases. Too many \nveterans have waited too long, been forced to wait too long to get the \nmedical care and the medical treatment they need.\n\n  That is a product, frankly, of a historically underfunded VA. We know \na decade ago, when the President a decade ago--more than a decade ago--\nand the Senate and the House took the country to war the Veterans' \nAdministration funding was put pretty flat. There was no real \npreparation by the Congress, by the President--then President Bush--and \nby the VA to scale up veterans' capacity, the VA capacity, veterans' \nhealth care--not enough nurses, not enough doctors, not enough health \ncare personnel, not enough capacity at the VA health care system to \ntake care of the surging numbers of soldiers coming home, sailors \ncoming home, marines coming home, air men and women coming home.\n  We also know at the same time what happened with Agent Orange, and \nthe Agent Orange presumptive eligibility. As Vietnam veterans were \nbeginning to get sicker, were beginning to show more and more symptoms, \nthe government made the right decision, Congress made the right \ndecision, if a soldier had boots on the ground, they were eligible. If \na soldier had an illness defined by the law that was connected to Agent \nOrange, then they were presumed to be eligible. They didn't have to go \nback and prove they were actually exposed at a certain place at a \ncertain time in Vietnam. All of those were good things, as our country, \nour government, our VA, embraced war, men and women, to get the VA care \nthey earned.\n  The bad news was Congress and the President didn't prepare for it a \ndecade ago as this surge of new people, the veterans coming home, \nveterans living here for a number of years after doing their service, \nthat they could get the health care they needed. That is the reason we \nhave had these long delays.\n  There are certainly issues of leadership within the VA. There are \nissues of administrators not doing their jobs. They should be held \naccountable. They should pay a price for that--sometimes termination, \ncertainly disciplinary action if shown to have failed to live up to \ntheir responsibilities ethically and efficiently and correctly and \nresponsibly.\n  It is clear this new agreement will take us forward. It will mean a \ncouple of things. One, it means those administrators, those VA \nofficials who didn't do their jobs, will be held accountable. Secondly, \nand most importantly, it will mean veterans who have had long delays or \nwho live in rural areas and simply can't get the coverage, can't get to \nthe VA clinic, the community-based outpatient clinic or the VA \nhospital, the VA center, if they can't get that health care treatment \ntoday, or soon, they can go to a private hospital, they can go to a \ncommunity-based health clinic and get the coverage, get the care they \nneed at no cost to the veteran.\n  The third thing is, to make up for the neglect of a decade ago that \nwe have tried to remedy by almost doubling the VA budget over the last \n5 years to take care of all these people who are now in the system who \nhave suffered much more serious illness and disability than the \nveterans of a generation ago who might have died on the battlefield \nfrom these same injuries, that we scale up the training of doctors and \nnurses in these VA facilities.\n  There has been an agreement reached among a group of us on the \nveterans committee and both parties that we will fund a number of new \nfacilities around the country as we train more\n\n[[Page S3463]]\n\ndoctors and nurses and other health care personnel--physical \ntherapists, occupational therapists, and others.\n  At a time of not particularly good news for veterans over the last \nfew weeks and really over the last few months, this is good news. This \nwill make for a better VA. We know the VA is a huge health care system, \nwith 85 million veteran visits, patient visits to the VA over the last \nyear and 8 million different veterans have used the VA over the last 12 \nmonths. We have to make sure we do our jobs as Senators and Members of \nCongress and in the White House to take care of our veterans. For those \nwho served us, it is time we served our veterans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           D-day Anniversary\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 70th anniversary \nof the heroic landings of D-day.\n  The incredible bravery exhibited on June 6 of 1944, in the first \nphase of Operation Overlord to liberate Western Europe from the \nclutches of Nazi Germany, is one of the defining moments of modern \nhistory.\n  The images of American GIs landing at Omaha Beach, Utah Beach, and \nPointe du Hoc have come to represent not only the great sacrifices made \nduring World War II, but the enduring cause of freedom for which the \nUnited States still stands.\n  I have had the humbling experience of visiting the American cemetery \nat Normandy that honors those who fell during the invasion. As I walked \nthe peaceful fields of brilliant white headstones in perfect formation, \nit was hard to imagine the terrifying landscape that greeted those \nAmerican and allied soldiers, many of them not yet 20 years old, when \nthey lowered the ramps of their landing craft in the shallows off of \nNormandy. Yet they understood the importance of their mission, and they \nheld fast against one of the greatest evils the world has ever faced, \nand they prevailed.\n  The men and women who answered the call to serve in World War II and \nthose who supported them on the home front are often revered as the \n``greatest generation,'' and deservedly so. They gave up their lives \nand their livelihoods and endured separation from their loved ones and \nfought in unspeakable conditions.\n  From the beaches of Normandy to the islands of the Pacific, where my \nfather served as a Navy pilot, the United States and allied forces \nfought for freedom and for the dignity of mankind, and we owe them a \ntremendous debt of gratitude.\n  As we honor the memory of those who served before us, we honor their \nlegacy by upholding the values for which they fought.\n  We are here today because of the immense burdens our men and women in \nuniform have carried on our behalf. May we never forget their \nsacrifices or the solemn responsibility we have to all of those who \nhave answered the call to serve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Tribute to Navajo Code Talker Chester Nez\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, my State of New Mexico has a \ngreat tradition of military service. When the Nation has called, New \nMexico has always answered. Today I wanted to say a few words to \nremember Chester Nez, the last of the original 29 Navajo code talkers \nof World War II.\n  Mr. Nez passed away Wednesday morning in Albuquerque, NM. We are \nforever indebted to him and his fellow warriors. They turned the Navajo \nlanguage into an unbelievable code, using the language they were \nforbidden to speak in school, as a weapon to defend our freedoms in \nwar, freedoms they themselves did not always enjoy. This is a great \nstory of courage, of love of country, of tremendous sacrifice. In \nbattle after battle in ferocious combat, the Navajo code saved \ncountless lives and helped secure the allied victory. In 2001, the \noriginal code talkers received the Congressional Gold Medal, the \nhighest honor the Congress can give.\n  Our former colleague, Senator Jeff Bingaman, fought hard for this. I \nwas pleased to push for it in the House. It was richly deserved and \nlong overdue. Mr. Nez was there for the ceremony, and the Presiding \nOfficer, who was in the House with me, may remember we had that \nceremony in the Capitol Rotunda. It was a great and uplifting day to \nfinally see the Navajo code talkers receive their medals.\n  I said then what I continue to feel now: Their service can never be \nforgotten and can never be diminished. Chester Nez was modest in his \nown life but proud of the code talkers and proud of the Navajo \ntraditions. In his later years, he visited schools and colleges all \nacross the Nation to tell the story of those Navajo code talkers.\n  In his memoir, written with Judith Avila, he said:\n\n       I recommended myself that my Navajo people had always been \n     warriors, protectors. In that there was honor. I would \n     concentrate on being a warrior, on protecting my homeland.\n\n  As we mark Chester's passing, we honor his memory with a renewed \ndedication to preserve our Native languages, to keep alive the story of \nour code talkers, the heroic story of the Navajo, and also of other \nNative American tribes, their codes and their commitment forever \nunbroken.\n  Today we say goodbye to this great hero, this humble man who served \nour country with such devotion. We say goodbye with sadness but also \nwith appreciation for a debt that can never be fully repaid, for \ncourage that will forever inspire, and for a life that truly made a \ndifference.\n  Chester, you made a real difference in our lives. I would just say to \nChester's family, we send them our heartfelt condolences.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Farewell to Pages\n\n  Mr. REID. As we leave for the week, I wanted to say something on the \nrecord regarding the pages. They are going to graduate tomorrow morning \nat 10 a.m. I look forward to these graduations every year. These are \nfine young men and women who come here and spend a semester of school \nwith us.\n  This is a tradition we have been doing for a long time. Two of my \ngrandchildren were pages, and even though my family has been involved \nin government through me for all these many years, they were never \nexposed to it like coming here and being pages. It really changed their \nlives, and I am sure some of these young men and women's lives have \nbeen changed also.\n  I can remember when I was about their age and I went to Boys State \nand the friends I made at that weeklong program--friends I still have. \nThese young men and women--friends they make here, they will have for \nthe rest of their lives.\n  These boys and girls are not the summer pages. We have two classes of \nsummer pages, and they are here for a month, and that is it. These \nyoung men and women are here for a semester, and the school is hard. It \nis not some kind of a lark back in Washington. They studied hard. We \nlook for good students, and that is what we get. They get up early in \nthe morning, they go to school, and they come here and try to learn \nmore about government. They really get to know us, personalities. Some \nof us are nicer to them than others. They recognize that.\n  I congratulate these pages because they are an integral part of what \ngoes on around here. They really do things that are hard. We don't ask \nthem to write dissertations, at least here in the Senate; for the \nschool, they do that. But they run bills around the Capitol Complex, \nand they help us on some of the more mundane things we take for \ngranted.\n  I really look forward to meeting them. I try to meet all the pages \nevery year. Sometimes I don't get to meet all of the Republican pages, \nbut I try. I want them to know that even though they won't hear from \nevery one of us,\n\n[[Page S3464]]\n\nwe all very much appreciate what they do.\n  Today is their last day here, as I mentioned. I thank them for their \nservice, and I hope their slight glance into the government will be \nsomething that will cause them to be involved in government.\n  As for young men and women, the Presiding Officer in this body has \nhad a great political career. She has held a number of statewide \noffices in the State of North Dakota. In all of what we do in life, \nthere are disappointments that come. She would have been the Governor \nof the State of North Dakota, but she was stricken with breast cancer, \nwhich, I understand, messed up her campaign. But she came back and as a \nreal underdog decided to run for the Senate, and she won. She has made \na tremendous difference in this body. I hope each of you can look \naround here and see people, such as the Presiding Officer, whom you \nwould like to be like someday.\n  When I first came to this body--I say to these young women \nespecially--Barbara Mikulski was a Senator from Maryland. I came with \nher to the Senate, and she was the woman. That was it. And now, I \ncouldn't help but smile earlier this week because a number of women--\nseven or eight women--had congregated here, and one of the Senators \nsaid to me--a female Senator said: Look, many of us wore turquoise \ntoday. And it was so bright and the clothes looked so vibrant and added \nso much to this body.\n  So it used to be boys, that the Senators we had here, with rare \nexception, were men, but that is not the way it is anymore. And I can \nspeak from experience--the Senate is a much better place because of the \ninput of women. Men and women are different. They have different views \nand outlooks on life. As a result of that, this is a much better place.\n  I can remember a number of years ago when I looked here on the \nfloor--I was whip at that time, taking care of the floor--it was \nstunning to me, on the military construction bill, appropriations bill, \ntwo women were running it. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican from \nTexas, was the ranking member, and Dianne Feinstein from California was \nthe chair of that committee, determining billions of dollars for \nconstruction of military facilities around the world. So things have \nchanged a great deal. You have been part of watching this great change \ntake place, young men and women. Thank you for your service here, and I \nhope someday some of you will be serving in this august body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3464-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I wish to commemorate the 70th \nanniversary of the Normandy invasion by Allied Forces. On June 6, 1944, \na date known ever since as D-day, a mighty armada crossed a narrow \nstrip of sea from England to Normandy, France and broke the Nazi grip \non Western Europe. The day before--June 5, 1944--a fleet of 3,000 \nlanding craft, 500 naval vessels, and 2,500 miscellaneous ships left \nEnglish ports bound for Normandy, France. The amphibious landing was \nthe largest effort ever in the history of mankind with the simultaneous \nlandings of U.S., British, and Canadian forces on five separate \nbeachheads in\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\nNormandy. An additional 13,000 aircraft supported Allied Forces on D-\nday.\n  General Dwight D. Eisenhower--the Supreme Allied Commander in \nEurope--addressed the troops immediately prior to the invasion, saying:\n\n       Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary \n     Force! You are about to embark upon a great crusade, toward \n     which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the \n     world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty loving \n     people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave \n     Allies and brothers in arms on other fronts, you will bring \n     about the destruction of the German war machine, the \n     elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of \n     Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.\n\n  And by the end of August 1944, all of northern France was liberated \nand the invading forces were reorganized for the drive into Germany \nwhere they would eventually meet up with Soviet forces advancing from \nthe east to bring an end to the Third Reich and its tyranny of terror.\n  The aftermath of World War II saw much of Europe devastated in a way \nthat is now difficult to imagine. Over 36 million Europeans died in the \nconflict; 19 million of them were civilians. Millions more were left \nhomeless, the European economy had collapsed, and much of the European \nindustrial infrastructure was destroyed.\n  But from these ashes of war came the beginning of a new era for \ninternational cooperation and diplomacy. In the wake of World War II, \nthe United Nations agreed to outlaw wars of aggression in an attempt to \nprevent a third world war. With the creation of the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization, NATO, in 1949 and the institutionalization of the \nHelsinki Accords 25 years later, we committed ourselves to the work \nthat began with the assault on those beachheads--Utah, Omaha, Juno, \nSword, and Gold Beach--in June 1944.\n  The guiding principles of the Helsinki Final Act are the foundations \nof lasting peace. These principles are worth enumerating: sovereign \nequality, respect for the rights inherent in sovereignty, refraining \nfrom threat or use of force, inviolability of frontiers, territorial \nintegrity of States, peaceful settlement of disputes, non-intervention \nin internal affairs, respect for human rights, self determination of \npeoples, co-operation among States, and fulfillment in good faith of \nobligations under international law. Additionally, the Helsinki Final \nAct reaffirmed mankind's fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of \nthought, conscience, and religion or belief.\n  Today, we remember the tremendous efforts of Allied Forces as they \nsignaled to the world that unprovoked aggression and genocide have no \nplace in our international order and will be met with our greatest \nresolve. I am reminded of the Maryland National Guard units who \nparticipated in the D-day landings. These brave Marylanders served with \ngreat distinction in the 29th Infantry Division, fighting their way \nacross Western Europe and liberating France and Holland. The 29th \nDivision suffered one of the highest casualty rates of any American \ndivision during World War II. We must honor those heroes by \nsafeguarding all that they fought and sacrificed for.\n  Today, there are one million surviving World War II veterans in the \nU.S., and 17,346 of them are Marylanders. These same heroes who landed \non those beaches in Normandy and parachuted behind enemy lines 70 years \nago are joined by veterans who have served in conflicts spanning from \nthe Korean war to the war in Afghanistan. Today, I call on each of my \ncolleagues to commit themselves to the work of meeting our obligations \nto all of these veterans. The best way to honor their sacrifices is to \nensure that we are unwavering in our support for them and their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3466-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NEVADA'S FRENCH LEGION OF HONOR RECIPIENTS\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, today I wish to congratulate two of \nNevada's own, MSG Davis B. Leonard and Private Gaetano R. Benza, for \nbeing awarded the National Order of the French Legion of Honor in the \nrank of chevalier. Their service to our country and dedication to \nensuring freedom beyond America's borders earn them a unique place \namong the outstanding men and women who have valiantly defended our \nNation.\n  As we approach the anniversary of D-day, nearly 70 years after World \nWar II, these heroes are being honored with the Legion of Honor, \nFrance's highest distinction. Veterans who risked their lives during \nWorld War II and fought on French territory have this award bestowed \nupon them as a token of gratitude from France for defending liberty on \ntheir soil. The sacrifices these brave soldiers made set America and \nthe world on a path to peace, freedom, and liberty that we as Americans \nenjoy today. Master Sergeant Leonard and Private Benza are joining the \nranks of other notable Americans, such as GEN Dwight D. Eisenhower and \nDouglas MacArthur and even, as an institution, the U.S. Military \nAcademy at West Point, by receiving this honorable recognition.\n  A highly decorated veteran from Henderson, NV, MSG Davis Leonard \nserved in the U.S. Army Air Force Reserve as part of the 8th Air Force. \nHe was transferred to England, where he flew his first of 64 combat \nmissions as a bombardier and navigator. Master Sergeant Leonard was \nactive in the Battle of Northern France, Ardennes, Rhineland, and \nCentral Europe. For his service, he earned several medals, including \nthe Distinguished Flying Cross with two bronze and one silver oak leaf \nmedal. Upon his return home, he worked to rebuild our country working \nfor Pacific Telephone Company for 30 years. Now retired at the age of \n91, Master Sergeant Leonard resides in Henderson with his wife.\n  Private Gaetano Benza from Las Vegas, NV, spent 4 months transporting \nsupplies and ammunition to the men on Omaha Beach as a longshoreman for \nthe Port Battalion 297th Port Company. During the invasion of Normandy, \nPrivate Benza worked tirelessly, while under heavy enemy fire, to \nensure that the soldiers that landed were equipped for battle. After \nspending 4 months at Omaha Beach, he moved to La Havre, France, where \nhe would remain until the end of the war. Awarded for his service to \nour country, Private Benza received the World War II Victory medal. \nOnce he returned home, he continued his education and became a barber \nat Nellis Air Force Base. While retired from the Armed Forces, 89-year-\nold Private Benza refuses to retire from his active lifestyle and is \nstill a barber in the Las Vegas area.\n  Their commitment to this country, as well as their dedication to \ntheir families and communities, exemplified why the legacy of all World \nWar II veterans must be preserved for generations to come. These \nveterans truly are the ``greatest generation''--selflessly serving not \nfor recognition but because it was the right thing to do. As a member \nof the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize that Congress \nhas a responsibility not only to honor these brave individuals but to \nensure they are cared for when they return home. I remain committed to \nupholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada \nand throughout the Nation.\n  Please join me in congratulating these men for their acts of heroism \nand valor that helped to defend France from the greatest enemy they or \nwe have ever faced. May we never forget the brave actions by these \nheroes that allowed the Allied troops to begin a march across Europe \nand defeat tyranny. Today, I join the Clark County community and \ncitizens of the Silver State to congratulate these courageous men and \nhonorable Nevadans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3466-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3466-S3467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GORDON STEWART\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I wish to honor Gordon Stewart, \nwho is retiring from serving as the air traffic manager at Boise \nAirport.\n  Gordon channeled his early exposure to aviation, through family \nmembers who owned airplanes, into a distinguished career. Gordon got \nhis start in aviation through his military service. He served for 3 \nyears in the U.S. Army, through which he received his air traffic \ncontrol training. He was a distinguished graduate at Fort Rucker, AL, \nin both basic and advanced individual training. He then went on to work \nat various helicopter training airports,\n\n[[Page S3467]]\n\nserve in Vietnam, and receive valuable experience working with a wide \nvariety of aircraft at the joint use airfield at Fort Huachuca, AZ.\n  He utilized the experience and training obtained through his military \nservice in his numerous Federal Aviation Administration assignments \nthat built up his deep knowledge of air traffic control. After \nreturning to his family farm in Montana and serving as acting manager \nat the Flight Service Station in Cut Bank, MT, he spent 3 years at \nMissoula International Airport, where he learned about nonradar \napproach. He went on to work for more than a year at Billings Logan \nInternational Airport and then at the Salt Lake City Terminal Radar \nApproach Control, TRACON, before returning to the Missoula \nInternational Airport, where he served as acting air traffic manager \nbefore obtaining a position at Boise Airport.\n  Gordon worked as a supervisor for 12 years at Boise Airport before \nbecoming the air traffic manager for the past nearly 12 years. His \nleadership during his time there has been instrumental in making the \nairport successful. The numerous recognitions he received for his \noutstanding work include multiple facility of the year awards and a \nFire Fighting Award for support of fire fighting in the Northwest \nMountain Region.\n  Gordon's effort to remain true to his core values and manage the same \nway he has parented--fair but firm--has been exemplary. Integrity has \nbeen a central element of Gordon's work. He can always be counted on to \ndo what is right. His principled approach to working through \nconsiderable challenges has been indispensible. This especially \nincludes his work on the development of the new Boise Air Traffic \nControl Tower and the effort to locate the TRACON.\n  Thank you, Gordon, for your outstanding and dedicated service. As you \nretire, you deserve to reflect on your extraordinary career with pride \nin a job well done. I hope that retirement affords you more time with \nyour friends and family, including your six children. I congratulate \nyou on your retirement and wish you all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3467-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3467-S3468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MINNESOTA POETRY CONTEST WINNERS\n\n Mr. FRANKEN.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CERRO GORDO COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Cerro Gordo County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Cerro Gordo County worth over $13 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $182 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together is working \nto help Northern Iowa Community College obtain over $2 million in \nFederal funds to support their programs, helping the city to improve \nthe drinking water supply, and working to improve area lakes and \nwaterways.\n  Among the highlights: investing in Iowa's economic development \nthrough targeted community projects: In northern Iowa, we have worked \ntogether to grow the economy by making targeted investments in \nimportant economic development projects including improved roads and \nbridges, modernized sewer and water systems, and better housing options \nfor residents of Cerro Gordo County. In many cases, I have secured \nFederal funding that has leveraged local investments and served as a \ncatalyst for a whole ripple effect of positive, creative changes. For \nexample, working with mayors, city council members, and local economic \ndevelopment officials in Cerro Gordo County, I have fought for more \nthan $8.4 million for water treatment facilities which have allowed \nmajor food processing entities to operate in the region, knowing that \nthe water they need to use is clean and healthy, helping to create jobs \nand expand economic opportunities. I have also secured over $310,000 to \nclean up area lakes and waterways, over $393,000 to rehabilitate the \nCity National Bank Building, and over $444,000 for repairs to the \nDelaware Street bridge.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall\n\n[[Page S3469]]\n\nacross America--is preserving the character and vitality of our small \ntowns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics. It is \nalso about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa helps \npreserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns such as \nMason City to use that money to leverage other investments to jumpstart \nchange and renewal. I am so pleased that Cerro Gordo County has earned \n$150,000 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings. They build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Cerro Gordo County has received $2.2 million in Harkin grants.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nCerro Gordo County has received over $9 million to remediate and \nprevent widespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Cerro Gordo County has received more than $8.4 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Cerro Gordo \nCounty's fire departments have received over $1.19 million for \nfirefighter safety and operations equipment and more than $879,000 in \nByrne Justice Assistance Grants.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Cerro Gordo \nCounty has recognized this important issue by securing more than \n$460,000 for community wellness activities.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Cerro Gordo County, during my time in Congress. In \nevery case, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Cerro Gordo \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3469-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3469-S3470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MUSCATINE COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Muscatine County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Muscatine County worth over $4.8 \nmillion and successfully acquire financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $10.2 \nmillion to the local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together is the \ncommunity's success in obtaining over $2.5 million for airport \nimprovements since 2001. As a strong supporter of small community \nairports, I have long fought for funding from programs that support \nservice to small communities and infrastructure support to keep these \nairports modern.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Southeast Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects, including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nMuscatine County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that \nhas leveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole \nripple effect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with \nmayors, city council members, and local economic development officials \nin Muscatine County, I have fought for $450,000 to improve the water \nsystem as well as more than $894,000 in funds for flood control, \nhelping to create jobs and expand economic opportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why for the \npast decade and a half I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\nHarkin grants for public schools construction and renovation. Across 15 \nyears, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million have helped school \ndistricts to fund a range of renovation and repair efforts--everything \nfrom updating fire safety systems to building new schools. In many \ncases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed incentive to \nleverage local public and private dollars, so it often has a tremendous \nmultiplier effect within a school district. Over the years, Muscatine \nCounty has received more than $3.5 million in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Muscatine County have received funds that I designated for \nIowa Star Schools for technology totaling $32,500.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years, including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Muscatine County has received more than $1.1 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Muscatine \nCounty's fire departments have received over $2.1 million for \nfirefighter safety and operations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nMuscatine County, both those with and without disabilities. And they \nmake us proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Muscatine County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Muscatine \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3470-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATING NICHOLAS CAROTHERS NIMMO\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, today I wish to congratulate \nNicholas ``Cole'' Carothers Nimmo, on obtaining one of the Boy Scouts \nof America's highest ranks of Eagle Scout.\n  Cole began his journey to the rank of Eagle Scout when he became a \nBoy Scout in 2008. Throughout his time in the Boy Scouts, he has \ntirelessly worked to achieve this next rank and honor. He completed his \nEagle project this past fall by leading a team of friends, family, and \nleaders in raising money for the materials and building a large storage \nshed for a local girls summer camp. Becoming an Eagle Scout enabled \nCole to develop an appreciation and love of the outdoors. Biking in the \nAcadia National Forest with Troop 388, canoeing on the Susquehanna \nRiver, and earning his favorite merit badge in camping were highlights \nof his tenure in the scouts thus far.\n  As one of tomorrow's leaders, Cole's dedication to his local \ncommunity enhances my faith in our great Nation's future. His training \nhas enabled him to develop skills and knowledge that will help him \nserve those around him his whole life. It is truly an honor for me to \nhelp in celebrating his advancement to Eagle Scout. Continuing at this \nlevel of accomplishment, with such a strong commitment to civic duty, \nCole will become a strong, contributing citizen of this great Nation. \nHe knows that achieving the rank of Eagle is just the beginning of a \nlife filled with leadership and service opportunities.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Cole on his loyal \nservice and contributions to his troop and community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3470-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3470-S3471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ALZHEIMER'S AND BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH\n\n Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I recognize this June as the \ninaugural Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month. Alzheimer's remains \none of our Nation's leading causes of death, and the number of \ndiagnoses is expected to triple by 2050--resulting in 16 million \nAmericans over the age of 65 living with Alzheimer's. Today, one in \nthree seniors will die with Alzheimer's disease. Currently, in my home \nof State of Florida, 480,000 residents over the age of 65 are living \nwith Alzheimer's, and the number is project to rise to 720,000 by 2050.\n  Given these staggering numbers, it is important we focus our \nresources to address this disease as outlined in the National \nAlzheimer's Plan, a roadmap for confronting Alzheimer's and dementia. \nThe National Alzheimer's Plan is released annually and outlines steps \nthe government should pursue in the fight against Alzheimer's. Last \nyear, the Special Committee on Aging, for which I am privileged to \nserve as chairman, held a hearing to assess the progress made in \ncombatting Alzheimer's disease and examined the first year of the \nNational Alzheimer's Plan as it continues its ongoing efforts to find \nan effective treatment by 2025.\n  This June, the first Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month, we must \ninitiate a global conversation about Alzheimer's disease and other \ndementias. Despite the prevalence of the disease, it is still widely \nmisunderstood. The Alzheimer's Association, the world's leading \nvoluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support, and \nresearch, is working to reduce stigma surrounding the illness, promote \neducation on the realities of the disease, and help promote research to \nend Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's Association is also \nencouraging Americans to ``Go Purple''--the color of the Alzheimer's \nmovement to fight Alzheimer's disease and promote public awareness of \nthis month's mission.\n  Recently, the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, AFA, released a cost \nanalysis report of the caregiver provisions in the 2012 National \nAlzheimer's Plan. The AFA works to ensure the best care and services \nare available to improve quality of life for individuals confronting \nAlzheimer's disease. I believe that the work of the AFA and other \nAlzheimer's advocacy organizations is increasingly important as we \ncontinually work to improve the care and well-being for those living \nwith Alzheimer's disease while also improving the quality of life for \ncaregivers and family members as they care for their loved ones.\n  AFA's recent report, ``Cost of Care: Quantifying Care-Centered \nProvisions of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease,'' \nevaluates the costs and benefits associated with implementation of \ncoordinated care delivery models, transitional care programs, and \nexpanded caregiver supports in the 2012 National Alzheimer's Plan. AFA \nfound that implementation of these caregiver provisions provide \nsignificant cost savings while promoting better health outcomes for \nthose living with Alzheimer's disease by reducing hospital readmissions \nand emergency room visits and delaying nursing home\n\n[[Page S3471]]\n\nplacement. The enactment of these provisions could result in Federal \nsavings that exceed $110 billion over 10 years.\n  I am well aware of the hardships for those living with this disease \nand their loved ones. I hear frequently from my constituents about the \nimportance of continuing to appropriate research dollars for \nAlzheimer's research and the necessity of making Alzheimer's a national \npriority. For example, Jeff from Palm Beach Gardens has been caring for \nhis mother for the last 5 years as her disease slowly progresses. And \nHeather of Winter Park, who wrote to me last October, shared the \nheartbreaking ``loss and grief that comes slowly and constantly'' with \nher mother's illness and the mourning for the person her mother was \nbefore her diagnosis. The work to improve care services for those \nliving with Alzheimer's as well as support services for their loved \nones is a growing necessity as our Nation's population ages and the \nnumber of individuals confronting the disease dramatically increases \nover the coming decades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3471-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3471-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3471-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:58 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4435.

A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide that \nagencies may not deduct labor organization dues from the pay of Federal \nemployees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, the Empower Employees Act prohibits Federal \nagencies from automatically deducting union dues from the pay of \nFederal employees. The current system provided for under title 5 of the \nUnited States Code permits taxpayer resources to be used for the \ncollection of these dues, which in turn are often used for political \npurposes. This legislation takes an important step in eliminating this \ntaxpayer subsidy to organized labor by shifting the administrative \nburden of funding public sector unions to labor organizations and away \nfrom the American taxpayer. Federal union employees enjoy benefits far \ngreater than those in the private sector and the unions' power to \nbargain is supported by the dues they automatically collect from \nemployees' paychecks. This bill in no way prohibits Federal workers\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\nfrom joining a union or paying dues, but rather increases freedom and \nchoice for American workers while decreasing the strong-hold that labor \nunions have on American politics and the Federal budget.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Markey, and \n        Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 2441. A bill to extend the same Federal benefits to law \nenforcement officers serving private institutions of higher education \nand rail carriers that apply to law enforcement officers serving units \nof State and local government; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Equity in Law \nEnforcement Act to extend Federal benefits to law enforcement officers \nwho serve private institutions of higher education and rail carriers. \nThis legislation would make these individuals eligible for the same \nbenefits provided to public law enforcement officers, including line-\nof-duty death benefits under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits \nProgram and bulletproof vest partnership grants through the Department \nof Justice.\n  The Public Safety Officers Benefits, PSOB, Act of 1976 was enacted to \naid in the recruitment and retention of law enforcement officers and \nfirefighters by providing a one-time financial benefit to the eligible \nsurvivors of public safety officers whose deaths are the direct result \nof traumatic injury sustained in the line of duty.\n  The same risks also apply to officers protecting our private \nuniversities and railways. However, the PSOB Act does not include these \nofficers, even though they enforce the law. These brave individuals, \nwho protect our college and university campuses and railways every day \nand receive similar training to their government counterparts, are thus \nexcluded from receiving the line-of-duty federal death benefits \navailable to law enforcement officers serving units of State and local \ngovernments.\n  Over the last 50 years, 35 college or university law enforcement \nofficers have lost their lives in the line of duty, according to the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The names of these \nofficers, including Patrol Officer Joseph Francis Doyle who was killed \nin the line of duty at Brown University in 1988, as well as the railway \nofficers who have been killed in the line of duty are inscribed on the \nmemorial.\n  A recent name on the memorial is Patrol Officer Sean Collier. We \nrecently marked the first anniversary of the bombing at the Boston \nMarathon, an act of terror that tragically killed three and injured \nover 260 others. Three days later, during the manhunt for the \nattackers, the perpetrators shot and killed Officer Collier of the MIT \nPolice Department on the university's campus. Officer Collier was not \nonly bravely serving the students and faculty of MIT last April. He was \nalso serving the city of Boston, working with others in the law \nenforcement community to keep the city and our Nation safe during an \nexceptionally tense and difficult time. However, since he was employed \nby a private university, Officer Collier was not eligible for line-of-\nduty death benefits. To honor Officer Collier's service and sacrifice, \nthis bill would be retroactive to April 15, 2013, the day of the Boston \nbombings.\n  I am pleased that Senators Ayotte, Leahy, Markey, and Whitehouse have \njoined me in introducing this legislation, which would ensure that \nofficers who give their full measure and their families are eligible \nfor the benefits associated with law enforcement work, and that they \nhave access to the protective equipment they need.\n  The bill would only apply to officers who are sworn, licensed or \ncertified to enforce the law within their jurisdiction, and is \nsupported by the National Association of Police Organizations and the \nInternational Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring and passing the \nEquity in Law Enforcement Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/05/senate-section/article/S3477-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 468--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND \n                   SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. REID of Nevada (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
