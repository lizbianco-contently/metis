Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will resume consideration of the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2642, the farm bill.

While the President pro tempore is here, I want to make a \nbrief comment.\n  The headlines over the last couple of days have been about the \ndeath--in my opinion--of one of the great actors of our time, Philip \nSeymour Hoffman. He obviously died from a drug overdose of heroin.\n  The reason I wanted to say a word while the President pro tempore is \npresiding is because the Governor of Vermont was very visionary in \ndirecting his State of the State remarks this year to the scourge of \nheroin addiction that is sweeping the Nation. It really is a scourge.\n  According to everything I have been able to learn, it is kind of \nunique. We have people who start off with some kind of prescription \ndrug and then wind up with this stuff that has been prepared by \npurveyors of evil. They don't know what is in it. There are some who \nbelieve they use baby laxative or other ingredients that look like \nheroin. It is a terrible shame.\n  I will send the Governor a letter, but I want to make sure my good \nfriend from Vermont personally tells the Governor what a--I can't find \na better word--visionary he was in the remarks he gave a few weeks ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Record will indicate that I opened the \nSenate in my role as President pro tempore, and now the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey is in the Chair.\n  I wish to respond to the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada and \nthank him for what he said.\n  I was in Montpelier, which is our capital, on Friday, and I spent \nsome time with Governor Peter Shumlin, who did his State of the State \nmessage on this subject, as the distinguished Senator from Nevada has \nsaid. I talked to him about it. I will call him later this morning and \ntell him what the leader said. I am also going to wear my hat as chair \nof the Judiciary Committee and do a hearing on this issue.\n  Ours is a very special and very precious State, but I think it points \nout that every State in the Union can face this problem. While on the \nnational news this morning, Governor Shumlin was great and focused the \nattention of this issue on many States.\n  I will close by saying to my dear friend from Nevada that I \nappreciate his comments. He knows how precious Vermont is to me and \nGovernor Shumlin, and I will make sure the Governor knows what he said.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                            A Man of Stature\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had a meeting with a number of Senators \nthis morning, and one of the topics of conversation was the Presiding \nOfficer's first speech--the so-called maiden speech--he gave last \nnight. It was stunningly good, substantive, and it came from the heart. \nThat is what many Senators told me this morning, and I agree. As I told \nthe Presiding Officer last night, I had to go to a quick meeting, so I \nwatched most of it from my office. The Senator's speech was so \nimportant. The speech focused on dealing with people who are in need.\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\n  This good man, who is presiding over the Senate now, is a man of \nstature. He is extremely talented academically. He is a Stanford \ngraduate and decided he would do public service. In the process of \ndoing public service, he identified with the people who needed help.\n  He moved into a neighborhood that you would not think a mayor of the \ncity would live in, but he did that because he wanted to feel the pulse \nof the people. It is obvious from the speech given last night that the \nPresiding Officer does understand the pulse of the people of his State.\n  We all admired him before he got here, and we admire him even more \nnow.\n\n\n                Measure Placed On The Calendar--S. 1982\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk \nentitled S. 1982 due for a second reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the \nsecond time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1982) to improve the provision of medical \n     services and benefits to veterans, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings with \nrespect to this bill at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be \nplaced on the calendar.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last night I had the good fortune to spend \nsome time with the President, along with Michael Bennet and others. It \nwas worth commenting on that meeting with the President about the \naddress he gave a week ago to the Congress and to the Nation.\n  He addressed Congress and the Nation and described the challenges \nfacing families in America. Wages are far too low, the cost of \neducation is far too high, and there are simply far too few jobs.\n  Each of these challenges places another stumbling block in front of \nAmericans striving to enter the middle class, as well as the middle \nclass trying to do their best to hang on to their status as part of the \nmiddle class. The middle class is being squeezed. The rich are getting \nricher, the poor are getting poorer, and the middle class is being \nsqueezed really hard.\n  Unless we open the doors of opportunity, every child in this Nation--\nour grandchildren--will no longer be able to do what we expect our \ngrandchildren to be able to accomplish. Every child in this Nation--our \ngrandchildren--will have to work longer and harder than we did just to \nget by, let alone just to get ahead.\n  Yesterday I read a story with interest. It was a long, well-\nresearched story in the New York Times. It was in the business section. \nThat piece argued that the richest families and the most successful \ncorporations in America should be just as worried about these trends--\nthe shrinking middle class--as the Presiding Officer and I are.\n  The article described the widespread failure of businesses that cater \nto the middle class. I repeat that: The widespread failure of \nbusinesses that cater to the middle class. Why? Because the middle \nclass is going away.\n  While high-end retailers such as Barneys and Nordstrom flourish, mid-\npriced retailers such as JCPenney and Loehmann's stumble. Loehmann's \nactually filed bankruptcy. While posh restaurant chains such as Capital \nGrille prosper, more modest eateries such as Red Lobster are sinking.\n  The Times wrote:\n\n       As politicians and pundits in Washington continue to spar \n     over whether economic inequality is in fact deepening, in \n     corporate America there really is no debate at all. The post-\n     recession reality is that the customer base for businesses \n     that appeal to the middle class is shrinking as the top tier \n     pulls even farther away.\n\n  Industry analysis says businesses that sell luxury goods to the top 1 \npercent are booming. Over the past 30 years, the top 1 percent has had \ntheir wealth increase three times while during that same 30-year period \nof time the earning capacity of the middle class has been cut by 10 \npercent.\n  Sadly, businesses such as Family Dollar, which caters to the growing \nranks of working families barely scraping by, are also thriving. Why? \nNordstrom is a great place. I love Nordstrom. They have a great return \npolicy. I am glad they are doing well. But Family Dollar is thriving \nbecause many people who were middle class are now poor.\n  Families are not going out for spaghetti and meatballs. They are not \neven going out for hamburgers like they used to. They are not buying \ntheir kids new jeans or backpacks. They pass them down from child to \nchild.\n  I can remember--it has been over a year ago--when I went to this \nprogram in North Las Vegas, NV. There are a lot of poor people in North \nLas Vegas. They were giving away backpacks with some pencils and paper. \nIt was before school started. Those backpacks were so--I don't want to \ndenigrate the wonderful things that people did--cheap. The backpacks \nhad names of businesses on them.\n  These children lined up with their parents for as far as you could \nsee. They were desperate for a backpack. It was not a very good one, \nbut they didn't have one. So they are not buying their kids backpacks \nlike they used to. Purchases that once seemed to be modest treats have \nbecome unaffordable luxuries.\n  While the economy is growing in spite of this trend, economists worry \nthat the growth is unsustainable. One economist told the Times:\n\n       It's going to be hard to maintain strong economic growth \n     with such a large proportion of the population falling \n     behind. We might be able to muddle along--but can we really \n     recover?\n\n  That is the question.\n  In other words, our fortunes are bound together. A shrinking middle \nclass isn't just a problem for families in the middle; it is a problem \nfor businesses, large and small. It is a problem that should worry the \ntop 1 percent of wealthy Americans as much as it worries the 99 percent \nwho are under that 1 percent. Can we really recover when so many of us \nare falling behind? It is a fair question and an extremely troubling \nquestion. Our entire economy is at risk unless we act now to protect \nand grow the middle class whose purchase power is the backbone of our \neconomy.\n  How can we do that? We can create some jobs which we as a Congress \nhave not done because every time we try, there is obstruction from the \nRepublicans. But to achieve this goal of protecting and growing the \nmiddle class, President Obama called for commonsense investments in our \nfuture. He has called for investments in 21st century infrastructure--\nthose old-fashioned structures such as roads and bridges and dams--as \nwell as the new, including renewable energy projects such as solar, \nwind, and geothermal, which would create lots and lots of jobs; then \ncutting-edge technology such as the new Tesla vehicle, an all-electric \nvehicle. I have spoken with Elon Musk who is talking about building \nanother big factory someplace in the West.\n  Investment in universal preschool is so important. Other countries \nare doing it. Why don't we have it mandatory for every 4-year-old?\n  And affordable college. Seated next to me is the assistant leader. He \nidentified a problem years ago which is that kids are being burdened \nwith debt, trying to go to college. Frankly, a lot of the money these \nyoung men and women borrow goes to schools that don't produce anything.\n  Investments in medical research. My colleagues heard me cough. I, for \nthe first time in my life, a couple of weeks ago got the flu. I never \nhad the flu before. I wasn't very sympathetic with people who missed \nwork because of the flu. I am now sympathetic. The flu is devastating. \nI was so sick. At my home in Searchlight, we didn't have a thermometer. \nBy the time we had someone bring one over from Vegas, my fever was very \nhigh. I started the medication Tamiflu not as early as I should have, \nand it turned into bronchitis.\n  The reason I mention this--again, speaking about my friend, the \nsenior Senator from Illinois--he went yesterday to NIH, the National \nInstitutes of Health. I went there a couple of months ago. We should be \nembarrassed by what we have done as a Congress to NIH. We have cut \nthem. And the reason I mention my flu is because when I went there, I \nlearned they are so close to having a flu shot that covers all flu--\neverything. They are so close. What do they need to go the extra mile? \nMore money. The devastation of sequestration has hurt the National \nInstitutes of Health significantly. Chairman Murray did some good work \nto help in the future, but money we have\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\nlost because of sequestration is gone. We have not been fair to the \nNational Institutes of Health. They are doing lifesaving work there, \nand other countries are trying to match what we have done with the \nNational Institutes of Health. They can't; we are way ahead, but we \nwill not remain ahead unless we put some money into the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  We need to help companies that build their products here in America. \nI go out of my way to buy New Balance shoes, running shoes. Why? They \nare made in America. The suit I am wearing, Hickey Freeman, is made in \nAmerica, and I am proud of that.\n  The President also called on Congress to increase the Federal minimum \nwage to $10.10 an hour--a huge step forward guaranteeing that no \nAmerican working full time lives in poverty as they now do, as the \nPresiding Officer so well illustrated last night. This proposal of \nraising the minimum wage has been endorsed by seven Nobel Prize-winning \neconomists. I don't know the political persuasion of these Nobel Prize-\nwinning economists, but they are all persuaded that what we have done \nto the working poor is wrong and we have to do something about it. The \nproposal would raise millions of families out of poverty and give tens \nof millions of children a shot at graduating from college, securing \nhigh-paying jobs, and joining the middle class.\n  There is something else Congress should do to prevent hundreds of \nthousands of Americans from descending into poverty: Extend \nunemployment benefits. In the month we have cut off these benefits \nbecause of obstruction by my Republican colleagues the country has lost \nmore than $2 billion in purchasing; the State of Nevada $30 million. So \nwe could do something now to prevent hundreds of thousands of Americans \nfrom descending into poverty. A 57-year-old woman--I read a part of her \nletter yesterday--said: How do you think I feel going from friend to \nfriend to sleep on their couch? Couch surfing we call it. She said: \nThat only lasts so long. I am selling everything I have. I don't have a \nhome. I am trying to sell everything I have so if I get an opportunity \nfor a job interview, I can buy gas for my car.\n  We must extend unemployment benefits because 1.6 million people have \nbeen out of work for months. These benefits will ensure that more than \n2.3 million children have nutritious meals and a safe place to sleep \nwhile their parents hunt for jobs. Renewing emergency unemployment \ninsurance would prevent Americans who have worked hard to get ahead \nfrom losing their grip on the ladder of success. Restoring unemployment \nbenefits is by no means enough to secure our shrinking middle class, \nbut it certainly is a good first step.\n\n\n                   recognition of the minority leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           EPA Overregulation\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past several years, I have \noften come to the floor of the Senate to draw attention to the Obama \nadministration's radical environmental agenda and the deeply harmful \neffects it is having on the people of Kentucky. The Environmental \nProtection Agency's war on coal is the most obvious and tragic example.\n  Today I wish to highlight this administration's environmental agenda \nat perhaps its most absurd. At the heart of our story is a 2\\1/2\\ inch \nminnow--a 2\\1/2\\ inch minnow called the duskytail darter--a 2\\1/2\\ inch \nminnow called the duskytail darter.\n  Last week, the Obama administration sided with this minnow over the \neconomic well-being of thousands of people in southeastern Kentucky who \nlive near or depend on Lake Cumberland as a major driver of commerce, \ntourism, and recreation. The Obama administration did this by \ndetermining that the presence of the darter in the lake's tributaries \nmeant that the raising of the lake's water level must be further \ndelayed.\n  Lake Cumberland is a signature tourist destination in my State and \none of the economic pillars of McCreary, Clinton, Laurel, Russell, \nPulaski, and Wayne Counties. The water level of the lake was lowered \nback in January of 2007 due to problems with the dam which feeds the \nlake.\n  The past 7 years of reduced water levels have not only hurt small \nbusinesses that rely on tourism but have also strained local \ngovernments, as local towns have had to lower their water intake. \nMarinas have had to spend valuable dollars on both ramp upgrades and \ndock relocations--dollars that could have been spent on growing \nbusinesses, hiring new workers, and enhancing local commerce.\n  In addition, the drawdown of water has deterred tourism, as a \nmisperception has been created among potential visitors that the lake \nis no longer suitable for boating, fishing, and water sports.\n  Every year, Lake Cumberland brings to the local community $200 \nmillion in economic activity and employs, on average, 6,000 people. \nUnderstandably, those in the local community have been anxious to see \nthe water levels returned to their normal level, after 7 years of \nreduced water level.\n  2014 was supposed to be a great year for Lake Cumberland, as \nKentuckians would mark the end of 7 years' worth of repairs to the dam \nand, therefore, reduced water levels and fewer visitors. Now, suddenly, \nthe Obama administration has announced that the water level cannot be \nraised because it could potentially have a harmful effect on this \nminnow, the duskytail darter, which is on the endangered species list.\n  The absurdity of the Obama administration's posture on this issue is \nmanifest. First, the administration is protecting a fish from water. \nLet me get this straight: Protecting a fish from water? The radical \nenvironmentalists in the Obama administration don't want this fish to \nbe exposed to too much water? What is next, protecting birds from too \nmuch sky?\n  Second, the administration took this action because raising the water \ncould--could, not would--potentially--potentially--have an adverse \neffect on this poor little minnow. Of course, anything in the universe \ncould have an adverse effect on this minnow. To the people of \nsoutheastern Kentucky, the President's year of action is apparently \nbeneficial only if you have gills.\n  The story of the darter would be humorous if it weren't so harmful to \nthe economic well-being of thousands of southeastern Kentuckians. This \nmisguided policy will have deeply harmful consequences for this region \nof Kentucky.\n  Carolyn Mounce, who is responsible for promoting tourism at Lake \nCumberland at the Somerset/Pulaski Convention and Visitors Bureau, put \nit best when she said: ``[This is] bureaucracy run amok!'' Bureaucracy \nrun amok, said Carolyn Mounce. She just returned from attending travel \nand tourism shows in Cincinnati and Louisville 2 weeks ago.\n  She said:\n\n       The shows were crowded . . . people wanted to talk about \n     Lake Cumberland. They were excited about returning the lake \n     to normal operation. And now this.\n\n  J.D. Hamilton, who operates Lee's Ford Resort Marina in Lake \nCumberland in Nancy, KY, was also disappointed to learn of this \nannouncement. Disappointed is an understatement, as his business has \nbeen stifled by the lowering of water over the last 7 years. In \nresponse to this announcement, he said, ``The Corps is keeping its word \nto the fish but not to the economy.''\n  So, yesterday, my friend and colleague Senator Rand Paul and I, along \nwith our colleagues in the House, Congressman Rogers and Congressman \nWhitfield, wrote the administration calling for an end to this \nintolerable further delay. I hope the Obama administration will take \nheed and concern itself more with endangered jobs and endangered \nlivelihoods of actual Kentuckians and Americans than with the possible \nendangerment of this apparently water-averse minnow.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                      Lance Corporal Adam D. Peak\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak about a young man from my State who \ngave his life while serving this Nation in uniform. LCpl Adam D. Peak \nof Florence, KY, was tragically killed by an improvised explosive \ndevice in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, on February 21, 2010. A member \nof the U.S. Marine Corps, he was 25 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Lance Corporal Peak received many medals,\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\nawards, and decorations, including the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the \nIraq Campaign Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal, and the NATO International Security \nAssistance Force Medal.\n  Born on August 30, 1984, Adam was a native of Florence, where he grew \nup with a reputation as a performer who made his friends and family \nlaugh with his quick wit. He and his older sister Sara would quote \nmovie lines back and forth to each other in a blink of an eye, and Adam \nespecially liked to entertain his younger sister Angela. ``Adam was \nsarcastic with a dry sense of humor, and could get people to laugh all \nthe time,'' says Adam's mother Diana. ``I guess what I loved most about \nhim was his love for his sister, who was born with Down Syndrome. He \nhad unlimited patience with her, and I knew that when his dad and I \nwere gone, he would take care of Angela.''\n  Although Adam did not get a chance to have a family of his own, he \nloved kids. ``He was like a second father to a lot of the other \nMarines' kids,'' says his sister Sara. Adam's mother certainly agrees. \n``He loved kids and thought that someday he would have a large \nfamily,'' she says. ``He played Santa every year for his friend's \nfamily, and the kids loved him.''\n  Adam attended Boone County High School, where he graduated in 2002. \nHe then attended Thomas More College in Crestview Hills, KY. In school, \nhe was active in the Alpha Delta Gamma fraternity, the Saints Club, the \nEducation Club, and the Villa Players Theater Club. His mother Diana \nparticularly remembers Adam's interest in theater. ``He developed a \nlove for the stage while in college at Thomas More,'' she says. ``He \nstarted out behind the scenes, but his friends got him on stage for a \nplay and he loved it. He appeared in many productions while at \nschool.''\n  Richard Shuey, a business administration professor at Thomas More, \ntaught Adam in three classes. Adam ``was one of those really nice, \nclean-cut northern Kentucky kids,'' Richard says. ``Always polite and \ninterested in doing well, and obviously a true patriot.''\n  One of Adam's fraternity brothers, Caleb Finch, remembers him as ``a \nbig-hearted, free-spirited, fun-loving guy who would do anything for \nanybody.''\n  After graduation from Thomas More, Adam enlisted in the Marine Corps \nin July of 2007. By December of that year he had been promoted to the \nrank of lance corporal. Adam's younger brother Sean enlisted in the \nMarines as well, and the two brothers served together in the same unit \nin Iraq in 2008. ``Their personalities were night and day,'' says Robin \nPeak, Adam's sister-in-law. ``But they always had each other's backs \nand were there together.'' In October 2009, Adam and Sean were deployed \nto Afghanistan, both as members of the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marine \nDivision, Two Marine Expeditionary Force, based out of Camp Lejeune, \nNC. Sean accompanied his brother back home for burial, and Adam was \nlaid to rest with full military honors in Taylor Mill, KY.\n  Mr. President, we are thinking of Adam's loved ones today, including \nhis parents Bruce and Diana, his brother Sean, his sisters Sara and \nAngela, his sister-in-law Robin, and many other beloved family members \nand friends.\n  The loss of LCpl Adam D. Peak is tragic. Indeed, it is only \nappropriate that this Senate pause to honor his service and recognize \nhis sacrifice.\n  I hope his family can take some comfort from the fact that both the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky and the country as a whole are grateful for \nand honored by the heroism and courage Adam displayed in his entirely \ntoo short life. The example he set for his loved ones and his country \nwill not be forgotten.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       reservation of leader time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n\n\n                       Commending Senator Booker\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I address the farm bill, I would \nlike to make two other points. The first is to commend the Presiding \nOfficer. Yesterday he gave his first speech on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. About 20 of us were here and listened carefully. I am glad I \ndid. It was time well spent. It was a speech which the Presiding \nOfficer clearly not only worked on but believes in, and it showed. He \naddressed the plight of working Americans, and particularly those who \nhave lost their jobs, and the responsibility of this Congress and this \nNation to stand by these families while they are in transition looking \nfor new opportunities.\n  I sat here and listened and watched as the Presiding Officer spoke to \nthis subject, addressing specific people he has met in his State who \ntold him their stories. I thought to myself: I have met quite a few in \nIllinois in like circumstances. I wish every Member of the Senate would \ndo what the Presiding Officer has done--visit the towns, the \nrestaurants, the veterans centers, and other places where unemployed \npeople gather and listen to them.\n  The point the Presiding Officer made so convincingly was those who \ndismiss the unemployed as just lazy people have never met them. They \nare not lazy. They are workers who want to work again. What they are \nasking for is a helping hand, and the Presiding Officer made that point \nso eloquently yesterday.\n  What was particularly good for me, having served in the Senate for a \nnumber of years, was to hear a new Member of the Senate, in his first \nspeech, really reach back to the values that inspired many of us to run \nfor this position. It is easy to become jaded after you have been here \nfor a while and been engaged in the petty political fights that take \nplace here with some frequency. It is easy to forget why you asked your \nfamily to stand behind you when you ran, why you sacrificed to try to \ncome to this place, and why each of us--some 1,200 or so who have had \nthis distinct honor to serve in the Senate--should not miss the \nopportunity to bring our values and passion to the floor every single \nday.\n  So I thank the Senator from New Jersey, our Presiding Officer, for an \nextraordinary maiden speech, first speech on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. It was one of the best.\n\n\n                    Environmental Protection Agency\n\n  Secondly, I would like to address the issue that was raised by my \ncolleague from the State of Kentucky. The State of Kentucky is just \nsouth of Illinois. We have coalfields too. Almost 75 percent of our \nState has coal under the ground. We mine that coal--not like we used \nto, but we still mine it and use it, and we have coal miners and coal \ncompanies, and coal is an important part of the Illinois economy.\n  The Senator from Kentucky came to the floor today to really take \nexception to a decision by the Environmental Protection Agency as it \naffected coal country in Kentucky. I do not know anything about the \nparticulars of his complaint involving the Cumberland Lake and the \nEndangered Species Act, so I will not address that, but I would like to \naddress one, more general topic.\n  To argue that the Environmental Protection Agency is the enemy of \ncoal country is to completely ignore what has been in the newspapers \nfor the last several weeks. There are 300,000 people in the State of \nWest Virginia who are afraid to drink the water because of a leak from \na tank that had a chemical solution used for cleaning coal. These \npeople worry that drinking this water, cooking with this water, even \nbathing in this water is a danger to them. And where did they turn for \nsome indication of safety for their families? This part of America--\nWest Virginia, coal country, just like Kentucky and Illinois--turned to \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. Of course they did. Is it safe? \nCan my child drink this water safely? Can I use it for cooking?\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\n  So to argue that the Environmental Protection Agency is the enemy of \ncoal country is to ignore the obvious. They can make wrong decisions. \nWe all do. Agencies do. But time and again, when we are in trouble, \nwhen it comes to something as basic as the safety of our drinking \nwater, we turn to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers \nfor Disease Control and ask them to help us determine whether that \nwater is safe.\n  Let me add parenthetically, Mr. President, your predecessor, Senator \nFrank Lautenberg of New Jersey, was a leader, and I was happy to be his \npartner in trying to get to the bottom of the danger of many of these \nchemicals. Most Americans mistakenly believe this government reviews \nthe toxicity or danger of all the chemicals in use in this country. In \nfact, only a small percentage is ever reviewed by the government. We, \nin fact, trust those who make and sell these chemicals to do the right \nthing, and many times they betray that trust and sell something \ndangerous which we discover later after the damage has been done.\n  Again, the role of the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nCenters for Disease Control, the role of the Federal Government in \nmonitoring these chemicals for the safety of businesses and families \nand individuals across America is essential whether you live in the \ncities of Newark or Chicago or coal country, USA. So if we are going to \ngo to war against the Environmental Protection Agency, let's at least \nbe honest about the critical role they play. I hope that is remembered \nas we reflect on some of the things said on the floor this morning.\n  Mr. President, this is the conference report for the Agricultural Act \nof 2014. Senator Stabenow was on the floor earlier. She has stepped off \nnow. She has poured her heart and soul into this document and into this \nwork. Two years ago we passed the farm bill on the floor of the \nSenate--2 years ago. She did it with Senator Roberts of Kansas. I voted \nfor it, and I thought it was an exceptional effort on her part. It went \nto the U.S. House of Representatives--as is the custom under the \nConstitution--to wither and die 2 years ago.\n  Then a year ago they said let's try again. Let's pass the farm bill \nagain in the U.S. Senate in the hopes that the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives will take it up--a year ago. So a year ago Senator \nStabenow and Senator Roberts sent this measure to the House of \nRepresentatives for consideration, and again it languished. It may have \nbeen one of the longest running conference committees in the history of \nCongress, but thank goodness for the perseverance of Senator Stabenow \nand many others; they produced this document.\n  For those who do not live in farm country, this may seem like a \nforeign text, but for those of us who do live in farm country, just \nreading the table of contents will tell you the important elements of \nthis bill and why it is so critically important to Illinois and \nvirtually every State in the Union.\n  I commend Senator Stabenow. As I said, she really poured her heart \nand soul into this document. There are provisions in here that many of \nus may never really appreciate that she fought for over a long period \nof time. I am going to acknowledge a few of those during the course of \nmy formal remarks. But while she is here on the floor, let me give \nspecial credit to my colleague. She really took on this task and did it \nin an extraordinary way.\n  After years of expirations and short-term extensions, primarily due \nto the problems and inaction in the House of Representatives, this bill \nfinally is going to provide farmers in Illinois and across the Nation \nwith some guarantee of certainty on their future.\n  Compared to the presequester budget levels--that is budget talk \naround here for past budgets--this bill is going to save $23 billion \nover the next 10 years. This conference report before us works to do \nfour things: invest in energy and research, help our rural communities \ngrow--those of us who represent smalltown America know how important \nthat is--ensure stability for our farmers who face the vicissitudes of \nweather and markets, and provides food assistance for those most in \nneed both here and overseas.\n  These are amazing and important goals. I am glad Senator Stabenow and \nall the conferees applied themselves to make this happen. I am \ndisappointed by one provision. I know Senator Stabenow will not be \nsurprised. Despite modest reforms, we still provide extraordinary \noutside premium support for many farmers who buy crop insurance.\n  In fairness, this bill eliminates a price support program that was no \nlonger defensible, a program that paid farmers in good times as well as \nbad. So it was not what it was designed to be, emergency help for \nfarmers in need. She eliminated the direct payment program, by and \nlarge. That, to me, is a step forward.\n  Instead, this bill moves farmers toward crop insurance. Most of us, \nstepping back, say: That sounds like a responsible thing to do. A \nfarmer buys an insurance policy, so if things go bad on the farm, a \nflood, a drought, some other problem, or the prices happen to be \ndisastrous when the farmer goes to market, the insurance policy will \nmake sure they can live to plant again. That is a good thing. But as I \nhave said several times, any time you put the two words ``Federal'' and \n``insurance'' in the same sentence, I advise my colleagues to step back \nand ask some questions. This is not insurance as you envision it. It is \nnot a matter of automobile insurance, where the automobile owners pay \nenough in premiums to create a reserve to cover the exposure of \naccidents.\n  This is different. Under the Crop Insurance Program, similar to many \nFederal insurance programs, there is a massive Federal subsidy: 62 \npercent of the reserves that are necessary to make the program function \nare provided by the Federal Treasury, not by premiums paid by farmers. \nSo it is a good program. It is a valued program. It is critically \nimportant. But let's keep our mind on the reality. It is heavily \nsubsidized by the Federal Government.\n  Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, a very conservative Republican, and I \ndecided to offer an amendment which said: If you are a farmer whose \nincome is over $750,000 a year, we will reduce, slightly, the \ngovernment's subsidy of your crop insurance. Over $750,000 in income, \nwe will reduce, slightly, the 62-percent Federal subsidy on your crop \ninsurance. You will pay slightly more in premiums because you are able \nto. You are better off than most.\n  This passed not once but twice on the floor of the Senate. As it \nturned out, the conferees, primarily from the House, hated this \nprovision like the devil hates Holy water. So they struck this \nprovision from the bill. That is unfortunate. Not only did we pass it \ntwice, the House had passed on the floor an instruction to conferees to \ninclude it. Members wanted to be on record saying they liked this idea. \nWhen the conferees got their hands on it, they lopped it right out of \nthe bill.\n  Let me ask the Presiding Officer to hold on to that thought for a \nmoment while I get into another section of the bill. The areas where \nthe House conferees worked up an appetite was when it came to the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the so-called Food Stamp \nProgram.\n  Again, let me commend Senator Stabenow as chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee. She called me several times to tell me about the battles she \nhad to wage to protect the food stamp program.\n  Let's talk about the program for a minute. Almost 15 percent of \nhouseholds across America have trouble keeping food on the table. SNAP, \nthe food program, provides 47 million Americans with essential food \nassistance. Eighty-three percent of the households that receive food \nstamps include a child or a person with disability or a senior citizen. \nNearly 1 million veterans use the Food Stamp Program each year in \nAmerica.\n  In Illinois, over 2 million people, almost one in seven residents, \nrely on SNAP benefits to buy the food they need. Who are these people? \nWho in the world needs food stamps in a great State such as the State \nof Illinois? Let me tell you about two or three of them.\n  One of them was the elderly lady whom I met at the Irving Park \nMethodist Church food pantry. She was on a walker. She had a very short \nhaircut, suggesting that perhaps she had been through some chemotherapy \nor radiation. She soldiered her way right up there to get a bag of \ngroceries. She sat down and I talked to her.\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\n  I said to her: Can you tell me a little bit about how you are doing.\n  Sure Senator. I am doing OK. I get $800 a month in Social Security.\n  I said: How in the world do you live in Chicago on $800 a month?\n  Ain't easy, Senator. Got to pay the rent. Got to pay the utility \nbills and the basics. She said: I come to this food pantry and one \nother one. Each one of them gives me 3 days' worth of food. So I get \nabout 1 month, 6 days' worth of food, out of the two food pantries. I \nthank them for that. I get food stamps worth about $130 a month.\n  That is it, folks. That is what she lives on, an elderly person. When \nthe House Republicans said what we need to do is cut $40 billion--that \nwas their original recommendation--$40 billion out of food stamps, they \napparently had never met this lady and what she was up against or they \nmight have met a couple of workers whom I had a press conference with \non Sunday in Chicago, working full time and qualifying for food stamps. \nOne was a fellow who worked on the west side of Chicago at a used car \nlot. Does it all, he said--cleans the cars, shovels the lot, sells the \ncars, and gets paid $8.25 an hour, which is our State minimum wage--\nfour kids, his wife is sick and cannot work.\n  He gets food stamps. He needs them to put food on the table for the \nkids, for a full-time worker at a minimum wage job. Then on the other \nside was a lady who is a waitress. She told the story of being a single \nmom. Her son is now 19. She is heading him off to the City College of \nChicago. That is a great deal. But she works a job which has a \nguaranteed minimum wage in Illinois of about $4.50 an hour. That is \nwhat waitresses are guaranteed--tipped wage. Nationally, the tipped \nwage is $2.13 an hour. She said: I do not work in a fancy restaurant. I \nam lucky to come home with $10 or $20 in tips in a day.\n  So do the math. She said: Some days they do not call me in to work. I \nget nothing. She relies on food stamps too, a woman who is ready to \nwork and works hard, standing all day, waiting tables. So in come the \nHouse Republicans saying we need to come down hard on these people, \nthese lazy people on food stamps. I wish they would meet some of those \nfolks who use food stamps to get by, to survive. These people are our \nneighbors. They are hard-working people who lost their jobs or got \nsick. They are seniors living on a limited fixed income.\n  This bill does cut $8 billion out of SNAP, the Food Stamp Program. I \nunderstand the cuts that were made. I think Senator Stabenow and others \nhave done these carefully. I do not want any fraud in this program. She \ndoes not either. We think we have tightened it so it will not affect \nthe payments to those who are truly eligible and those who need the \nhelp. Yet it will make sure the taxpayers are treated fairly as well.\n  But look at the contrast. Some of the conferees walked into this \nhearing and said that farmers who make almost $1 million a year should \nnot have any reduction in their subsidy for crop insurance, but people \nsuch as the lady at the Irving Park Methodist Church food pantry, being \npaid $800 a month, we ought to take a hard look at the $130 a month we \ngive this lady. That is upside down. That does not reflect the values \nof this country or the priorities we need to face.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan. She worked long and hard, was a \nreal champion when it came to SNAP, the Food Stamp Program. \nIncidentally, the good news is, as the economy improves and people get \nback to work, the number of people on food stamps is going down, which \nis what we want to see. But does it not say something about us as a \nnation, a caring, compassionate Nation, that we are going to be there \nto help those families living in our towns and our States, going to our \nchurches, when they are struggling to put food on the table?\n  Why was that such an inviting target for some of the House conferees? \nI do not understand that. There is a lot of money that can be saved in \ngovernment. We do not want to waste a penny of it. But let's focus \nprimarily on those who can afford to pay and are getting a Federal \nsubsidy as opposed to those who are just struggling to get by and are \nasking for a helping hand. This bill does so much. I could not even \nstart to describe all of the different areas dealing with risk on the \nfarm, key investments in energy and research, ag research, programs to \nhelp rural communities grow, and helping those in need.\n  Most importantly, this reauthorization gives Illinois farmers \ncertainty about farm programs. They need it. That is something they \nhave not had for the last 3 years. I am going to support this bill. I \nwish we had been able to preserve the provision that Senator Coburn and \nI included. But I believe, on balance, it is an important step forward \nin farm country across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, as the Senate turns its attention this week \nto the farm bill conference report, my thoughts turn to the Wild West \nto put its provisions in context. Frankly, its 950 pages lend \nthemselves to talking about the good, the bad, and the just plain ugly.\n  I mention the good, because while this farm bill falls far short of \ngaining my support, it is not entirely without provisions worth \nhighlighting. Conferees, including a one-term extension of the Payments \nin Lieu of Taxes, or the PILT Program. That gives temporary \npredictability at least for counties with low tax bases due to Federal \nland ownership and provides Congress with time to chart a long-term \nsolution in this regard.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes permanently the stewardship \ncontracting authority. This is a critical land management tool that \nallows us to proactively reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires. It \nis one I have long called for. While reforms to the liability \nrequirements are also included, the report fails to include necessary \nflexibility on cancelation ceilings. That is something I will continue \nto work on in the future.\n  Sadly, when it comes to the bad, there is not enough time to list all \nof the items in the report that should make any lawmaker cringe who is \nconcerned about our crushing national debt or those of us trying to \nreform agriculture policy.\n  Rather than truthfully trimming the already generous agriculture \nsafety net, taxpayers should prepare for yet another round of entirely \nnew alphabet soup subsidy programs. The Senator from Illinois explained \nvery well the Crop Insurance Program that is so heavily subsidized, 62 \npercent.\n  I think all of us with auto insurance or other types of insurance \nwould love to have that kind of contribution from the Federal \nGovernment. This report does not even provide commonsense reforms that \nlimit waste and largess to sustained hallmarks of agriculture \nsubsidies. The report also fails to limit agricultural payments to \nthose who are actually involved in farming.\n  It cannot even provide a reasonable income limit, as was discussed by \nthe Senator from Illinois, for those who already receive crop insurance \nsubsidies. Incomprehensibly, any renegotiation of the arrangement \nbetween crop insurers and the Federal Government would be required to \nbe revenue neutral, despite billions of dollars in taxpayer savings \nhaving been found in previous renegotiations.\n  This bill is purported to be fiscally conservative because it saves \n$16 billion or so in tax dollars. Before we pat each other on the back \nin this regard, we need to remember that Congress has a pretty dismal \nrecord of actually knowing how much farm bills are going to cost.\n  According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, ``The last two farms bills \nare on pace to exceed their Congressional Budget Office score by more \nthan $400 billion, and there's no assurance that this farm bill will be \nany different.''\n  Let's get to the ugly. For years, direct payments have been one of \nthe clearest signs of what needs to be changed in Federal spending. The \nFederal Government has been handing out roughly $5 billion a year to \nfarmers regardless of whether they are farming the land. I want to pay \ntribute to the Senator from Michigan who has fought to end these direct \npayments.\n  The Senate did a pretty good job there, but the House did not. I \nmyself have long sought to end these direct payments. I was encouraged \nwith the Senate action to end these payments outright. But despite our \nfiscal situation, the best we could get in the House was allowing \ndirect payments to continue, albeit slightly reduced for cotton, for \n2014 and 2015.\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\n  This conference report purports to end direct payments but ends them \nin name only for cotton. Let's be clear. It simply renames direct \npayments for cotton for 2 years. They will now be called transition \npayments. Cotton growers will continue to receive payments until--wait \nfor it--the other new subsidy programs created in this report come \nonline.\n  Perhaps, instead of western movies, I should have conjured up images \nof Shakespeare to describe this fiscal tragedy: a government-funded \nhandout by another name is still a government-funded handout. It is \nalso worth recalling that when originally created in 1996, in the 1996 \nfarm bill, direct payments went by the name AMTA payments or \nAgricultural Market Transition Assistance payments.\n  It would appear that for some commodities, there will always be a \ntransition from something to something else that will result in a \ntaxpayer-funded handout.\n  According to the CBO score, the report actually takes the zero cost \nfrom the Senate proposal and the $443 million cost from the House \nproposal and compromises at a higher cost of $556 million in 2015. That \nis some compromise, to go well above both the House and the Senate \nnumbers.\n  While the 10-year score for the transition payments in the report is \nlower than the House proposal, the first-year costs are actually \nhigher. It is at this point that one can simply stop being surprised at \nwhat will happen when it comes to farm subsidies. Sadly, rather than a \nblockbuster of fiscal sanity, taxpayers are going to be saddled with \nwhat looks to be another rerun of missed opportunities to reform \nFederal agricultural policy. Although livestock groups have decried the \nabsence of fixes to ongoing regulatory problems, and fiscal \nconservatives are chafing at the continued waste in spending, this \nreport is still likely to be adopted.\n  There are other issues addressed, and I am pleased that some of this \nwill end up on the President's desk, but I cannot support this \nconference report. I will continue to push for real fiscal discipline \nand sound agricultural policy.\n  I should note I remember when I first came to Congress, or about 1 \nyear after, I came to the floor of the House to rail against the farm \nbill at that time, the 2002 reauthorization. We had gone in the 1990s \nfrom the Freedom to Farm Act to the Farm Security Act. For those of us \nconservatives who talk about moving from freedom to security and all \nthat means, that was actually in the title of the bill, and we haven't \nimproved much since that time. That was more than a decade ago. I have \nto say we should have made progress that was simply not made in this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I rise today to discuss legislation that benefits all \nAmericans, and particularly my home State of Ohio.\n  I appreciate Senator Flake's comments. I admire his integrity and his \nfocus on waste in government for the decade or so that I have known \nhim--longer than that. I think he makes good points in this \nlegislation. We come down on different sides in the end. Some of the \nthings he had talked about, eliminating a lot of direct payments, were \nespecially important and were made possible by legislation Senator \nThune and I introduced.\n  This is an ongoing process to improve this bill every year. Every 5 \nyears I am hopeful we can do that. I thank Senator Flake for his \ncomments.\n  This bill is bipartisan. It reduces the deficit, it helps farms, \nhelps families, helps our economy, and it helps our environment. It \nsaves 23 billion taxpayer dollars. It provides certainty and support to \none of the Nation's largest job creators, agriculture. Food and \nagriculture together are about one in seven jobs in Ohio. Agriculture-\nrelated businesses such as food processing, fertilizer and feed sales \nalso are part of Ohio's largest industry.\n  I thank Senator Cochran and Senator Stabenow for getting us to this \npoint. They have been dogged in their support for our Nation's farmers \nand our rural communities.\n  I have spoken with Ohio's corn and soybean growers, as well as \nmembers of the Ohio Farm Bureau. On Friday I spoke and met with a group \nof 300 farmers, members of the Ohio Farmers Union, in Columbus. They \nhave told me the importance of passing a 5-year farm bill. They \nespecially emphasized the certainty, finally, of this bill. They can \nmake the planning and planting decisions that business people and \nfarmers need.\n  I have traveled across Ohio's 88 counties and listened to farmers \nfrom Minster to Millersburg, who have told me they want a leaner, more \nefficient, and market-oriented farm safety net. Taxpayers deserve that \ntoo.\n  This bill is a reform farm bill. It eliminates direct farm payments, \nlinks crop insurance to conservation compliance, and it reforms our \nrisk management programs--all important things in agriculture policy.\n  Ohio farmers were clear they wanted a farm bill that eliminated those \ndirect payments and provided the risk management tools they needed when \ntimes are bad, but without the market-distorting policies that ensure \nfarmers are planting for the program and not the market. Unfortunately, \nthat was happening far too often.\n  In the last 6 or 7 years during my time in the Senate, leading up to \nthe 2007-2008 farm bill and the 2013-2014 farm bill, I held some 25 \nroundtables with farmers and rural development people around my State. \nWorking with my colleagues Senator Thune and Senator Durbin, we were \nable to streamline the farm safety net and make it more market \noriented. Our bill, the Aggregate Risk and Revenue Management Act, is \nthe basis for the Agricultural Risk Coverage Program, which was \nincluded in the commodity title. By reforming commodity programs to \nbetter align with the market instead of simply sending out checks--even \nwhen times were good and in many cases to people who don't need them--\nthis bill will provide farmers with increased risk management tools \nwhile improving the integrity of these programs.\n  The bill incorporates many portions of the Local Farms, Food, and \nJobs Act that I introduced. We know too many farmers struggle to find \nlocal markets for their products. Too many Ohioans are also unable to \naccess fresh and affordable food. This legislation helps to put them \ntogether. Whether by improving Farmers Market Promotion program, or the \nValue Added Producers grant, this bill makes a significant investment \nin local and regional food production and marketing.\n  We know what has happened in rural America in terms of development. \nWhile agricultural prices have been such that farmers have been \nprosperous enough and that many in rural America are doing OK, rural \ndevelopment is still an issue as people move out of the these \ncommunities looking for jobs.\n  Whether it is bringing broadband to southeast Ohio or a water and \nsewer project in Henry County or a low-interest loan to Buckeye Power, \nthis bill will make sure rural communities have the tools, the \nprograms, and capital that they need to succeed.\n  My State is home to approximately 130 companies that use agricultural \ncrops to make new biobased products, ranging from natural pet foods to \npaint, soy ink, toner, and plastics. Last week, USDA Secretary Vilsack \nand I toured a Columbus plastics factory, where they are working to \nmake more of their products with biobased feedstocks instead of oil. We \nknow what that means for renewable energy in our State. Our homegrown \nproducts can replace imported oil in our everyday products. This is a \nwin for our local economies and for Ohio farmers.\n  We also know the importance of helping young farmers. If someone goes \nto any farm organization meeting, farmers are typically in their \nfifties, sixties, and seventies. We don't see enough in their twenties, \nthirties, and forties. In this legislation, we will help to recruit, \ntrain, and retrain the next generation of farmers. That is part of this \nconference report. USDA needs to redouble its efforts, particularly in \nmaking capital available, and ensure that young and beginning farmers \nare able to succeed.\n\n  The bill streamlines and, in my opinion, improves USDA's conservation \nprograms. That is so important in the western Lake Erie basin of the \nGreat Lakes. We have seen what has happened with algae blooms east of \nToledo along places like Port Clinton and Sandusky. It is reaching \nalmost as far east as Lorain. We are seeing the problems it causes to \nwater quality, recreation, tourism, and to development along the lake \nthat is so important.\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\n  The House wanted, on the SNAP issue, to slash food stamps by $40 \nbillion. We fought back. Our conference committee rejected every \nproposal passed by the House to cut off the assistance to workers and \ntheir families who have fallen on very hard times. When we couple what \nsome in this body want to do with cutting unemployment, failing to \nextend unemployment insurance, failing to raise the minimum wage, \nmaking huge cuts in Food Stamp Programs, this was a huge victory in our \nconference committee.\n  This bill needs to pass. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass \nit and send it to President Obama so he can sign this bill at the end \nof this week or the beginning of next week.\n  Before I leave the floor, I do want to speak in great detail about \nthe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, and the nutrition \ntitle of the bill. SNAP benefits are very modest and are essential part \nof our nation's social safety net. The average SNAP household gets just \nover $9 a day in benefits or $1.46 per person per meal. Yet, for people \nthat are food insecure, SNAP is the difference between putting food on \nthe table or going hungry.\n  When there is an economic downturn, SNAP responds to support those \nwho need assistance: the elderly, children, and working families. When \nwe last strengthened the program in the 2008 farm bill, we ensured that \na strong SNAP was there for families and communities. We saw the \ncaseload rise from 28 million people in 2008 to over 47 million people \ntoday.\n  Too often, we forget that those who rely on SNAP are real people, and \nnot just some statistic. I want to tell you about a couple of those \npeople. Doris, from Reynoldsburg, is a 60-year-old who was diagnosed \nwith stage 4 colon cancer in 2009. The doctors only gave her 6 months \nto live, but nearly 5 years later, she continues to fight. Because of \nher illness, she had to quit her work and she lost her health \ninsurance. Doris has worked all her life and saves the little money she \nhas to pay her bills and rent on time. Since she is on disability, she \nis eligible to receive $16 a month in SNAP benefits. After the cuts to \nthe program that went into effect on November 1, her benefit is now $10 \nper month. She's too young to collect Social Security, so each week she \nand a friend drive to Columbus to the Mid-Ohio food bank for fresh \nproduce.\n  Roxanne lives in northeast Ohio and is a home-health aide. She's a \nsingle mother and has four growing children under the age of 17. \nRoxanne works more than 60 hours per week, but relies on SNAP to help \nher make ends meet and ensure her children have enough to eat. For the \npast 3 years she has received about $400 per month; after the November \ncut to SNAP, her family now receives $335 per month. Unfortunately, \nthis usually only lasts through the third week of the month. As she has \ntried to stretch her income, she has been forced to choose between \nserving her family healthy fruits and vegetables or ordering off the \ndollar menu at a fast food restaurant. Roxanne never thought she would \nbe in a situation where she would have to rely on a food pantry to help \nher feed her family.\n  I am proud that we were able to maintain a robust and responsive \nnutrition assistance program. The conference has rejected every \nproposal passed by the House to cutoff assistance to workers and their \nfamilies who have fallen on very hard times. Rather than arbitrarily \nimpose new and harsher time limits on how long unemployed workers may \nreceive SNAP benefits, the bill strengthens SNAP employment and \ntraining program capacity. It provides modest but meaningful \nimprovements in program administration and clarifies and codifies \ntechnical but important aspects of eligibility policy. The bill \nsupports new anti-fraud initiatives, requires strong but efficient data \nmatching in program administration, and supports keeping program retail \noperations up-to-date with the evolving food retailing environment.\n  There has been criticism about this bill's SNAP savings--which are \nfar more modest than the House's proposal to cut $40 billion from SNAP. \nI appreciate these concerns. This bill achieves savings by correcting a \nquirk in the SNAP benefit calculation that allows some State agencies \nto give households higher benefits by allowing them to deduct more \nincome from their shelter costs.\n  SNAP benefits are based on the size of the household and how much \nmoney it has available to buy food. This amount is determined by \nsubtracting out essential costs that households must pay and cannot use \nto buy groceries. For example, households with high shelter costs \nrelative to their income have less money for buying food. Shelter costs \ninclude rent or mortgage payments and the cost of utilities such as \nheating and cooling. Rather than trying to document each household's \nutility costs over the course of a year, the rules allow States to set \na standard utility allowance, ``standard allowance,'' for households \nwith these expenses. This standardization enormously reduces the time \nand paperwork required to calculate income. Almost every State uses the \nstandard allowance, and most require it to be used to budget utility \ncosts and do not allow any option to claim actual expenses.\n  Program rules have long recognized that the receipt of Low Income \nHousehold Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, aid is a simple method \nof determining if households incur utility costs. A few States have \nauthorized households to receive negligible LIHEAP assistance--\ngenerally only $1--merely to get them higher benefits. This was not the \nintention of connecting the standard allowance to LIHEAP. This bill \ncloses this loophole by requiring that a family's LIHEAP payment must \nbe at least $20 in order to qualify for the standard allowance solely \non the LIHEAP connection. LIHEAP funds are very limited and at this \ndollar level States would no longer be able to fund the broad-based \nbenefits for SNAP households that some now offer.\n  This change does not affect anyone in my State of Ohio, but I \nrecognize that this will not be an easy adjustment for households that \nare affected. I expect that the Department will ensure that State \nagencies do not summarily deny the standard allowance to households \nthat received a nominal LIHEAP payment. State agencies and the USDA \nmust work with families so they can determine whether they have any \nheating or cooling costs that would qualify for the standard allowance \nregardless of LIHEAP. These costs are most likely a bill from a utility \ncompany, but could be a charge from a landlord.\n  As I have said, this farm bill ends the policy whereby some States \ngive $1 of payment to most if not all SNAP households. I am concerned \nthat many if not most of these households really do have heating and \ncooling costs and need the standard allowance to get an adequate and \ncorrect benefit. So I expect that USDA will work with State agencies to \nensure that households have a meaningful opportunity to claim these \ncosts so that they get the right amount of benefits.\n  Finally, I'm concerned about the very quick implementation \nrequirement for this provision. If a State is not able to implement \nwithin 30 days, I don't think SNAP households should be held \nresponsible. I hope that my friend Secretary Vilsack will find a way to \nensure that households who may continue to receive higher benefits \nbecause the State agency was not able to implement this policy change \nwithin 30 days will not be held accountable for mistakes arising from \nsuch an aggressive implementation schedule.\n  There are a number of other provisions that do not result in benefit \ncuts to households, but change eligibility rules or codify common \npractices. I would like to turn to them now.\n  The title codifies longstanding SNAP student eligibility policy. \nWhile SNAP remains unavailable to most college students, low-income \npeople on SNAP who are trying to gain skills and credentials needed for \nimmediate employment can access SNAP.\n  Historically, most college students have not been eligible for SNAP \nand this bill does nothing to expand their eligibility. But at a time \nwhen workers need to continually acquire new and better job skills, \nStates have concluded that many participants can be best served by \nenhancing their vocational skills through training offered by State \ncareer and technical education networks. These networks offer training \nand education that aims at enabling students to keep or qualify for new \njobs. Many times the programs are offered by community colleges which \nare considered part of the higher education system. I want to be sure \nthat SNAP\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\nState education and training programs can connect SNAP recipients to \nthis type of vocational education because in the long run it has the \ngreatest potential to help people achieve lasting self-sufficiency. \nGiving people a stark choice between putting food on the table today or \ngetting a job credential that will help them get a job tomorrow is \ncounterproductive. By helping people stay in a vocational program, we \ncan support them so they can better support themselves.\n  The bill clearly stipulates that the farm bill can support this type \nof education, and that students in these courses can continue to get \nfood assistance. This reinforcement of current policy is an opportunity \nfor the Department to work more closely with State agencies to \nestablish better connectivity with their State career and technical \nnetworks to strengthen energy and training programs. We want worker \ntraining programs that will help people learn the skills necessary to \nget the good paying job they want so they will no longer need SNAP \nbenefits. In the long run, this is a much better investment than \nsupporting programs that result in procedural sanctions that churn \nhouseholds on and off the program in the short run but do little to \nimprove self-sufficiency in the long run. Another provision tightens \neligibility policy to make sure that people who enjoy substantial \nlottery or gambling winnings are ineligible for SNAP and will not \nbecome eligible until such time as they meet the normal income and \nresource standards for SNAP. This provision responds to a few isolated \ninstances in which a SNAP recipient reaped a State lottery windfall. \nWhile such cases are extremely rare, we want to be certain that they \nare taken into account.\n  I expect that the Department will construct rules that will target \nthese extraordinary cases without burdening State agency workers and \nrecipients with unproductive reports. The first issue is how to define \n``substantial.'' I believe the intent of Congress was to identify \nreally extraordinary windfalls that change lifestyles, and not winnings \nthat reflect good fortune but will be rapidly dissipated by paying \nmajor bills or addressing overdue car or home repair issues.\n  Crucial to implementing this is how the State SNAP agency learns \nabout these winnings. This bill requires State SNAP agencies to work \nwith any in-State gaming authorities to establish a mechanism to report \nsubstantial winnings. We envision a process that will rely entirely on \nagency-to-agency reports. Our intent is twofold. First, the only truly \nreliable source of this information will be the State gaming or lottery \ncommission. It will offer much more dependable and authoritative \ninformation about winnings than recipient reports. Second, we want to \navoid cluttering notices on responsibilities for reporting and action \non changes with items about extraordinarily rare events such as a \nlottery windfall. This would run the risk of distracting participants \nfrom reporting much more frequent and important events such as changes \nin income and household membership. We want to maintain reporting \nrequirements that are sharp, clear, focused, and short. We do not \nintend for this provision to trigger any additional household reporting \nor require additional questions on application and certification forms.\n  Another issue is regaining eligibility for those who had enough \nwinnings to be disqualified from SNAP. The bill provides for applying \nthe regular financial eligibility standards to these households if they \napply for SNAP again. We intend this to mean the normal gross and net \nincome eligibility guidelines and the dollar-limited resource \neligibility thresholds specified in the Food and Nutrition Act, and \nexpect that normal verification rules will be applied.\n  The bill reinforces policy on the eligibility of felons. Felons \nfleeing from law enforcement or violating their parole or probation are \nineligible for SNAP. This bill highlights the ineligibility of those \nfelons convicted of crimes such as murder and armed robbery who violate \ntheir parole or probation. Ex-offenders who have completed their \nsentences and comply with any parole conditions placed on their \nrelease, and who are otherwise eligible for food assistance through \nSNAP, remain eligible for assistance. But persons on the run from \njustice after committing one of these crimes should not be eligible \nbased solely on technicalities about how the crimes are designated \nunder some jurisdiction's criminal code.\n  This provision should not affect current application procedures which \nask applicants about fleeing felon and probation violation issues. \nRather, we believe that eligibility workers must receive clear guidance \non especially serious crimes that should be treated as felonies.\n\n  The bill addresses program integrity concerns about multiple requests \nfor electronic benefit transfer, EBT, card replacements. EBT cards are \nroutinely replaced for a wide variety of valid reasons. State agencies \nneed to be able to quickly replace them so families can continue to buy \nfood. A small number of households frequently request replacement \ncards; we are concerned that a small subset of these households may be \nmisusing their cards and benefits. The bill aims to require States to \nseek explanations from households with an excessive number of card \nreplacement requests while preserving strong procedural protections for \nhouseholds. We envision it to work as follows: USDA is required to set \na standard for excessive requests for card replacements. I think that \nthe floor should not be fewer than 4 replacements over the course of a \nyear. States must seek explanations from households that exceed this \nthreshold as to why another card is needed prior to re-issuing a card. \nThe process must allow households the opportunity to immediately \nprovide the explanation because of the critical importance of \nmaintaining access to food assistance. Any delay in working with the \nhousehold freezes their food purchasing. I expect the Department to \nmonitor this process and examine how long households are going without \ncards. Even if a State's computer lists the household as eligible, if \nit cannot access its benefits, it might as well not be. Any policy that \ndenies a household effective food assistance should be treated as the \nequivalent of an eligibility cut-off.\n  Replacement cards can be needed for a wide range of legitimate \nreasons. Cards can be stolen, damaged, or simply lost. Some people may \nnot understand that the cards are reusable, or may confuse a PIN \nproblem with a card problem. Because some people are particularly \nvulnerable to these problems, this bill requires that rules will \nestablish protections for persons with disabilities, homeless persons, \nand crime victims. Some people with disabilities may require \naccommodations or authorized representatives.\n  The bill does not allow for using this process to suspend or \nterminate SNAP participation. Program rules spell out procedural \nstandards for acting on evidence of intentional program violations. \nThese standards enable State agencies to pursue recipient fraud in a \nmanner that protects the due process rights of the accused. If a State \nbelieves that its evidence about multiple card replacements indicates \nan intentional program violation, it must replace the card and use its \nestablished disqualification procedures such as administrative \ndisqualification hearings or court actions. It cannot force a household \nmember to submit to an interview in order to get access to its \nbenefits.\n  I want to highlight two areas where the bill provides more resources \nto improve program integrity. First, we are giving the Department more \nresources to enhance its retail store monitoring through more data \nmining and analysis. We recognize that the Department has been actively \nusing its data base of retailer transactions and want to enable more \nactivity in this area.\n  Second, we're authorizing funding for Federal-State partnerships to \nimplement pilot projects to combat trafficking. I expect that the \nDepartment will seek and select State agencies that demonstrate sound \nand fair procedures for determining fraud.\n  The bill has several provisions that I worked on that will better \nlink SNAP retailer policy to evolutions in retail technology and \nmarketing. The Secretary is authorized to test the use of mobile \ntechnologies in SNAP. This could really help SNAP customers shop at \nretailers such as farmers markets and vegetable stands that are unable \nto install traditional debit card machines but may be able to connect \nto smart\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\nphone applications. This provision was included in my Local Food, \nFarms, and Jobs Act. But as we expand ways to accept benefits, we must \nmaintain program integrity. That is why we are starting with a pilot \nproject to test mobile technology in SNAP, including protections for \nrecipients such as bans on any food price markups. We expect USDA to \ncarefully examine program integrity issues as part of a required \nfeasibility report, and would not expect any expansion of mobile \ntechnology unless the report shows a satisfactory level of integrity. \nThe Department needs rock solid means of ensuring that mobile devices \napproved for a seemingly legitimate retailer do not end up in \ndisqualified or other dishonest retailers' facilities.\n  This bill also allows pilot projects to test the feasibility of \nallowing the online purchase of food with SNAP benefits. More retailers \nare offering food delivery based on an online transaction. Food \ndelivery can make the program more accessible to individuals who may \nhave trouble getting out to shop. Again, any new way of redeeming \nbenefits must meet high program integrity standards. The bill specifies \nthat the Department must stop any growth of online transactions if we \ncan't achieve the strong level of integrity that we expect. While the \nprovision makes clear that delivery fees associated with online \npurchases may not be paid with SNAP benefits, I also expect USDA to set \nstandards for the fees to ensure no adverse effect on food security. If \nconsumers are paying an inordinate amount for delivery or other fees \nthis could undermine food security. Most SNAP recipients are expected \nto spend a considerable amount of their own money to buy a \nnutritionally adequate diet, and if they are paying large delivery fees \nthey may not be able to do that.\n  I would like to point out that in the mainstream retail environment \nthese new mobile and online technologies do not rely on photo \nidentification or other biometric information to authorize payments and \nmaintain integrity, nor do standard credit or debit card transactions. \nA longstanding principle of SNAP benefit use has been that the SNAP \nretail transaction should look like any other debit card transaction to \ncustomers and retailers. I am concerned that USDA has approved State \nrequirements for photos on SNAP cards to be presented at the point of \npurchase. This is not a condition for a regular credit or debit \ntransactions--in many if not most cases, cardholders swipe their own \ncards without handing them over to a cashier. The SNAP retail \nenvironment should be consistent with general practice. The \nDepartment's regulations provide that, and they ought to be enforced.\n  While benefits have been issued and used successfully through EBT \ncards for years, there have been a few instances when cards failed to \noperate. In the event of a natural disaster or a major crash of the EBT \nsystem, participants may be in even greater need of assistance and must \nbe able to use their benefits to purchase food. This requires the \ncapacity to quickly and efficiently issue manual vouchers to affected \nindividuals. We expect USDA to allow a switch to manual vouchers when \nEBT card use is undermined by major systems failures or natural \ndisasters. States must be able to understand the criteria for issuing \nvouchers so that they can act quickly when a problem threatens access \nto food assistance, such as the cancellation of cards affected by a \ndata breach.\n  The bill requires State agencies to use the Department of Homeland \nSecurity system to validate immigration status. This system--the \nSystematic Alien Verification for Entitlements--is already used by most \nState agencies. This bill does not change immigrant eligibility, or \nrequire anything new or different from applicants in the certification \nprocess.\n\n  The bill also requires States to have a system for verifying income \nand eligibility. SNAP has longstanding, rigorous, and specific \nverification standards. We intend that States have a system for \nverification and believe that all now do. We are not mandating the \nimposition of any specific matching requirements such as the match \nrequirements under section 1137 of the Social Security Act. These \nmatches were required 20 years ago and were not productive. We made \nthem optional in the 1996 welfare reform legislation and intend that \nthey remain optional. We expect States will employ verification systems \nthat employ timely and useful matches with reliable sources of data.\n  One of the most important measures in the bill is authority and \nfunding for pilot projects to enhance the Employment and Training \nProgram. This bill provides support for up to ten projects and a \nrigorous independent evaluation of the impact of the projects on SNAP \nreceipt, employment, and earnings.\n  I know that all of my colleagues share the goal of seeing more \nAmericans earning enough so they do not need SNAP. I believe that this \nis best achieved through strong work programs, and not arbitrarily \ncutting off food benefits to people who can't find jobs. People are not \nchoosing unemployment and SNAP over gainful employment. There simply \naren't enough jobs. The ratio of the number of unemployed persons to \nrelative to the number of job openings has been improving steadily but \nremains at historically high levels--about 3 unemployed people for \nevery job opening. As a comparison, when the recent recession started \nthis ratio was 1.8 unemployed people per job. So I think we need to do \nmore to help SNAP participants successfully compete for the increasing \nnumber of jobs that we hope will be there as the economy continues to \nrecover.\n  Employment and Training, E, has been a component of SNAP since \n1987, but very little is known about its efficacy. E has afforded \nStates substantial flexibility to design work programs and leverage \nFederal matching funds. The result has been a wide variation in the \ntypes and scope of services offered. While the most prevalent \ncomponents are job search and job search training, followed by \nworkfare, more States are offering career and technical education in \nrecognition that many SNAP participants need significant skill building \nand education. In terms of funding, some States invest substantial \namount of State funds to realize the Federal match, while many States \nrely exclusively on the 100 percent Federal grant to fund program \ncomponents. So we have a program with huge variations but we don't know \nwhat works. And because we are not confident that we are getting \nresults, fiscal support for the program has been tepid; the basic \nFederal grant was $75 million in 1987 and is only $79 million today.\n  What we do know is that SNAP reaches a very large number of \nemployable low-income people. E presents a real opportunity to reach \nthese Americans with better services. And this is a population we need \nto reach more effectively. A recent report by the Miller Center at the \nUniversity of Virginia shows that low-income workers were much less \nlikely to get skills training than better off workers. In other words, \nthe people who most need training the most are the least likely to get \nit. So we need to do a better job of reaching low-income workers with \ntraining opportunities, and make sure that the services offered can \nhelp people get ahead.\n  What we want to do here is test different approaches to work and \ntraining programs and find which produce the best results. For far too \nlong, we've reauthorized this program because we all want SNAP \nparticipants to be better off, but we haven't invested in learning if \nwe are succeeding or how we can do better.\n  We envision a comprehensive approach to choosing the pilot projects \nthat will incorporate a range of services and serve a range of SNAP \nrecipients with different needs. This does not mean that every pilot \nmust serve a wide range of participants with a wide range of services, \nbut rather that USDA will approve a group of pilot proposals that as a \nwhole will provide different services and reach different types of \nparticipants. The bill specifies that the pilots as a whole must reach \nable-bodied adults without dependents, people with low skills or very \nlimited work experience, and people who are already employed.\n  Current law requires State E programs to be coordinated with their \nstatewide workforce development systems. We expect that these pilots \nwill at least be coordinated, and hopefully leverage existing \ninfrastructure such as one-stop career centers and career and technical \neducation networks. The bill provides for contributing funds from \nFederal, State, or private sources.\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\n  I want to briefly touch on employed persons who get SNAP. These are \npeople who have shown that they can get a job but are not earning \nenough to make ends meet without help from SNAP. So we are interested \nin approaches that can help the working poor improve their \ncircumstances. While hopefully many people will earn enough to no \nlonger need or qualify for SNAP, others may increase their earned \nincome but remain eligible for a smaller SNAP benefit. But they will be \nbetter off, and program costs will be reduced.\n  In many cases, stronger work supports could enable people to get a \njob or work more hours at their current job. For example, if some \nparents had better childcare, they may be able to take jobs that offer \nlonger hours or better wages. Similarly, transportation support such as \nbus or transit passes may enable people to take a first job or get a \nbetter job. In many cases, people may be able to qualify for jobs \nwithout further training, but can't take the jobs because of issues \nlike child care. So I see work supports--particularly child care--as a \nvery promising E component that some pilot projects could support. I \nalso believe increasing the minimum wage will help low-wage workers, \nbut I will speak more on that issue at a later date.\n  Pilots may also test private sector employment as a component. This \nmay be subsidized or unsubsidized employment. We expect USDA to ensure \nthat any employment components adhere to the full range of worker \nprotection standards in the Food and Nutrition Act and in other laws on \nissues such as workplace safety and health, wages and hours, workman's \ncompensation, and family leave. In addition, the Department should \nexamine whether any additional protections are needed.\n  If employment components are presented as an E requirement, new \nissues arise around sanctions because the State agency may not know the \ncircumstances when an assignment does not work out. But the basic \nprinciple holds: no one should be sanctioned unless he or she willfully \nrefused an assignment without good cause. People may not be able to \nkeep up with jobs because of changes in schedules, transportation, \nchild care, or sometimes because they lack the skills that an employer \nwants. None of these situations should lead to a sanction. Current \nprogram rules have addressed situations such as transportation and \nchild care problems. In an employment component, a new issue arises if \npeople are dismissed for a lack of competence. There is a real \ndifference between refusing to work and not being able to work \ncompetently. If people are not working out in a job, maybe they need \nmore training. Maybe they would be better in a different job. They do \nnot deserve a sanction. We expect that State agencies--not employers--\nwill make these decisions based on policies set out by the Department \nthat address very specific criteria for when a sanction may be invoked \nin an employment component.\n\n  To get the best results from pilot projects, I think that individual \nassessment of participants is going to be important to get people in \nthe right component. Pilots need to assess people's work history, \neducation, skills, and child care and transportation situation to \nunderstand which component can help them the most. I expect the \nDepartment to examine assessment procedures as part of its monitoring. \nWe see a strong independent evaluation as critical to the success of \nthese pilots. The Department may use project funds for this purpose, as \nwell as for Federal costs of managing the projects and any evaluation \ncontracts. We expect that the evaluation will look at the impacts of \ndifferent interventions such as job search, workfare, vocational \ntraining, and remedial education on different types of SNAP recipients \nin different local labor markets. Most importantly, we expect that the \nstudy will identify impacts on SNAP receipt and impacts on employment \nand earnings, including whether reductions in SNAP are attributable to \nhigher earnings. The bill also allows the Department to authorize \nState-initiated reviews of their projects which can supplement the \nFederal evaluation.\n  I am pleased that these pilots strengthen the work component of SNAP \nwithout creating incentives to end assistance for people who can't find \nwork or curtailing the ability of States with struggling labor markets \neconomies to secure waivers of current time limits. Pilot participation \nby participants may be mandatory or voluntary. It is my understanding \nthat if participation is mandatory, an individual who fails to comply \nwith any work requirements may lose his or her SNAP benefits under the \nsame rules that would have applied if she or he committed the same acts \nwhile assigned to the E program instead of the pilot. As the bill \nauthorizes unsubsidized work as an allowable pilot activity for the \nfirst time, we expect the Secretary to issue guidance describing what I \nthink are very limited circumstances under which a working person who \nloses a job could be sanctioned. Only if a person willfully refuses to \ncontinue a job without good cause should sanction policy come into \nplay.\n  I turn now to some other modest improvements in program \nimplementation.\n  The bill requires State agencies to use the Department of Health and \nHuman Services' National Directory of New Hires to check on whether \nSNAP applicants have jobs. Currently States may use this data base to \ncheck on the employment of SNAP recipients. The bill requires States to \ncheck the National Directory data when a household applies for SNAP to \nenhance eligibility determinations. There is no expectation of matching \nduring the period of certification. We expect the Secretary to issue \nrules to set standards to ensure that State matching practices are \nefficient and effective. As an example, it would seem prudent to focus \nmatches on employable household members and not spend time and money on \nmatches with children, elderly, and disabled members. The Secretary \nshould work with the Department of Health and Human Services to fashion \nrules that balance the potential gains in payment accuracy with State \nadministrative costs.\n  More Federal programs are implementing standards for exchanging \ninformation in an automated environment. This bill requires SNAP to \ndevelop these standards. More electronic data exchanges can help both \nparticipants and administrators. However, the strong privacy and \nconfidentiality requirements of the Food and Nutrition Act must be \npreserved.\n  The bill tightens policy on using funds for program informational \nactivities while preserving the authority to get information out so \nthat people can make informed choices about the program. Let us review \na little history. In the 1996 welfare reform law, we prohibited using \nFederal funds for recruitment. The idea was that support for \ninformation about the availability of help for grocery bills was okay, \nbut we did not want to cross a line to persuade people to enroll if \nthey already had learned about the program and decided to forego \nbenefits.\n  Over the last decade, we have made enormous strides to extend food \nassistance to eligible families. USDA, States, and a wide range of \ncommunity organizations have worked hard to inform low-income people \nabout the availability of SNAP. And as we have changed the name of the \nprogram from the Food Stamp Program to the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program, and States have branded their own programs \ndifferently, the need to get out clear information has never been \ngreater. I want to commend USDA and its partners inside and outside \ngovernment for helping to make SNAP a more effective anti-hunger \nprogram. In this bill we have drawn some bright lines for the Secretary \nto use in funding information efforts. First, no support for \npartnerships with foreign governments. Second, no contracts based on \n``bounties'' that tie compensation to the number of people enrolled. \nAnd finally, re-affirmation that recruitment is not a legitimate \nactivity for SNAP funding. I think the first points are clear and want \nto expand on the last one. Giving people information about the \navailability and benefits of the program to enable them to make \ninformed choices about managing family food budgets to put enough food \non the table is a legitimate use of Federal funds. If it crosses over \ninto pushing people who have made an informed choice not to apply to \napply, then we have a recruitment situation that the Conferees do not \nsupport. As long as households have\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\nthe knowledge and access to participate if they so desire, what they \nactually decide is up to them.\n  Providing positive information about the program and why or how to \napply or assisting them in navigating a complex application process is \nnot recruitment and remains an allowable activity and cost. We expect \nSNAP to continue to provide people with the information they need to \nmake informed decisions about participation, while ensuring that all \nfunds for public information are used responsibly and judiciously.\n  Finally, I would like to raise a problem about issuance that this \nlegislation does not address--because we thought that earlier \nlegislation did. Staggered issuance refers to spreading the issuance \ndates for loading benefits on to EBT cards over a period of time--\ngenerally 10 but sometimes 15 days or more. This way you don't have so \nmany SNAP households shopping on the same day. It benefits both \nretailers and their customers because stores are less crowded. The Food \nand Nutrition Act provides two key participant safeguards when a State \nagency moves to staggered issuance: first, no household can go beyond \n40 days without an allotment, and, second, no household's allotment may \nbe reduced for any period. I have become aware that the Department has \nbeen approving plans that recognize only one of these provisions; plans \nsimply extend some households for 40 days between issuances. This means \nthat an allotment designed to cover 30 days must now cover 40 days. \nBenefits are simply inadequate to stretch this far.\n  When a 30 day benefit must be stretched over 40 days, the daily \nbenefit is clearly reduced. And since we eat every day, the daily \nbenefit is a meaningful measure of benefit reduction. I am troubled \nthat this important protection in issuance law is seemingly being \nignored, and urge the Department to re-examine this situation and \nrequire supplemental issuances when States are implementing staggered \nissuance. Staggered issuance should be beneficial to all concerned. It \nshould not increase hunger during transition months. Referrals to food \nbanks during those months are a poor use of food bank resources and \ncompletely unnecessary given the act's requirement that households not \nsuffer a loss of benefits--which having to stretch the same allotment \nover a longer period certainly is. Food banks are already being \nstretched thin and it should not be policy for SNAP recipients to rely \non local food banks because benefits are stretched over this longer \ntime period.\n  All in all, this farm bill represents 2 years of hard work by both \nAgricultural Committees. The nutrition title is not my ideal; the \nbenefit reductions obtained by requiring significant utility assistance \nin order to qualify for the standard utility allowance will be painful \nfor those households affected by it. But I believe it is a narrowly \ntargeted way of strengthening the program, and with other modest \nimprovements, makes the title worth supporting. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding Senator Bennet is \ngoing to be due here shortly. I should be done by that time and ask \nunanimous consent that I take about 15 minutes of Senator Cornyn's \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, January 2014 may go down on record as the \ncoldest of the months in United States history. Between the freezing \ntemperatures from last week's polar vortex storms, much of the Nation \nexperienced record cold weather at least once or twice, and this has \nbeen going on now for the last 3 years. While we won't have official \nnationwide temperature data for January for a few more weeks, we do \nhave preliminary figures. Throughout the entire month, over 2,387 daily \ncold temperature records were set around the country, and many of those \nwere in my State of Oklahoma. At least 49 of these daily records \noccurred on January 6 and 7 when the first round of the polar vortex \nhit. In Tulsa yesterday it went down to 2 below zero. That was a \nrecordbreaker--that had held since 1912. That was the last time it got \nthat cold. The same day in Enid, OK, it got down to minus 3. In \nBartlesville--and this may be wrong, but the figure showed it was \nactually minus 14, making it even colder than the South Pole, where it \nwas only minus 11.\n  The cold weather is continuing into February. Many schools canceled \nclasses today around the State of Oklahoma because of the cold weather. \nIt snowed more than 2\\1/2\\ inches in Tulsa yesterday, 5.2 inches in \nHenryetta, just south of Tulsa.\n  There was an article in the Daily Oklahoman. They have a great zoo \nover there, but they reported that the grizzly bears refused to go \noutside their habitat yesterday because it was too cold.\n  I know many in the media cry foul when I talk about global warming \nwhen it gets cold outside, but is this really any different from the \nPresident talking about global warming on a hot day in June of last \nyear when he announced his climate action plan? No one seemed to mind \nthat, but there seems to be a different set of rules when we talk about \nhow cold it has been, which it has been for the last 3 years.\n  When we experience extreme cold like we have had the last few weeks, \neveryone in their right mind takes a step back and wonders if global \nwarming is really happening. When you look at the facts, you just have \nto wonder. Consider this quote from the journal Nature, which stated \nthat over the last 15 years, ``the observed [temperature] trend is . . \n. not significantly different from zero [and] suggests a temporary \n`hiatus' in global warming.''\n  This is something that has been a pattern for a long period of time. \nI can recall--and I am going from memory now--from the time they \nstarted keeping these temperatures, we started the first cold spell of \nrecent history in 1895, and that lasted until 1918; 1918 turned into \nanother warming area that went to 1945; and 1945 to 1975 was again \nanother cooling spell and, of course, from 1975 to 2000. So we know \nwhat has been happening.\n  The President has not acknowledged this fact. In fact, on multiple \noccasions he has said--and this is something he has said over and \nover--``the temperature around the globe is increasing faster than was \npredicted even 10 years ago.'' Unfortunately for his talking points, \nthe data that has been reported in Nature magazine, the Economist, and \neven in the United Nations IPCC report shows that is just simply not \ntrue.\n  Two weeks ago, in a hearing we had in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, my friend Senator Sessions pressed EPA Administrator \nGina McCarthy on this point, asking her whether the President's \nstatement was true. Ultimately, after running around the question for a \nfew minutes, she said, ``I can't answer that.'' You may not think this \nis an important fact, but it is. The President's entire climate action \nplan and efforts to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases \nare built fully on the fact that global warming is happening and that \nwe are all going to die if we don't do something about it.\n  What we all need to be aware of is that the impact of the President's \nclimate action plan, when implemented, will be stunning. It will \ncompletely adopt global warming policies and the implementation of \nregulations like cap and trade. The President has already done a \nstunning amount of this work already. We have been able to uncover that \nin the first 4 years he was in office, he actually spent--and people \nare not aware of this--$110 billion of taxpayer money on global \nwarming-related activities.\n  The cap-and-trade legislation we have debated over the last 10 years \ncarries a price tag of $300 billion to $400 billion a year. It would \nhave been the largest tax increase in American history. It was soundly \ndefeated--a bill in the Senate--but through the climate action plan the \nPresident is now trying to accomplish by regulation what he couldn't \nachieve through legislation.\n  We have heard the term ``the imperial President'' being used \nrecently.\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\nWell, listen to what was stated in the State of the Union Message, and \nthese are the words he used: ``We are going to set new standards on \ncarbon pollution from power plants.'' What he is saying is this: We \ncouldn't pass it for 12 years with four bills to do that. We can't get \nmore than 25 percent of the Members to vote for it, so we are going to \ndo it through regulation.\n  The first round of greenhouse gas regulations was proposed in the \nfirst week in January. These regulations, if finalized, would impose \nstrict regulations on new powerplants that would make it impossible to \nbuild a coal-fired powerplant. You may wonder: Do we really need coal \nanymore with all the new energy we have coming onto the market, with \nthe natural gas and the shale deposits and all that? The answer is yes.\n  Before I go into that discussion, I think it is important to point \nout a problem with the timing of the new rules proposal. I had a chart \nhere--I don't have it with me right now--that showed that when I was \nranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee--and this \nwould have been way back in October 2012--we released a report \nhighlighting the administration's actions to delay the finalization of \ncostly environmental regulations until after the 2012 Presidential \nelections. Whether it was the farm dust rule or the ozone standard, the \nPresident punted regulation after regulation until after the election \nto minimize the influence it would have on voters. It appears that is \nexactly what is happening today with the first round of greenhouse gas \nregulations for the construction of new powerplants.\n  As we know, under the Clean Air Act new rules for powerplants must be \nfinalized within 1 year of the proposal's publication in the Federal \nRegister--that is what kicks it off, when it is written in the Federal \nRegister--or the proposed rule is invalidated. This is important \nbecause after announcing his climate action plan, the President ordered \nthe EPA to ``issue a new proposal by no later than September 20, \n2013.'' The EPA proposed a new rule on September 20, but it did not \npublish in the Federal Register until January 8, 2014--this past \nJanuary. Had the EPA published this rule in the Register on the same \nday they proposed it on September 20, 2013, they would have been forced \nto finalize the rule by September 20, 2014, which would be 6 weeks \nbefore the 2014 elections.\n  This reveals an astounding double standard and is consistent with the \nremarks made at the State of the Union. On the one hand, the President \nsays we don't have time to delay action on global warming. He says we \nmust act before it is too late. But on the other hand, his actions show \nthat it is OK to wait to finalize rules that will harm the economy \nuntil after the elections. Ultimately, this hypocrisy reveals that the \nadministration is fully aware that the EPA's greenhouse gas regulations \nwill put a drag on the economy, and now that we are starting to see \nstrains of our electricity markets develop, the cost is becoming real \nto consumers.\n\n  Consider American Electric Power, one of the country's largest \nelectric companies. They are the ones that actually supply the power \nfor my State of Oklahoma. Last week, during the recent cold weather, \nthey reported they were running 89 percent of the coal generation they \nscheduled to retire in 2015. But these coal-fired powerplants, which \nwere critical to keeping homes all around the country warm during these \ncold temperatures, are going to be shut down because of President \nObama's environmental regulations.\n  American Electric Power said: What it should make everyone think \nabout is, what are we going to do when the generation is not available? \nWe need to be thinking about reliability and resilience in extreme \ntimes, not just the status quo.\n  If this recent cold weather occurs again in a year or two from now, \nonce these plants are shut down, there simply will not be enough \nelectricity available to keep homes and businesses warm. If cold \nweather pushes electricity demand up to the point where remaining \npowerplants are overloaded--the ones that haven't been shut down by the \nPresident--it could result in massive blackouts, and when Americans \nneed their electricity it won't be there. It would be as if we were \nliving in the 1600s and everyone will be cold. Again, the annual cost \nof this would be in excess of $300 billion to $400 billion that would \nbe a hit on the GDP. And this does not even begin to measure the \nsuffering we would have to experience.\n  The President, as he has done with ObamaCare, may just say that these \nplants can stay open, that he won't enforce these new rules he is \ncreating, but I don't think that is realistic. American Electric \nPower's warning comes in the wake of regulations the President has \nalready finalized. The new ones that are being developed will make \nthings even worse by making coal-fired powerplants impossible to build \nor keep open. What has been a steady source of cheap electricity will \nbe gone in just a few short years.\n  I have long said the Clean Air Act was never intended to regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions; it was written only to include the most \negregious, harmful air pollutants, not carbon dioxide and other \nharmless greenhouse gases.\n  Surprisingly, even some Democrats are starting to publicly agree with \nme. Last week, at an Energy and Commerce Committee meeting over in the \nHouse, Congressman John Dingell from Michigan, a staunch Democrat, \nsaid, ``Like most members of this committee, I think the Supreme Court \ncame up with a very much erroneous decision on whether the Clean Air \nAct covers greenhouse gases. Like many members of this committee, I was \npresent when we wrote that legislation, and we thought it was clear \nenough that we didn't clarify it, thinking that even the Supreme Court \nwas not stupid enough to make that finding.''\n  That is a direct quote from John Dingell. So I wish the Supreme Court \nwould have sided with Congressman Dingell.\n  As things now stand, the EPA is poised to put the Nation out of \nbusiness with greenhouse gas regulations that would cost the entire \neconomy some $300 billion to $400 billion.\n  Every year I always calculate the number of people in my State of \nOklahoma who file Federal income taxes. This $300 billion to $400 \nbillion cost would mean about $3,000 per family of those who file \nFederal income tax returns. So it is a huge amount, and it would be the \nlargest tax increase in history. Out of this concern, I am introducing \na commonsense bill today, the Electricity Reliability and Affordability \nAct, which will allow States to keep their powerplants open if they \nbelieve it is necessary to maintain electricity, reliability, and \naffordability. In other words, the States can opt out.\n  American Electric Power's announcement should cause all of us great \nconcern, but the EPA is not listening. States have long protected and \nconserved their environments with great success, and State governments \nare in a much better position to determine which powerplants should and \nshould not remain open, despite the regulations.\n  I know my friend from Colorado is waiting to take the floor, so the \nlast thing I will say is that in the State of the Union Message, the \nPresident made the statement that he is going to go ahead and do this, \nregardless of the fact that we have killed this legislation four times \nover the last 12 years. And at that time, I was talking about $300 \nbillion to $400 billion as the cost, but that would have been the cost \nif this had been legislation. Specifically, talking about legislation \nsuch as the Lieberman-Warner act and several of the others, that would \nregulate sources with at least 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions. \nHowever, if you do it by regulation and not legislation, that would \nhave to be under the Clean Air Act, which would regulate systems of 250 \ntons of CO2 a year. So while the legislation would have \nregulated the CO2 emissions for powerplants, refineries, and \nmajor factories, if the President is able to do it through regulations, \nthat would cover every school, every church, and every apartment house \nin the Nation. So it is very significant.\n  I know that right now we are on the farm bill, but we have to remind \npeople that this is something that has been just announced that they \nare going to be doing.\n  I remember when Lisa Jackson was the Director of the EPA. She was \nappointed by President Obama. I asked her the question: If we are to \nregulate this and one of these bills would pass,\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\nwhich means we would be regulating CO2 emissions, would this \nhave the effect of reducing CO2 worldwide?\n  She said: No, because that would only apply to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  That is not where the problem is. The problem is in China, India, in \nMexico, and other places.\n  So I remind my fellow Members this is something very serious and \nworthy of consideration at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for \nyielding.\n  I wish to speak about the farm bill which, thanks to months and \nmonths and actually years of tireless work by Chairwoman Stabenow, \nRanking Member Cochran, and other conferees on the bill, Democrats and \nRepublicans in both Houses of Congress--thanks to all of this work, we \nare going to be able to pass this bill this afternoon.\n  There are 16 million people working in agriculture in our country. \nThese workers and our rural communities are demanding the certainty \nwhich comes with a long-term bill. I am pleased to say we are passing \nnot a 2-month extension, not a 10-minute extension, not an ``I hope we \nget it done tomorrow before we leave town'' extension but a genuine 5-\nyear farm bill, which is going to give us a lot of certainty.\n  This bill eliminates direct payments made to farmers regardless of \nmarket conditions or what they planted and prioritizes what is working \nfor producers; namely, crop insurance.\n  I have spoken on the floor before about Colorado's battle against \nhistoric drought conditions. Some of our farmers lost half their corn \nyields in 2012. It is hard to imagine any business losing half its \nproduction in 1 year, but that is what has happened to many Colorado \ncorn producers. Mr. President, 2013 was a little better for corn in our \nState, but it is hard to celebrate when producers still face \nsignificant losses fighting against this dry soil. The Crop Insurance \nProgram is what is keeping these farmers and rural economies in \nbusiness during these tough times. That is why it is a priority.\n  That is why we should have passed it 1 year ago, 2 years ago, but \ntoday we finally have the chance to do it.\n  Beyond crop insurance, another key highlight of this bill is its \nconservation title. I spoke last week on the floor about the revamped \neasement programs, and the important linkage between conservation \npractices and crop insurance which has been preserved in this \nconference agreement.\n  But beyond those highlights, the bill places a new emphasis on water \nconservation, which is so important to the West. Programs such as EQIP \nand the Regional Conservation Partnerships Program are going to be \ncritical as the West faces record drought conditions brought on by \nclimate change. New conservation tools, coupled with crop insurance to \nhelp hedge risk, will help our producers as we move into a new normal \nof a drier American West.\n  The conservation title programs help producers, but they also help \nthe fish in our rivers and the wildlife on our lands.\n  Here is a great illustration of why sportsmen groups support this \nbill. This is a photo taken of my friend John Gale hunting pheasants in \nYuma County, CO. The Conservation Reserve Program, CRP--a program \nreauthorized through this farm bill--provides important habitat for \npheasants and other upland birds all across the country. The land \nsurrounding this photo is all CRP land.\n  The program protects habitat but also helps hold highly erodible \nsoils in place--such as the soil in Baca County, CO, where over 250,000 \nacres are enrolled in CRP. As the Presiding Officer may know, Baca \nCounty in many ways was the epicenter of the area devastated by the \nDust Bowl of the 1930s. Thanks to CRP, Baca County has weathered recent \ndroughts a lot better than their forefathers did. Healthy grasslands, \nopen landscapes, and abundant wildlife are a fundamental part of the \nWest, to be a part of the West, and we need to preserve those \ngrasslands, those open spaces, and our species. That is what the \nconservation title of the farm bill does. A lot of people don't know \nabout it, but it is a very important part of the farm bill.\n  As a result, this farm bill is supported by over 250 conservation and \nenvironmental organizations--groups such as Ducks Unlimited, Pheasants \nForever, National Wildlife Federation, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, \nand the National Rifle Association, among others.\n  This legislation not only ensures we have healthy croplands and \ngrasslands but also prioritizes the health of our forests--an issue of \nhuge importance to western States as we deal with our massive \nwildfires.\n  Here we can see the Waldo Canyon fire from 2012. I chair the \nagriculture subcommittee on forestry, and we held a hearing on \nwildfires not too long ago. We looked at the terrible fires which have \nraged across the West, the budgetary nightmare they have caused, and \nWashington's inability to understand what we are actually facing out \nthere. My clearest takeaway from this hearing was that when it comes to \nour forests, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n  If we prioritize the fuel mitigation work on the front end, we will \nsave on fire suppression and recovery costs on the back end. If we \ndon't, we will break our budget and not preserve our forests. The \nCongressional Budget Office has found that for every $1 we invest in \nforest health, we save $5 in costs associated with wildfire.\n  This farm bill conference report makes these investments and gives \nthe Forest Service new tools to treat areas in need of restoration and \nmitigation. This bill makes commonsense reforms, reduces the deficit, \nand will bring certainty and continued prosperity to rural America. It \npassed the House last week with broad bipartisan support.\n  I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote when we vote on the farm bill \nconference report later today. With all the uncertainty our farmers and \nranchers are facing in these tough times, in these drought times, it is \nthe least we can do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nColorado for his words about the farm bill. He and I are an example of \nhow this bill is important to every region of the country. His kind of \nfarming is very different than our kind of farming, but they are \nequally important to our States.\n  I rise to talk about the farm bill. This bill is a long time coming. \nThere has been back-and-forth between the two Chambers, the House and \nSenate, and between various regions, probably most famous, South versus \nMidwest farming, but that is not the only one--different types of crops \nand different types of farm products. It may be sugar, milk, soybeans \nor corn. Who knows what it is going to be.\n  Nonetheless, I am happy to report that finally this bill overcame the \npartisan gridlock we have seen in Washington. I am sorry it took so \nlong. I know last year the House basically blew up this bill on kind of \n``my way or the highway'' politics. I thought that was very \nunfortunate. But here we are with a bipartisan farm bill, one that got \na huge vote in the House and I hope will get a huge vote in the Senate.\n  I am glad this cut, cut, cut ideology did not prevail, because when \nwe look at this bill and how important it is, not just to my State but \nto every State in the Union and so important to the U.S. economy--this \nbill is very important to the Nation's economy and to the future of our \nNation.\n  Agriculture is something we do in this country better than anybody \nelse in the world. We do a lot of things great in this country, and we \nshould be proud of those, but no one does agriculture better than the \ngood old United States of America. Our farmers, our producers, our \nagribusiness do incredible work. We literally are the envy of the \nworld. It is a core strength of the U.S. economy.\n  It is critical to keeping our Nation's economy strong that we have a \nstrong agricultural sector. It is critical to our Nation that we have \nstrong rural communities and to a large extent--not completely but a \nlot of what this bill is about is helping rural communities.\n  Not everyone in this country lives in the big cities or lives in the \nsuburbs. This bill will help every American in lots of ways, no matter \nwhere they live, whether they live in the biggest city in the country \nor the smallest town out in the countryside. But it will\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\nalso help millions and millions of hard-working people and their \nfamilies in rural America. Why in the world would we want to let \nideological fights and partisan bickering jeopardize this economic \npowerhouse we built for ourselves? Nonetheless, today we have overcome \nthat.\n  This legislation is a win-win for everyone. We have seen Democrats \nand Republicans from all regions of the country come to the floor to \ntalk about this farm bill, why it is important to them and why it is \nimportant that it pass.\n  Just a few of the provisions in there:\n  There are market protections for our farmers and ranchers all over \nthe country.\n  The PILT Program is so critical to a number of western States but \ncertainly a number of our counties in Arkansas. We have counties in our \nState where literally half or more of their land is Federal. They can't \nget any tax base off of it, so PILT helps to fix that.\n  The Catfish Inspection Program. We don't subsidize catfish, but we \nhave the inspection program to make sure imported catfish meet U.S. \nstandards. This is critical. We want a safe and good food supply. There \nis a big emphasis on exports. We all know we have a terrible trade \ndeficit. Our trade deficit would be horrendous if it wasn't for \nagriculture.\n  Of course, there is nutritional assistance for hard-working families \nin this country. We have the richest, most bountiful, most blessed \nNation in the history of the world, and we have people who are hungry. \nThese nutrition programs in many cases are the difference between life \nand death.\n  This bill also focuses on conservation. Not everyone is a farmer, but \nthere are millions of people all over this country who love to enjoy \nthe great outdoors. They like to go hunting, they like to go fishing, \nand other activities. Conservation programs are critical to keep \nhabitat where it is and critical for large sections of our economy. \nHunting and fishing is a huge part of our economy, not just in Arkansas \nbut all over the country.\n  The rural development programs are essential for rural America. We \nknow there is everything from wastewater programs in here to rural \nhousing, to all kinds of programs. But rural development programs are \ncritical for the quality of life in rural America.\n  I am the first to say this bill isn't perfect. I think all of us \nagree this is a series of compromises. There are probably things each \none of us would do differently if we could change a provision or two in \nthe bill, but it is a good bill. It is going to provide and stabilize \ngood jobs and economic security for our country.\n  Our agricultural producers not only feed us and clothe us, but they \nfeed and clothe the world. In the Senate we hear every day from the \nbusiness community. They want more certainty. They want more stability. \nThis bill provides that in the agricultural economy. Our farmers, \nproducers, and others deserve that same certainty and stability, and \nthis bill provides that.\n  In closing, I would read a quick passage from James 5:7. I was going \nto read it from King James, but I will paraphrase it. Be patient, \ntherefore, brothers . . . see how the farmer waits for the precious \nfruit of the Earth, being patient about it, until it receives the early \nand late rains.\n  Our agricultural producers have been patient long enough. They have \nwaited and waited and waited on this legislation. I sincerely hope all \nof us will give this bill strong consideration. This bill provides good \ncommon ground. It provides economic security. It continues the safe and \nabundant food supply that we have in this Nation.\n  I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will join me in voting yes \nfor this conference report today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          Milk Pricing Formula\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Michigan, her \ncommittee and staff for their tireless work that has brought this farm \nbill to fruition. Further, I greatly appreciate the Senator's \nwillingness to discuss an issue that is absolutely critical for dairy \nfarmers in the Northeast: prehearings to review the Federal pricing \nformula for class III and class IV milk.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I want to thank the Senator from Maine. This \nlegislation addresses many aspects of agriculture including dairy. \nDuring our deliberations we heard clearly from various dairy \nstakeholders who argued that the class III and class IV milk product \npricing systems are outdated and not responsive to the needs of \nproducers or consumers.\n  Mr. KING. The senior Senator from Maine and the junior Senator from \nNew York authored the provision included in the Senate farm bill which \nrequired USDA to address the pricing formula for class III and class IV \nmilk through a public, transparent prehearing process. Their work has \nbeen essential in moving this conversation forward.\n  As the Senator from Michigan well knows, milk pricing policy is a \ncomplex, convoluted, and controversial business and challenging to \nhandle in a package such as the farm bill. Does the Senator believe \nthat the USDA, which is charged with stabilizing farm income; \nconserving soil, water, and other natural resources, and ensuring the \navailability and quality of food and fiber products, should provide an \nopportunity for a thoughtful, balanced process for addressing essential \ndairy pricing structure?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, the USDA has the economists and experts that can \nanalyze various alternatives to the current system of pricing milk--and \nif the system is not working well for most of the players in the dairy \nindustry, especially the farmers, the Department should make changes. A \npublic, thoughtful and thorough discussion of those alternatives needs \nto take place, guided by nonbiased people who are focused on the goal \nof creating the best policy.\n  Mr. KING. I thank the Senator for her response. The dairy producers \nin Maine have told me that they believe that it will take just such a \nthorough review of proposals from interested parties, to help address \nconcerns from industry, assist with the stabilization of the price of \nmilk and provide greater certainty for dairy producers.\n  Does the Senator agree that the Secretary has the authority and \nability to conduct a prehearing procedure to consider alternative \npricing formulas for class III and class IV milk products?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, I believe that not only does the Secretary have \nthe authority to act upon a petition, but as was said earlier, the USDA \nhas the ability to conduct a thoroughly researched prehearing procedure \nto consider alternative pricing formulas for class III and class IV \nmilk products and that would be welcomed by the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  Mr. KING. I understand that the Dairy Industry Advisory Committee has \nrecommended that the Secretary take such action and review interested \nparty proposals to address class III and class IV pricing formula \nchanges in a participatory and transparent manner.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, that is correct; the Dairy Industry Advisory \nCommittee has recommended such action. Further, I believe that a study \nof pricing alternatives, followed by a rigorous prehearing process, \nwould cut to the heart of the issue. This would not only clear the air \non many of the disagreements that plagued the farm bill debates but \nmight even reduce the reliance on temporary stopgap government supports \nthrough better financial connections for all sectors of the dairy \nindustry with the consumer value of dairy products.\n  Mr. KING. The dairy producers that I have spoken with are calling on \nthe USDA Secretary to undertake a study of alternatives and to agree to \nhold prehearings on such alternatives as a basic component of the \nUSDA's fundamental mission to the dairy industry. They believe it is \ntime for Congress to direct the USDA to take the bull by the horns and \nto ensure that all regions of the United States can sustain viable \ndairy sectors and meet local, national and international demand for \nhigh quality U.S. dairy products.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am happy to assist dairy farmers in their efforts and \nwill contact the Secretary to ask that he take action on a prehearing \nrequest.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today, I will vote nay on the Agricultural \nAct of 2014, also known as the farm bill.\n  Florida's economy and the livelihoods of many family-owned businesses \nand workers rely on a vibrant agricultural industry. Unfortunately, \nthis farm bill goes far beyond agricultural\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\nprograms and includes antipoverty programs and renewable energy \nprograms, among other spending measures that total nearly $1 trillion.\n  With Washington facing a $17 trillion debt and another debt ceiling \nincrease in a few weeks, this bill does not undertake any fundamental \nreforms to ensure every taxpayer dollar is being properly spent to \nsecure our Nation's food supply instead of needlessly growing \ngovernment or continuing the status quo on programs that need reform.\n  For example, Food Stamp Programs are an important part of our safety \nnet, but we should have a separate debate on these and other \nantipoverty programs with the goal of empowering States to better \ndesign these programs to help their people escape poverty.\n  While energy innovation is an important debate and will be a key \neconomic growth driver in the 21st century, we should be discussing \nrenewable energy and biofuels programs in the context of energy policy, \nnot lumping them in to this bill that is supposed to be about securing \nour Nation's food supply.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, today we will pass the final conference \nreport for the farm bill, called the Federal Agriculture Reform and \nRisk Management Act of 2013. This important bipartisan bill protects \njobs and identifies new reforms that will ensure the long-term success \nof our Nation's agricultural industry. I would like to thank Chairman \nStabenow for her leadership and commitment to getting this bill passed. \nIn addition, I would like to thank Senator Cochran for his work on this \nbipartisan bill.\n  The U.S. citrus industry is facing a devastating disease called \ngreening, for which we know no cure and which kills the citrus tree \nwithin 5 years. The disease is spread by an insect called the Asian \ncitrus psyllid. Citrus greening spreads quickly and, because of its \ndormancy period, has often already destroyed surrounding groves once it \nhas been discovered.\n  In a 2012 report, University of Florida researchers found that the \ndisease cost Florida's economy $4.5 billion and 8,000 jobs between 2006 \nand 2012. Florida was ground zero, but the disease is spreading to \nevery citrus-producing State, including Texas, California, and Arizona. \nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has already affirmed this emergency \nwith the citrus quarantine for Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Hawaii, \nLouisiana, and Mississippi as well as parts of California, South \nCarolina, and Arizona in October 2012. If we don't do something, soon \nwe won't have a domestic citrus industry.\n  The farm bill sets up a new research initiative especially for the \ncitrus industry within the existing Special Crop Research Initiative, \nwhich is called the Citrus Disease Research and Extension Program. The \nprimary goal of this program is to help fund research to find a cure to \ncitrus greening and save the U.S. citrus industry.\n  The new Citrus Disease Research and Extension Program will ensure the \nclose collaboration between the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the \ncitrus industry stakeholders, and the relevant entities engaged in \nscientific research under this program. The farm bill directs the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to consult closely and regularly with the \nindustry stakeholders in the formulation, consideration, and approval \nof research projects and grants performed under this program and will \ngive great weight to input from these stakeholders. This close \ncoordination will ensure the research program will advance the research \nfor citrus greening and other threats to the U.S. citrus industry.\n  Because of the devastating nature of the citrus greening disease, I \nworked to make sure the citrus program established guaranteed funding \nin the farm bill. Senator Stabenow agreed and worked with other members \nof the farm bill conference to include $125 million in mandatory \nfunding for the citrus research program. Money in this grant program \nwill go toward scientific research aimed at addressing diseases, \ndomestic and invasive pests, and other challenges to the U.S. citrus \nindustry, helping to also disseminate the research findings to growers.\n  In this age of economic uncertainty, Congress should be doing \neverything it can to improve our economic situation. In this case, we \nare doing just that by saving an industry that is vital to not only \nFlorida's economy but to Texas, California, Louisiana, Alabama, \nArizona, Georgia, and the Nation as a whole.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, while this is far from a perfect bill, I \nam pleased that the Senate will pass the Agriculture Act of 2014. This \nlegislation--a result of more than 2 years of deliberation--reaches a \ncompromise that protects small farmers, fights hunger, and saves \ntaxpayers more than $16 billion.\n  I thank Chairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member Cochran, along with \nleaders in the House of Representatives, for their hard work in \nreaching this agreement.\n  This year's farm bill makes targeted investments in our Nation's \nagricultural and nutrition sectors while eliminating some of the \nwasteful subsidies that cost taxpayers billions of dollars. The bill \nsupports our rural economies and helps protect our farmland and forests \nfor generations to come. And it makes historic investments in fruit and \nvegetable farming and in organic agriculture.\n  During negotiations on this bill, I worked with Chairwoman Stabenow \nand Senator Leahy to ensure that new dairy programs will adequately \nprotect New Hampshire's small farms, which are struggling to deal with \nhigh feed costs and volatility in milk prices. I am hopeful that the \nnew dairy program will provide stability for New Hampshire's dairies \nand create an environment in which these family-owned businesses that \nare so important to our State's economy can grow and thrive.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference report includes \nlanguage nearly identical to my bipartisan legislation, the Oilheat \nEfficiency, Renewable Fuel Research and Jobs Training Act.\n  This important provision will reauthorize the widely supported \nNational Oilheat Research Alliance, NORA, the oilheat industry's \nnational program for research and development, consumer education and \ntechnical training. It will allow the industry to continue funding \nvital national oilheat efforts for 5 years--at no cost to local, State \nor Federal governments.\n  Consumers will benefit from the development of improved and efficient \nequipment, increased safety through technical training, and the \navailability of up-to-date information regarding safety practices and \nfuel conservation. Importantly, these objectives will be achieved \nwithout raising consumer costs. NORA provides a direct path for \nresponsible, domestically produced and efficient energy consumption \nwithout raising consumer costs. Its inclusion in the farm bill is good \nfor consumers, American businesses, and the environment and will \nprovide tangible value for the country for many years to come.\n  I also thank Chairwoman Stabenow and Senator Wyden for working with \nme to preserve the Environmental Protection Agency's treatment of \nregulating forest roads as nonpoint sources through State-adopted best-\nmanagement practices. This approach will allow for the continued \nsustainable development of working forests in New Hampshire.\n  In New Hampshire, more than 100,000 people rely on the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program each month to keep from going hungry. The \nfarm bill reauthorizes SNAP and other critical programs that help \nmillions of American families put food on the table. The bill also \ncontains important reforms that will provide food for our Nation's food \nbanks and improve low-income Americans' access to fruits and vegetables \nand other healthy foods.\n  The legislation also improves consumer access to local foods with \nincreased funding for farmers' markets. In recent years, interest in \nsupporting local agriculture has grown significantly. New Hampshire \ncurrently has more than 70 farmers markets across the State, with \nnearly 30 open through the winter. Americans want to know where their \nfood comes from, and farmers want to be able to sell their products in \ntheir communities.\n  The farm bill significantly increases funding for programs that \nsupport small and beginning farmers, including greater support for \ngrant programs that enable small farmers to invest in improving the \nvalue of their products.\n  One dairy farmer from Landaff, NH, accessed these programs to help \nher grow her cheese-making business. Because of the grant, she was able \nto hire two full-time employees and several\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\npart-time employees, and her second-generation farm now sells award-\nwinning cheeses in stores and restaurants around the country. These are \nthe kind of job-creating investments we need to be making in rural \nAmerica.\n  However, while the legislation implements some reforms to subsidy \nprograms that will save taxpayer dollars, it does not go far enough in \ncutting wasteful spending.\n  Senator McCain and I worked to repeal a duplicative catfish \ninspection program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has \nalready cost taxpayers $20 million over the past 5 years and has yet to \ninspect a single fish. Unfortunately, this bill does nothing to end \nthis unnecessary and wasteful program.\n  I am also disappointed that this bill continues the Federal Sugar \nProgram with no changes. Taxpayers were forced to pay nearly $300 \nmillion last year to bail out the sugar industry, in addition to the \n$14 billion this wasteful program has cost consumers and businesses \nover the past 5 years. The high price supports and strict trade \nrestrictions continued with no reform in this bill will ensure that \nsugar remains the most tightly controlled commodity in America.\n  This bill also continues the wasteful practice of providing subsidies \nto large and wealthy farm businesses with no meaningful payment limits. \nSome programs in the bill will allow huge farming operations to receive \nunlimited subsidies, and the new crop insurance program includes no \nindividual caps or means testing requirements.\n  The Senate-passed bill would have reduced subsidy payments for the \nwealthiest farmers, but this provision was removed from the final \nconference report. And there was no consideration of implementing a \nprovision I offered with Senator Toomey to place a reasonable cap on \ncrop insurance subsidies that would have saved taxpayers $3.4 billion \nover the next 10 years.\n  As we confront our Federal debt and deficit and as millions of \nfamilies across the country are tightening their belts, we cannot \njustify unlimited subsidies for wealthy farmers and giant \nagribusinesses.\n  While I will continue working to end wasteful farm bill programs and \nprotect taxpayers, I support this legislation because it supports New \nHampshire farmers and our State's rural communities, reduces the \ndeficit, invests in healthy foods, and helps prevent low-income \nAmericans from going hungry.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reauthorization of the farm bill presented \nan opportunity to make much needed changes in our agriculture policy to \nrein in taxpayer subsidies for big agribusiness, support the growth of \nsmall farms and local food systems, and ensure that our constituents in \nneed do not go hungry. Unfortunately, despite the extraordinary efforts \nof Chairwoman Stabenow, the reforms included in the bill before us \ntoday fall much too short.\n  Most troubling is that the bill cuts more than $8 billion from the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. I cannot support reducing \nhunger assistance for the most vulnerable Americans while creating new \ncrop insurance programs, increasing crop insurance spending by $5.7 \nbillion, and continuing to subsidize the wealthiest farmers. As such, I \nwill oppose this bill.\n  The nutrition cuts are particularly challenging in my State, where \nroughly 1 in 6 Rhode Islanders receive SNAP benefits--a reflection of \nthe challenging economic times in our State, where the unemployment \nrate remains above 9 percent, the highest in the country. According to \na survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, more than 15 percent of \nRhode Islanders are food insecure, meaning they do not always know \nwhere they will find their next meal and thus are at risk of hunger. \nAnd this number has grown over the last 5 years, from 58,000 households \nto more than 66,500 today. Many local food banks like the Rhode Island \nCommunity Food Bank--are struggling to keep pace as the need for food \nassistance grows. The SNAP cuts in this bill cannot be easily made up \nby food banks and other charitable organizations even with increased \nfunding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program.\n  While the conference agreement does not include the far more damaging \npolicy changes proposed by the House, it will reduce benefits for about \n850,000 low-income households by an average of $90 a month, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office. This is on top of the across-the-\nboard cut that hit all SNAP households last November when the benefit \nboost under the 2009 Recovery Act expired. When these cuts went into \neffect, families of 4 lost an average of $36 a month, while single-\nperson households lost an average of $11. Without the Recovery Act \nboost, SNAP benefits will average less than $1.40 per person per meal \nin 2014. Now we are asking some of our most vulnerable constituents to \nget by with even less--all while growing the safety net for the \nwealthiest farmers and the crop insurance industry. This is \nunacceptable.\n  As I noted, these remain trying economic times, with many Americans \nstill struggling to find work or working low-wage jobs that do not \nprovide the resources necessary to meet basic needs like food. This is \nnot the time to cut a lifeline benefit like SNAP. I am deeply \ndisappointed that some of the savings generated in this bill were not \nreinvested into SNAP to help meet the need for food assistance across \nthis country.\n  Unfortunately, the conference agreement also maintains the \nduplicative USDA catfish program--a program that both the House and the \nSenate have voted to repeal, the Government Accountability Office has \ncalled wasteful, and the administration proposed defunding in its \nfiscal year 2014 budget. This program would require seafood processors \nto comply with USDA regulations for catfish while the FDA would \ncontinue to oversee inspections for all other seafood. According to the \nGAO, repealing this program would avoid duplication of Federal programs \nand save taxpayers millions of dollars annually. We should be finding \nways to make government processes more efficient, not less.\n  While I am unable to support the conference report because of the \ndeep cuts to SNAP and inadequate reforms to crop insurance and farm \nsubsidy payments, I would like to acknowledge several provisions in \nthis bill, including several that will support the development of local \nand regional food systems and improve the affordability of and access \nto fresh fruits and vegetables for low-income families. I am \nparticularly pleased that the bill includes many measures from a bill \nthat I cosponsored, Senator Brown's Local Farms, Food and Jobs Act, \nthat will increase funding for specialty crop block grants to support \nresearch and promotion of fruits, vegetables, and other specialty \ncrops. Another measure is the enhancement of the Farmers Market and \nLocal Food Promotion Program to aid direct producer-to-consumer \nmarketing channels and local food sales to retailers and institutions.\n  The bill also allows Community Supported Agriculture operations to \nredeem SNAP benefits and creates Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive \ngrants, providing $100 million over 5 years for a national pilot to \nincentivize the purchase of fruits and vegetables at farmers markets by \nSNAP participants. A similar program has already been successfully \nimplemented in Rhode Island. Farm Fresh Rhode Island runs the ``Bonus \nBucks'' program where every $5 in SNAP benefits spent at a farmers \nmarket allows low-income individuals to receive an additional $2 to \nspend on fresh vegetables, fruit, eggs, fish, meats, and cheeses \nproduced by local farmers and fishermen. Within the first year that \n``Bonus Bucks'' was implemented, Farm Fresh Rhode Island saw a 675 \npercent increase in the amount of SNAP spent at their markets. In 2013, \n22 Rhode Island farmers markets up from 8 in 2008, have booths that can \naccept EBT cards.\n  It is exciting to see the ingenuity of our States replicated at the \nnational level in ways to help ensure that low-income families have \naccess to nutritious local foods. These types of programs also help \ngrow local food economies by encouraging purchases from local \nproducers. A win-win.\n  The bill also makes several changes to enhance and promote \nconservation. Requiring farmers to comply with conservation practices \nin order to receive taxpayer-supported subsidies on crop insurance will \nhelp further the conservation of natural resources and ensure that our \nfarmers remain good stewards of the land.\n  Thankfully, the conferees rejected a harmful amendment included in \nthe\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\nHouse bill that would have had far-reaching consequences by prohibiting \nStates from regulating agricultural products within their jurisdiction. \nThis bill also makes it a federal crime to attend or bring a child \nunder the age of 16 to an animal fighting event--a slightly modified \nversion of a bill I cosponsored that was introduced by Senator \nBlumenthal.\n  The conference report also includes legislation to reauthorize the \nNational Oilheat Research Alliance, NORA. I have cosponsored bills to \nreauthorize this program during the last several Congresses and am glad \nit will now become law. NORA seeks to strengthen and improve the oil \nheating industry through education and training and improving home \nheating efficiency. With more than 1 in 3 Rhode Islanders dependent on \nfuel oil to heat their homes this winter and heating oil prices on the \nrise, it is important to reauthorize NORA.\n  While Chairwoman Stabenow's efforts helped to ensure some positive \nprovisions and reforms, the bill simply does not go far enough. It \nwisely eliminates direct payments but restores some of those cuts by \ncreating new crop insurance programs, while not going far enough to \nlimit commodity and crop insurance subsidy payouts. The bill does not \neven include an amendment that I cosponsored and was passed in the \nSenate to set income limitations for crop insurance making a very \nmodest 5 percent reduction for farmers making over $750,000 annually.\n  We must do more to ensure that farm subsidies are available to the \nsmall and medium-sized farms that need it most and rein in the taxpayer \nsubsidies to large, wealthy farming operations. And we certainly should \nnot be paying for expensive farm programs by cutting SNAP, thereby \nplacing additional burdens on those who are struggling to make ends \nmeet.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bipartisan farm \nbill conference agreement before us today. This 5 year bill provides \ncertainty to both the producer and the consumer. It's a jobs bill \nsupporting 16 million jobs across the Nation. It also is a reform bill \nthat cracks down on fraud and abuse and ends direct payments.\n  Agriculture is the No. 1 industry in Maryland. We have 12,800 farms \nand 350,000 Marylanders employed in the industry. Poultry is Maryland's \nlargest agricultural industry followed by nursery grown plants and \ndairy.\n  Maryland's Eastern Shore is home to a $1.4 billion poultry industry \nresponsible for over 5,000 jobs. There are nearly 1,000 chicken farms \nand three processing plants. In fact, one in seven jobs on the Eastern \nShore is poultry related.\n  For poultry growers, this bill continues the supplemental agriculture \ninsurance assistance which provides disaster aid. This program lapsed \nin 2011, and this bill makes the program retroactive to 2012. This \nmeans Maryland's chicken farmers will continue to get disaster \npayments. The bill also continues to allow farm operating loans for \npoultry growers who do not qualify for operating credit at other \nlenders.\n  This farm bill requires country-of-origin labeling, which I have long \nsupported. Every consumer has the right to know where their food comes \nfrom on their dinner table. I acknowledge there are some in the poultry \nindustry that oppose these requirements. I think it is the right thing \nto do.\n  For Maryland's 500 dairy farms, the bill creates two new price and \nincome support programs. The Dairy Production Margin Protection Program \ntakes into consideration the high price of feed costs. This is a first \nfor dairy programs and a win for dairy farmers struggling to survive \nwith escalating variable and fixed operation costs. The premium cost to \nparticipate in this program will be very low for Maryland's small dairy \nfarmers. The Dairy Production Donation Program will guarantee a profit \nfor dairy farmers when the market becomes over saturated.\n  This legislation is important to the Chesapeake Bay conservation \nefforts. It includes the Regional Conservation Partnership Program, a \nnew competitive program. The bill provides $100 million annually for \nthis program. The Bay Watershed will compete with eight other regions \nfor these critical conservation dollars. This bill also ties farmers' \nconservation compliance to crop insurance. This means if your land is \nnot compliant, you will not receive a premium subsidy.\n  For sugar producers and refineries, the bill continues the existing \nSugar Program. The U.S. Sugar Program supports over 140,000 American \njobs, including 500 jobs at Domino Sugar located at the Port of \nBaltimore. Significant reforms to this program will put these jobs at \nrisk and they may be shipped overseas.\n  This bill helps Maryland's growing specialty crop and organic farmers \nby gradually increasing specialty crops block grants from $55 million a \nyear in 2014 to $85 million in 2018. Maryland receives more than $1.7 \nmillion from this program. The bill also increases organic research \nfunding to assist farmers transitioning to organics.\n  The bill makes modest reforms to the food aid program following a \nsimilar path as the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014. I support \nthe reforms in the bill and believe this is another step in the right \ndirection to allow more locally purchased food.\n  Finally, I would like to address food stamps, now called SNAP. I am \nfor food stamps and always will be. We have approximately 800,000 \nMarylanders receiving food stamp benefits. In November, I visited the \nMaryland Food Bank with my House Democratic colleagues. We announced \nthat we were standing up for SNAP and opposing the House's harmful cuts \nto the program.\n  During my visit, I met Tracey Coleman, a hard-working Marylander \nwhose husband was laid off through no fault of his own when the steel \nplant in Baltimore closed last year. Tracey has three kids, including a \ndaughter with special needs. She shouldn't have to choose between her \nson's asthma medication and a family meal. Tracey had nowhere else to \nturn. She signed up for SNAP benefits to keep food on the dinner table \nfor her family.\n  I personally thank Senator Stabenow for working so hard to protect \nSNAP families in this bill. She fought off the House Republicans that \nwanted to gut the program, cutting $40 billion from SNAP and axing SNAP \nbenefits for 4 million people, including putting 77,000 Marylanders at \nrisk. I am happy to report no American will lose their benefits under \nthis bill--not one. Most important to me, no Marylander will see their \nbenefits reduced from the reforms in this bill.\n  I know some of my colleagues are going to vote against the bill \nbecause of the changes to the standard utility allowance calculation \nthat will reduce benefits for their constituents. I understand. But \nwhat we all have to understand is that a compromise is a compromise and \nSenator Stabenow fended off the worst. I was recently in her shoes \nnegotiating the appropriations bill with the House. It is tough.\n  I commend Senators Stabenow and Cochran for their hard work on this \nbill. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill. It is good news \nfor American farmers and consumers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I will support final passage of the \nconference report of the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management \nAct of 2013. The conference report is particularly important to my home \nState of Michigan, where agriculture, the State's second-largest \nindustry, supports one in four jobs.\n  While the legislation presented contains many laudable provisions, I \nam deeply disappointed that the final conference report includes cuts \nto the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP. SNAP benefits \nprovide nutrition assistance to millions of families. It is distressing \nthat we are reducing food stamp support for those families.\n  While I oppose the SNAP cuts, the positives of this legislation are \nimportant enough that it deserves support. I applaud the work of my \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, whose leadership as the \nchair of the Agriculture Committee helped craft this important \ncompromise. This legislation makes critical reforms, reduces our \ndeficit, and brings certainty to farmers and business owners.\n  This legislation is more than just a farm bill. This legislation \ncovers conservation, nutrition assistance, crop insurance, \ninternational food aid, forestry and so much more.\n  This legislation makes significant modifications to help farmers \nbetter manage their risk by eliminating direct payments to farmers and \nreplacing\n\n[[Page S725]]\n\nit with two new risk management programs. This will ensure farmers \nreceive support only when there is a drop in farmers' income. This \nlegislation also creates a new and voluntary insurance program to \nprotect dairy farmers from losses. It also includes valuable reforms to \ndisaster assistance. Of note is the creation of a permanent livestock \ndisaster assistance program and retroactive coverage for orchardists \nand nursery growers who have recently been affected by droughts and \nwinter storms.\n  Importantly, this legislation also strengthens agriculture research \nprograms, such as the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This \ninvestment in specialty crops is vital to Michigan, which leads the \nnation in growing a wide variety of specialty crops including tart \ncherries, blueberries, cucumbers, dry black and red beans, and \ncranberries.\n  I am pleased the conference agreement retains important conservation \nprovisions that will help protect our water and air quality, restore \nfish and wildlife habitat, and improve flood control. The agreement \nconsolidates 23 existing conservation programs into 13 programs which \nshould streamline implementation. Further, conservation compliance is \ntied to crop insurance, which should ensure that basic conservation \npractices are implemented more broadly. Conservation provisions in the \nfarm bill will help prevent soil erosion, reduce water runoff and \npollution, and shift production away from sensitive lands. In addition, \nthe conference agreement retains the Regional Conservation Partnership \nProgram, which should benefit Great Lakes water quality and improve \nfish and wildlife habitat.\n  The bill also includes a 1-year extension of the Payments in Lieu of \nTaxes--PILT--Program, which provides funding to rural communities to \nhelp offset losses in property taxes due to nontaxable Federal lands \nwithin their boundaries. Each year, Michigan typically receives about \n$2.5 million under PILT, funding that is vital for providing essential \nservices such as education, law enforcement, and emergency response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I too rise to speak on the farm bill.\n  Similar to many Nebraskans, I am relieved that a final conference \nagreement has been reached and will provide much needed certainty for \nboth producers and consumers. This legislation accomplishes a great \ndeal. It provides risk management and disaster assistance programs. It \npromotes environmental stewardship. It bolsters export opportunities. \nIt encourages rural development, advances research, helps beginning \nfarmers and ranchers, and delivers nutrition assistance to our needy \nfamilies.\n\n  While the bill is not perfect, it is the result of compromise and a \nlong collaborative legislative process.\n  One of the most challenging issues for lawmakers was addressing \nnutrition assistance programs, which comprise 80 percent of the farm \nbill's total spending. With one in every seven Americans receiving \nsupplemental nutrition assistance, it is important to strengthen the \nprogram's integrity and its accountability, while better targeting \nprograms to serve those in need.\n  I am also pleased the bill empowers States to help capable adults \nenroll in work programs to reduce reliance on taxpayer assistance. The \nbill provides tools to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse, including \ncracking down on trafficking through data mining, terminal ID, and \nother measures.\n  While these are all steps in the right direction, it is disappointing \nthat the bill will not achieve additional savings from nutrition \nprograms, which are projected to cost more than $756 billion over the \nnext decade.\n  True farm programs--the commodity programs and crop insurance--only \ncomprise about 14 percent of all of the farm bill spending, but they \naccount for more than half of the savings under this proposed bill. In \nfact, the commodity title contributes more savings than any other title \nin the entire farm bill.\n  The legislation makes significant reforms to farm policy. Direct \npayments are repealed and replaced with risk management that offers \nprotection only when warranted by significant price or revenue \ndeclines. In Nebraska, agriculture is our No. 1 industry, and it is one \nof which we are very proud. Our farmers and ranchers take on an \nenormous amount of risk. They endure the elements every day as they \nwork to feed the world and responsibly take care of our natural \nresources.\n  I am pleased this farm bill maintains and strengthens one of the most \nimportant risk management tools for our farmers, and that is crop \ninsurance. This is a very successful public-private partnership that \nhelps farmers invest in their own risk management by purchasing \ninsurance policies so they are protected from adverse weather or market \nconditions.\n  This legislation also provides needed disaster assistance to \nlivestock producers. Unfortunately, the Livestock Forage Program and \nthe Livestock Indemnity Program both expired in 2011 under the last \nfarm bill. In 2012, livestock producers experienced the most \ndevastating loss of pasture, rangeland, and forage in decades due to \nwidespread drought, affecting approximately 80 percent of our country.\n  Then, in October of 2013, an unexpected early fall blizzard killed \nmore than 20,000 cattle, sheep, horses, and bison in the Dakotas and in \nmy State of Nebraska. While those affected by these hardships have been \nwithout assistance for more than 2 years, this farm bill will now help \nproducers to rebuild those herds and sustain their ranching operations.\n  I also appreciate that this farm bill continues our commitment to \nstrong conservation programs. The bill consolidates and streamlines \nthose programs, providing landowners with incentives and assistance to \nprotect and improve our land, our water, and our air.\n  Agriculture continues to be a bright spot for U.S. trade, thanks in \npart to the successful export promotion programs, and those are \nreauthorized in this bill as well. An independent study conducted for \nUSDA in 2010 found that for every dollar expended by government and \nindustry on market development, U.S. food and agricultural exports \nincreased by $35. Through the Market Access Program and the Foreign \nMarket Development Program, we can expect increased demand for U.S.-\ngrown agricultural products and commodities.\n  This farm bill also continues investment in rural development, \nproviding assistance to communities to build that very critical \ninfrastructure and access to credit to help grow small businesses.\n  Also supported by this farm bill are critical agricultural research \ninitiatives which allow American producers to innovate, to become more \nefficient and productive with fewer and fewer resources. Moreover, the \nbill also provides support for developing technologies that reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Finally, this bill provides some needed regulatory relief for the \nagricultural industry. I am very pleased the bill includes an amendment \nI offered to fix bureaucratic hurdles impacting farmers' access to \nseeds. This bipartisan amendment, cosponsored by Senator Carper, \nensures that EPA does not treat biotech seeds as pesticides when those \nshipments are imported.\n  I was disappointed, though, that the conference did not include \nlanguage to address one of the worst regulatory challenges confronting \nfarmers: EPA's overregulation of on-farm fuel storage under its Spill \nPrevention Control and Countermeasure Program.\n  The House farm bill included an SPCC relief provision, and the Senate \nunanimously passed a similar amendment which I cosponsored to reduce \nfarmers' SPCC compliance burdens during consideration of the Water \nResources Development Act. There is bipartisan agreement on both sides \nof the dome that this regulation needs to be fixed. The farm bill did \nprovide the perfect opportunity for getting this relief enacted into \nlaw, but that chance was missed. However, I stand ready to work with my \ncolleagues to ensure we don't miss another opportunity to address this \nissue--to fix this issue--and we can do that during the WRDA \nconference.\n  As I said, this bill is not perfect, but on balance this farm bill \ngoes a long way in promoting opportunity and providing certainty for \nboth producers and consumers. I encourage my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the final passage of the farm bill.\n\n[[Page S726]]\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor for the third time \nto express my opposition to the farm bill--obviously not in total, but \nto certain provisions of it, particularly provisions I had a hand in \nwriting--and to set the record straight, once again.\n  I come here because several of my colleagues have approached me \nindicating confusion on whether the payment limits provisions I fought \nfor are in this bill or not in this bill. People are going to tell \ncolleagues there are payment limitations in this bill, but I am here to \nset the record straight with facts. They don't accomplish what I tried \nto accomplish, and they are even much more liberal than in existing law \nin regard to my amendment.\n  My original payment limit provisions included a $50,000 individual/\n$100,000 married couple cap for the shallow loss programs shown as \nPrice Loss Coverage--PLC--and the Agricultural Risk Coverage--ARC--\nprograms. In this bill farmers will have to pick one of those programs \nfor the next 5 years.\n  The conference report allows individual farmers to get $125,000 and \nmarried couples to get $250,000 from the PLC and the ARC programs.\n  This is where this has really exploded because what I just referenced \nis a 150-percent increase over what my limits allowed--the limits that \npassed the Senate without discussion and limits adopted in the House of \nRepresentatives on a 230-to-194 vote. That is just a plain, simple \nfact--a 150-percent increase over what my limits allowed. The \nconference report allows the PLC and ARC programs to pay out 150 \npercent more than my limits did.\n  This intentional change by the conference committee allows each \nfarmer to get significantly more from these new countercyclical \nprograms that are not even World Trade Organization--or, as we say \naround here, WTO--compliant.\n  Another way of looking at this, under the 2008 farm bill, an \nindividual farmer could only get $65,000 from the countercyclical \nprogram. Under this bill, they can get $125,000 from the \ncountercyclical program. That means they almost doubled what the \ncountercyclical program will pay out compared to current law.\n  Furthermore, some university analysis has already shown the high \ntarget prices for certain crops in this bill will likely have a 70- to \n80-percent chance of triggering payments through the PLC program any \ngiven year of this farm bill.\n  So, I say to my colleagues, please don't buy what my opponents are \nselling on this issue, or at least trying to sell. My payment limits \nare not in this bill. The result of that is going to be a \ncountercyclical program that will be much more market-distorting than \nthe current ones for a few crops. How can it not be more distorting? \nThe PLC program is designed to trigger more often and pay out larger \namounts than the old countercyclical program for certain crops in the \n2008 farm bill.\n  That is just a plain, simple fact. I am sorry if proponents are \nhaving a tough time acknowledging that publicly, but that is what this \nbill actually does. Their bill does lots of things, but brilliantly \nreforming Title I is not one of them.\n  I am sure we have been told that this bill reforms. It is like some \nof the opponents of payment limits still thinking this is 1975 or some \nyear back then. Back then, the national debt was still measured in \nbillions and the WTO didn't even exist. Unfortunately for them, things \nare very different today. Recently, the WTO declared our cotton program \nnoncompliant, and we happen to have a $17 trillion national debt. But \nworse than this, I say to my colleagues, is the fact that these \namendments were adopted on the floor of the Senate, and they were \nadopted in the House of Representatives by a 230-to-194 vote. They \nshould not have even been subject to negotiations.\n  The moral authority of the people of the United States was behind \nwhat both Houses did. Because we have a $17 trillion national debt, we \nought to be able to save this $387 million that this amendment would \nhave saved. It had the moral authority of a majority of the House and \nthe Senate, which moral authority should not have been overridden by a \nhandful of people sitting in conference.\n  I stress this latter point for one simple reason: Rule XXVIII of the \nSenate says if things are the same in both Houses, they should not be \nconferenceable. I say this to my friends, not that this bill is going \nto go down to defeat and we start over again and maybe accomplish what \nI want to accomplish, but to make sure other conferences do not abuse \nthe Senate rule like this conference abused the Senate rule; and also \nto tell my colleagues here that, both working with what rules maybe we \ncan get through the U.S. Department of Agriculture or on some other \npiece of legislation, I intend to pursue these goals that I sought, and \nI intend to keep reminding my colleagues of Senate rules being violated \nby conferees that should not have been violated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nmany ways ObamaCare continues to negatively affect Americans.\n  Yesterday, the Washington Post published an article exposing yet \nanother problem with healthcare.gov. I would like to share a couple of \nexcerpts from that article. The article begins:\n\n       Tens of thousands of people who discovered that \n     HealthCare.gov made mistakes as they were signing up for a \n     health plan are confronting a new roadblock: The government \n     cannot yet fix the errors. Roughly 22,000 Americans have \n     filed appeals with the government to try to get mistakes \n     corrected. . . .\n\n  Those mistakes, according to the Post, include being overcharged for \nhealth insurance, being directed to the wrong insurance program or \nbeing wrongly denied coverage.\n  So what is the status of those appeals?\n  The Post reports:\n\n       For now, the appeals are sitting, untouched, inside a \n     government computer. And an unknown number of consumers who \n     are trying to get help through less formal means--by calling \n     the health-care marketplace directly--are told that \n     HealthCare.gov's computer system is not yet allowing federal \n     workers to go into enrollment records and change them. . . .\n\n  So let me summarize here. Mr. President, 22,000 Americans are either \nwithout insurance or are paying too much for insurance as a result of \nmistakes made by the Federal health exchange.\n  Healthcare.gov contains no appeals process. Attempts to find recourse \nby other means have been unsuccessful, and the administration's \nresponse is basically: Tough luck.\n  President Obama was interviewed by FOX News' Bill O'Reilly this \nweekend. One of the topics they covered was healthcare.gov's problems.\n  The President said:\n\n       The goods news is that right away we decided how we're \n     going to fix it. It got fixed within a month and a half. It \n     was up and running, and now it's working the way it's \n     supposed to. . . .\n\n  Let me repeat that The President of the United States said: `` . . . \nnow it's working the way it's supposed to. . . .''\n  Well, tell that to the 22,000 people wondering why there is no \nappeals process on the Web site or why their paper appeals are stuck in \na computer system at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nwhere, the Post says, the appeals process is currently stopped because \n``the part of the computer system that would allow agency workers to \nread and handle appeals has not been built.''\n  When Bill O'Reilly asked President Obama about the Web site problems, \nthe President responded by saying that--and I quote again--``I don't \nthink anybody anticipated the degree of problems that you had on \nhealthcare.gov.''\n  That is not an excuse. It was the President's job to ensure that \npeople in the administration were anticipating the problems that would \noccur, and the President owes the American people an explanation of why \nhe did not because this is not just a story of bureaucratic \nincompetence. It is the stories of the tens of thousands of individual \nAmericans who are suffering as a result of the Web site glitches and \nwho are wondering how they will afford their health care under \nObamaCare--Americans like Addie Wilson, whose story is highlighted in \nthe Post article.\n  Addie is a 27-year-old who makes just $22,000 a year. She was sure \nshe would\n\n[[Page S727]]\n\nqualify for a subsidy on the exchanges, and she was absolutely right. \nShe did--only healthcare.gov did not tell her that.\n  So Addie phoned one of the call centers, which told her to sign up at \nthe more expensive price she was quoted and to appeal the decision \nlater.\n  Since her old insurance plan was on its way out and she needed \nsurgery in January, that is what she did. Now she is stuck paying $100 \nmore a month than she should be paying, along with a deductible that is \n$4,000 higher than it should be. That too-high of a deductible is of \nparticular concern since she incurred huge hospital bills in January \nwhen she was forced to have surgery. If she does not get relief from \nthe appeals process, she could end up paying $4,000 in medical bills \nthat she should not have to pay and cannot afford.\n  But it is not just the Web site that is driving up Americans' medical \nbills--it is the law itself. As awful as Addie's situation is, at least \nmaybe she will get help eventually. For millions of other Americans, \ntheir high deductibles are no mistake.\n  For too many Americans on and off the exchanges, the reality of the \nso-called Affordable Care Act has been a staggering increase in health \ncare costs.\n  Some family plans on the exchanges carry deductibles of almost \n$13,000. That is more than some families will spend this year on their \nmortgage.\n  Upper-income families may be able to absorb these costs--and some \nlimited help is available for lower-income families--but what middle-\nclass family can afford $13,000 a year in medical costs?\n  Too many families around the country will be putting on hold their \nplans to buy a home or send their kids to college because they have to \ndevote every spare dollar to paying their health care bills.\n\n  On top of crippling cost hikes, many of these same families are \nfacing the loss of doctors and hospitals, as insurance companies narrow \ntheir networks in response to ObamaCare's mandates.\n  So far I have only mentioned the personal devastation ObamaCare is \ncausing. But ObamaCare is not just affecting families' pocketbooks; it \nis affecting the economy as a whole.\n  In response to ObamaCare's burdensome mandates and new taxes, \nbusinesses are cutting employees' hours, declining to hire new \nemployees, and abandoning their plans to expand. That means fewer jobs \navailable for the millions of Americans looking for work and fewer \nopportunities for career growth and advancement.\n  In fact, just this morning, there was a story in the Wall Street \nJournal, and it references the Congressional Budget Office report that \nestimates now that the impact of this law through the year 2024 will \nmean 2.5 million fewer jobs--2.5 million in job losses as a result of \nObamaCare. It is so much so that you see many of the very labor unions \nthat supported and wholeheartedly endorsed ObamaCare when it passed \ncoming out now and saying ``[i]t would be a sad irony''--and I am \nquoting from a letter that went out from several of the labor unions--\n``[i]t would be a sad irony indeed if the signature legislative \naccomplishment of an Administration committed to reducing income \ninequality cut living standards for middle income and low wage \nworkers.'' The letter also says that the ObamaCare law ``undermines \nfair marketplace competition'' and that they are ``bitterly \ndisappointed.'' This comes from labor unions in this country that \nwholeheartedly endorsed this law when it passed several years ago.\n  The American people have endured 5 years of economic stagnation, and \nObamaCare has been making things worse.\n  The President has called for 2014 to be a year of action, but I have \nseen no evidence that he plans to address the causes of our sluggish \ngrowth or provide relief for the millions of Americans struggling with \ncrippling health care costs.\n  Republicans have a number of health care proposals, from \ncomprehensive plans like that proposed by Senators Coburn, Hatch, and \nBurr, to commonsense ideas to lower costs by allowing businesses to \npool together to negotiate lower rates, and by allowing insurance \ncompanies to sell health care plans across State lines to promote more \ncompetition and give people more choices.\n  If the President really wanted to make health care more affordable \nand accessible, he would abandon this government takeover of one-sixth \nof our economy and work with Republicans to pass real health care \nreform. But given the President's record, I am not holding my breath \nthat is going to happen.\n  But at the very least--the very least--I hope the President will see \nhis way to supporting bipartisan proposals to improve the economy and \nto open new jobs and opportunities to struggling Americans.\n  Just last Friday, the Obama State Department released its fifth \nenvironmental impact study on the Keystone XL Pipeline. Once again, the \nreview found that the pipeline would have no significant impact on \nglobal carbon emissions. Senators and Representatives of both parties \nsupport this job-creating measure. It is high time for the President to \napprove the pipeline and open the 42,000 shovel-ready jobs it will \nsupport.\n  He should also pick up the phone that he keeps talking about to call \nthe Senate majority leader to tell him to stop obstructing bipartisan \ntrade promotion authority legislation that would help American farmers, \nranchers, entrepreneurs, and job creators gain access to a billion new \nconsumers around the globe.\n  The President and the majority leader held a White House meeting \nyesterday, we are told, yet an aide reported that there was no \ndiscussion of the majority leader's antitrade comments last week.\n  Given this legislation's importance for increasing American jobs, it \nis difficult to understand why the President would not bring this bill \nup at that meeting.\n  Finally, the President of the United States also should join the vast \nbipartisan majority in the Senate that supports repeal of the job-\nkilling ObamaCare medical device tax, which is forcing American \ncompanies to send jobs overseas.\n  The President will be visiting the Democrats' retreat tomorrow, which \nwould be a prime opportunity for him to get on the same page with his \nparty in support of these bipartisan measures.\n  Republicans are ready and willing to work with the President and with \nDemocrats, and we hope we will have willing partners to do the things \nthat are necessary to get people back to work, to create jobs, to grow \nour economy, and to help provide and build a better future for middle \nclass families in this country.\n  The American people should not have to wait any longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, once again, the President of the United \nStates has failed to meet the statutory deadline to propose a budget. \nIn fact, he has missed the deadline so many times that people hardly \nnotice anymore. Failure seems to become the rule, not the exception. \nThe President has now missed the budget deadline five times since he \ntook office in 2009. By comparison, his three White House predecessors \nmissed the deadline a total of four times in 20 years. Five times under \nPresident Obama; four times in the last 20 years under his three \nimmediate predecessors.\n  All totaled, it is now the 18th time that the Obama administration \nhas missed a legal deadline related to the Federal budget. I guess the \nPresident and his administration consider the law purely an advisory \nmatter not binding on them. The law is for other people, not for this \nPresident and for his administration, seems to be their attitude.\n  The reason this is so important is because, as we all know--whether \nit a family budget or a budget for your business--setting a budget is \nwhere you establish your priorities: the things you have to have, the \nthings you would like to have but maybe need to put off, and then those \nthings you really cannot afford. That is how you budget. That is why it \nis so important.\n  But if your budget includes massive amounts of new spending, along \nwith firm opposition to major reforms, you would have no choice but to \nask for a huge tax increase. The President, I do not think, wants to \nput himself on record again, like he did last year, for\n\n[[Page S728]]\n\nanother huge tax increase, nor does he want his party's members, who \nare running for election in 2014, to have to cast the hard vote on the \nPresident's own budget.\n  Last year, his 2014 budget proposal would have raised taxes by \nroughly $1 trillion--a trillion-dollar tax increase. That is on top of \nthe $1.7 trillion that taxes have gone up during the last 5 years under \nthis administration.\n  It looks as if the President's priorities are more taxes, more \nspending, and more debt.\n  But if those sorts of priorities led to robust economic growth and \njob creation, we would see one of the strongest economic recoveries in \nAmerican history. But the truth is more taxes, more spending, and more \ndebt are not a recipe for economic growth and job creation--just the \nopposite.\n  We are seeing the evidence of that right now. We are suffering \nthrough the weakest economic recovery since the great recession in \nmodern history. Actually, we are seeing the weakest economic recovery \nsince the Great Depression right now. There are a lot of reasons, but \nthe Congressional Budget Office has given us some reasons that I want \nto talk about just briefly.\n  They talk about ObamaCare and its impact on job growth and economic \ngrowth. As a matter of fact, the Affordable Care Act, the President's \nsignature legislative accomplishment--the Congressional Budget Office \nsaid the number of full-time workers will go down by 2 million in the \ncoming years as a result of the Affordable Care Act. So in addition to \npeople getting cancelled policies or sticker shock and finding out that \ntheir health care costs did not go down, they went up, or finding if \nyou like your doctors you cannot keep them, what we are finding is that \nthese same people may find themselves out of work as a result of the \npolicies in the Affordable Care Act.\n  The Congressional Budget Office looked primarily at how employers \nwould respond to a new penalty for failing to offer insurance to \nemployees who worked more than 30 hours. That response would include \ncutting people's hours, hiring fewer workers, and lowering wages for \nnew jobs. I know my friends on the other side of the aisle agree with \nthe President when he said we ought to raise the minimum wage.\n  Well, one of the problems is the President's own health care policy \nthat they all voted for is killing full-time work and putting people in \npart-time work, meaning that their weekly wages have been depressed. \nFor them the answer is not to deal with the source of that problem, \nwhich is ObamaCare, but to fix wages at 40 percent higher than they \ncurrently are per hour, which we know--economists tell us and it is \nintuitively true--is going to put more people out of work, put more \npressure on workers.\n  Perhaps one of the most distressing things about the Congressional \nBudget Office's report today is what they said, what the prospects look \nlike for the President's remaining term in office. The Congressional \nBudget Office does not see unemployment falling below 6 percent for the \nrest of President Obama's term--6 percent for the remainder of his \nterm.\n  Yet, despite all of this, the President still will not get behind \ngenuine progrowth reforms. He will not support genuine reforms of our \nexisting programs such as Medicare and Social Security that would \nactually save them and put them on a fiscally sustainable path. He has \nno plan for controlling our national debt.\n  I went back and looked. Last time Congress came within one vote of \npassing a balanced budget amendment, do you know what the national debt \nwas then? It was $4.85 trillion. Do you know what it is today? It is in \nexcess of $17 trillion, with no end in sight. So the truth is \nRepublicans have put forward ideas for streamlining Federal \nregulations, for mitigating the negative effects of the Affordable Care \nAct and for replacing ObamaCare with patient-centered reforms that \nwould cut costs, broaden quality insurance coverage, and improve \npatient access. But so far, the majority leader and the President have \nshown zero interest in trying to work with Republicans to solve our \nNation's most serious economic challenges, which are having a direct \nimpact on the American people.\n  Instead, the President said he is going to go it alone. He has a pen; \nhe has a phone. But as I have suggested before, one of the things he \ncould do that would put Americans back to work almost immediately and \nmake us more North American energy-independent would be to sign the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  I know my time is expired. I ask unanimous consent that the three \narticles I was referring to on the CBO report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 4, 2014]\n\n          CBO: Health-Care Law Will Reduce Jobs By Two Million\n\n                (By Zachary A. Goldfarb and Sarah Kliff)\n\n       The Affordable Care Act will reduce the number of full-time \n     workers by more than two million in coming years, \n     congressional budget analysts said Tuesday in the most \n     detailed analysis of the law's impact on jobs.\n       After obtaining coverage through the health law, some \n     workers may forgo employment, while others may reduce hours, \n     according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office. \n     Low-wage workers are the most likely to drop out of the \n     workforce as a result of the law, it said. The CB0 said the \n     law's impact on jobs mostly would be felt after 2016.\n       The agency previously estimated that the economy would have \n     800,000 fewer jobs in 2021 as a result of the law. In that \n     analysis, the CBO looked primarily at how employers would \n     respond to a new penalty for failing to offer insurance to \n     employees who work more than 30 hours a week. That response \n     would include cutting people's hours, hiring fewer workers \n     and lowering wages for new jobs.\n       On Tuesday, the agency released a more detailed estimate \n     that includes how ordinary Americans would react to those \n     changes by employers. Some would choose to keep Medicaid \n     rather than take a job at reduced wages. Others, who \n     typically do not work full-time, would delay returning to \n     work in order to keep subsidies for private insurance that \n     are provided under the law.\n       As a result, by 2021, the number of full-time positions \n     would be reduced by 2.3 million, the agency said.\n       The reduction in employment from the health care law \n     ``includes some people choosing not to work at all and other \n     people choosing to work fewer hours than they would have in \n     the absence of the law,'' the CBO said.\n       The law also estimated that the botched rollout of the \n     health law's Web site may reduce the number of people who \n     will sign up for coverage by 1 million through March 31, the \n     CB0 estimated. Initially, the agency predicted 7 million \n     would have signed up by then.\n       In its new analysis, the CBO said it had reduced its \n     estimate of how many Americans would sign up for the \n     insurance through the online marketplaces ``in light of \n     technical problems that impeded many people's enrollment in \n     exchanges in the first months of the open enrollment \n     period.''\n       The CBO said that the program would catch up over time, \n     with a total of 13 million Americans signing up in 2015 and \n     24 million by 2017.\n       Late last month, the Obama administration announced that \n     about 3 million Americans had signed up for private health \n     plans so far under the federal health exchange and separate \n     exchanges that are being run by 14 states.\n       The administration and the CBO agree there should be a \n     surge of sign-ups near the March deadline to apply for \n     coverage in 2014.\n       The CBO estimated that 84 percent of the U.S. population \n     would have health insurance in 2014, rising to 89 percent \n     within a few years. Medicaid, the program for the poor \n     expanded under the law, should add 6 million more people this \n     year.\n       At the same time, the CB0 reported that the federal budget \n     is rapidly shrinking and is projected to decline to $514 \n     billion this year, providing fresh evidence that the problem \n     that has been Washington's obsession for the past several \n     years has become far less urgent.\n       Tax hikes, spending cuts and faster economic growth have \n     helped close the deficit, which topped $1 trillion for \n     several years following the onset of the Great Recession.\n       The budget deficit would equal 3 percent of the total size \n     of the nation's economy this year--what many economists see \n     as a healthy level. The deficit is expected to decrease to \n     $478 billion next year, or 2.6 percent of the size of the \n     economy.\n       One of the more troubling aspects of the CBO report was its \n     assessment of long-term economic growth.\n       The CBO said that the economy will continue to enjoy a \n     solid recovery for the next several years, but will slow to a \n     pace of expansion of 2.2 percent a year from 2018 to 2024.\n       Much of the slowdown has to do with fewer workers active in \n     the economy--mainly a result of baby boomers retiring.\n       The slow growth the economy will reduce taxes by $1.4 \n     trillion of the next years, leading to a larger than expected \n     deficit by 2024 $1.07 trillion, or 4 percent of the size of \n     the economy.\n       The CBO said it would still take until 2017 for the \n     unemployment rate, currently at 6.7 percent, to fall to 5.8 \n     percent, and may not reach 5.5 percent until 2024.\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\n       Today, the agency said the economy is about six million \n     jobs short of where it should be.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From The Hill, Feb. 4, 2014]\n\n         CBO: O-Care Slowing Growth, Contributing to Job Losses\n\n       The new healthcare law will slow economic growth over the \n     next decade, costing the nation about 2.5 million jobs and \n     contributing to a $1 trillion increase in projected deficits, \n     the Congressional Budget Office said in a report released \n     Tuesday.\n       The non-partisan group's report found that the healthcare \n     law's negative effects on the economy will be ``substantially \n     larger'' than what it had previously anticipated.\n       The CBO is now estimating that the law will reduce labor \n     force compensation by 1 percent from 2017 to 2024, twice the \n     reduction it previously had projected.\n       This will decrease the number of full-time equivalent jobs \n     in 2021 by 2.3 million, it said. It had previously estimated \n     the decrease would be 800,000.\n       It said this decrease would be caused partly be people \n     leaving the workforce in response to lower jobs offered by \n     employers, and increased insurance coverage through the \n     healthcare law.\n       It also said employer penalties in the law will decrease \n     wages, and that part-year workers will be slower to return to \n     the work force because they will seek to retain ObamaCare \n     insurance subsidies.\n       The healthcare law isn't the only reason the CBO is \n     projecting slower economic growth between 2014 and 2023, \n     however. It also cited inflation and lower productivity as \n     reasons why it was lowering its projections.\n       The slower growth will mean less tax revenue, which will \n     add to the deficit. Instead of adding $6.3 trillion in \n     deficits from 2014 to 2023, the government will add $7.3 \n     trillion, CBO now projects.\n       By 2023, the gross debt of the United States will be $26 \n     trillion, up from a projected $25 trillion. A year later the \n     debt will rise to $27 trillion as the $1.074 trillion deficit \n     for fiscal 2024 is added in.\n       ``Most of the increase in projected deficits results from \n     lower projections for the growth of real GDP and for \n     inflation, which have resulted in projected revenues between \n     2014 and 2023 by $1.4 trillion,'' CBO explained.\n       CBO now thinks the economy will grow at 3.1 percent in this \n     fiscal year, which ends in October, rather than the 3.4 \n     percent growth it predicted last year.\n       The unemployment rate is projected to fall to 6.7 percent \n     by the end of the year, much lower than the 7.6 percent CBO \n     saw for 2014 previously. The budget office does not see \n     unemployment falling below 6 percent for the rest of \n     President Obama's term, however.\n       In the near term, the CBO is projecting smaller deficits.\n       The budget office says that legislation enacted since last \n     May has reduced deficits by $400 billion.\n       For 2014, the deficit is slated to be $514 billion, an \n     improvement of $46 billion from last year's projection.\n       In 2015, the deficit falls to $478 billion. That is still \n     higher than the last full year of the Bush administration \n     when the deficit was $458 billion, but it is a steep drop \n     from the $1 trillion deficits of most of the Obama years.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nasking for the passage of the farm bill that we are going to have a \nvote on shortly. I thank my colleague from Michigan, the Chair of the \nAgriculture Committee, for her unbelievable work on this very important \npolicy for America. I know she understands these issues well because, \nwhile everybody thinks of Michigan as a manufacturing State, it also is \na very big agricultural State. We share a lot of the same crops, being \nkind of on a northern plateau: apples and wine and a variety of others. \nI certainly thank her for her help and support in getting an important \nnew program in our school lunches for very nutritious peas and lentils, \ncalled pulse crops, and to thank her for her input.\n  I rise today to talk about the importance of the farm bill, because \nit is a jobs bill for our Nation. Two years ago I joined my colleague \nSenator Johanns from Nebraska and sent a bipartisan letter with 44 \nSenators saying it was time to act on the farm bill because we thought \nit was so important for our economy as we were still struggling coming \nout of a recession. Today it is finally here, that opportunity to put \nall of that hard work into a bill that goes to the President's desk.\n  Agriculture employs 16 million Americans, and it produces exports \nworth $115 billion of agricultural products to markets around the \nworld. I do not think we always focus on that. A lot of times we come \nout here and we talk about the individual crops in our State or the \nindividual focus. But what we really need to understand is it is a very \nbig product for the United States.\n  We live in a very competitive global economy. One of the biggest \nadvantages we have in this global economy is that we in the United \nStates of America know how to grow things. So the emerging middle class \naround the world can now afford to eat higher quality products. The \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue put it best in a speech he \ngave about the global marketplace last year. He said:\n\n       You play to your strength. You leverage your advantages and \n     then you find ways to improve them. And one of the greatest \n     strengths in America is agriculture.\n\n  Mr. Donohue said those remarks as an example of what innovation is \ndriving in American agriculture. He is absolutely right, because not \nonly do we know how to grow things but we also know how to innovate. \nThere is a lot of innovation going on in the ag economy. In fact, there \nare some people in the Pacific Northwest who say now there is as much \ninvestment going into new innovations in agriculture as there was \nrecently in high tech or even green energy. So people get it. It is a \ngreat investment.\n  I have seen in Washington State cutting-edge research done at our lab \nin Prosser for new wheat rotation crops in the Palouse, to savvy \nentrepreneurs making connections like getting Washington cherries into \nthe new Korean market. So simply put, this is a growing, growing \nopportunity for the U.S. economy.\n  American farmers and businesses are seeing demands for their products \nrise on two fronts: First, American consumers want to buy their \nproducts directly from the farms in their communities, so that means \nthe farms are creating products for exactly what their end customer \nwants. Because they are doing that, they can make more money on \ndelivering to the end customer exactly the kind of product they want.\n  Secondly, a rising middle class in places such as Asia to South \nAmerica wants to use their new-found spending power on purchasing our \nproducts as well. So this farm bill helps on both of those fronts. \nAgain, thanks to the chairwoman from Michigan. It helps get more goods \nto the market, whether that is a farmer's market around the corner from \nyour local supermarket, or whether that is a new market in South Korea.\n  In 2030, China's middle class will have 1 billion people. That is up \nfrom 150 million today. India's middle class will grow by more than 800 \npercent. Maybe because we sit on the Pacific, just like the Presiding \nOfficer, he knows how important it is to get products to those \nmarketplaces.\n  In 2012, the United Nations reported that the world will need 70 \npercent more food by the middle of the century. This is a tremendous \nopportunity but only if Congress acts today and passes the farm bill. \nWe need to maintain our investment in research and exports so American \nfarmers can thrive and win in the expanding global marketplace. I am \nconfident if we do that, our farmers and our businesses--and we make \nsure that they have a level playing--will win.\n  But other countries are playing for keeps too. Every farmer around \nthe world wants access to that rising middle class. The European Union \nspent $700 million on export promotion for food products in 2011. That \nis nearly three times as much as America spent. China is planning to \nboost its agricultural investment over the next decade. It is a \nsentiment that I heard in October when I visited one of our wholesalers \nwhen he was talking to an overseas client. He was talking about export \nand agricultural leaders in Washington State and how other countries \nwere starting to use particularly the apple market to try to open new \nopportunities.\n  That is why we need to increase opportunities within the farm bill \nand to move forward on trade deals that help open the door to new \nagricultural markets. That will help unleash an entrepreneurial spirit \nwe need to be aggressive about. Many people have heard of Walla Walla--\nor maybe you have not or maybe you thought that was a term. But Walla \nWalla is a great community in the southeast corner of our State with \n30,000 people. It is deeply tied to the global economy. It has wine and \nwheat and peas and lentils. The farmers there, I know, are very \nappreciative of the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. They thanked me many \ntimes for making sure that got passed. I can\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\ntell you that many of those farmers went to Bogota to try to sell wheat \nto the growing Colombian middle class. That is what entrepreneurship in \nAmerica is all about.\n  So Congress mist not dampen our entrepreneurial spirit. Farmers need \nto start this season and make sure they can put long-term plans in \nplace. Then the seeds that will be planted, the fields that will be \nharvested, the crops that will be shipped, the smart, targeted \ninvestment toward those new international markets will be done. That is \nwhat this farm bill is about.\n  The bill, I can tell you, is a compromise. Again, I thank the \nchairwoman for her hard work, because I know how hard she worked on \nforging those compromises. I can tell you that it cuts SNAP far more \nthan I would have cut it. I was one of 26 Senators who voted for the \namendment by my colleague from New York offered to restore those cuts. \nBut it is time we move forward.\n  I want to take a second to talk about three reasons why people should \nbe for this farm bill. First, as I talked about, it continues to expand \nthe export programs that are so important for America's new markets. \nWhile I might have been for a more robust program, some of my \ncolleagues obviously have not quite understood why this is such a great \nbenefit to market U.S. products around the globe. I think some people \nthink of big global corporations and things; why do we need that?\n  Well, I can tell you, when I am talking about apples or cherries or \npears, these are not big corporations. They are a collection of \nhundreds or thousands of farmers working together. When MAP helps \ntarget getting people in the Asian market to consume those products, it \nis a win-win situation for America.\n  Secondly, this bill funds research, making our crops stronger and \nhealthier and more competitive.\n  Third, it starts initiatives on products such as a pulse crop that I \nthink can be so beneficial to us over the long run with new, as I said, \nschool lunches, but just healthier products.\n  Our new farm bill will do the research on specialty crops that are so \nimportant for us in the Pacific Northwest. This is the first time in \nthis farm bill that the reauthorization makes long-term investments in \nspecialty crop block grant programs and specialty crop research \ninitiatives. Again, I thank the Senator from Michigan for her help on \nthat, understanding how important these specialty crops are.\n  I think everybody in America and around the world knows the brand of \nWashington apples. I can tell you, I have been in the Chinese \nmarketplace and seen how people took off the Washington label, \nparticularly on Fuji apples, and tried to stick it on other apples, \nbecause they knew if that sticker was on that apple, everybody in China \nwould consume those apples even though they were not really Washington \nFuji.\n  So what this specialty research initiative does is say we are not \ngoing to let apples and pears and cherries basically constantly fall \noff the radar as it relates to research, but they will be a permanent \npart of a program for research and have a block grant program so they \ncan basically continue to do the research that is needed.\n  Again, if any of my colleagues have ever had a chance to visit the \nresearch facilities within their State, they will know what I am \ntalking about. If they haven't, they should go and do it.\n  But when we are fighting against or upon a competitive field with \nIsrael, China, or anybody else when it comes to apples, we constantly \nhave to answer questions about phytosanitary issues, and we have to \nconstantly talk about ways we can make sure we gain access to those \nmarketplaces. Science and research are the only ways we can fight some \nof these trade barriers that exist when our products can't get into \nthose countries. So we need to make sure we continue to fight that.\n  Lastly, I am very pleased about pulse crops--peas, lentils, things \nlike chickpeas. I am sure a lot of people ate a lot of hummus over the \nweekend while they were watching the Super Bowl and the Seattle \nSeahawks victory. Hummus is a crop that has exploded 500 percent in the \nlast 15 years. It is definitely a product people have been consuming \nall over the world for a long time, but we in the United States are \nstarting to consume more of it. The fact that product has had such a \nhuge increase has given our farmers in Washington State great \nopportunity. But this product is also a very healthy product and one \nthat we fought hard to make sure would be included in a new school \nlunch program, something where students could get access to a high-\nprotein, high-fiber product that certainly is more affordable for our \nschools. With the research that is going to go on on pulse crop \nderivatives and the fact that school lunches are now going to have the \nopportunity to serve pulse crops more aggressively, we are very excited \nabout this farm bill.\n  I thank my colleagues in the Senate, Senators Crapo and Risch. I also \nthank my colleagues from South Dakota and North Dakota for helping \nbecause both States are very big on these pulse crops. They certainly \nhelped to make sure this stayed in the conference report.\n  To all of my colleagues, please vote for a bill that will really help \nour economy, will help us tackle the growing middle class around the \nworld and keep America putting great products on those market shelves \nand help create more jobs in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am proud of what we were able to \naccomplish in the nutrition title of the Farm Bill. It achieves \nimportant reforms in SNAP, but also protects food assistance for \nfamilies, many of whom never dreamed that they would need help putting \nfood on their table. We are adopting important reforms to clarify the \nlaw or rules in a few places where members had legitimate concerns. At \nthe same time, and perhaps more importantly, we are rejecting many \ndraconian proposals that would have caused serious harm to program \nparticipants by slashing benefits or kicking families off of SNAP, \nundermining the primary purpose and the basic framework of the program.\n  Let's start by reviewing some of the improvements we made to SNAP to \naddress concerns around minor eligibility issues.\n  In Michigan, we discovered two lottery winners were continuing to \nreceive benefits after winning a million dollars. In a program with 46 \nmillion participants, this really is an example of a very rare problem. \nNevertheless, we want to make absolutely clear in federal law that \nindividuals who win the lottery are not eligible for SNAP. So we \ntightened rules in a way to ensure that not even one lottery winner can \nget SNAP. But we also wanted to make sure that this prohibition does \nnot result in a burdensome new requirement to ask all applicants and \nparticipants if they had recently won the lottery.\n  The provision requires that State SNAP agencies and local lotteries \nand gaming commissions set up data-sharing to ensure that the SNAP \nagency is informed when individuals win substantial sums of money. A \nSNAP agency can then take action to contact the winning participant and \nreview their eligibility in light of these major winnings. I'm pleased \nthat we managed to find a way to address this problem without imposing \nnew requirements on the millions of struggling low income households \nwho participate in this program. There is no need to put questions \nabout the lottery or gambling on the application form, and we expect \nUSDA to ensure that won't happen. In other words, this change allows us \nto use our data and technology to prevent this extremely rare event \nfrom happening again without putting new burdens on participants.\n  States will apply regular income and asset tests apply to lottery \nwinners--if someone has winnings that make them ineligible, they can be \ndisqualified from SNAP. But if that person paid off debts or was able \nto finally afford costly home repair or health care and now had income \nthat made them eligible, they have every right to receive SNAP \nbenefits.\n  Another area of eligibility that follows the same principle on \nimplementation is eligibility for ex-offenders felons who are fleeing \ncriminal justice. Current SNAP law prohibits people with criminal \nrecords who are fleeing from law enforcement or violating the terms of \ntheir parole from participating in SNAP. Because criminal law\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\nis a complicated mix of federal and State statutes and definitions, \nmembers wanted to make very clear that people committing odious crimes \nwould be ineligible for SNAP if they were fleeing or violating their \nparole. This does not apply to any convicted criminal who satisfies his \nor her debt to society by serving out the sentence and complying with \nany court order. So, it's a narrow group of people that we're \nhighlighting. For that reason, we do not expect any changes to the SNAP \napplication and eligibility process. Applicants are already asked about \ntheir fleeing felon status, so we expect that additional inquiries \nabout applicants' criminal records will not be necessary.\n  We did include one provision that will result in a cut to SNAP \nbenefits for some households. Some States have been providing as little \nas $1 in heating assistance for the sole purpose of qualifying \nrecipients for higher benefit. While I agree that SNAP benefits are \noften insufficient to cover a family's food needs over the course of a \nmonth, the very structure of SNAP is meant to award benefits based on \nhow much money a family has available to purchase food. Providing $1 in \nheating assistance skews benefits away from this income and expense \nbased system. So the change we made means a SNAP recipient now must \nreceive $20 in heating assistance to qualify for the Standard Utility \nAllowance. If you do not receive at least $20 in low income heating \nassistance, you will need to produce a utility bill. This is intended \nto make the energy assistance a real contribution to the actual \nexpenses of a poor household. Congress never intended to permit \nhouseholds that don't have heating or cooling costs because they are \nincluded in rent or covered by the landlord to get a deduction as if \nthey did have expenses. The law is ambiguous on this point, so this \nbill would clarify the issue.\n  When we decided to make this change, I insisted that we do it in a \nway that did not harm any household that had actual heating or cooling \ncosts, including costs passed on by a landlord or shared with another \nfamily. That means we expect USDA to make three things a priority when \noverseeing State implementation of this change. One priority is that \nanyone currently getting this $1 in energy assistance must be given a \nchance to show whether they have energy costs of any kind. I think many \nof these households will have these costs and qualify for the deduction \nthat raises their benefits. That's how the current program works in the \nmajority of States that do not offer this minimal energy assistance. \nStates must give households a chance to document actual costs. I expect \nUSDA to provide guidance to States to ensure that reflects many \ndifferent living scenarios that low-income households experience are \ntaken into account when implementing this change.\n  The second priority for USDA is to make clear that this change should \nhave no effect on anyone currently receive a more typical LIHEAP \npayment. We continue to support the connection between SNAP and LIHEAP \nand do not expect these changes to cause problems for the majority of \npeople who rely on and receive LIHEAP, or are applying and are likely \nto receive it, in getting the SNAP utility deduction. I know this puts \nthe burden on States to make sure their application process and benefit \ncalculations are performed in a way that allows them to determine \neveryone eligible for the deduction based on receiving energy \nassistance. We expect households to be given the opportunity to attest \nto their participation in LIHEAP. Many States offer that option to \nhouseholds now, and we do not intend to change that. We expect that a \nState SNAP agency could certify that its State State does not provide \nLIHEAP payments of less than $20 per year. This would mean there is no \nneed for households to provide information about the amount of LIHEAP \nthey receive or the method or frequency of those payments. We expect \nthe Secretary to monitor this change closely and help States come up \nwith the least burdensome implementation options available. Because CBO \ndid not assume any savings from reduced benefits in States that have \nnot implemented this practice, we expect the Secretary to implement \nthis change in a way that is consistent with the intent to not impact \nthose States.\n  Although we did provide States the flexibility to phase in the \nprovision for most participating households, I remain concerned that \nthe timetable for implementation of these changes is short. For new \napplicants and households, the provision is effective just 30 days \nafter enactment. Under SNAP regulations, States will be protected from \nbeing cited for errors during the first few months after enactment. \nHowever, low-income households do not have the same administrative \nprotection. It is possible that they could receive higher benefits as a \nresult of the State not being able to convert its systems quickly \nenough. I urge the Secretary to work with States to waive any household \nliability that results from receiving slightly higher benefits because \nStates were unable to implement the provision in a timely manner.\n  Let me turn now to a significant outcome in the nutrition title. I am \nparticularly pleased with the reforms that we have proposed to SNAP's \nemployment and training program. A key element of that effort is a new \ndemonstration project to test innovative strategies to help build \nindividuals' skills and employability. The majority of adults enrolled \nin SNAP who can work do. Even more work just before or just after their \nparticipation in SNAP. Nevertheless, all of the conferees had a shared \ngoal of exploring whether there were ways that SNAP could more \naffirmatively support SNAP participants' desire to work and improve \ntheir and their families' situation. We agreed to look for ways to help \nadults get the training, support and encouragement to find suitable \nemployment. Of course, we had to do this in an environment with very \nconstrained resources.\n  We worked on a package of ideas that would make better use of \nexisting federal resources, provide modest new sums of money for SNAP \nemployment and training and provided funding to test innovative new \napproaches. We wanted to be sure that by the time of the next \nreauthorization we would have a better sense of what kinds of services \nStates were offering, what was producing results for families, and that \nUSDA would have more capacity to oversee an employment and training \neffort.\n  The bill provides $200 million to for up to 10 State pilot projects \nthat will test new strategies to support individuals to return to work, \nenhance their skills to improve their earnings, and address households' \nbarriers to work. The pilot will operate within SNAP's employment and \ntraining program framework, but we have also expanded the types of \nactivities that can be offered. Now States will have the option to \ninclude activities offered through the State's cash assistance as well \nas supportive services that are allowed under SNAP. States can use the \nfunding to cover the mandated supportive services, such as child care, \nfor participants in the pilot. Moreover they can test whether \nsupportive services such as child care or transitional housing are \nappropriate interventions on their own. After all, a mother with safe, \nstable high quality child care is far more likely to be able to look \nfor and maintain employment than one without such help. Similarly an \nindividual with a place to live is far more likely to find and keep \nemployment than someone without housing.\n  It was important to me to include unsubsidized employment as an \nallowable activity because that's ultimately what we want all job \ntraining participants to find. This required some careful \nconsideration. Private employment is a different kind of activity than \na class or program run and monitored by the State. States, very \nunderstandably, will have very limited ability to oversee private \nemployment situations. So we wanted to ensure that the kinds of \nprotections that exist in the private labor market, such as workplace \nprotection laws, health and safety standards and wage and hour \nprotections also apply to any private employment programs under SNAP \nemployment and training programs. We also made clear that placements \ninto unsubsidized employment cannot displace an existing worker at the \nemployment site. That has long been the rule under other types of SNAP \nemployment and training programs, and we expect the same here. I expect \nthat USDA will issue comprehensive standards that incorporate all \nexisting SNAP protections as well as the appropriate private employee \nprotections such as the Fair\n\n[[Page S732]]\n\nLabor Standards Act into the requirements for offering unsubsidized \nemployment. Despite that responsibility, I hope USDA shares my \nexcitement that including unsubsidized employment as an education and \ntraining activity is an unprecedented opportunity to support low-income \nindividuals as they enter or rejoin the workforce.\n  I specifically focus on one challenge in offering unsubsidized work. \nThe pilot projects will allow States to apply SNAP's sanction policy to \nany individual who is assigned a work activity, but willfully refuses, \nwithout good cause, to take an action that he or she could safely take. \nIn the traditional education and training setting, it is usually--\nthough not always--relatively straightforward to determine whether an \nindividual has complied. Did the person participate in the required \nactivity? If not, did the person have good cause, like sickness, not to \ndo so? But in the unsubsidized work placement, it may be difficult to \nmake the correct assessment when an individual does not meet the work \nrequirement. The private employer may have reduced work hours or \ntransferred the individual into a position for which they are clearly \nnot qualified. Such action does not speak to the individual's \nwillingness to work. Because of the inherent challenges in determining \ncompliance with unsubsidized work activities, the pilot program \nrequires clear evidence that an individual willfully refused to take a \nsafe and proper action without good cause before the State can subject \nhim or her to sanctions. I also encourage the Secretary to issue \nguidance about the very limited circumstances under which a person who \nis working could be sanctioned for losing his or her job. When someone \nwho is working loses the job for reasons beyond their control, we want \nto ensure they are not doubly punished by losing SNAP benefits as well.\n  The only way we will know if the pilot projects are succeeding is if \nwe have a high quality, longitudinal evaluation. So any State applying \nto conduct a pilot must also participate in a comprehensive evaluation \nto determine what works and what doesn't. We want to measure actual \noutcomes--employment and changes in earnings, as well as documented \nimprovements in a participant's skills, training and experience, since \nsuccessfully completing a job training program is not a guarantee of \nimmediate employment. We also want to better understand how to ensure \nthat the assessment of each job training participant helps match the \nindividual with the training or support best suited for their needs. \nAfter all, if a job training volunteer really just needs help with \nchild care or transportation in order to accept a job offer, we don't \nwant that person assigned to job search or workfare. Assessment is \nalready a requirement under federal rules. Gaining more insight into \nhow a good assessment and assignment system can improve participant \noutcomes may be one of the most cost-effective lessons we can hope to \ngain from this effort.\n  This is an area where I want to thank my fellow conferees for all of \ntheir hard work. We came to the conference with very different ideas \nabout what the issues facing the program and clients are, and what \nSNAP's approach towards promoting work out to be. We spent a tremendous \namount of time educating ourselves about the issues, the opportunities \nand the risks of various approaches. I believe we ended up with a \nstronger program that encourages work without penalizing those who are \nwilling to work but unable to find a job in this economy. The pilot \nprogram represents a true compromise and an important step forward in \nhelping low-income Americans succeed in the labor market.\n  In addition to the pilot projects, the bill requires States to begin \nmeasuring actual individual-based outcomes from participating in job \ntraining. We directed USDA to compile and analyze this information so \nwe can learn what kinds of services work best to provide SNAP \nparticipants with the skills and experience they need to find \nemployment. Because matching an individual's employment needs to an \nappropriate program or service is critical to positive employment \noutcomes, this review should include a focus on the individualized \nassessment that is required of SNAP work registrants. As I mentioned \nearlier, this is an aspect of employment and training that is already \nrequired. Understanding individuals' needs and abilities is crucial to \nmatching them to a job training or work program where they can succeed. \nThat is the first important step in making future improvement in the \nprogram. We were very clear that successful outcomes can mean more than \na full-time job placement. We expect that the State outcome data \nreflect this by including measures of improved employability, like \neducational attainment, credentials and work experience. We also expect \nUSDA's analysis to acknowledge the reality that getting suitable \nemployment may take more than the completion of a job training course. \nThis admittedly increases the attention both USDA and the States must \nplace on their education and training programs, but it will give us \ninvaluable information about how best to meet the needs of SNAP \nparticipants.\n  Another area of the legislation where we made some important \ninvestments is enhancing USDA's efforts to combat fraud. The agency has \ndone a remarkable job of identifying and preventing fraud and \ntrafficking; even as household and retailer participation grew \ndrastically, fraud remained at a historic low percentage. So we \ntargeted every small area we could to improve the integrity of the \nprogram.\n  We've increased funding for USDA to address retailer fraud through \ndata mining and expand State and federal partnerships to combat \nretailer fraud. Historically, States have pursued household fraud and \nUSDA has dealt with retailer fraud. But, in some cases, the fraudulent \nactivity involves both types of parties, so we're creating pilot \nprojects to see how collaboration can help stretch resources. While \nStates have done a good job with their responsibility to prevent and \nprosecute fraud, some States have developed troubling techniques that \npressure innocent low-income households to admit wrongdoing. When USDA \nselects States to partner with, we intend that they prioritize States \nthat have a record of addressing fraud through investigations, hearings \nand actual third-party findings of fraud. We urge USDA to take a close \nlook at States that have a high number of disqualifications that come \nfrom client confessions in the absence of investigations. States that \nare ready to take on new responsibilities under the pilot must be those \nthat ensure their disqualifications are in fact a result of documented \nfraud.\n  Another provision deals with a rare, but important, participant \nintegrity issue. SNAP benefits are paid on a debit card we call \nElectronic Benefit Transfer or EBT cards. Clients use these at the \ngrocery store to buy food just like any other consumer. Clients who \nlose their card can request replacements. That's an important customer \nservice feature which ensures needy households don't lose the \nassistance they need. However, some households requesting multiple \nreplacements may raise red flags. Multiple care replacements might be \nan indication that the household needs help in how to use the debit \ncard. In other cases, multiple replacements could be an indication that \nan individual in the household is trying to sell the card.\n  The farm bill requires the household to provide an explanation when \nthey request an excessive number of replacements in a given year. In \norder for this to be helpful in fighting fraud, rather than become a \nburden on innocent households that struggle to keep their cards, we \nadded a set of protections that USDA must implement. After consultation \nwith the Department, we expect they would consider it excessive if a \nhousehold requested more than four replacement cards per year. USDA's \nown analysis indicates that fraud is only an issue when the requests \nare that frequent. Second, the provision requires that households be \ngiven the flexibility in how they want to provide their explanation. In \nparticular, States may not require households to go to the local SNAP \noffice or to be interviewed about their card loss. The goal was to \navoid undue burdens on households, including those who are working, are \nhomebound, or who may not have the means to travel to a SNAP office. \nThis provision also does not empower the State to withhold household \nbenefits based on the household's explanation. If the State questions \nthe validity of the household's reason, we\n\n[[Page S733]]\n\nencourage the State to pursue a fraud investigation. SNAP has processes \nin place already for program violations and we expect these processes \nto be followed. This provision does not expand or alter that authority.\n  Finally, it is important to emphasize that this process is not just a \nway to identify potential fraud; it's also a way to identify households \nthat need help in using the benefits they are eligible for. There are \nmany perfectly legitimate reasons to need a new card, and we intended \nthat this integrity measure not entrap households that have done \nnothing wrong. That's why we require USDA to include specific \nprotections for the homeless, people with disabilities and victims of \ncrime. My colleague, Senator Harkin, has led the way in championing the \nneeds of people with disabilities and making clear that federal \nprograms have an obligation to provide such individuals accommodation. \nWe expect this provision to result in States' intensifying their \nefforts to identify and assist individuals who would benefit from more \nassistance.\n  SNAP retailers operate within a rapidly changing food retail \nenvironment. We've seen fundamental changes in the way food is sold \nsince the last farm bill, so the conferees sought to make some changes \nin the way SNAP benefits can be redeemed. This farm bill will direct \nUSDA to conduct pilots to test both mobile technologies, like smart \nphone apps, and online technologies. These pilots offer an exciting \nopportunity for farmers markets and other small retailers who find the \npoint-of-sale EBT equipment to be too expensive or cumbersome. They \nalso provide access to SNAP recipients that may have real physical or \ngeographical challenges in getting to the store. But one of the risks \nof embracing new technology is that bad actors will find a way to \ndefraud the program. So we included a set of protections, for both \nrecipients and retailers, and expect USDA to carefully monitor the \npilot programs for evidence of fraud. This may require USDA to develop \nstandards of transparence and recordkeeping for mobile technologies \nthat differ from those used in traditional brick-and-mortar stores. \nMost online retailers charge a fee for the delivery of food. For low-\nincome SNAP participants, fees like that can really cut into their food \nbudget. We were clear that SNAP benefits cannot be used to pay for any \ndelivery fee or premium, and we required that the cost of food be the \nsame as the in-the-store price, but we cannot prevent retailers from \ncharging for delivery. So we urge USDA to pay special attention to \nthese fees and be willing to deny participation to entities that cannot \nensure that fees will be minimal. We also want USDA to assess whether \nfees undermine the ability of a household to afford an adequate diet \nwith SNAP benefits.\n  Since we are moving towards adapting SNAP to emerging retail trends, \nI'd like to note what we did not do in this bill. First, we have not \nremoved the requirement that SNAP households be treated the same as \nother customers. Whatever steps States and USDA take to modernize \nbenefit redemption methods cannot result in overt identification of \nSNAP households, such as SNAP-only lanes in grocery stores.\n  Because technology continues to evolve, we included several \nprovisions that have to do with ``data matches.'' Data matching is \nwhere the SNAP agency or eligibility worker can check information about \nSNAP participants' household circumstances with third party data bases. \nWhen done well, this is a cost effective means to test the veracity of \nclient statements as well as to catch information that client may fail \nto provide the program. If done poorly, data matching can result in \nlots of confusing data matches that do not actually improve \nverification. We don't want States to undertake data matching for data \nmatching's sake. The point is to empower States with good information \nat the right time to inform effective eligibility processing.\n  First, we include a provision to add federal standards for data \nexchanges to SNAP so that SNAP can more easily share data with other \nprograms. This is a commonsense provision that will ensure that across \nthe various State and federal programs, our systems can ``talk'' with \none another other. SNAP law and the privacy act protects client's \npersonal privacy and this authority does not change that obligation.\n  Second, we required States to use the Department of Health and Human \nServices' National Directory of New Hires (NDNH). This database \nprimarily is for State child support agencies to learn information \nabout the employment of noncustodial parents who live or work in other \nStates and States currently have the option to use it for SNAP. By \nrequiring its use at the time a household is certified for SNAP, we \nbelieve it can help States determine eligibility and the correct level \nof benefits. We do not, however, dictate how States must use the data.\n  Third, the bill codifies the existing State practice of verifying \nimmigration status by using the Citizenship and Immigration Services \ndatabase for immigrants' status through the federal Systemic Alien \nVerification for Entitlements program. Currently in SNAP, States have \nthe option to use SAVE and nearly every State currently does. The Food \nand Nutrition Act references SAVE and another database, the Income \nEligibility Verification Systems, or IEVS, in the same place in the \nSocial Security Act. I want to make clear that we are only mandating \nStates use SAVE. We did not intend to change anything about how States \nuse IEVS--use of that database would continue to be optional for \nStates. Longstanding SNAP policy has required rigorous verification \nprocedures, and IEVS is one of many ways to get information to ensure \ncorrect eligibility decisions.\n  We want States to have a plan for using the data available to them. \nThe goal is not to require data matches that States know to be \nunhelpful, or where they determine it is not cost-effective to do so. \nMoreover, we are not pressing States to run afoul of simplified \nreporting and check these databases between reviews. In our last two \nfarm bills, we took great pains to reduce needless paperwork burdens on \nStates and households between certifications. These changes are not \nmeant to override the framework of simplified reporting. Instead, \nStates will use third-party data to make periodic reviews as accurate \nas efficiently possible while always providing participants the ability \nto challenge data matches they believe to be inaccurate.\n  The nutrition title also takes steps to ensure that federal funds \nused to inform Americans about the SNAP cannot be used in inappropriate \nways. To be clear, USDA has done a fine and necessary job getting \ninformation about SNAP to low-income households that struggle to put \nfood on the table. The program cannot be effective if those who may \nneed it are unaware of its existence or believe they are not eligible. \nMoreover, outreach and program promotional materials can be helpful to \nimproving program integrity. Applicants and clients who are informed \nabout their responsibilities and educated about what the application \nprocess entails will be better prepared to complete the application and \nrenew process. That's likely to increase program accuracy, reduce fraud \nand enhance overall efficiencies.\n  It's important that we provide low-income households with accurate \ninformation about the program, just as we do with Social Security or \nMedicare benefits. That's the only way that individuals can make the \nright choice for them about whether or not to apply. In this bill, \nCongress continues to support this kind of information sharing, while \nclarifying that aggressive recruitment, including recruitment outside \nof the United States, is not permissible. Recruitment is trying to \npersuade or convince someone who has made an informed decision not to \napply to change his or her mind. That hasn't been a permissible \nactivity, and the bill simply codifies that practice. Providing and \nproducing positive information about the program and the benefits of \napplying or assisting households to navigate the complicated \napplication process would still be permitted. We expect the agency will \ncontinue to provide necessary information while ensuring that education \nfunds are used appropriately.\n  As I said at the start, this bill is not perfect. I much prefer to be \ndiscussing more ways we could better ensure SNAP benefits were adequate \nto help families have enough healthy food throughout the month. \nHowever, I continue to believe this farm bill protects SNAP, which is \nthe best defense we have against hunger in our communities. We have \ncontinued the long tradition in the Agriculture Committee of\n\n[[Page S734]]\n\nbipartisan support for the program. This was not an easy task, given \nhow far apart the House and Senate were just a few months ago. This \nfarm bill is an important step in dealing with the most important food \nand agricultural issues facing the nation today. I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  I understand we will recessing for lunch in a moment, but there are \nsome very important people I would like to thank today. I wish to take \nthis moment before we have the final vote to do so. I know, listening \nto other colleagues, as we come to major pieces of legislation, at the \nend they talk about the importance of their staff. I have come to \nrealize just how powerful those words are. I have been blessed with an \nincredibly talented, hard-working staff. They are the reason we are \nhere today talking about the Agricultural Act of 2014. Every single one \nof them should be very proud of their contribution, as I am proud of \nthem.\n  This certainly starts with our staff director Chris Adamo. We have \nbeen on speed dial for so long, I am sure I will be doing that probably \nout of habit from now on, day and night. I appreciate his incredible \nleadership, tenacity, talent, and hard work. Chris deserves a \ntremendous amount of credit for leading us with his team. I thank him.\n  I also thank Joe Schultz, who is our chief economist. No matter what \nthe problem, he seemed to make the numbers add up, whether it is the \ncommodity title, crop insurance, or dairy. When at the very end it \nbecame very clear that after 3 years of hard work and passing a dairy \npolicy, it wouldn't get the support of the House Republicans and we \nwere going to have to rewrite it in a week and a half--which was no \nsmall thing--Joe continued to give us the right kind of advice. I am \nproud to say that we started with a commitment to have $23 billion in \ndeficit reduction, counting our sequestration and spending cuts, and we \nhave ended with $23 billion in deficit reduction and spending \nreductions in agriculture. Joe has been a huge reason why we have been \nable to get there.\n  I thank Jonathan Cordone, who is our chief counsel. He made sure we \nwere right on the process and worked specifically on issues such as \ntrust funds with many colleges and around the complex areas to help \nthem to be able to meet the issues of their States. There were \nimportant issues, such as payment reforms and a number of legal issues. \nHe has been an incredibly valuable and important member.\n  Russ Benham is our counsel on regulatory issues. Some of the trust \nfund issues we had to address related to regulatory issues and forestry \nissues. We are very proud that in this bill there is an agriculture \nadvisory committee to the EPA, moving forward on rules. It is extremely \nsignificant to have the voice of agriculture involved with the EPA in a \nformal way. In this and so many other areas, Russ has been very \ninstrumental.\n  To our conservation team, Tina May is amazing. She is going back to \nthe USDA next week to help lead the implementation, which gives me \nconfidence that this is really going to be done as we intended. Tina \nMay's brilliance in strategy, negotiation, and commitment on these \nissues is unmatched. Her team is Kevin Norton and Hanna AbouElSeoud. \nThe area of conservation is really landmark in reforms, protecting our \nland, water, conservation compliance, and setting real standards around \nstrong conservation practices and in forestry as well. These are \nimportant areas that we have addressed in forestry and international \nfood aid--America's opportunity to fulfill our values around the world \nand create more flexibility for us to help feed a hungry world.\n  Karla Thieman is also on speed dial. The very last phone calls I was \nmaking and emails before we wrote and finalized the conference report \nwere with Karla and Chris. Our energy title is about jobs and about \nenergy efficiency. I am so proud of what we were able to do; a landmark \nenergy title; livestock disaster assistance, all of the areas that \nsupport livestock and, again, dairy. Karla was our lead on dairy. I \nthink we may have finally stopped waking up in the middle of the night, \ndreaming about dairy policy. I am not sure, but we are getting there.\n  Cory Claussen led our efforts on farm credit and beginning farmers. I \nam so proud we have added our veterans to the support there. I thank \nhim so much.\n  Brandon McBride--rural development, jobs, and quality of life in \nrural America. Brandon led our effort to make sure we were \nstrengthening tools for businesses and local units of government and \nall of those who count on rural development; also research, a new \nresearch foundation and partnership, a real commitment to research in a \nway we have not seen before. I thank Brandon for leading that effort.\n  Of course, on nutrition, fruits and vegetables, Jacqlyn Schneider and \nKatie Naessens led an extremely complicated area. Jacqlyn had to \nnegotiate some very difficult areas. I am proud to say that we rejected \nevery harmful policy in the House bill. Because of Jacqlyn and Katie's \nefforts, we have a strengthened commitment to organics and farmers \nmarkets, fresh fruit and vegetables for our children's schools, and so \nmany other areas in which we are beginning to change the paradigm about \nlocal food systems and strengthening opportunities for local markets \nfor our farmers.\n  Grant Colvin has worked so hard on commodities as well as livestock \nand trade and, of course, exports. They are so very important to us. It \nis an area of real strength and jobs for our country. I thank Grant for \nall of his expertise.\n  As staff assistants, Alexis Stanczuk and Kyle Varner helped the \nentire team every step of the way. They have been there to help us on \nevery single project, every single effort we needed help with. I thank \nAlexis and Kyle.\n  Jessie Williams and Nicole Hertenstein are clerks. Their entire team \nbasically kept the whole thing together. They made sure we were doing \nthe right thing on point. I thank Jessie, Nicole, and their team as \nwell.\n\n  Finally, I would like to thank my personal staff.\n  Bill Sweeney, my chief of staff, has been with me in a multitude of \ndifferent capacities--from telling the story on the floor with our \ncharts to making sure we had a coordinated team between the Agriculture \nCommittee staff and all of the talented people on my personal staff, as \nwell as wonderful strategy advice. Bill, as my chief of staff, I am \nproud to say, has been invaluable in this process.\n  Matt VanKuiken, my legislative director, worked as a team every \nsingle step of the way.\n  Our press team, when we looked at telling the story of the new farm \nbill approach, Cullen Schwarz, Ben Becker, Alex Barriger, Will Eberle, \nand Matt Williams--they were telling this story and getting the facts \nout every step of the way.\n  My State team, led by my State director Teresa Plachetka, Kali Fox, \nMary Judnich, Brandon Fewins, Korey Hall, Jeremy Hosking, and Adrian \nWalker--they made sure Michigan's voice was heard in every part of this \nbill, a tremendous amount of hard work. This bill is better, certainly, \nfor Michigan as a result of all their efforts.\n  Kasey Gillette in Senator Reid's office worked as our partner on \neverything.\n  Gary Myrick, Trish Engle, Tim Mitchell, and all of our floor staff--I \nthank them for all of their patience as we have passed this once, \npassed this twice, and finally we are going to pass the conference \nreport this afternoon.\n  I also thank legislative counsel Michelle Johnson-Wieder and Gary \nEndicott.\n  I thank Senator Cochran's staff of T.A. Hawks and James Glick for \ntheir partnership and excellent work.\n  Finally, I thank Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack and the USDA. The \ntechnical expertise we have received on every single section has been \nabsolutely invaluable. When it came to the final days on dairy, the \nSecretary played a very critical role in helping us get the compromise \nthat will allow us to meet the goals and address farmers all over the \ncountry.\n  Last but not least, I thank the Congressional Budget Office, which we \ncalled on day and night. We appreciate their efforts.\n  I appreciate the patience of the Presiding Officer, who allowed me to \nspeak at this time to make sure we had a chance to say thank you to a \nlot of folks who deserve, as usual, a tremendous amount of credit for \ngetting this done. They are the folks behind the scenes who have made \nthis happen. I am very proud of each and every one of them.\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/04/senate-section/article/S735-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 20 \nminutes equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees. If no time is yielded, time will be equally charged to both \nsides.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, we have heard a lot from colleagues \nthe last 2 days about just how important this farm bill is, and that is \nbecause there is so much more in this bill than what we would call a \nfarm bill. It is really 12 different pieces of legislation, from farm \nto research, to fruits and vegetables, to energy across the board all \nput together in something we call the farm bill.\n  This is, most importantly, a major bipartisan jobs bill that makes \nsure the 16 million people who work in agriculture--from Michigan to \nMississippi, to Minnesota, to Oklahoma, and everywhere in between--have \nthe support they need.\n  This is an exports bill that will help expand opportunities for \nAmerican agricultural exports, one of the few areas where our Nation \nmaintains a healthy, robust trade surplus.\n  This is a research bill that will make a permanent long-term \ncommitment through a new public-private foundation and other \ninvestments that will allow us to find solutions to pests and diseases \nand focus on innovations for the future.\n  This is an energy bill that will help create the next generation of \nbiofuel to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and will help farmers \nand rural small business owners generate their own power to improve \nenergy efficiency and lower their costs for their businesses.\n  This is an economic development bill that will help rural businesses \nand communities get broadband Internet access so they can find new \ncustomers and compete and connect around the country and around the \nworld.\n  This is a conservation bill that helps farmers and ranchers protect \nour precious land and water resources. This is our country's largest \ninvestment in conservation on private lands that we make as Americans. \nMost of our land is privately owned. It includes a historic new \nagreement between commodity and conservation groups that ties \nconservation compliance with crop insurance so we are being the best \npossible stewards of our land.\n  This bill will save taxpayers money and conserve our lands and waters \nfor years to come by preserving millions of acres of wildlife habitat, \nwhich in turn has helped rebuild populations of ducks and quail and \npheasants, among others. That is why the bill has the strong support of \nthe National Wildlife Federation, Ducks Unlimited, the Nature \nConservancy, Pheasants Forever, and the World Wildlife Fund, which are \nonly a handful of the more than 250 conservation groups that have \nendorsed this farm bill.\n  This is a nutrition bill that makes sure families have a safety net, \njust as we do for farmers. The savings in food assistance comes solely \nthrough addressing fraud and misuse while maintaining and protecting \ncritical benefits for those who need help, most often temporarily, \nputting food on the table for their families while they get back on \ntheir feet after having lost their job.\n  It strengthens the integrity and accountability of SNAP, making sure \nevery single dollar goes to families in need while they get back on \ntheir feet. It gives our children more healthy food options in schools \nand will help bring more healthy, locally grown food into our \ncommunities.\n  This is a deficit reduction bill that will save taxpayers $23 \nbillion. All together we have cut spending, a portion of it accounts \nthrough sequestration, the rest in additional spending in this bill, \nwhere we have voluntarily--as I have often said--voluntarily agreed to \ncut spending in our own area of jurisdiction. By the way, that $23 \nbillion is more than double the amount of agricultural cuts recommended \nby the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission.\n  This is a reform bill that contains the greatest reforms to \nagricultural programs in decades. We have finally ended direct payment \nsubsidies which are given to farmers even in good times. Instead, we \nmove to a responsible risk-management approach that only gives farmers \nassistance when they experience a loss. This farm bill is focused on \nthe future, not the past. This bill is taking a critical step toward \nchanging the paradigm of agriculture and the broad range of \nagricultural production in this country.\n  This bill has the support of over 370 groups and counting from all \nparts of the country and ideological backgrounds. That is because as we \nwrote this bill we worked hard to find common ground to develop a bill \nthat works for every kind of agricultural production in every region of \nour country. We worked hard and together--and I want to thank my \nranking member, the distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, for \nhis leadership and partnership in this effort--we have included \nvaluable input from both sides of the aisle and from the House and the \nSenate. I wish to thank all of our colleagues for their ideas, for \ntheir willingness to put partisanship aside and work together. This is \nan example of how we can get work done, and I hope it is just one step \nof a productive year moving forward.\n  Thanks to all that work, we have arrived at a farm bill that works \nfor all of America--for families and farmers, for consumers, for those \nwho care so deeply about protecting our lands and our water. This bill \nwill strengthen agriculture for years to come. It is time to pass it. \nIt is time to get it to the President for signature.\n  Every single Senator in this Chamber has constituents who work and \nbenefit from agriculture, and certainly just coming from lunch today we \nshould each be thanking a farmer for the safest, most affordable food \nsupply in the world.\n  After 491 days without a farm bill, our constituents need us to get \nthis done. I urge colleagues to join in a bipartisan way, as we have \nthroughout this process, to vote yes on this farm bill and to give our \nfarmers, our ranchers, and the rest of the 16 million people who work \nin agriculture the farm bill they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I first of all want to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan for her outstanding leadership of \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. As we proceeded \nfrom the hearings to review those suggestions being made for change and \nmodernization of our agriculture act to the final days of committee \nhearings and now full debate in the Senate and in the House, it comes \nto this final vote.\n  Last night there was a decisive vote of 72 to 22 to end debate on the \nfarm bill. That reflects the appreciation and respect the Senate has \nfor the work of this committee, led by our distinguished chairman, the \nSenator from Michigan. So I thank her, as well as our House committee \ncounterparts, Frank Lucas of Oklahoma and ranking member Collin \nPeterson of Minnesota, as well as the members of their staff, as we \nworked our way through the conference between the House and the Senate \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry leadership.\n  I wish to thank, too, our majority staff director Chris Adamo and all \nof Chairwoman Stabenow's staff for their hard work in developing this \nfarm bill. Our committee clerk Jessie Williams and her staff have also \nprovided great assistance throughout this process. They have worked \ndiligently and competently and thoughtfully on this legislation. Their \ndedication to developing the bill and the conference report led to long \ndays, many working weekends, and we do owe them a very strong debt of \ngratitude and commendation for this work product.\n  My staff director T.A. Hawks has been at the job, it seems like, day \nand night for a long time to help make sure we pass a bill that \nreflects the sentiment and the suggestions for this Congress for \nmodernization of our agriculture legislation. James Glueck also worked \nclosely with T.A. Hawks and has been a trusted adviser. I am grateful \nfor his good help as well.\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\n  All of our staff members have done great work in helping move the \nfarm bill to a successful conclusion and the approval by the Senate of \nthis work. My personal office agriculture LA Daniel Ulmer also was \ninvolved in the work of this committee and advising me personally as we \nworked our way to the conclusion of our responsibilities. He worked \nvery closely with the committee to help develop the farm bill; \nlikewise, chief of staff Bruce Evans, legislative director Adam Telle, \nlegislative aide Bennett Mize, and others from my staff have added \nvaluable input into this process, and I appreciate their good work.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I realize we will be having the vote \nat 2:35, so let me just take one more moment to stress how important it \nis that we recognize this was an effort in good faith between the House \nand the Senate and Republicans and Democrats.\n  I too wish to join with my ranking member Senator Cochran in thanking \nthe chairman in the House Frank Lucas. He and ranking member Collin \nPeterson were true partners with us as we moved through this process.\n  We actually started about 2\\1/2\\ years ago when the supercommittee on \ndeficit reduction at that time asked each committee to come up with a \nway to reduce the deficit, to cut spending in their area of \njurisdiction. We decided to do it a little differently. Chairman Lucas \nand I talked and we decided the four of us would get together and \nactually come up with a House-Senate, Democratic-Republican \nrecommendation that would be solidly supported by all sides. So it was \na prenegotiation on the farm bill that we were going to be doing in the \nnext year.\n  So in July, August of 2011, we sat down and started going through \nways we could save dollars. We all agreed direct payment subsidies \ncould no longer be justified and needed to be eliminated. We also knew \nit was important to have a safety net for our farmers, and disaster \nassistance for our ranchers and farmers as well, and that we needed to \nhelp them manage their risk. We came up with an approach which took \npart of the dollars we cut and put it back into strengthening risk \nmanagement tools, such as crop insurance--which is just like any other \ninsurance: you pay a premium, you get a bill--not a check--and you \ndon't get any kind of help unless you have a loss.\n  But we also took a look at other areas of the farm bill. We found \nthere were 23 different conservation programs. Every time somebody had \na good idea, we added a new program. We thought, let's go back and \nreally take a look at this. If we were starting from scratch, how would \nwe put together all these important programs and do it in a way that is \nmore user friendly for farmers and ranchers and organizations that work \non land and water preservation. So we went from 23 to 13 programs and \nput them in 4 different buckets, or subject areas, and we saved money.\n  Then we looked at every part of the farm bill. I asked our staff not \nto talk about programs but principles: What should we be doing? What \nshould the farm bill be doing for agriculture, for farmers, ranchers, \nfamilies, consumers, rural communities, job creators? Let's not protect \nprograms. Let's look broadly at principles.\n  So we did that, and we ended up eliminating about 100 different \nauthorization programs, consolidating, cutting down on duplication, \ndoing what I think Americans are asking us to do in every part of the \nFederal Government.\n  We then turned around to set priorities about where to invest, \nbecause it is not just cutting for cutting's sake, it is trying to make \nthings work better, be more effective, and save precious dollars, but \nat the same time investing in the future--investing in that which will \nstrengthen agriculture, create jobs, strengthen rural communities, and \nnew opportunities for the broad array of production, what consumers are \nasking for in organics, local food systems, and so on.\n  So we basically put together a plan that started with the deficit \nreduction process, the supercommittee, and we made a recommendation of \n$23 billion in cuts and deficit reduction. We all know that the broader \ndeficit reduction process did not proceed, but we decided to keep the \ncommitment to that $23 billion, and so we have. We have moved forward. \nPart of the cuts now that we have put into place have been accounted \nfor by the Budget Office as part of sequestration. Most have not. But \nwhen we add it all up, it is still $23 billion that we started with \nback in 2011, when the four of us together decided to sit down and \nlisten to each other, understand each other, find common ground, and \nmake some tough decisions about how we could do things better in the \narea of agriculture and the farm bill.\n  As we come to a close, I again thank colleagues who have given such \nvaluable input and been involved every step of the way. I hope everyone \nwill feel a sense of pride that this is something we have done \ntogether--that people expect us to do together, which is do our job, to \nmake decisions and to govern, and to operate in a way which allows us \nto listen to each other, find common ground, and get our work done.\n  Madam President, I yield back all remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

S. 1845, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1845) to provide for the extension of certain \n     unemployment benefits, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n\n[[Page S737]]\n\n\n       Reid (for Reed) amendment No. 2631, relating to extension \n     and modification of emergency unemployment compensation \n     program.\n       Reid amendment No. 2632 (to amendment No. 2631), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Finance, \n     with instructions, Reid amendment No. 2633, to change the \n     enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2634 (to (the instructions) amendment \n     No. 2633), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 2635 (to amendment No. 2634), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n\n                       Motion To Commit Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the pending motion to commit be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \npending amendment No. 2631.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Could we have order in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We have a number of ideas on this side of the aisle to \npromote economic growth and job creation, and we would like the \nopportunity to offer amendments to implement these ideas.\n  For example, Senator Paul has an amendment to create economic freedom \nzones to help struggling areas of our country to recover from the \neconomic downturn. Senator Tim Scott's SKILLS Act would improve job \ntraining programs for the very long-term unemployed that this extension \nis actually designed to help. In addition, Senators Ayotte, Collins, \nPortman, and others have been working very hard--Senator Coats as \nwell--to come up with a path forward on a meaningful offset that would \nextend unemployment benefits without adding to the deficit.\n  Their ideas have so far been blocked. So I would like to ask the \nmajority leader to modify his request to provide for an orderly process \nfor amendments. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments and \nmotions be withdrawn and that the minority and majority sides be \npermitted to offer amendments in alternating fashion so that these \nimportant ideas can be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, when we last \ndealt with unemployment insurance, I offered a unanimous consent \nrequest at that time that would have allowed up to 20 relevant \namendments--20.\n  Mr. President, my friend, the Republican leader--he is again, through \na lot of words, saying: We do not want this. We are not going to help \nyou pass it. There is more than one way to filibuster a bill. Providing \nfor an endless number of amendments is one of those ways to kill this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, what we are going to do here is offer a fully paid for \n3-month extension of unemployment insurance. Simple as that. Simple as \nthat. That is what the Republicans said they wanted, and we agreed to \ndo it.\n  We will not agree to an unlimited number of amendments. I look \nforward to hearing from my Republican colleagues if they have a \nproposal that is different than this, which is, again, a different way \nof saying: We do not care about unemployment compensation as it is now \nfocused, and we are not going to support it.\n  In the meantime, I object to an order providing amendments without \nlimit and without any commitment to vote on passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment No. \n2631.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine) is \nnecessarily absent\n  Mr. CORNYN.

I move to proceed to Calendar No. 298, S. 1963.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to Calendar No. 298, S. 1963, a bill to \n     repeal section 403 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum required \nunder rule XXII be waived for the cloture motions just filed and that \nWednesday, February 5, 2014, count as an intervening day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I want to take a moment to explain where we are. Over the \nlast few months, we have been struggling to find a way to help some \ndesperate people in our country. It is hard to find a way to convince \nour Republican colleagues that these people are in a desperate \nsituation and to join with us in extending unemployment insurance \nbenefits for 1.6 million of our fellow citizens.\n  Last month, we tried to pass a bipartisan bill that would simply \nextend those benefits on a short-term basis for 3 months. All but a few \nRepublicans voted against proceeding to that measure. Republicans \ncomplained that we had not paid for the extension, so we offered them a \npaid-for 11-month extension. Every Republican voted against the cloture \nmotion, every Republican, and all but one Republican voted against \ncloture on the bipartisan 3-month extension. So today we are trying yet \nagain, offering an amendment that extends unemployment benefits for 3 \nmonths and pays for that extension, not a disputed, controversial \nextension and certainly not a controversial pay-for. Our alternative \nalso includes something that Senator Coburn has been talking about for \nseveral months, an amendment to prevent millionaires from getting \nunemployment benefits, because it has happened. A person won a lottery \nand still got unemployment benefits.\n  Thursday, we are going to vote on cloture on that amendment, one that \nis paid for and would take care of this issue for lots of people. After \nthat have we will vote on cloture on the bill, as amended. In the \nmeantime, I am pleased to continue discussions with Senators about \nsetting up votes on the relevant amendments.\n  The Republican leader's proposal is an absolute absurdity. I don't \nknow why they just don't come out and say we are not going to do this, \nwe are not going to extend unemployment benefits. But they have \nalternating amendments, and they want amendments related to--George \nMitchell, who was the Democratic leader for a period of time that I \nserved here, a wonderful human being, his statement was don't depend on \nthe Republicans; they will break your heart every time, and that is \nwhat they are doing. They are breaking our hearts, and 1.6 million \npeople, their hearts are broken.\n  The main proponent of this bill has been Jack Reed of Rhode Island. \nJack Reed and I have a contest--I wish we didn't--and that is which \nState, Rhode Island or Nevada, has the highest unemployment number.\n  We care about this greatly, but others care about this. I am sure \nthere are some Republicans who care about it, but why are they hung up \non this foolishness that they can only do it if one time they have \nalternating amendments? They wouldn't take 20 amendments.\n  There are a handful of Republicans who tried very hard and worked in \ngood faith with Senator Reed of Rhode Island. But the problem is they \nhave no control over the tea-party-driven Republicans who make up most \nof this Republican caucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. We are at a critical moment. It has been 38 days since the \nemergency unemployment compensation expired, forcing now not 1.6 \nmillion but 1.7 million Americans off an economic cliff and also \ndraining $2.2 billion from State economies, and this is according to \nestimates based on data from the Department of Labor and the Ways and \nMeans Committee Democrats. This has had a huge impact on families and a \nhuge impact on the economy throughout this country.\n  Congress should be doing everything to focus on creating jobs and \nimproving our economy. This week we have an opportunity to do that. \nThat is why we should vote to renew unemployment insurance and help put \nmore Americans back to work.\n  Restoring these benefits is an imperative. We must do it. We have to \nact with a sense of urgency. People are out there every day looking for \nemployment. They are doing everything they can to support their \nfamilies and themselves. While this modest level of support helps them \nstay afloat, what they really want is a job. So our constituents, who \nare trying so hard and doing what they need to do in order to provide \nfor themselves and their families, are looking to Congress to uphold \nits end of the bargain.\n  Many of our constituents are running out of options. The rent is \ncoming due. The telephone bill is coming due, and without a phone they \ncan't actively compete for work. There is no way employers can get hold \nof them.\n  College tuition is coming due for middle-aged people who are out \nlooking for jobs, for their children, and some people who are paying \ntheir way through college. They are being squeezed from all sides, and \nthe expiration of these benefits is hurting not only them but it is \nhurting our economy overall.\n\n  Time is of the essence. It has been 7 weeks since Senator Heller and \nI introduced a bipartisan short-term plan that was designed to provide \nimmediate relief. We tried different permutations of extending these \nbenefits, provisions the other side said they wanted, but to this point \nwithout success.\n  I must say that I have found not only Senator Heller but many of my \ncolleagues on the other side both thoughtful and willing to \ncontribute--Senator Collins, Senator Coats, Senator Portman, and so \nmany others, who are\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\nsincere in trying to get this done. But what we have to do is get over \nthis 60-vote threshold, at least to provide this immediate relief of 3 \nmonths to our constituents.\n  Again, the face of those unemployed in this downturn is a bit \ndifferent than in the past. We are hearing and seeing more and more \nmiddle-aged workers who have worked all their lives and for the first \ntime are confronted with unemployment. They sent out hundreds of \nresumes. They sought job interviews, many times unsuccessfully. They \nare squeezed because they are trying to support parents at the same \ntime they are trying to support children who are in college or young \nadults who are at home.\n  This is a tremendous toll on people who have worked hard all of their \nlives. They are simply asking us to step up, as we have done \nconsistently in the past, and give them some modest support while they \nsearch for work.\n  We are 1 month into 2014 and still debating a 3-month fix. At some \npoint, we will reach the point where the retroactive benefits will be \ngreater than the benefits going forward for the 3-month fix. That is \nnot a place we want to be, not for people who have worked hard. The \nonly way to qualify for unemployment insurance is to be working and \nthen, through no fault of your own, to be dismissed from your work--and \nyou still have to look for work. That is the whole program. So it is \nnot right.\n  I think we have to move forward, and we have done this on a \nbipartisan basis three times under President Ronald Reagan, five times \nunder George W. Bush, with overwhelming majorities on a bipartisan \nbasis, no question. In fact, most times they were completely unpaid \nfor. It was emergency spending, not only because people needed the \nemergency aid, but it is a great form of economic support to our \neconomy.\n  The CBO estimates that if we fail to extend for the full year these \nbenefits, we will lose 200,000 jobs over 2014, at a time when our first \npriority should be to put more jobs in the marketplace.\n  We have a plan today that is short term, 3 months, retroactive to \nDecember 28. It is fully paid for by extending pension smoothing for 4 \nmore years.\n  In addition to paying for these benefits, it will reduce the deficit \nby $1.2 billion over 10 years, so we have a mechanism that not only \nhelps people but also goes to the issue of the deficit, which is \nanother pressing concern, particularly to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  This offset has been used before. It passed 79 to 19 as part of the \n2012 MAP-21 transportation bill. This is a noncontroversial pay-for. It \nhas been proposed by Members on both sides of the aisle with various \nproposals requiring pay-fors.\n  We have an urgent need, a very short-term focus, and a \nnoncontroversial pay-for, and I will urge my colleagues, let's support \nthis, let's move this. If there is work to be done on the architecture \nof unemployment insurance, if there are other collateral issues or \nissues that could be thrown into the mix, let's get this done and then \nlet's focus on those issues.\n  This amendment also incorporates a measure that Senator Coburn has \nproposed that would bar millionaires, individuals making over $1 \nmillion, from qualifying for unemployment insurance. This measure has \nbeen unanimously supported 100 to 0 in this Chamber, so we thought we \nwould go ahead and put that in as an additional measure that would be \nembraced by everyone in the Chamber.\n  This is an issue that has huge support among the American public. \nThere is a FOX News poll that says over two-thirds of Americans support \nand want Congress to act now to extend unemployment insurance.\n  Let me again thank my colleagues on the other side who have worked \nvery sincerely and very diligently to come up with a solution. I say to \nthem: Thank you. I appreciate it.\n  My concern is helping--as their concern is--those constituents who \nare getting increasingly desperate. We share this. Now what we have to \ndo is find a pathway forward.\n  I hope, because of the short-term nature of this bill, because of the \nnoncontroversial pay-for, that we can get this done, and then I think \nwe can embark on a much more expansive review on a much more expansive \nset of issues with respect to UI and other issues that have come before \nthe Chamber. It is time to vote--vote aye--to get this measure passed.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                          2012 Benghazi Attack\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe attack on our consulate on September 11, 2012. I am here to talk \nabout the fact that four brave Americans were murdered that day by an \nact of terrorism. One of those murdered was our Ambassador to Libya \nwhen those four Americans were killed at Benghazi at our consulate.\n  I really want to talk about what I believe is a pattern of \nmisinformation, misimpressions, and, frankly, misleading the American \npeople about what happened there and, during an election season, what \nwas represented about the attack on our consulate on September 11. Let \nme walk through some of the situation and the tangled web that was \nwoven here.\n  First of all, right after this attack occurred--we know that on \nSeptember 16 Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on behalf of the \nadministration on every major Sunday television show, and during that \ntime people rightly wanted to know what happened. This was a big deal. \nAn ambassador had been murdered, along with three other Americans in \nLibya, where we had gone in to remove, working with our NATO partners, \nQadhafi and really had established alliances with Libya. So here we \nhave a murdered Ambassador on September 11, and that day Ambassador \nRice, during the context of a Presidential election, went on every \nSunday television show, and when she was asked about what happened on \nthat day, she blamed it on the spontaneous reaction to a hateful video.\n  Recently, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence did some very \ngood bipartisan work looking at what happened with regard to the attack \nat the consulate. That report contains something very telling. That \nreport found that ``contrary to many press reports at the time, \neyewitness statements by U.S. personnel indicate there were no protests \nat the start of the attacks.'' In fact, the then-Deputy Director of the \nCIA received an email sent from the CIA's Chief of Station in Tripoli \nto him on September 15--4 days after the attacks occurred--and in that \nemail the Deputy Director of the CIA, Mike Morell, was told the attacks \nwere ``not an escalation of protests.'' Not an escalation of protests.\n  Why is that important? It is important for many reasons because what \nends up happening during this period is that Ambassador Rice is going \non the Sunday shows to talk about this. She is designated to do this on \nbehalf of the administration. We have always wondered why. Why did she \ngo on, as opposed to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or perhaps \nthen-Secretary Panetta, the Secretary of Defense? But she is sent that \nday onto the Sunday shows, and on those shows she said this was a \ndirect result of a heinous video--protests that came as a result of \nthis video.\n  Yet the day before, the then-Deputy Director of the CIA had already \ngotten an email from the people on the ground--eyewitness statements. \nThere were survivors, people who survived this attack and who were \ninterviewed to find out what happened. As you would in any situation \nwhere you have had a terrorist attack or a murder case, you are going \nto talk to the eyewitnesses on the ground. So there were eyewitnesses, \nand they were spoken to. As a result of those eyewitness interviews, \nthe day before she goes on those Sunday shows, the Deputy Director of \nthe CIA is told that there was not an escalation of protests, that what \nhas been reported is not the case. Yet she went on the show and said \nthat anyway.\n  What is even more troubling is that this information is communicated \nto the Deputy Director of the CIA, and somehow there are talking points \nprepared that don't reflect this information. Moreover, somehow this \ninformation that was given to the Deputy Director of the CIA was not \ngiven to the President--or, I don't know, maybe they didn't like the \nstory they received because during that period of time, if we look at \nthis, on September 11 the President gave many media interviews\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\nduring this period. It was during a Presidential election.\n  On September 18, which is 7 days after the attacks on the consulate, \n2 days after Susan Rice went on the Sunday shows, the President is on \nthe Dave Letterman show. We have all watched the comedy show, the Dave \nLetterman show, and Dave Letterman asks the President about the attacks \nin Benghazi. On that show he talks about the video, this heinous video \nbeing a cause of what happened and the attack at the consulate. Yet, on \nSeptember 15, the then-Deputy Director of the CIA already had some \ninformation that said this is not an escalation of protests. There were \ninterviews done of the survivors on the ground. Yet on the Dave \nLetterman show a week later--in fact, 3 days after this information is \nreceived by the Deputy Director of the CIA--we have the President \ntalking about the video.\n  But it gets worse. Nine days later--9 days after the attack, so on \nSeptember 20--the President gives another interview at the Univision \nTown Hall. This is 5 days after the Deputy Director of the CIA is given \nthis information, apparently coming from the survivors. And what does \nthe President say?\n\n       What we do know is that the natural protests that arose \n     because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse \n     by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. \n     interests.\n\n  That is what he says when he is asked about the attacks on our \nconsulate.\n  So here we are 9 days after the attack, 5 days after this information \nis given to Mike Morell, the then-Deputy Director of the CIA, and yet \nwe have another interview on ``The View,'' another popular show, 13 \ndays--almost 2 weeks after the attack on the consulate, and again the \nPresident of United States talks about this being about the video and a \nreaction to the video.\n\n  So here we have the work that was done on this--clear misinformation \nabout what happened that day and a very troubling pattern in the \ncontext of an election, where on those Sunday shows Ambassador Rice \nmade sure to tell everyone Al Qaeda has been decimated because that was \nthe narrative during this time period, that Al Qaeda has been \ndecimated. So if this was a terrorist attack, that would be problematic \nto that narrative.\n  In fact, we had testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee \nfrom then-Defense Secretary Panetta. When he testified before the Armed \nServices Committee, he said clearly:\n\n       There was no question in my mind it was a terrorist attack.\n\n  In fact, he said:\n\n       When I appeared before the committee 3 days afterwards, I \n     said it was a terrorist attack.\n\n  Secretary Panetta made clear he knew from the beginning this was a \nterrorist attack. Yet the President, on September 12, even though the \nday of it he said, ``We won't tolerate any act of terror''--he is asked \ndirectly by the interviewer, Mr. Kroft from ``60 Minutes,'' ``Mr. \nPresident, this morning you went out of your way to avoid the use of \nthe word terrorism in connection with the Libya attack. Do you believe \nthis was a terrorism attack?'' The President said, ``Well, it's too \nearly to tell exactly how this came about, what group was involved, but \nobviously it was an attack on Americans.'' The President refused then \nto call it what it was, what his own Secretary of Defense knew--that it \nwas a terrorist attack--because, of course, we know the narrative at \nthe time was that Al Qaeda had been decimated, and if it was a \nterrorist attack, it didn't quite fit with that narrative.\n  In fact, recently the President gave an interview on FOX News with \nBill O'Reilly--on February 2--and this is what he said when he was \nasked about the attack on the consulate:\n\n       We revealed to the American people exactly what we \n     understood at the time. The notion that we would hide the \n     ball for political purposes when a week later we all said in \n     fact there was a terrorist attack taking place the day after \n     I said it was an act of terror, that wouldn't be a very good \n     coverup.\n\n  I guess the President, when he told Mr. O'Reilly that, forgot about \nthe interview he had given on ``The View,'' which was almost 2 weeks \nafter this event--13 days after it.\n  Almost 2 weeks later he was asked by Ms. Behar:\n\n       I heard Hillary Clinton say it was an act of terrorism. Is \n     it? What do you say?\n\n  Well, no act of terrorism then. He doesn't acknowledge it. He said:\n\n       We're still doing an investigation. There's no doubt that \n     [with] the kind of weapons that were used, the ongoing \n     assault, that it wasn't just a mob action.\n\n  This is in the context, of course, where his Secretary of Defense \nsaid he knew right away it was an act of terrorism. In fact, he came to \nthe Armed Services Committee 3 days after and said it was an act of \nterrorism. Yet, again, within a week he isn't saying it was an act of \nterrorism when he is directly asked if it was an act of terrorism.\n  In this recent interview with Mr. O'Reilly the President talked about \nthe security at the consulate. In fact, there was a strong report \nrecently done by the Senate Intelligence Committee on a bipartisan \nbasis. In fact, one of the issues they raised deep concerns about is \nthat the State Department should have increased its security posture \nmore significantly in Benghazi based upon a deteriorating security \nsituation on the ground and that the threat reporting on the prior \nattacks against westerners in Benghazi--and there were many cables \nleading up to this too that had been made public--warranted there was \nsufficient warning that security should have been increased at the \nconsulate.\n  The President acknowledged that in his recent interview with Mr. \nO'Reilly, where he said:\n\n       In the aftermath what became clear was that the security \n     was lax, that not all the precautions that needed to be taken \n     were taken.\n\n  That is certainly confirmed by the bipartisan Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. So if that is the case, why is it that Ambassador Susan Rice \nwas on the Sunday shows on September 16--she is sent on the shows to \ntalk about what happened that day, and she responds in this fashion to \nthis question directly and specifically asked by Chris Wallace in that \ninterview:\n  He says:\n\n       Terror cells in Benghazi had carried out five attacks since \n     April, including . . . a bombing at the same consulate in \n     June. Should U.S. security have been tighter at that \n     consulate given the history of terror activity in Benghazi?\n\n  What is her response? Well, we obviously did have a strong security \npresence.\n  She was on several shows--ABC with Jake Tapper; she was on ``Face the \nNation'' with Bob Schieffer. During the course of those interviews, she \nwas asked about the security at the consulate, and she described the \nsecurity at the consulate that day as significant and substantial. What \nwas the basis for that? Did anyone give her information that ``security \nwas significant, substantial and strong'' that day? Because there was \nabsolutely no evidence of that. In fact, everything in this \ninvestigation has shown that security was absolutely lax at that \nconsulate, unacceptably so given the prior history of intelligence at \nthe consulate, given the prior attacks that had been made on the \nBritish and on the Red Cross, and unfortunately this really was a death \ntrap.\n  So in the context of an election, why is she--and the President as \nwell--not only pushing the video story but also saying that the \nconsulate security was strong, it was substantial, it was significant, \nwhen there is no evidence to support that? It all goes to the contrary.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the video. Ambassador Rice \ngoes on the Sunday shows and she talks about the video. She talks about \nthe causal effect of the video in terms of the attacks on the \nconsulate. What she essentially says is this: This was a direct result \nof a heinous and offensive video which was widely disseminated and \nwhich the U.S. Government had nothing to do with and which we have made \nclear is reprehensible and disgusting. And we have also been very clear \nin saying that there is no excuse for violence, that we have condemned \nit in the strongest possible terms.\n  This ``direct result of a heinous and offensive video,'' which she \nsaid on all those Sunday shows and which the President then also talked \nabout in the interviews: 1 week later on David Letterman; the \ninterview, 9 days after the attack, on Univision; and the interview \nalmost 2 weeks later on ``The View''--why are they still talking about \nthe video?\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\n  From the beginning, I have thought the talking points were \nfascinating. These talking points were created for dissemination. \nAmbassador Susan Rice was given these talking points, she said she \nrelied upon them, and there are serious deficiencies with these talking \npoints.\n  Even so, I challenge people to find any reference to a video in these \ntalking points. I have looked and looked, and I couldn't see the word \n``video'' in these talking points anywhere. Yet we have Ambassador \nSusan Rice, on behalf of the administration, on September 16 on every \nSunday show, talking about the video. We have the President of the \nUnited States on David Letterman 1 week later, then 9 days later, after \nthe attack, on Univision, and almost 2 weeks later, 13 days later on \n``The View'' talking about a video. Yet there isn't a reference to a \nvideo in these talking points. I have never understood. Where did the \nvideo story come from? Do you think we will ever get the answer? I \nthink we deserve an answer to that, especially now.\n  Because of the recent Senate intel report, we know that the Deputy \nDirector of the CIA, the day before Ambassador Rice first appeared on \nthose Sunday shows to tell this story, received this email which \nreported that the attacks were ``not/not an escalation of protests.'' \nSo if it is not an escalation of protests--let's look at these talking \npoints again. These talking points do not refer to a video. We are not \nsure how that story got told.\n  Why is it that the talking points that went out say: Available \ninformation suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were \nspontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and \nevolved into a direct assault against our U.S. diplomatic post in \nBenghazi and subsequently its annex and that they were participating in \nviolent demonstrations. Why wasn't what they learned the day before \ntaken into account in terms of what was represented to the American \npeople? I think a bigger question is, How is it that the Deputy \nDirector of the CIA can receive relevant and important information and \nthat information never gets to the President of the United States as \nlate as 9 days later? On September 24, on ``The View,'' he is still \ntalking about this video. Yet it turns out the video never had anything \nto do with this. It really raises so many questions in terms of the \ntangled web of this whole situation.\n  I have yet to talk about what was an incredible change in these \ntalking points, which was the removal of the reference to Al Qaeda. \nBefore they went through various modifications, the original set of \ntalking points talked about Al Qaeda or the potential of Al Qaeda-\naffiliated groups being involved in these attacks. Of course, that now \nhas been confirmed by the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee \nreport recently revealed. But at the time, the reference to Al Qaeda \nwas removed from these talking points. It was removed from these \ntalking points, and Ambassador Rice was free to go on the Sunday shows \non September 16, and she said Al Qaeda had been decimated. Imagine if \nthe talking points kept the reference to Al Qaeda. Do you think she \nwould have gone on every Sunday show and said Al Qaeda had been \ndecimated? I would hope not because it was not true that Al Qaeda had \nbeen decimated, as evidenced by the attack on our consulate.\n  So we still don't know who removed the reference and what happened \nwith these talking points. But what really troubles me is the Deputy \nDirector of the CIA, through the Senate Intelligence Committee report, \nreceived this email on September 15 which said the attacks were not an \nescalation of protests. He worked on these talking points. He was part \nof the group who actually had feedback on the talking points that went \nout the door. Yet somehow this wasn't included.\n  The Al Qaeda reference was removed, and apparently no one, even after \nreceiving the actual eyewitness interviews of what happened on the \nscene, ever thought to go to the administration--the President of the \nUnited States--and correct him: By the way, we are not sure this video \nreally pans out, that it is a demonstration and that this is a protest \nin response to a video. Somehow that doesn't get up the chain of \ncommand? We have big problems if this kind of information is not \ngetting up the chain of command. Why those representations were made \nwhen there was intel that contradicted it has never been answered.\n  Finally, and most of all, the President said he was going to bring \nthe individuals who committed these attacks to justice. Yet no one has \nbeen brought to justice. The families who lost loved ones deserve to \nhave these terrorists brought to justice. And what we have seen in some \nof the reports--the intelligence committee itself essentially \nidentifies that more than 1 year after the Benghazi attacks, the \nterrorists who perpetrated the attacks have still not been brought to \njustice.\n  The intelligence community has identified several individuals \nresponsible for the attacks. Some of these individuals have been \nidentified with a strong level of confidence. So why hasn't anyone been \nbrought to justice? Why haven't we pursued this to pick up the people \nwho committed these terrorist attacks and to hold them accountable? The \nvictims deserve justice, and they have not seen justice. I hope we will \nget those who murdered our Ambassador and three other brave Americans \non September 11, 2012, and bring them to justice. It is totally \nunacceptable that has not yet happened.\n\n  We have seen press reports of people like Abu Khattala--reported to \nhave established Ansar al-Sharia, an Al Qaeda-affiliated group, and \nidentified as a prior commander of this group--identified by witnesses \nas being there that night during the attacks on our consulate, and yet \nwe haven't picked him up or anyone else. In fact, he is sitting at \ncafes, and press in the United States are able to find him, interview \nhim, talk to him, and yet we haven't brought him or anyone else in. \nThere have been news reports that there may be a secret warrant for \nhim, but he hasn't been brought in. Where is the attention to this?\n  I have talked about this tangled web which has been woven, which is \nreally troubling in terms of the misimpressions and misleading nature \nof how this has been represented to the American people. But I hope we \nwill all focus on bringing the people who committed these terrorist \nattacks to justice because the victims of these terrorist attacks \ndeserve justice.\n  The terrorists who committed these acts against our consulate need to \nknow that we are coming after them and that we are going to hold them \naccountable. If you commit a terrorist attack against our country, you \nshould not be in a position to be out drinking coffee in a cafe. You \nneed to be held accountable.\n  We need to send a message to other terrorists: Don't mess with the \nUnited States of America, because right now they are getting the \nopposite message with no one being held accountable for the terrorist \nattacks on our consulate on September 11, 2012.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                             Foreign Policy\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New Hampshire for \nher stirring remarks on the terrorist attacks in Benghazi and urge that \nwe pay heed to the words she said. It is striking--the Senator from New \nHampshire has said more about that terrorist attack than our Commander \nin Chief has ever said.\n  We are at a time where Tolkien's classic ``The Hobbit'' is one of the \nbest-selling, most popular movies in the country. ``The Hobbit'' is a \nfantasy story. In Washington, we were visited with fantasy last week in \nthe President's State of the Union Address. I would like to talk about \nthe contrast, concerning foreign policy, between the fantasy presented \nto the American people and the cold, hard realities of the dangerous \nworld in which we live--which is only getting more and more dangerous.\n  In his State of the Union Address last week, President Obama gave \nsome revealing clues as to how he believed the United States should \ninteract with the rest of the world.\n  On the whole, his remarks encourage Americans not to worry too much \nabout international challenges. He suggested the situations in Syria \nand Iran are being definitely managed by American diplomats; that Al \nQaeda is now a regional nuisance that can be outsourced to surrogates; \nthat our relationship with Israel is defined by the\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\nPalestinian peace process, which will also be resolved in short order \nthrough American diplomacy; and that our interest in Ukraine is to \nexpress support for the abstract principle that all people should \npeacefully participate in their own governance. In this rosy scenario, \ndifficult challenges such as the deadly terrorist attacks on Benghazi \non September 11, 2012, or the long and painful ordeal of Pastor Saeed \nAbedini in an Iranian prison simply do not exist.\n  I wish we all lived in the utopian world President Obama painted last \nweek. But in just a week, numerous news reports have come out to \nsuggest that picture belongs far more in the world of fantasy than \nreality. In the interests of being honest with the American people--\nwhich I wish our Commander in Chief had done--I would like to contrast \nreality with what we were told last week.\n  On Syria, in the State of the Union Address, the President claimed:\n\n       American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why \n     serious chemical weapons are being eliminated, and we will \n     continue to work with the international community to usher in \n     the future the Syrian people deserve--a future free of \n     dictatorship, terror, and fear.\n\n  That is truly a rosy scenario. Yet, what is the reality? On Sunday, \njust 4 days after the President delivered the State of the Union \nAddress, Secretary of State John Kerry reportedly told a congressional \ndelegation that the administration's Syria policy is on the brink of \ncollapse. Syria's chemical weapons are purportedly being destroyed \nthrough the intervention of Vladimir Putin in what was a major \ndiplomatic victory for the Russian strongman. But we have learned in \nrecent days that this process has not proceeded as promised. The \nSyrians have ignored their deadlines and only 4 percent of the \nstockpiles have been eliminated, undoubtedly because Assad knows there \nis no compelling reason for him to comply. As for what the Syrian \npeople deserve, after 3 years of rudderless U.S. policy, over 130,000 \nare dead, millions are refugees displaced across the region, and the \noldest Christian communities on the planet are threatened with \nextinction. Assad is entrenched and Al Qaeda is in control of the \nopposition. Sadly, as a result of the President's mismanagement, today \nwe have no good options in Syria. Yet not a word of that made it into \nhis State of the Union Address.\n  On Iran, the President claimed:\n\n       It is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has \n     halted the progress of Iran's nuclear program . . .\n\n  The reality is quite different. No enriched uranium has been \ndestroyed--not a pound--and no centrifuges have been dismantled. The \nIranians quickly refuted the President's claim in the State of the \nUnion, announcing, quite publicly, that they have not halted their \nprogress in the slightest. America's closest ally in the region, the \nnation of Israel, has called this a ``very, very bad deal.'' Indeed, \nPrime Minister Netanyahu has referred to it as a ``historic mistake.'' \nYet the President proceeds on and the Senate refuses even to allow a \nvote on reimposing sanctions to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear \nweapons capability. There has been no renunciation of Iran's State \nsponsorship of terrorism that killed Americans in Lebanon and in Saudi \nArabia and in Afghanistan and in Iraq. The mullahs have gone on a \nhanging spree, executing some 40 people in the first two weeks of \nJanuary alone. Meanwhile, billions of dollars are flowing into the \ncountry, both through relaxed sanctions and Iran's reemergence as a \nlegitimate business partner because of this administration's misguided \ndeal. Indeed, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani might almost be forgiven \nfor publicly gloating that ``the Geneva deal means the surrender of the \nbig powers in front of the great nation of Iran.'' I wish he was not \nspeaking the truth. That reality did not emerge on the House floor last \nweek.\n  On the House floor, the President claimed:\n\n       If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with \n     the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America \n     can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today.\n\n  The reality is the claim that we are negotiating with Iran from a \nposition of strength and confidence is a blinkered view of reality \nbecause it isn't even clear our President is negotiating towards actual \nvictory. Capitulation is not victory. President Obama announced in the \nState of the Union that in order to keep negotiations going, he would \nveto any additional sanctions Congress might pass to pressure Iran to \nactually stop pursuing nuclear weapons--a position that is supported \nnot only by his current administration, but expressly by his former \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad \nZarif has good reason to announce publicly he has no ``fear'' of \nCongress. When Ronald Reagan negotiated with the Soviets, he did it \nfrom a clear, strategic perspective of ``we win, they lose,'' standing \nfor U.S. national interests. He was facing an existential threat that \nhe defined as ``the Evil Empire.'' There was no danger or \nmisunderstanding of what the goal was or who was going to be doing the \nsurrendering. As a result of his leadership, the Cold War was won \nwithout firing a shot. Today, on Iran, we are tragically repeating the \nmistakes of the past--in particular, the mistakes of the Clinton \nadministration--in relaxing sanctions on North Korea for the same empty \npromises that they would cease developing nuclear weapons only to have \nNorth Korea use the billions of dollars we sent to them--or allowed to \ngo to them--to develop nuclear weapons. The difference is the North \nKorean leader is motivated by staying in power, which means some form \nof rational deterrence is hopefully possible. In Iran, the supreme \nleader has made clear his desire to destroy the nation of Israel and as \na result of the billions of dollars going to Iran right now, the risk \nis unacceptably high that we discover the same thing that happened in \nNorth Korea happened in Iran, except that we discover it because Iran, \nin pursuit of Jihad, detonates a nuclear device over Tel Aviv or New \nYork or Los Angeles. Not a word of that was acknowledged in the \nPresident's speech.\n  On Al Qaeda, President Obama claimed:\n\n       While we have put Al Qaeda's core leadership on a path to \n     defeat, the threat has evolved, as Al Qaeda affiliates and \n     other extremists take root in different parts of the world--\n     in Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, and Mali, and we have to keep \n     working with partners to disrupt and disable those networks.\n\n  The reality is that whatever path Al Qaeda is on, it does not \ncurrently appear to be towards defeat. The recent assertion by a State \nDepartment spokeswoman that Ayman al-Zawahiri is the only core Al Qaeda \nmember left and that thus the threat has been decimated by the \nPresident is demonstrably false. For starters, Zawahiri is no mere \nabstract threat. He explicitly called for attacks on the United States \non September 10, 2012, the day before the terrorist attack that claimed \nthe lives of four Americans in Benghazi, including the first U.S. \nambassador killed on duty since 1979. Zawahiri is actively involved in \ndirecting Al Qaeda groups that are active in Syria. But core or not \ncore--whatever that means--the reality is that Al Qaeda has been at war \nwith the United States for more than two decades and the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, are only the most spectacular of a series of \nattacks and attempted attacks launched at us. Trying to parse this \nthreat to make it seem less deadly, to make it seem like less of a \nthreat to Americans, will not make it so. We need to confront what \nattacked us in 2001. We cannot defeat radical Islamic terrorism when \nthe President seems unwilling to utter the words ``radical Islamic \nterrorism.'' Indeed, the recent Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \ndocumented that what attacked us in Libya in 2012 is the very same \nthing that attacked us on September 11, 2001. We should not aim simply \nto disrupt or to disable Al Qaeda terrorists. We should aim to defeat \nthem.\n\n  On Israel, in the State of the Union, the President had one mention \nof Israel in that speech. He said:\n\n       American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians \n     as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the \n     conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state \n     for Palestinians, and a lasting peace and security for the \n     State of Israel--a Jewish State that knows America will \n     always be at their side.\n\n  The reality is sadly much different. Over the weekend, we saw a \ndiplomatic spat play out in the press over allegations that Secretary \nof State Kerry is actively working behind the scenes to\n\n[[Page S743]]\n\nencourage European countries to threaten Israel with boycotts if the \nIsraelis don't agree to whatever framework Mr. Kerry will propose in \ntwo weeks. Rather than threats from the U.S. Secretary of State, and \nrather than tweets from National Security Advisor Susan Rice \ncriticizing Israel, instead, the United States should stand \nunequivocally with our friend and ally, the nation of Israel. We should \nreaffirm Israel's unique status as a strong, democratic ally in the \nMiddle East, a uniquely Jewish State, and that the United States \nappreciates the excruciatingly difficult security situation in which \nIsrael finds itself with the threat of a nuclear Iran, and that the \nUnited States will vigorously defend Israel from attacks, from \ninternational institutions, from legal onslaughts, and from attempts to \nundermine Israel's economy through punitive boycotts, and that the \nUnited States is unshakably committed to preserving Israel's security, \nregardless of the status of the peace process.\n  I commend to my colleagues the recent remarks Canadian Prime Minister \nStephen Harper gave in Israel. Those are the remarks of an ally \nstanding strong with Israel and appreciating the incredible value that \nIsrael provides to our national security and to peace in the world. I \nwish our President could speak with a fraction of the clarity and \nsolidarity with Israel that the Canadian Prime Minister recently \nprovided.\n  On Ukraine, the President claimed:\n\n       In Ukraine, we stand for the principle that all people have \n     a right to express themselves freely and peacefully and to \n     have a say in their country's future.\n\n  The reality is the day after the State of the Union, Ukraine's former \nPresident said that the country teeters on the brink of civil war. \nProtesters have been brutally tortured and murdered. Indeed, one \nopposition leader described how he was recently crucified. The \nUkrainian people's constitutional rights have been trampled. This \nformer Soviet republic has been wrenched away from a proposed trade \nagreement with the EU and a path towards membership in NATO and instead \nthrust back into Russia's sphere of influence by a corrupt and \nautocratic leader, depriving the United States of an important economic \nand security partner.\n  We need to tell this story. We need to look for concrete actions we \ncan take right now to demonstrate real support for the opposition, to \ndemonstrate real support that Ukraine is welcomed by the West, and that \nwe will not accede to Putin's efforts to reassemble the old Soviet \nUnion and place Ukraine under its domination.\n  We can start by immediately offering a free-trade agreement to \nUkraine and partnerships to help them build natural gas infrastructure \nso they need not remain dependent upon Russia, which uses natural gas \nto blackmail them, and we could immediately release exports of liquid \nnatural gas from the United States in conjunction with helping with \nthat infrastructure.\n  Surely, the people gathering in the frozen snow of Maidan Square, \ncrying out for the freedom of the West, deserve more from the leader of \nthe free world than mere blandishments about abstract universal rights.\n  If you are standing in the frozen streets of Kiev, being beaten, \nbleeding--naked, as one opposition leader was--and yet standing proud \nfor freedom, empty generalities from the President do you very little \ngood.\n  On Benghazi, the President claimed nothing. We all remember last \nfall, during the debates in the Presidential election--just over 1 year \nago--when the President emphatically stated no one cared more about the \nterrorist attack that happened in Benghazi than he did. Yet in the year \nand a half that has followed, the word ``Benghazi'' seems never to \nleave his lips. The reality is we have four Americans murdered in a \npreventable attack, and that is what the Senate Intelligence Committee \nconcluded in a bipartisan manner; that this was preventable by Al Qaeda \nterrorists, and more than 16 months later, no one in Washington or \nLibya has been held accountable.\n  Congress and the American people, and particularly the families of \nthe fallen, deserve the answers that only a joint select committee of \nCongress could get. Yet, sadly, the majority leader and Democrats in \nthis Chamber are blocking a joint select committee. ``What difference \ndoes it make,'' former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked. It \nmakes all the difference in the world to ascertain the truth.\n  I will note, even though he said not a word about Benghazi in the \nState of the Union, he was forced to say something this week when he \nwas interviewed by Bill O'Reilly. Before the Super Bowl, when Bill \nO'Reilly asked him about Benghazi, what is striking--and I would urge \neveryone to go and watch and listen to what the President said--Bill \nO'Reilly asked him: Did Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta tell him that \nnight that the attacks were the works of terrorists? Mr. O'Reilly asked \nthat question, and yet the President, over and over and over, refused \nto answer a simple yes or no, did Leon Panetta tell him it was the act \nof terrorists. He did not want to answer that question, and indeed he \ndid not.\n  For those of us who have spent some of our career in a court of law, \nthe technical term for his answer was ``nonresponsive,'' and were a \njudge there, he would have directed the President to answer the \nquestion that was put to him; nor did the President say one word about \nwhy the talking points were scrubbed to eradicate any mention of \nterrorism and the Al Qaeda affiliates involved.\n  We need accountability. We need accountability for those four brave \nAmericans who lost their lives to terrorism and need to know why no one \nhas been held accountable in the State Department, nor have any of the \nterrorists who committed that attack been brought to justice.\n  On Saeed Abedini, the American pastor brutally imprisoned in Iran, \nPresident Obama in the State of the Union Address said nothing. The \nreality is an American citizen has been wrongly imprisoned in Iran for \nmore than 1 year simply for professing his Christian faith. All of us \nare blessed to live in a land where the Constitution guarantees us \nreligious liberty. Yet a Christian pastor, going to Iran, professing \nhis faith, was thrown in a pit of a jail.\n  There is no more compelling evidence that the Supreme Leader in \nTehran represents the very same repressive Islamist regime today that \nhe has for so many years and that his goal is not peaceful \nrapprochement with the West but the preservation of his own power.\n  The President of the United States should be standing and demanding \nPastor Saeed Abedini's release, not making his captors into diplomatic \npartners. Indeed, it is notable, in the midst of our negotiations in \nGeneva, the nation of Iran transferred Pastor Saeed Abedini from one \nhorrible prison to an even worse prison, where they keep their death \nrow, where they send people to die, and he did so on the anniversary of \nIran's taking Americans hostage--what is referred to in Iran as ``Death \nto America Day.'' That was not accidental. That was meant to thumb \ntheir nose at our Nation, and the President--instead of standing for an \nAmerican wrongfully imprisoned for preaching his Christian faith--the \nPresident instead chose, in the State of the Union Address, to say not \na word.\n  The President concluded his speech on foreign policy by saying:\n\n       Finally let's remember that our leadership is defined not \n     just by our defense against threats, but by the enormous \n     opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the \n     globe--to forge great cooperation, to expand new markets, to \n     free people from fear and want. And no one is better \n     positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than \n     America.\n\n  The reality is, if this past week has proven anything, that American \nleadership is not defined by global opportunities to do good and \npromote understanding. American leadership is defined by defending and \npromoting the values that have made our Nation great.\n  We do not do this by ignoring unpleasant realities, refusing to \nacknowledge the terrorist attack in Benghazi, sending administration \nofficials out to claim it is not a terrorist attack but the result of \nan Internet video or refusing to stand for an American wrongfully \nimprisoned in Iran for preaching his Christian faith, and we do not do \nthis by refusing to admit failure but by standing and facing our \nchallenges, accepting responsibility for our actions, and speaking out \nwith a clarion voice for the freedoms we enjoy--freedoms that should be \nthe aspiration of every man and woman on the planet.\n  Leading from behind does not work. As a result of this \nadministration's misguided foreign policy, the world has become a much \nmore dangerous place\n\n[[Page S744]]\n\nin the last 5 years. U.S. national security interests have been \nendangered dramatically. We see nations such as Russia increasing their \nsphere of influence, while the threats to the security of men and women \nthroughout America grow and multiply.\n  Standing strongly with like-minded allies and encouraging others to \nseek freedom is not disinterested do-gooding; it is vital work that \nwill promote the security and prosperity of the United States of \nAmerica, something I believe is ultimately in the interest of all \nmankind.\n  I wish, when the President of the United States stood on the floor of \nthe House of Representatives to address the Nation and to address the \nworld, that when he spoke of foreign policy he had not embraced a \nforeign policy fantasy that disregards the cold, hard reality of the \ndangerous world we live in and the consequences of receding U.S. \nleadership.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n           Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to address two issues. The first \nis what is before us. That is the Emergency Unemployment Compensation \nExtension Act. The second is something that should be before us; that \nis, the confirmation of the U.S. attorney for Minnesota. This will be \nthe third time in a few days that I have spoken on this issue, which I \nwill continue to do so until this gets done.\n  I rise in support of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation \nExtension Act. I know we are making progress on a proposal that extends \nFederal support for emergency unemployment compensation for 3 months \nand is fully offset.\n  I have spoken about the need to extend Federal support for \nunemployment insurance, and I would like to thank Senator Jack Reed and \nSenator Dean Heller for their bipartisan leadership on this issue.\n  Unemployment insurance provides a critical lifeline. Workers pay into \nthe program so it will be there when they are looking for work. \nUnemployment insurance helps families pay the mortgage or rent and put \ngas in the tank. Federal support for unemployment insurance is crucial \nfor those Americans who exhaust their State-funded benefits and are \nstill looking for work.\n  Throughout my time as the Senate chair of the Joint Economic \nCommittee, I have focused on the continuing problem of long-term \nunemployment. Last month, I issued a Joint Economic Committee report \nthat makes the clear economic case for extending Federal support for \nunemployment insurance, which keeps those Americans afloat, those \nAmericans who are continuing to search for work.\n  The long-term unemployment rate now stands at 2.5 percent, nearly \ntwice as high as when these benefits expired during the last recession.\n  We already know the consequences of allowing the Federal benefits to \nexpire are not good. At the end of last year, 1.3 million workers lost \nall unemployment benefits, and another 3.6 million jobless workers \ncould lose their benefits this year.\n  In my home State, roughly 9,200 people lost benefits at the end of \nlast year and about 65,000 workers could lose their unemployment \ninsurance by the end of this year.\n  Now is not the time for Congress to cut off extended unemployment \ninsurance for those people who have been actively looking for work for \nmore than 26 weeks.\n  These are not the people, as you know, who benefited from the uptick \nin the stock market over the last few years. They do not have stock \nportfolios. They are not checking the stock rate. They have not noticed \nthat it has gone down a little bit recently, and they have not noticed \nthat it went up all last year. They are just trying to put food on \ntheir table and keep a roof over their head. They are people who live \nin our States and who are our neighbors.\n  I have heard from countless Minnesotans who are sharing their stories \nwith me about how unemployment insurance is a lifeline for their \nfamilies and that ending Federal support for the long-term unemployed \nwould be devastating.\n  I am sharing some of these letters because they tell the stories of \nhard-working Americans who are doing their best to look for work and \nsupport their families.\n  Linda from Little Falls wrote:\n\n       Dear Amy,\n       Please, please, please fight to extend the emergency \n     unemployment past the end of the year. My husband and I are \n     both still unemployed, by no fault of our own, and are both \n     over 55. We are having a very difficult time finding \n     employment, and to stop this program would be devastating for \n     us and many others that we know. My husband was at his job \n     for 37 years and they closed the doors, and I made more than \n     some of the more junior people in my office, so I was let go \n     first.\n\n  Think of that: a couple, the man working at his job for 37 years, the \nwoman more senior at her job saying she was let go because she made \nmore money than others in the office.\n  She ends by saying:\n\n       Please help to get this extended. I feel like the people \n     who are still left jobless are being forgotten!\n       Thank you. . . .\n\n  Second letter, Donna from Prior Lake. She says this:\n\n       . . . Having worked for over 30 plus years of my life, I am \n     currently unemployed. I have applied for over 300 positions \n     during the last 6 months. I do not expect a handout but I was \n     really disappointed when I found out that I could no longer \n     receive unemployment insurance after the 28th of December. . \n     . .\n       It's not that I am not trying to work, or that I am not \n     looking for a position, but I am 55 years old and my full \n     time job right now is to find a job. I am looking for \n     temporary, full time, part-time, contract work. I would like \n     to know that my congress people are doing the same for me. \n     Donna.\n\n  Thirty-plus years of working. She is 55 years old. She has applied \nfor over 300 positions. That is who we are talking about here. These \nare the people we are talking about when we talk about this kind of \nlong-term extension of unemployment. It is something I hope my \ncolleagues will keep in mind as we move forward and get this done and \nget this passed.\n\n\n                        Andrew Luger Nomination\n\n  Now I would like to turn to another matter. The only thing these two \nhave in common is they are both kind of victims of stalled-out \nsituations of gridlock. The second one is about one person, but it is \nnot really about one person, it is about a system of justice and it is \nabout a decision on the part of the United States, part of our Founding \nFathers, the part of our Congress that is going way back, that we would \nhave a U.S. attorney in most States in this country, that we would have \na U.S. attorney who would be charged with enforcing the Federal laws, \nthat the Congress would have a role in deciding who that U.S. attorney \nwould be, that the President would recommend, would appoint someone, \nand then the Congress has the job of simply deciding if that person is \nqualified or not for the job.\n  But it is not even just about one person or one system of government, \nit is also about the people who work in the U.S. attorney's office, in \nthe case of the district of Minnesota, over 100 people, over 50 people \nwho are prosecutors working in the office who deserve to have a full-\ntime leader in the U.S. attorney's job.\n  For 2\\1/2\\ years, 888 days--I counted each day--Minnesota has not had \na full-time U.S. attorney. It is a modern-day record. During those \nyears, from August 2011 to August 2013, B. Todd Jones was responsible \nfor doing two jobs. He was the Minnesota U.S. attorney, and as those of \nus involved in the long vote in this Chamber that lasted over 8 hours \nremember, he was also the Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They had not had a full-time \nconfirmed Director for 7 years. So he went in after the mess with Fast \nand Furious and was willing to be the Acting Director. At the same time \nhe was the U.S. attorney for Minnesota. As you can imagine, there was a \nlot of work and cleanup to do at the ATF. That was where he was focused \nfor most of his time.\n  Meanwhile, the U.S. attorney's office in Minnesota kept going. But at \nsome point after 2\\1/2\\ years, you cannot keep going on your own. Over \nthe summer, the Senate finally confirmed B. Todd Jones as Director of \nthe ATF, leaving the Minnesota U.S. attorney's position finally open \nfor good. Even before the confirmation of B. Todd Jones, Senator \nFranken and I, upon the recommendation of our bipartisan U.S. Attorney \nAdvisory Committee, had already recommended Andy Luger, Assistant U.S.\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\nAttorney, to fill the position. That was 197 days ago.\n  In November, President Obama nominated Andy Luger to become the new \nU.S. attorney. The Judiciary Committee approved his nomination \nunanimously on January 9. Our colleague from Texas, Senator Cruz, had \nno objection to this nomination. We had no objections on the committee, \nwhich is saying a lot, because we have a lot of different people from \ndifferent backgrounds and different political views on the committee.\n  Usually when people speak on nominations on the floor, it is because \nthey are fighting to get someone through because there is an objection. \nThis is not at all the case in the case of Andy Luger, who is trying to \nbe the U.S. attorney for Minnesota.\n  What has happened in past cases with U.S. attorneys? Over the past 20 \nyears, 4 Minnesota nominees to be U.S. attorney, appointed by \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents alike, were confirmed within a day \nof when they passed out of the committee. During this timeframe, all of \nthe nominees were confirmed within an average of 9\\1/2\\ days of being \nvoted out of committee.\n  It has been 26 days since Mr. Luger was approved by the committee. It \nis time that we do the right thing by quickly confirming him to make \nsure that Minnesota has its highest law enforcement officer in place.\n  I want to thank Senator Grassley for his help on this. He actually \nalso has a U.S. attorney who is pending for the District of Iowa.\n  Why is the U.S. attorney important? I thought our pages would be \ninterested in this fact, because we are going to be talking a lot about \nthe U.S. attorney over the next few weeks if this keeps going on. The \nposition of U.S. attorney is a law enforcement post that the Founders \nregarded as so vital that they created it during the very first \nCongress in the Judiciary Act of 1789. This is the same act that \ncreated the Attorney General and the structure of the Supreme Court and \nthe lower courts. According to the act, each judicial district would be \nprovided with:\n\n       a person learned in the law to act as attorney for the \n     United States . . . whose duty it shall be to prosecute in \n     each district all delinquents for crimes and offenses \n     cognizable under the authority of the United States, and all \n     civil actions in which the United States shall be concerned . \n     . .\n\n  The U.S. attorney is a position so necessary that President Zachary \nTaylor appointed Henry Moss--this is a name you may not have heard of \nbefore--to the post within 2 days of Minnesota becoming a State. So \nback then somehow they are able to get it done in 2 days. Now, we have \nbeen waiting 888 days. But in 2 days they were able to get a U.S. \nattorney in the job when Minnesota first became a State.\n  Since 1849, the District of Minnesota's 31 U.S. attorneys have upheld \nthe rule of law, the Constitution, and the rights of our State's \ncitizens and tirelessly pursued justice on their behalf. This quick \naction by President Taylor and the speed with which the Senate has \nconfirmed past U.S. attorneys for Minnesota shows how much our \ngovernment has historically valued this position.\n  These people have not been used as pawns in some kind of a fight over \nother issues, they have simply been confirmed. We have simply gotten it \ndone. I think we can all agree, given what we have seen with the heroin \ncases that are on the rise all over the country in the last few \nmonths--this has certainly come to our attention in Minnesota. In \nHennepin County alone, 60 opiate-related deaths in 1 county in our \nState in just 6 months of the year. So I think we can all agree that \nthe importance of this position is no less important than it was in \n1789 when this job was created.\n  Since the founding of the country, we have recognized the great \nauthority placed in the hands of U.S. attorneys to uphold the rule of \nlaw, to protect our freedoms, and to exercise their power responsibly \nand only for just ends. A 1935 Supreme Court decision called Berger v. \nUnited States has gained iconic status for Justice Sutherland's \ndescription of a prosecutor's duty to follow the rule of law, serve \njustice, and play by the rules. Justice Sutherland so aptly wrote:\n\n       The United States Attorney is the representative not of an \n     ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose \n     obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its \n     obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, \n     in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, \n     but that justice shall be done.\n       As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the \n     servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt \n     shall not escape nor innocence suffer. He--\n  And we could say he or she for the modern day.\n\n     --may prosecute with earnestness and vigor--indeed, he should \n     do so. But, while he my strike hard blows, he is not at \n     liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to \n     refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a \n     wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to \n     bring about a just one.\n\n  That is the kind of statement that rings as true today as it did \nnearly 80 years ago. The men and women in the Minnesota U.S. attorney's \noffice exemplify the professionalism, high ethical standards, and \nunwavering commitments to the rule of law and public safety that we \nexpect of prosecutors. They work to protect public safety by focusing \non offenders who harm our communities: terrorists, the ``worst of the \nworst'' violent criminals and drug traffickers, and major financial \nfraudsters.\n  They also work closely with local law enforcement to ensure local and \nFederal resources are used efficiently and effectively to prevent crime \nand lock up criminals.\n  For example, the office won a conviction in a $3.65 billion Ponzi \nscheme case, the second biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. Now this \ncase was originated when, in fact, they had a full-time U.S. attorney. \nMost of the prosecution did take place when they had a full-time U.S. \nattorney in the office. Of course, with a major case like this, you \nwould want a full-time U.S. attorney there to make critical decisions.\n  Also the office has an ongoing terrorism investigation that has led \nto charges against 18 people for aiding the terrorist organization al-\nShabaab--8 of whom have been convicted, some receiving sentences of up \nto 20 years in prison.\n  So at some point, as that investigation continues, one wonders why \nthe United States of America would want to have an office overseeing \nand prosecuting major terrorist cases without having a full-time U.S. \nattorney. I do wonder if this would ever happen in New York City or in \nthe city of Chicago. I hope people keep this in mind as they look at \nthe situation.\n  Other major accomplishments of the office include Operation Highlife, \na major drug trafficking investigation involving more than 100 local, \nState, and Federal law enforcement officers that resulted in 26 \nindictments, 25 guilty pleas, and sentences of up to 200 months in \nprison.\n  Operation Brother's Keeper, a successful investigation and \nprosecution of a RICO case involving a regional 200-member gang, took \n22 dangerous criminals off the streets. This does not sound like a case \nthat should be handled by an office that does not deserve a full-time \nU.S. attorney. That would be the prosecution of a RICO case involving a \nregional 200-member gang.\n  Or how about Operation Malverde, which received national attention, \nand was a prosecution of 27 defendants associated with a Mexican drug \ncartel, including the apprehension of the cartel's regional leader, and \nsentences as high as 20 years in prison.\n  The office also recently played a key role in shutting down a major \nsynthetic drug seller in Duluth. This head shop was a major problem. \nThey went after this head shop. They prosecuted the owner. The owner \nwas recently in his house and was found to have over $700,000 in \nplastic bags hidden in his bathroom. They won that case.\n  These are just a few of the major cases that office has worked on in \nrecent years. I will be telling you more in the days to come.\n  After 888 days without a full-time boss, these hard-working people \ndeserve a leader, and Mr. Luger is the right person for the job. Again, \nI am not up here speaking about this because anyone in the Senate \nobjects to Mr. Luger for the job.\n  It is time we vote on Mr. Luger's nomination. In the past, as we \nknow, U.S. attorney nominations have simply gone through on voice \nvotes, without much hurrah, within a few days after they go through the \ncommittee. Mr.\n\n[[Page S746]]\n\nLuger is a dedicated public servant and has the breadth of experience, \nstrength of character, and commitment to justice that makes him a well-\nqualified candidate to serve as Minnesota's next U.S. attorney. I have \nno doubt that he will uphold the principles Justice Sutherland sought \nin that opinion in a U.S. attorney. I urge my colleagues to support Mr. \nLuger's confirmation and to finally give the Minnesota U.S. attorney's \noffice and its hard-working prosecutor the full-time U.S. attorney they \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we were able to \nvote on and pass a badly needed and long-overdue 5-year farm bill today \nand that we are finally on the verge of enacting the legislation into \nlaw with the President's signature.\n  With one in five jobs in Minnesota connected to agriculture, passing \nthis bill has been a top priority of mine. I have been working on it \nfor over 2\\1/2\\ years, along with a large number of my colleagues, and \nI have gone all around Minnesota talking to farmers and businesses. \nThey tell me not only did they want a 5-year farm bill, but they needed \na 5-year farm bill so they could plan for the future. Well, we finally \nhave gotten it done.\n  There are so many important pieces to this bill, and I want to speak \nabout a few of them today.\n  When I meet with farm leaders and visit farms all across Minnesota, I \nhear over and over about the importance of providing farmers with a \nstrong safety net. There is a lot of uncertainty when it comes to \nfarming. Once a farmer puts his crop into the ground, the crops are \nvulnerable to drought, to too much rain, to disease, and different \nkinds of pests and to other natural disasters. In 2012, for example, we \nwitnessed a terrible drought that devastated the Nation's corn and \nsoybean crops and forced ranchers to cull their livestock.\n  All of these safety net programs in the bill are important because \nthey protect our farmers and ranchers, and they also protect American \nconsumers by making sure families have a reliable, domestically \nproduced supply of food.\n  The bill provides disaster assurances for livestock producers. It \ncontains a dairy program so our dairy producers have the certainty they \nneed. It contains a sugar program to help protect our sugar growers, \nAmerican sugar growers.\n  Minnesota is home to a large number of beet sugar growers, and the \nsugar industry provides thousands of good-paying jobs, American jobs, \nand billions of dollars to the economy of our region. I fought to make \nsure we kept this vital program in place.\n  This bill also includes crop insurance so farmers have certainty with \nrespect to their planting decisions.\n  One of the things the farm bill does, which was very important to me \nand to so many people, is to link the crop insurance program to \nconservation. Minnesota farmers are good stewards of the land and \nunderstand how critical conservation is, and so do our hunters and our \nanglers. With this provision in the farm bill, when our farmers receive \nthe crop insurance benefits, they also agree to implement conservation \npractices that are good for our land and for our water.\n  In addition to a strong safety net in the conservation provisions, \nthe bill also contains many provisions that are very important to \nMinnesota agriculture. For example, I pushed to include provisions to \nsupport beginning farmers. With the average age of farmers in Minnesota \napproaching 60, we need to invest in a new generation of farmers and \nranchers. That is why the beginning farmer and rancher program has been \na priority of mine. This important program will support training and \neducation for beginning farmers, and it will help new farmers overcome \nthe steep financial hurdles they often face when starting.\n  I am also very proud of the comprehensive energy title of the bill, \nwhich I helped to author. The energy sector in agriculture produces \njobs and supports rural communities in Minnesota and across the \ncountry. The energy title includes programs such as the Rural Energy \nfor America Program--or REAP--which provides farmers and rural business \nservices with loans and grants so they can invest in energy efficiency \nand renewable energy to reduce their energy bills.\n  It also includes programs to help rural America develop advanced \nbiofuels that will help wean the Nation off of foreign oil. It also \nincludes programs to help move the Nation away from a foreign petroleum \neconomy, the way products are increasingly made out of homegrown \nrenewable biomass. Those are only some of what I fought for in the \nbill. The bill does all of these critically important things while also \nreducing the deficit by billions of dollars.\n  Like all bipartisan compromises, the bill is not perfect. In \nparticular, I am not happy with the cuts to the nutrition program on \nwhich so many low-income families rely. I am somewhat relieved in the \nend these cuts were closer to what was in the original Senate bill than \nthe draconian cuts the House of Representatives had called for and \npassed in their bill. I appreciate the tough job, though, my colleagues \nhad on their hands to arrive at a final compromise.\n  At the end of the day, this is an incredibly important piece of \nlegislation that I and many colleagues on both sides of the aisle have \nbeen working to get over the finish line. I am pleased we have finally \ncome together to pass a bipartisan 5-year farm bill that will make \nneeded reforms and give farmers the certainty they need to plan for the \nfuture. The bill we passed will not only support rural America but our \nentire Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Last week President Obama came to Congress and \ndelivered the State of the Union Address. He admitted that under the \nObama economy too many Americans are still out of work. The President \ndidn't admit that his policies were to blame, but he did promise to \nact. He said: ``Wherever and whenever I can take steps without \nlegislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's \nwhat I am going to do.'' What the President promised all of us he \npromised the country last week.\n  I believe the President could start by coming clean about how his \nhealth care law is hurting jobs and harming middle-class Americans.\n  Just this morning, the Congressional Budget Office put out their \nestimate that the President's health care law will reduce the number of \nfull-time workers by 2.3 million people by the year 2021. That includes \npeople who will lose their jobs, people who will have their hours cut, \nand mostly people who will decide not to work. This is one of the \nperverse incentives in this terrible law. It actually encourages able-\nbodied people to not work. We are already faced with the lowest labor \nforce participation rate we have seen in 35 years and this number they \nhave come out with--over 2 million fewer jobs in our economy. When we \nwere debating the health care in the Senate and the CBO came out with \ntheir estimate based on the way they read the law before it went into \neffect, they said this could negatively impact jobs and the economy to \nthe tune of 800,000. Now we are at 2\\1/2\\ times that many--over 2 \nmillion fewer jobs--and as a result specifically of the health care \nlaw. We should be doing all we can to increase labor force \nparticipation. The health care law actually pushes it in the opposite \ndirection.\n  The Congressional Budget Office also said this morning that the \nhealth care law will provide health insurance to 2 million fewer people \nthis year than previous estimates had expected. One of the main reasons \nDemocrats insisted they needed to pass this law in the first place was \nto cover uninsured people. Now the Congressional Budget Office doesn't \neven expect it to do the job the Democrats intended it to do very well.\n  The law is raising costs, it is hurting middle-class Americans, and \nnot even helping the people the Democrats told us it was going to help \nin the first place. President Obama promised last week to act and to do \nsomething to\n\n[[Page S747]]\n\ncreate jobs. What we see is this health care law is actually reducing \njobs and reducing the number of people working. There are other things \nthe President could do to help create jobs. The first thing, though, \nwould be to work with Republicans to help repeal the health care law \nand come up with reforms that will actually work.\n  He could also look at a number of the options on the energy front \nthat would help the private sector create jobs--no government money \nneeded.\n  The President says he wants to do things that don't require \nlegislation. Without any legislation at all, the President could \napprove the Keystone XL Pipeline and expand opportunity for thousands \nof American families.\n  Over the past 5 years, a small number of lawyers, consultants, \nbureaucrats, and environmental activists have made a living over \nhaggling about the pipeline. Meanwhile, the President has turned his \nback on middle-class people who are in need of jobs, desperate need of \njobs--people living in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, other States.\n  TransCanada submitted its application for a permit to build the \nKeystone XL Pipeline more than 5 years ago. Ever since, President Obama \nhas wasted America's time and money grasping for excuses in order for \nhim to be able to reject it.\n  The State Department's latest environmental review confirms yet again \nthat the pipeline shows no significant environmental impact, and it \nwill support more than 42,000 jobs. Last summer, the President sneered \nat those jobs. He said they were just ``a blip relative to the need.'' \nFor out-of-work Americans, those jobs are more than a blip. For them, \nthis is more than a pipeline, it is a lifeline. It is way past time for \nPresident Obama to quit stalling and to finally do the right thing for \nthose Americans.\n  They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and \nover and expecting different results. Yet the Obama administration has \nbeen doing the same thing over and over.\n  We have had a draft environmental impact statement. We have had a \nsupplemental environmental impact statement, we have had a final \nenvironmental impact statement, then we have had a draft supplemental \nimpact statement, and Friday we had the final supplemental \nenvironmental impact statement.\n  People at home listening to this would say why would it take 2 \nyears--and it did, it took 2 years--to go from the supplemental draft \nenvironmental impact to the draft supplemental environmental impact \nstatement. It makes no sense at all. This is the fifth report by the \nState Department and the conclusion is always the same. They could do \nthis report another 5 times or another 50 times. The result is still \ngoing to be the same. It is a simple cost-benefit analysis. The cost is \nno significant environmental impact. The benefits are at least 42,000 \njobs and a chance to reduce our dependence on overseas oil.\n  Now that the complaints from the far-left environmental extremists \nhave been debunked, what do they say? According to the news reports, \nsome will have protests and some are planning lawsuits. The Washington \nPost had a story this Sunday entitled ``For pipeline, the `gut check' \nmoment.'' It talked about some of the fanatical anti-energy protesters \nwho refuse to accept the science. They want to pressure the President \nand Secretary of State Kerry to make sure these jobs never get created. \nThis is one good quote: ``Neva Goodwin, co-director of the Global \nDevelopment and Environment Institute at Tufts University and a \ncontributor to Kerry's past campaigns, said that she will be opposing \nthe pipeline in another way.''\n  The article quotes her as saying: ``I am working with an informal \nnetwork of political donors that will be pushing Kerry to do the right \nthing.''\n  Political donors and activists on the left are committed to killing \nthis pipeline, regardless of the science, regardless of the middle-\nclass jobs, and regardless of what is in the best interests of the \ncountry.\n  I find it astonishing that former Energy Secretary Steven Chu said \nyesterday, on this very point, what about the science, what about the \ncost-benefit analysis. President Obama's former Secretary of Energy \nsaid yesterday: ``The decision on whether the construction should \nhappen was a political one, not a scientific one.'' So much for the \nPresident of the United States saying the decision would be based on \nscience.\n\n  The President's activist base will be mobilizing and fighting against \ngood American jobs. So what does the administration itself say? It says \nit wants to wait for some more opinions.\n  The White House Chief of Staff said Sunday that the President wants \nofficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy \nDepartment, and other agencies to tell him what they think. I know what \nthe former Secretary of Energy thought. He said the decision on whether \nthe construction should happen was a political decision, not a \nscientific one.\n  You don't need to look any further. Look at the history of the \nproject. TransCanada applied to build this pipeline more than 5 years \nago. The Obama administration has set deadlines and said it would make \na decision. First, it was the end of 2011; then it was after the \nelection in 2012; and then it was at the end of 2013. That is what \nPresident Obama promised Republican Senators when he met with us last \nMarch. The administration has missed every deadline, broken every \npromise. It is interesting because the last time the Senate voted on \nthe subject, 17 Democrats joined every Republican to support the \npipeline.\n  The Obama administration is still trying to find a way to evade and \nto avoid having to make a decision. This really ought to be \nembarrassing to an administration. President Obama was elected to make \ndecisions. The science is settled. The President should be embarrassed \nwhen his former Secretary of Energy says the decision on whether the \nconstruction should happen was a political one and not a scientific \none.\n  Any objections have been heard; they have been answered. There are no \nmore excuses. It is time for the President to make up his mind. Is he \ngoing to follow the science or just the politics? He should approve the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. He should do it now. He should do the job he was \nelected to do so middle-class Americans can do the jobs they \ndesperately want to do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to S. 1963.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n        Supporting Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last week, Attorney General Eric Holder \nappeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a regular oversight \nhearing. I appreciated the Attorney General's cooperation and \nwillingness to appear before the Committee to discuss a variety of \nimportant matters. His testimony reminded us of the Justice \nDepartment's central role in carrying out the policy of Congress to \nsupport our Nation's law enforcement officers and first responders.\n  There is one vital program that provides support to the families of \nfallen law enforcement officers and other first responders, and that is \nthe Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program--the PSOB. I am proud to \nhave authored legislation that has expanded and improved the PSOB in \nimportant ways so that we honor the sacrifices made by our law \nenforcement officers and first responders. From my Hometown Heroes \nSurvivors Benefits Act to the Dale Long Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits Improvement Act, I have fought to make sure that all of the \nfamilies who have lost an officer or first responder are honored. We \ngot those laws passed to honor the service of these dedicated first \nresponders and we exercised considerable oversight to make sure the \nprogram was administered fairly and efficiently. We wish we didn't need \nthe PSOB program because it is a reminder to Americans about the \ndangers law enforcement officers face every day. But because they do \nface those dangers, we need the program. I thank the Attorney General \nfor his leadership and commitment to making this program more \nresponsive to Congressional intent and more effective for grieving \nfamilies.\n\n[[Page S748]]\n\n  Sadly, in 2013, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund \nreported that 111 law enforcement officers in the United States were \nkilled in the line of duty. This preliminary data reflects an eight \npercent decrease from the number of officer fatalities in 2012, and \namounts to the fewest line of duty deaths in more than five decades. \nThis trend is good news, but Congress must not let up on its effort to \nincrease officer safety. Every single line-of-duty death represents \nenormous tragedy for the families but also for the communities of these \nofficers.\n  For decades, Congress has been steadfast in its support of law \nenforcement officers, and has traditionally maintained policies to \nincrease officer safety and well-being. Until recently, Congress has \nacted decisively in support of those who dedicate themselves to \nprotecting their communities. As someone who had the privilege to serve \nin law enforcement for 8 years, I am so proud of what we have done in \nthe past. But now, for some reason, there are some in Congress who do \nnot believe the support of law enforcement officers and first \nresponders can be a Federal responsibility. I disagree. I remain \ncommitted to fighting for all of our State and local law enforcement \nofficials.\n  Last fall the Senate Judiciary Committee reported two important bills \nto support our Nation's law enforcement officers. Both bills would help \nprotect the lives of law enforcement officers. Both have been approved \nin this body for immediate passage by every single Democratic Senator. \nUnfortunately, there are some Republican Senators who continue to \nobstruct passage of both bills in the Senate. I worry that some are \nputting ideology ahead of the safety of our law enforcement officers.\n  More than a decade ago, a Republican Senator from Colorado, Senator \nBen Nighthorse Campbell, and I joined forces--again, because both of us \nhad a law enforcement background--and we authored the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act. We worked across the aisle to get both \nRepublicans and Democrats to support us, and we created a grant program \nthat has assisted State and local law enforcement agencies in \npurchasing more than 1 million protective vests.\n  In fact, Madam President, I remember a police officer who testified \nbefore the Judiciary Committee telling us how much he loved law \nenforcement, but what he loved even more was his family, his parents, \nhis wife, and his children. When he talked, he said: I came within a \nsecond of never being with them again. He said: This is what saved me. \nHe pulled up from under the desk a bulletproof vest and we could see \nthe slugs stuck in it. He said: I was ambushed and had a cracked rib, \nbut later that day I saw my family. Without this vest and the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, I never would have seen my \nfamily again.\n  Between 2000 and 2010, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act has \nbeen reauthorized three times by unanimous consent. Bulletproof vests \nhave saved the lives of more than 3,000 law enforcement officers. These \nare officers who put their own lives on the line. They do not stop to \nsay: Wait a minute, how did people vote on the bulletproof vest act? \nThey respond when they are called.\n  Unfortunately, since 2012, a few Republican Senators have blocked \npassage of this bill and thwarted the vast majority of senators who \nwant to see this program reauthorized so that it can continue to save \nthe lives of those who keep our communities safe. There is no dispute \nthat the Bulletproof Vest Partnership program saves lives. In testimony \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee in February 2012, the Government \nAccountability Office noted that since 1987, bulletproof vests have \nsaved the lives of more than 3,000 law enforcement officers. I am \ndisappointed we can't all come together to promote the safety of our \nNation's law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every \nday to ensure our safety. It is our duty to support them and I call on \nall senators to stand with them and pass this important legislation.\n  Madam President, I remember walking down the street in a town in \nColorado and a police officer in uniform walked up to me and asked: Are \nyou Senator Leahy? I said: I am. He tapped his chest, and you could \nhear the thunk, thunk of the bulletproof vest, and he said: I want to \nthank you, and I want to thank Senator Campbell. That is all he said. I \nwas choked up listening to him.\n  The Judiciary Committee also reported the National Blue Alert Act. \nThis is a bipartisan bill. It passed the House of Representatives by an \noverwhelming majority of Republicans and Democrats. The National Blue \nAlert Act would create a national alert system to notify all State and \nFederal law enforcement agencies with critical information when an \nofficer is injured or killed in the line of duty. I am a proud \ncosponsor of it. It is sponsored by Senator Cardin and Senator Graham, \na key Democrat and Republican. This bill would help apprehend a \nfugitive suspected of seriously injuring or killing a law enforcement \nofficer and who is fleeing through multiple jurisdictions. It defies \ncommon sense that any senator would object to this legislation, which \ncontains no fiscal authorization and is universally supported by law \nenforcement leaders across the country.\n  In recent weeks, some Senators have expressed concern for the safety \nof law enforcement officers in the context of the Senate confirmation \nprocess. I do not question that these Senators are as concerned as I am \nabout the safety of law enforcement officers, but I invite those who \nhave expressed concern before the cameras for the well-being of law \nenforcement officers to come here and support the two bills I have \ndiscussed today and end the needless obstruction of this proven \ncommonsense legislation. Do your press conferences, if you want. Say \nyou are in favor of law enforcement. Who is going to be against law \nenforcement? But then prove it. Let us get these passed.\n  I am proud that every Democratic member has supported it, and most \nRepublicans do. Those few who are opposed, let us vote. In the coming \nweeks, as the Senate moves closer to recognizing our Nation's fallen \nlaw enforcement officers during National Police Week in May, I intend \nto come to the floor to seek unanimous consent to pass these long-\nstalled bills. If Senators want to oppose them, fine, vote against \nthem, but they ought to be willing to join me on the floor and explain \nthose objections to the thousands of law enforcement officers and \nfamilies who will soon gather in Washington to honor those who have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in service to their fellow citizens.\n  Our law enforcement officers risk their lives every day to keep us \nsafe. They deserve a Congress that does more than just talk about their \nservice. They deserve protection.\n  One of the saddest days I ever spent as State's attorney was going to \nthe funeral of a police officer killed in the line of duty. It was a \nsnowy day in Vermont. The snow was falling gently from the sky, and \nthere were several miles of police cars--their blue lights reflected \nagainst the white snow. Such a peaceful scene--but not for the family \nof that police officer. I said to myself that I would do everything I \ncould to protect them, and I appreciate those Republicans and Democrats \nwho have joined me on this. We cannot bring back a fallen officer but \nwe can and we must work together to protect the next one who may come \nunder fire. I call on friends from across the aisle to join all the \nrest of us, and your fellow Republicans who have already joined, to \nprotect law enforcement officers. Let us immediately reauthorize the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, and let us pass Senator Cardin \nand Senator Graham's National Blue Alert Act.\n  We have many--I know in my office--who have worked on this. I will \nmention Matt Virkstis, whose background is at the Vermont Law School, \nthat some in this body are well aware of, such as our distinguished \nSenate Parliamentarian. But I also appreciate all those police \nofficers--and I have no idea what their politics are--who come in to \nsay thank you to those of us who have supported the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership program. It is such an easy thing to do. It should be \nnoncontroversial. Let us get back to the days where, when we have \nsomething noncontroversial, we just pass it. Together we can honor the \nservice of those who keep us safe.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I see my dear friend is here, so I will not suggest the absence of a \nquorum. I yield the floor, and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S749]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                          The Debt and Deficit\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I returned to the Senate in 2011 to \ntackle what I believed to be the greatest challenge facing our country, \nand I have devoted much of my first 3 years in this returned term on \nworking to achieve a debt reduction agreement that would put our Nation \non a path to fiscal health and fiscal responsibility.\n  I have been involved in discussions for endless hours and days and \nmonths with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--Republicans and \nDemocrats--with the administration and with outside groups over trying \nto put together a long-term deficit and debt reduction plan that will \nput us on the path to fiscal health, to finding a way forward to deal \nwith our ever mounting debt.\n  I am committed to working with my colleagues and the administration \non this issue because I believe, ultimately, the most important thing \nwe can do for the future of our country, for future generations--the \nmost important legacy we can leave during our term of service here--is \nto solve our Nation's fiscal crisis.\n  Recently, we have heard relatively little about this. Despite efforts \nwhich have been ongoing for the last 4 to 6 years, we have not come to \na resolution; we have not come to an agreement which puts us at the \nbeginning of a path to resolve this problem. Yet each year it mounts. \nOur debt dramatically increases. We continue on deficit spending.\n  Even though we have made a few efforts to reduce deficit spending to \nhalf of what it has been--at least for this coming year, based on the \nsequester and the implication of that--it is also clear that this is \ntemporary. It is also clear that whether we reduce it in half or not, \nthe other half still amounts to more than half a trillion dollars of \nexcess spending, driving our debt higher and higher.\n  I am privileged to serve as the senior Republican Senator on the \nJoint Economic Committee. We spend a fair amount of time looking at the \nprojections for the future and how they ought to shape our actions here \nin the Congress, as well as how we should work with the administration \nin terms of dealing with this issue.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan group who deals with \nnumbers, not with politics--at least they are not supposed to. They \nbring about their annual ``Budget and Economic Outlook,'' which was \nreleased today. Looking at it is shocking. Never has my conviction been \nstronger than today when I read this outlook which has just been \nreleased. It addresses issues important for all of us. I am going to \ntalk about just the top 10. But if this is not a siren call to us to \nrefocus our efforts on this issue, we are going to regret to the end of \nour lives not having taken action to begin the process of getting this \ncountry's fiscal health and responsibility back in order.\n  Again, this is the Congressional Budget Office--a nonpartisan group \nestablished by this body to deal with numbers and give us facts and \nprojections from economists who give us the opportunity then to look at \nhow we shape policies.\n  I was stunned by the CBO report, and I would like to share the \nshocking findings. I hope every Member of Congress will look at this. I \nam going to distribute it on behalf of the Joint Economic Committee so \nwe have access to this. But it ought to send a shock wave through all \nof us, and it ought to provide us with the courage and the will to step \nup and do what I think we all know we need to do.\n  Finding No. 1. The national debt has exploded over the last several \nyears. Gross Federal debt in 2014 is projected to reach $17.7 trillion, \nwhich is a figure larger than our entire economy and an increase of \nover $7 trillion in just the last 5 years under this President.\n  Point No. 2. CBO projects cumulative deficits from 2014-2023 to be $1 \ntrillion larger than last year's projection for the same time period.\n  Last year was startling enough. Now we learn--after 1 year of \nsequestration, holding down spending, and speeches on this floor saying \nwe are getting control of this, CBO comes along and says the cumulative \ndeficits from 2014 to 2023 will be $1 trillion larger than they thought \njust last year. So while we are congratulating ourselves for holding \ndown spending, we are told we are adding $1 trillion more than was \nprojected and anticipated last year.\n  Now we are dealing with the so-called Affordable Care Act--yet to be \nproven to be affordable. CBO says that ObamaCare will reduce the number \nof full-time workers by 2.3 million people through 2021. At a time when \nthis was sold as a plan to put Americans back to work, as something \nthat would reduce our deficit because we would get control of out-of-\ncontrol health care spending, we are told by the Congressional Budget \nOffice that the number of full-time workers will decrease by 2.3 \nmillion. This is a significant increase from the last estimate of \n800,000 during the same time period. So we have gone from an 800,000 \nprojection not that long ago to 2.3 million.\n  Point No. 4. Mandatory spending--particularly our health and \nretirement security programs--is crowding out all other priorities. The \nCongressional Budget Office once again has said that as we look at our \ntotal budget, the mandatory spending continues to crowd out all other \nspending priorities.\n  This figure stood out and stunned me because it is the first time I \nhave seen such an extraordinary jump in the mandatory spending \npercentage of our total spending.\n  On mandatory spending, CBO says interest on the debt is projected to \nconsume 94 percent of all Federal revenues 10 years from now, squeezing \nout funding for all other priorities. Squeezing out? Eliminating. We \nare entering the season when interest groups from our State come with \nmany creative and innovative ideas as to how they could better spend or \nspend more money on their particular programs.\n  They come in and say, ``We are here to encourage you to increase \nspending for medical research at the National Institutes of Health'' \nor, ``We are here to have you understand how important scholarship \ngrants, Pell grants, and others are for enrollment of students in our \nStates'' or, ``We are here to talk about the need to improve our \ninfrastructure, to pave our roads and fill potholes and build and \nrepair and establish new infrastructure for the movement of water, \nsewage treatment.'' On and on it goes. We can go right down the list of \nliterally hundreds of requests as to how tax dollars ought to be spent \nto better improve our States, to better improve our health, to better \nimprove our education, to better improve a whole range of things, \nincluding support for national security.\n  I have to look them in the eye and say: Every year we have a smaller \npot of money percentage-wise of our budget to apply to all these \ndiscretionary spending programs which Congress has to approve every \nyear.\n  I say: I am really not here to argue about whether money for the \nNational Institutes of Health is more important than money for \neducation grants or money for infrastructure development or any other \nendeavor in which the Federal Government is involved.\n  Every year all of these are going to be faced with less money to fund \nthese programs. Some of them ought to receive less and some of them \nought to be closed and the waste and fraud ought to be eliminated. \nNevertheless, there are essential functions that need to be funded, and \nthey won't be able to be funded adequately and will continue to shrink \nas the mandatory spending runs out of control.\n  But to think that of all the revenue--all the tax dollars that come \ninto the Treasury 10 years from now, 94 percent will be spent on \nprograms we have no control over and won't be available for any of the \nthings I mentioned and dozens--if not more--of programs. It is simply \nunsustainable. Ninety-four percent. Six percent left to provide for our \nnational security and national defense, our institutes of health, \neducation, infrastructure development, manufacturing innovation, \nresearch and development--you name it.\n  CBO also said Social Security is in jeopardy. They project that \nSocial Security ``will continue to run cash flow deficits every year \nduring the next decade.'' And the disability insurance trust fund will \nbe insolvent by 2017. That is 3 years away.\n  Let me repeat that. The Congressional Budget Office said that at the \ncurrent rate the Social Security disability insurance trust fund will \nbe insolvent in 3 years.\n  They also said mandatory spending on health care programs is \nexploding.\n\n[[Page S750]]\n\n  We have heard it said on this floor and we have heard it mentioned in \nthe State of the Union Address and by the administration numerous \ntimes, that we are getting control of our exploding health care costs \nthrough the Affordable Care Act. In 2013 the Federal Government spent \n$861 billion on Medicare, Medicaid, and other major health care \nprograms. This year the collective cost is expected to reach $933 \nbillion and then nearly double by the year 2024 to $1.8 trillion. I \ndon't call that getting control of our health care costs. Yet this \nmandatory spending part of our budget will continue to grow to the \npoint where we simply have no money left for any other function of \ngovernment.\n  All this, of course, is based on interest rates and the assumption as \nto what they will be. CBO says interest on our debt is set to double. \nAnnual interest payments on the national debt are estimated to more \nthan double over the next 10 years from 1.3 percent of our gross \ndomestic product in 2014 to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2024. And we know \nfrom the past that estimates of what will happen with interest rates \nwill drive that rate higher, particularly as our fiscal crisis gets \nmore desperate.\n  Point No. 8. Again, the Congressional Budget Office says: We have a \nspending problem and not a taxing problem. Projected revenues will \nexceed the 40-year historical average of gross domestic product this \nyear and outpace growth in our economy over the next 10 years.\n  So they say the problem isn't too little revenue. That is going to \ncontinue to pour in here as we continue to raise taxes. But you can't \nraise taxes fast enough or adequate enough without, one, destroying our \neconomy or limiting our economy, but, secondly, to keep pace with the \nspending, which will hit its projected average of 20.5 percent this \nyear and over the next 10 years outpace economic growth to a greater \ndegree.\n  CBO notes that ``after 2024, the long-term trajectory of spending \nwill drive up debt to nearly unprecedented levels.\n  Let me repeat that. This is a quote from the Congressional Budget \nOffice: ``After 2024, the long-term trajectory of spending will drive \nup debt to nearly unprecedented levels.''\n  CBO suggests that such an upward path would ultimately be \nunsustainable.\n  Point No. 9. Labor force participation will continue to decline over \nthe next several years. CBO projects that labor participation will drop \nto 62.5 percent by the end of 2017, fueled in part by the mandates in \nthe Affordable Care Act and negative impact on job creators as a \nresult.\n  Point No. 10. The Congressional Budget Office suggests that even \nthese dire projections may be overly optimistic. CBO projects real \neconomic growth of 3.1 percent, which is notably higher than private \nsector and IMF estimates of 2.4 percent to 2.8 percent. CBO says that \nit ``would probably trim its projection of GDP growth'' in 2014, based \non late-2013 data. So the numbers we are dealing with today may be \noverly optimistic. As dire as this report is, it may be that we are \nunderestimating the damage that will come from our inability to control \nspending and put us on a path to fiscal health.\n\n  This isn't another siren alerting Washington to the stark reality of \nour country desperately needing a real debt reduction agreement; this \nis, a five-alarm fire. Our fiscal house is engulfed in flames. The \nquestion is, When are we, who have been given the responsibility by the \npeople we represent, going to have the courage to stand and do \nsomething about this, to put out this fire?\n  We cannot overlook the fact that our Nation is facing record deficits \nas far as the eye can see. We are careening on an unsustainable, \nunstable fiscal path. We need all hands on deck to address this now--\nnot tomorrow, not after the next election. How many times have we \nheard, after this next election, we need to dig down and roll up our \nsleeves and take on this challenge. We need to do this now because the \nthreat is now.\n  A credible, long-term plan to reduce our debt and put our country \nback on a path of fiscal health and economic growth and opportunity is \nthe only way we can preserve the America we enjoy today or have enjoyed \nin the past. It is the only way to preserve that for future \ngenerations. So I think we have a generational responsibility that is \nas important as any we have faced before.\n  Many say our legacy rests on what we do here. Whether that is true, \nwe certainly will be measured by what we do or what we don't do \nrelative to this particular crisis. Again, this is not a Republican \nconservative standing and saying: This is how I see things. I am simply \nreciting how the entity we turn to, the Congressional Budget Office--a \nneutral body which just does the math and then draws conclusions from \nit--actually, we draw the conclusions; they put the numbers down. This \nis what the Congressional Budget Office has told us. These are stunning \nnumbers, much more than any of us anticipated. I think there has been a \nlittle lull of us thinking: Well, we have things under control. We had \nsequester; that was kind of messy, but it did save some money. Now we \nhave a budget. We are going forward and back to regular order.\n  What is regular order? Regular order is continuing to spend more than \na one-half trillion dollars more than we bring in, in revenue. Raising \ntaxes, according to CBO, is not going to solve the problem; that just \nhinders economic growth.\n  So those of us on both sides of this body who have worked to address \nthese issues now, not later; those of us who have worked with the \nadministration--and I was part of a small group working with the \nadministration over a 7-month period of time with the President \ndirectly and with some of his top advisers to try to put something in \nplace, as modest as it was or as it seemed to end up being--and we were \nnot even able to complete that. That burden, that responsibility, that \nlegacy rests on our shoulders. That duty rests on our shoulders, to \nacknowledge these facts, acknowledge these numbers, and to understand \nwhat impact it is going to have on the future of this country, our \nchildren and grandchildren, everybody's children and grandchildren, and \nperhaps even our generation.\n  So I will be distributing this report from Republicans on the Joint \nEconomic Committee. I am hoping our report sends out yet another alarm, \nand we will not simply rest on the fact that we have made a baby step \nhere in terms of getting some control over our spending. But as we turn \naround--akin to a little grass fire over here that we put out across \nthe street while the five-alarmer is burning away, blazing away, and we \nare saying we will deal with it later. We can't deal with it later. We \nmust deal with it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Hawaii for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                College Affordability and Innovation Act\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I am on the floor with my colleague \nSenator Schatz from Hawaii to talk about our recent introduction of a \npiece of legislation entitled ``The College Affordability and \nInnovation Act of 2014,'' which we introduced along with our good \nfriends Senator Murray of Washington and Senator Sanders of Vermont.\n  By way of framing the conversation we will have today, I wish to \nspeak about one particular college that maybe paints a picture of the \ncrisis we are in today with respect to the mounting cost that confronts \nkids and families when they want to get a college education and the \nvariety of outcomes--the frankly surprising and often shocking variety \nof outcomes--that students are getting when they show up at the doors \nof institutions of education, particularly institutions of for-profit \neducation. Corinthian College is a school in California--not a small \none but a pretty big college. It has about 100 campuses in 25 different \nStates. Let me give some statistics about Corinthian College. After \nabout a year, over half of the students who enroll drop out. When they \nare finished with their education, whether it be to a degree or not, \nabout one-third of all students who go to Corinthian default on their \nstudent loans. If 56 percent isn't a bad enough number in terms of 1-\nyear dropout rates, after 4 years, only 6 percent of all the kids who \nwalk in\n\n[[Page S751]]\n\nthrough the doors of Corinthian College get a degree--6 percent of \nthose kids.\n  Affordability isn't an argument in favor of this school either. For a \nlegal assistant degree, they charge $28,000, but down the street at a \ncommunity college a person can get that same degree for $2,500. They \nhave a 35-percent default rate, a 6-percent 4-year graduation rate, and \ndegrees that can cost 14 times as much as comparable local schools.\n  Guess what. The Federal Government rewards this school with $1.6 \nbillion in Federal aid every year and $500 million in Pell grant money \nevery year. So this example, which frankly can be repeated over and \nover, especially in the for-profit world, speaks to the challenge we \nhave.\n  We have done a very credible job over the course of the last few \nyears in keeping down the interest rate we charge students who want to \ntake out loans to go to school. No one has worked harder on this issue \ninside this body and outside this body than the Presiding Officer. But \nwe also have to have a concurrent conversation about the sticker price \nof college because it can't be enough that we are facilitating student \nborrowing; we actually have to try to engage in a real effort, using \nFederal leverage, for the first time perhaps in our history of Federal \nhigher education policy, to push the cost of tuition down in the first \nplace. That is what the College Affordability and Innovation Act seeks \nto do.\n  As Senator Schatz will talk about, there aren't a lot of issues that \nare much more important to the middle class than the cost of higher \neducation. We both know that. We have partnered on this piece of \nlegislation in part because not only are we not that far away from the \ntime in our lives when we were in college, but we are paying back our \nstudent loans and saving for our kids' education, so we get how much of \nan annual budget can be taken up in paying for both prior and saving \nfor future college. So we attack this problem in two ways--and I will \njust briefly speak about the first way and then I think the Senator \nfrom Hawaii can speak a little bit about the second method.\n  First, we think it is time for a little bit more innovation when it \ncomes to the way in which college is structured. There is no magic to \nthe fact that today one has to sit in a classroom for 4 years, taking a \nrequisite amount of credits, in order to get a degree. There is a lot \nof interesting innovation happening out there where a small subset of \nschools are saying: Wait a second. Maybe there is a different way to do \nit.\n  For instance, maybe we should award a degree based on the \ncompetencies a student gets, regardless of whether the student needs 2 \nyears or 3 years or 4 years to get that degree or, for instance, maybe \nwe should give students who show up at their freshman year of school \nwith prior learning more credit for that, whether they got that \nexperience studying at a high school or in the work force or in the \nmilitary. Some students don't have to start as a freshman; some \nstudents can start as a sophomore or a junior.\n  Maybe it is a renewed effort to consolidate graduate programs with \nundergraduate programs. I think President Obama is right; one doesn't \nneed 7 years to become a lawyer in this country. It doesn't make a lot \nof sense that one has to essentially spend 10 to 15 years in education \nand training to become a doctor. We can consolidate graduate and \nundergraduate programs.\n  But whatever we do, we have to admit that one of the easiest ways to \nreduce the cost of a degree is to reduce the time it takes to get a \ndegree. So the first part of our bill focuses on giving some grants to \na small number of schools to build out the right way to do competency-\nbased degree programming or initiatives to give greater credit for \nprior learning or consolidations of graduate and undergraduate degrees.\n  We introduced this piece of legislation because we think it is time \nto start having a real conversation about what the Federal Government \ncan do to control and lower the price of college education. It is \nbreaking the bank for families. We can do something about it. If we \ndidn't have any tools at our disposal, maybe this wouldn't be a \nworthwhile conversation, but we give out $140 billion in Federal aid \nevery year, and it is about time we start demanding some accountability \nfor that money, whether it is accountability for cost or accountability \nfor quality. It doesn't make sense for taxpayers to be sending $1.6 \nbillion a year to a school with a 6-percent graduation rate, a 38-\npercent loan default rate, and prices that are simply not competitive \nin the landscape of college education.\n  I am pleased to be on the floor with my colleague Senator Schatz, and \nI am happy to turn the floor over to him.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis partnership on this legislation. He has been a real friend and a \ntrue partner. We are happy to have the support of Senator Murray from \nWashington as well as Senator Sanders. They have been working on this \nissue for a long time.\n  This is the middle class issue of our time. It doesn't just belong to \ncollege-aged students; it belongs to all of us. Senator Murphy spoke \nabout how important it is for those of us who have young children and \nare beginning the process of trying to save for our children's college \neducation, but it also belongs to the grandparents' generation. So many \npeople are thinking about whether they can help their kids to \nameliorate their existing student loans or their grandkids to be able \nto afford college.\n  As Senator Murphy mentioned, we spend almost $150 billion in some \nform or fashion on Federal financial aid for institutions of higher \nlearning, and that is good. That is a matter of national strategy. That \nis about the American dream. That is about the premise that the \nPresident talked about in his State of the Union Address, which is that \nif people work hard and play by the rules, they can move up the \neconomic ladder. Higher education is one of the best ways to do that. \nIt always has been in the United States of America. But here is the \nproblem. The Senator from Connecticut talked about an individual \nexample, but let me give the aggregate data.\n  Over the last 10 years, we have spent 20 percent more and we have \ngotten 25 percent less. We are spending 20 percent more and we are \ngetting 25 percent less. That means that although our investment in \nhigher education and theoretically in college affordability has \nincreased, the net cost for students has gone up by 25 percent. We now \nhave more than $1 trillion in student loan debt. It is the second \nlargest source of debt, to mortgage interest, and it has now outpaced \ncredit card debt.\n  This is a real crisis not just on the consumer level but as a matter \nof economic strategy for our Nation, because to the degree and extent \nthat young people or people who want retraining or people who want to \nget a culinary degree or become a master carpenter or who want to \nbecome an architect or a doctor start to evaluate higher education and \ndecide it is not a good value anymore, that doesn't just impact their \nindividual family or their individual community but it impacts our \nnational economic strategy.\n  College is no longer affordable to many people, and that is despite \nthe fact that we are spending more in raw dollars and in inflation-\nadjusted dollars than ever before.\n  Senator Murphy talked about the innovation portion of this \nlegislation. We also have an accountability portion of this \nlegislation. Here is the basic premise: As an institution of higher \neducation, if you are a for-profit, if you are a not-for-profit, or \neven if you are a public institution, it is not the Federal \nGovernment's job to determine what your mission may be. And certainly \nif you are a private for-profit, we are not here to dictate your \norganization's mission. But a for-profit institution has no special \nright to Federal funding. If you are going to receive billions of \ndollars in Federal subsidies, we think it is reasonable, as we endeavor \nto reauthorize the Higher Education Act, that we tie some reasonable \npublic policy strings to those dollars.\n  All we are saying is that we want institutions of higher learning--\nand especially their leadership--to wake up every morning and not think \nfirst about profits, not think first about how they are going to market \nto find more customers, but to think about access and affordability. \nAnd what we are saying is that different institutions may have \ndifferent missions. A community college has a different mission than a\n\n[[Page S752]]\n\ntraining institute, and a 4-year institution has a different mission \nthan a graduate institution. That is all fine, and that is why we have \nestablished in this legislation an independent commission, comprised of \nexperts, to determine what matrix of incentives and possible penalties \nwould be appropriate for each institution.\n  But here is the bottom line: We are spending more and getting less, \nand we are spending $150 billion. This system is not working, and we \nare pleased to have the support of several of our colleagues. We are \ngoing to be enlisting the support of many others.\n  I am looking forward to continuing the conversation with the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank Senator Schatz.\n  Here is another statistic to think about: It was not so long ago that \nwe ranked first in the Nation with respect to 25-year-olds to 35-year-\nolds with college degrees, and that was not only a source of immense \npride for this country but really the genesis of our economic \ngreatness--that we turned out more college-educated young people than \nany other country in the world. In a very short period of time we \nslipped from 1st to not 2nd or 3rd or 4th but to 12th. We are now 12th \nin the world with respect to the number of 25- to 35-year-olds with \ncollege degrees.\n  Part of the reason for that is that a lot of other countries have \ncaught up to the United States. But the crisis in this country is no \nlonger just a crisis of access. That was the buzzword for a long time, \nthat we needed to increase access to college. We now have a crisis of \ncompletion in which millions of students are starting school and not \nfinishing for a variety of reasons but largely because of the \nastronomical cost.\n  Today the majority of students are not graduating in 6 years. So the \nissue about affordability is not just about attracting more kids into \nthe doors of college--because I will tell you, as I am sure Senator \nSchatz does, I talk to a lot of kids who graduate high school and do \nnot apply to schools in my State because they are scared off by the \ncost and they do not believe they are going to be able to put together \nthe family resources to pay for it--but we also are losing a generation \nof workers because it is taking young people now 6, 7, 8 years to \ncomplete a degree, and often many of them are never completing that \ndegree while still taking on loan after loan after loan and getting \nstuck in the worst possible situation whereby they have thousands of \ndollars in debt and no certificate to bring into the workforce.\n  So our effort is an effort to address cost because we care about \naccess, but it is also an effort to address cost because we care about \ncompletion, and that is one of the big problems we have in our system \ntoday.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I think the Senator is exactly right about that one. Let \nme give you some data. In 2011 only 38 percent of undergraduate \nstudents in a 4-year institution graduated on time. So when you think \nabout the cost of college, you think about the per-year cost. But if it \nis taking 6 or 7 years, then the per-year cost is not as important as \nhow realistic it is for you to finish on time. Just to be clear, those \ndata could be skewed by the fact that there are part-time students and \nall the rest of it. That is not what we are talking about here. It is \nsimply hard to finish on time.\n  But there is hope on the horizon. For instance, the University of \nHawaii has undertaken a program called 15 to Finish. The basic idea is \nthat students, especially in their freshman year, need to know that \nthey need those 15 credits. They need to get help from their counselors \nso that by the time they are in their sophomore year, they are well on \ntheir way to completing their major of choice in the 4-year period of \ntime.\n  The challenge now is that given that legislatures have cut funding to \ninstitutions of higher learning--and as a result you have fewer \ncounselors and fewer people to assist in the student services office--\noftentimes you do not get real counseling with respect to what you need \nuntil it is too late, and then you find that you are on a 5- or 6-year \nplan. Your family may not have made the financial arrangement that puts \nyou in a position to be on the 5-year plan.\n  From a revenue standpoint, if your mission as an institution--for-\nprofit or not-for-profit--is just to fill those seats and to generate \nthose dollars, then that does not matter to you. But the challenge we \nhave right now is that the institutions--the publicly traded ones--have \npressures to generate profits. But even the not-for-profits and even \nthe public institutions--the Universities of Hawaii and the \nUniversities of Connecticut--have had their funding reduced by the \nlegislatures. So their CFOs are trying to figure out new revenue \nstreams, and as long as they can keep enrollment up, that enables them \nto go back to their legislature and say: We are in the black.\n  What we are saying is that is not good enough. We are not asking you \nto be in the black. We certainly understand the need to be fiscally \nresponsible. We certainly understand the need to generate tuition \nrevenue. But here is the thing: The point of higher education is for \nstudents to be able to move up that economic ladder, and to the extent \nthat not only is it not accomplishing that goal, but it is actually \ndoing the opposite for some of our students, they end up with a \nmountain of debt and either no degree or a degree that they find does \nnot make them employable in the marketplace. That is a national shame. \nThat is why we have to address this issue.\n  The good news is we believe we are spending a sufficient amount of \nmoney on the Federal level so we can effectuate these changes just by \nsaying: If you want to receive Federal dollars for your institution of \nhigher learning, then we are asking you to focus on access and \naffordability.\n  I want to give one last piece of data because it actually shocked me, \neven as much as I have been working on this issue. The for-profit \ninstitutions comprise about 12 percent of the students and 30 percent \nof the Federal dollars. Madam President, 12 percent of the students and \n30 percent of the Federal dollars.\n  So while there are institutions that are for-profit that are doing \ngreat work and there are not-for-profits and public institutions that \nhave to do a lot better, let's call it like it is.\n  One of the major challenges here is we have to wrap our arms around \nundue profits and publicly traded companies that are generating profits \nand spending Federal dollars on marketing to students and not providing \nvery much in the way of value.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Let's be clear as to what we are talking about here. We \nbelieve we are talking about a pretty light hand of accountability in \nthe sense that we are really going after the true outliers. The Senator \ntalked about the work happening at the University of Hawaii or the \nUniversity of Connecticut. We do not imagine that any flagship \nuniversity is going to run afoul of these accountability standards. I, \nfrankly, do not believe many public universities at all are going to \nrun afoul of these standards. We are really talking about the handful \nof outliers that have just absolutely abysmal retention rates, \ngraduation rates, default rates, or tuition increase rates.\n  We are also talking about, we think, a pretty nuanced process to try \nto bring those schools around before they lose eligibility for funding. \nOur bill says that if you are not meeting these standards, you have a \npretty long period of time in which you would be on probation with no \npractical effects, in which you could set upon an action plan to \nimprove your affordability or outcomes. Then if, after that period of \ntime, you still were not hitting your benchmarks, then you lose 10 \npercent of your Federal aid, then 20 percent, and then finally, in the \nfourth or fifth years, you would become ineligible. That is plenty of \ntime for a university to correct. But if a school that is starting out \nwith a 6-percent graduation rate cannot improve that over 5 years, why \non Earth would we continue to send $1 billion to that school when it \ncould be used for students who are attending schools that care a lot \nmore about quality education?\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I think the Senator is exactly right. We had the Senator \nfrom Indiana talking about debt and deficits and making sure we spend \nevery Federal dollar intelligently. Right now, we are simply not \nspending this money in the most efficient and efficacious way possible. \nThat is what this legislation is about.\n  Senator Murphy and I talked about how it might have been a little \nmore\n\n[[Page S753]]\n\npolitically satisfying in the short run to put hard caps on college \ntuition and precipitous goals that would have been very easy for us to \narticulate. But the fact is, given that you have different institutions \nwith different missions and you have great work being done at the \ncommunity college level, at the certificate level, and at the 4-year \nand at the graduate level, we wanted to account for the different \nmissions, and we wanted to make sure we did not create the kind of \nincentive program that, for instance, would prevent an institution from \nwanting to take a kid in who is from a lower income area and maybe, \nstatistically speaking, is more likely to default on his or her loan.\n  We really want, as a matter of policy, to focus on access. So it is \naccess; it is affordability; it is the consistency with the mission. \nBut here we are spending $150 billion--more than we ever have--on this \nnational priority, and our results are worse than ever. So the status \nquo cannot stand, and I am really looking forward to working with my \ncolleague on this important issue.\n  Mr. MURPHY. As we wrap up our time on the floor, when my great-\ngrandfather came to this country, he knew that without a college \neducation he could get a job pretty easily that would be able to put \nfood on the table, have decent health care for his family, even provide \nhim with a little bit of a pension that would take care of him. His \nson, my grandfather, followed him into that same profession, working \nfor a ball bearing factory in New Britain, CT.\n  While those jobs still exist, they are getting rarer and rarer. For \nthe next generation to succeed, we know they need access to a college \ndegree. They are not getting that access to completion because we have \nbeen woefully inadequate in using the tools at our disposal at the \nFederal level to try to put pressure on colleges to deliver on both \naffordability and outcome.\n  We hope the introduction of the College Affordability and Innovation \nAct will allow us to open a new front in the debate on higher education \nto promote the idea of reducing the sticker price of college.\n  I thank my colleague for joining me, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nabout 15 minutes, perhaps as many as 17 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I come to the floor today for the \n57th consecutive week that the Senate has been in session to urge my \ncolleagues to wake up to what carbon pollution is doing to our \natmosphere and oceans.\n  I have described Congress as surrounded by a barricade of lies. Today \nI will be more specific. There is not just lying going on about climate \nchange; there is a whole carefully built apparatus of lies. This \napparatus is big and artfully constructed, phony-baloney organizations \ndesigned to look and sound as if they are real, messages honed by \npublic relations experts to sound as if they are truthful, payroll \nscientists whom polluters can trot out when they need them, and the \nwhole thing big and complicated enough that when you see its parts, you \ncould be fooled into thinking it is not all the same beast. But it is, \njust like the mythological Hydra--many heads, same beast. So this \nspeech is going to be about that beast.\n  A recent research article published by Dr. Robert Brulle, a professor \nof sociology and environmental science at Drexel University, describes \nthe beast.\n  He joins a tradition of scholarship in this area, including work by \nNaomi Oreskes, Aaron McCright, and Riley Dunlap, each of whom has \nstudied the forces behind climate denial; and David Rosner and Gerald \nMarkowitz, who explored chemical and lead industry campaigns to deceive \nAmericans about the dangers of those products.\n  The intricate, interconnected propaganda web and funding network of \nthis climate denial beast encompasses over 100 organizations, including \nindustry trade associations, conservative think tanks, and plain old \nphony front groups for polluter interests. It has even co-opted media \noutlets, a phenomenon I chronicled in an earlier speech about the Wall \nStreet Journal editorial page becoming a tool of polluter propaganda.\n  So let's take a look at this climate denial beast, and how polluter \nmoney and dark money flows through its veins. This chart from Dr. \nBrulle's report shows the complex interconnection of the beast's major \nplayers. The green diamonds are the big funders, the Koch-affiliated \nfoundations, the Scaife-affiliated foundations, the American Petroleum \nInstitute, and so on.\n  The blue circles are the who's-who of climate denial groups: the \nHeartland Institute--they are the group that compared folks concerned \nabout climate change to the Unabomber, to give you a sense of what sort \nof people they are--the American Enterprise Institute, right here, the \nHoover Institution, the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the \nMercatus Center, to name just a few.\n  The purpose of this network, to quote the report, is ``a deliberate \nand organized effort to misdirect the public discussion and distort the \npublic's understanding of climate.''\n  To misdirect and distort. The coordinated tactics of this network, \nthe report shows, and I will quote again, ``span a wide range of \nactivities, including political lobbying, contributions to political \ncandidates, and a large number of communication and media efforts that \naim at undermining climate science.''\n  That is the beast. Big money flows through it, more than half a \nbillion dollars. The Drexel University report chronicles that from 2003 \nto 2010, 140 foundations made grants totaling $558 million to 91 \norganizations that actively oppose climate action. It looks like a big \nbeast to build just to propagate climate denial. But if you look at \ncarbon emissions from fossil fuels, which in 2011 EPA estimated to be \nover 5.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide--so take 5.6 billion \ntons of carbon dioxide and then multiple that by the social cost of \ncarbon, the economic and health costs that the polluters cause and \ninflict on the rest of society, which OMB recently set at $37 per \nmetric of CO2--5.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted, \n$37 per metric ton of CO2 on the social cost of carbon. Just \n1 year's emissions will cost roughly 200 billion--with a B--dollars. So \nthe stakes are pretty high for the polluters. If they were to pay for \nthe harm they are causing, half a billion dollars through the beast, \nover 7 years, to get away with $200 billion of harm every year is a \nbargain.\n  More than that, a lot of this machinery was already built. The beast \ndid not spring up at once full grown, it grew over time--in industry-\nfueled campaigns to obscure the dangers of cigarette smoke, of acid \nrain, of ozone depletion. Who knows. There are probably parts of it \nthat go back to the benefits of requiring seat belts and airbags in \ncars.\n  Looking back on the effects of these industry-funded campaigns of \ndenial, we see that real people were hurt. But the denial machinery \nstalled action and made the wrongdoers money. It worked. So now the \nclimate denial machine, the beast, is calling plays from the same \nplaybook and even using many of the same front organizations.\n  So who is behind this base? Unfortunately for the proponents of \ntransparency, a large portion of the funding is not traceable. Much of \nthe money fueling the beast is laundered through organizations which \nexist to conceal donor identity. Some of the organizations examined by \nDr. Brulle get over 90 percent of their money from hidden sources. \nIndeed, more than one-third of these organizations get over 90 percent \nof their money from hidden sources. The biggest identity laundering \nshop is Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund. Indeed, it is by far the \nbiggest source of funding in this web. These twin entities reported \ngiving a combined $78 million to climate denier groups between 2003 and \n2010, and they refused to identify their funders.\n  According to the Drexel report, the Donors Trust and Donors Capital \nfunding operation does double duty. It is the ``central component'' and \n``predominant funder'' of the denier apparatus, and at the same time it \nis the ``black box'' that conceals the identity of contributors.\n  Interestingly, anonymous funding through Donors Trust and Donors \nCapital fund has grown in tandem with disclosed funding from fossil \nfuel polluters declining, anonymous dollars up,\n\n[[Page S754]]\n\ndisclosed dollars down. As we see here, Donors Trust and Donors Capital \ndonations to the beast went from 3 percent of all foundation funding in \n2003 to more than 23 percent in 2010.\n  At the same time, for example, the Koch brothers' affiliated \nfoundations declined from 9 percent of all foundation funding in 2006 \ndown to 2 percent by 2010. The same is true for other polluter-backed \nfoundations. The ExxonMobil Foundations wound down its disclosed \nfunding of organizations in the climate denier network and basically \nzeroed out by 2007.\n  It makes perfect sense. Why would the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil \ncome under fire for obviously funding climate denial when Donors Trust \nand Donors Capital creates a mechanism for polluters to secretly fund \nthe base?\n  Plus, the phony-baloney front organizations within the beast can \npretend they are not funded by polluter money. Everybody wins in this \nidentity-laundering charade except the public, obviously, whom this \nelaborate construction is designed to fool.\n  The product of the denial apparatus is a complex ruse to delegitimize \nthe science that supports curbing carbon emissions, foisted on the \nAmerican people with all of the financing and fantasy of a Hollywood \nblockbuster production. Here is Dr. Brulle describing what you see when \nyou look behind the actors who appear in the media spotlight. I will \nquote.\n\n       The roots of climate-change denial go deeper . . . Just as \n     in a theatrical show, there are stars in the spotlight. In \n     the drama of climate change, these are often prominent \n     contrarian scientists or conservative politicians. . . . \n     However, they are only the most visible and transparent parts \n     of a larger production. Supporting this effort are directors, \n     script writers, and, most certainly, a series of producers, \n     in the form of conservative foundations.\n\n  Frankly, this apparatus is a disgrace. When the inevitable happens, \nand the impact of climate change really starts to hit home, people will \nwant to know--Americans will want to know, people around the world will \nwant to know why, why we did not take proper steps in time. It is not \nas if there is not enough scientific evidence for us to act. Why not? \nThis denial operation, the beast, will then go down as one of our great \nAmerican scandals, like Watergate or Teapot Dome, a deliberate, complex \nscheme of lies and propaganda that caused real harm to the American \npeople and to our country, all so that a small group of people could \nmake more money a little longer.\n  The fact that one of our great political parties is in on the scheme \nwill be to its lasting shame. There is an old hymn that says, ``Turn \nback O man, forswear thy foolish ways.'' It is time for our denier \ncolleagues to turn back and forswear their foolish ways. If they do \nnot, there will be a day of reckoning and a harsh price to pay.\n  Every day, more and more Americans realize the truth, and they \nincreasingly want this Congress to wake up. They know climate change is \nreal. As the President said in his State of the Union Address:\n\n       The debate is settled. Climate change is a fact.\n\n  Sir Winston Churchill once said this:\n\n       Owing to past neglect, in the face of the plainest \n     warnings, we have now entered upon a period of danger. . . . \n     The era of procrastination, of half-measures, soothing and \n     baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In \n     its place we are entering a period of consequences. . . . We \n     cannot avoid this period; we are in it now.\n\n  Well, we are now in a period of consequences. We have got to break \nthe back of the beast and break the barricade of blandishments and lies \nthat the beast has built around Congress. This campaign of denial, this \nbeast, is as poisonous to our democracy as carbon pollution is to our \natmosphere and oceans. With money and lobbyists and threats, it has \ninfiltrated itself in an unseemly influence in our government. For the \nsake of our democracy, for the sake of our future, for the sake of our \nhonor, it is time to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                      International Trade Policies\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I wish to take a few minutes to talk about our Nation's \ninternational trade policies. Specifically, I wish to discuss efforts \nto renew trade promotion authority, or what we call TPA. The most \nrecent authorization of TPA expired nearly 7 years ago. Since that \ntime, Republicans have, by and large, expressed support for renewing \nit.\n  In August 2010, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk testified that the \nObama administration needed TPA to conclude ongoing trade negotiations. \nHowever, after that time, little was done to move the ball forward on \nrenewing TPA. In September 2011, Minority Leader McConnell and I \noffered an amendment on the Senate floor to renew trade promotion \nauthority for President Obama.\n  Unfortunately, despite strong support from the Republican caucus, a \nnumber of Democratic Senators actively opposed our efforts, and it \nreceived virtually no Democratic support. As a result, our efforts \nfailed.\n  In March 2013, then-Acting USTR Marantis again expressed the \nadministration's support for renewing TPA and pledged to work with \nCongress to get it done.\n  In June 2013, United States Trade Representative Michael Froman, \nduring testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, formally \nrequested on behalf of President Obama that Congress renew TPA.\n  Throughout most of 2013, I worked with Chairman Baucus and Chairman \nCamp of House Ways and Means to craft a bipartisan bill to renew TPA, \none that could pass through both Houses and the Senate. We introduced \nour bill in January.\n  Last week, in his State of the Union Address, President Obama asked \nCongress to pass TPA legislation so his administration could complete \nnegotiations on two very ambitious and important trade agreements. \nWhile I thought President Obama could have spoken more forcefully on \nthis matter, his call for TPA renewal was clear and unambiguous. Yet so \nfar the call appears to be going unheeded--or should I say among \nDemocrats in the Senate.\n  Why is TPA so important, trade promotion authority? I think some \nadditional context is necessary.\n  The administration is currently in the midst of negotiations on the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, an Asia-Pacific trade agreement that \nis currently being negotiated between the United States and 12 other \ncountries, including some of the world's largest economies, such as \nJapan, Canada, and Mexico.\n  The Asia-Pacific region represents more than 40 percent of the \nworld's trade and, as a group, TPP countries represent the largest \ngoods and services export market for our country, the United States of \nAmerica.\n  On the other side of the world, the United States is negotiating a \nbilateral trade agreement with the 28 countries of the European Union. \nThis is called TTIP. The United States and the EU generate over half of \nthe world's economic output. Total goods trade alone, however, between \nthe United States and the EU amounts to over $1 trillion a year. \nInvestment flows represent another $300 billion a year on top of that.\n  Together, these two trade agreements have the potential to greatly \nexpand access for U.S. products in the foreign markets around the \nworld. Most importantly, they would help to grow our economy and create \njobs at home.\n  These two separate trade agreements and negotiations represent what \nis the most ambitious trade agenda in our Nation's history. While \neveryone knows that I am a pretty outspoken critic of the Obama \nadministration, I believe the administration deserves credit on this \nfront. But if these negotiations are going to succeed, Congress must \napprove TPA.\n  Because of the unique structure of our government, our country needs \nTPA. Our trading partners will not put their best deal on the table \nunless they know the United States can deliver on what it promised.\n  TPA empowers our trade negotiators to conclude agreements and \nprovides a path for passage in Congress. That is why every President \nsince FDR has sought trade promotion authority. No economically \nsignificant trade agreement has ever been negotiated by any \nadministration and approved by Congress without it.\n  Put simply, if Congress does not renew TPA, the TPP negotiations and \nthe TTIP negotiations with the European Union will almost certainly \nfail. That is why it is so disconcerting to me to see how some of my \ncolleagues across the aisle have responded to the\n\n[[Page S755]]\n\nPresident's call for TPA renewal. TPA is one of the few issues where \nboth parties can and should be able to work together to achieve a \ncommon goal.\n  I know that I, along with my Republican colleagues, stand ready and \nwilling to work with the administration to approve TPA as soon as \npossible. I think I have a reputation of working across the aisle and \nbringing people together. This is one I want to bring people together \non--and I shouldn't even have to argue about it, but I do.\n  I believe the bipartisan bill Chairman Baucus and I recently \nintroduced to renew TPA would receive strong bipartisan support in the \nSenate if it were allowed to come up for a vote. Indeed, I am confident \nthat the vast majority of my colleagues would join me in supporting the \nbill, both Democrats and Republicans.\n  The problem is Republicans are not in the majority in the Senate. It \nis the Democrats who control the agenda. Unfortunately, the President's \ncall to renew TPA does not appear to be a priority for some of the \nDemocrats, certainly the leadership of the Democrats.\n  The question is, Will Senate Democrats work with the President on \nthis issue? I don't know the answer to that question, but I have to say \nthat things don't look very good to me. Instead of robust support for \nthe President and his trade agenda, the response we have seen from some \nDemocrats has ranged from awkward silence on TPA to outright hostility. \nNeedless to say, I am extremely disappointed by this.\n  The issue is fairly simple. If we want to grow our economy through \ntrade, Congress must approve TPA and do so soon. The President can play \na unique and key role. By forcefully advocating for TPA renewal, he can \nhelp turn some of the skeptics in his party around.\n  Recently, the Financial Times published a powerful editorial which \noutlined the need for TPA and the role the President must play for TPA \nto succeed.\n  According to the editorial:\n\n       Twenty years ago, President Bill Clinton pulled out all the \n     stops to push through approval of the controversial North \n     American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. He was \n     able to squeak through a narrow victory by deft lobbying of \n     lawmakers and a willingness to make a strong case for \n     globalization to the American public. Mr. Obama is lagging \n     behind his predecessor on both counts. The case for TTIP and \n     TPP are both strong. The time for Mr. Obama to make these \n     arguments has arrived. He has every incentive to succeed. \n     Failure to secure [TPA] would be a grievous blow to his \n     presidency.\n\n  I understand there are some powerful critical forces that leave some \nof my friends on the other side of the aisle to oppose international \ntrade. However, let's be clear: If we fail to approve TPA, we will be \ndoing our Nation and our economy a great disservice. International \ntrade is good for our country. It is one of the few tools Congress has \nto grow our economy that does not add to the Federal deficit. As I \nmentioned, Senator Baucus and I, along with Chairman Camp, have \nnegotiated and introduced a bipartisan, bicameral TPA bill. It is, in \nmy opinion, the only TPA bill that stands a chance of getting passed in \nboth the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a choice. They can \neither work with the Republicans to pass our bill and empower our \ncountry to complete these important trade agreements, or they can throw \nup more roadblocks and cast more uncertainty on the President's trade \nagenda.\n  As I stated, Republicans stand ready to work with President Obama on \nthese issues and to help these trade negotiations to succeed. For the \nsake of our country and our economy, I sincerely hope my Democratic \ncolleagues and friends in the Senate are willing to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I come to the floor to discuss the \nrecent report by the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, which \ncontains updated estimates of the insurance coverage provisions of the \nAffordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare.\n  It was just on Sunday the President told Bill O'Reilly of Fox News--\nin front of all America on Super Bowl Sunday--that his health care bill \nis working. Today, the Congressional Budget Office has changed that \ntune. We learned from the report that ObamaCare will now cost us $2 \ntrillion. People may recall President Obama told the country his bill \nwould cost less than $1 trillion. We also learned that we are expected \nto lose--expected to lose--2.5 million full-time jobs over the next 10 \nyears. Finally, the CBO says exchange subsidies under the ACA will \nreduce incentives to work.\n  Let me go over that again. President Obama told the country his bill \nwould cost less than $1 trillion. Now the CBO says it will be $2 \ntrillion. We are expected to lose 2.5 million full-time jobs over next \n10 years. Finally, CBO says exchange subsidies under the ACA will \nreduce incentives to work.\n  If this is working, what does ``broken'' mean to this President?\n  As I am reading this report and accompanying reaction, the most \nrecent updates sound hauntingly familiar. In fact, I believe this is \nsomething that I and my colleagues spoke about every day during the \ndebate on health care reform. We questioned at that time whether the \nCBO estimates accurately reflected the impact of ObamaCare on the \nAmerican people, which leads to why I am on the floor as of this \nevening. This is about accountability, folks.\n  During the debate, we questioned whether the scoring done by the CBO \nwas fraught with gimmicks or an unrealistic belief that Medicare would \nachieve significant savings in the future.\n  I have serious concerns with the accuracy of the scoring done on \nObamaCare and its portrayal of the impact of this legislation versus \nthe stated benefits for the American people.\n  We cannot keep doing this. There are people's lives at stake, \npeople's lives that we are dealing with. The CBO projections during the \nhealth care reform debate seemed to significantly underestimate the \nnegative impact of ObamaCare. Because of those projections, supporters \nwere able to jam it through--one vote, everybody knows about that \nvote--and now the American people have to pick up the tab on the CBO's \nerrors.\n  I am calling for hearings in the Finance Committee, upon which I sit, \nto demand CBO come before the committee and explain to the Congress and \nthe American people why and how its scores, which led to the passage of \nObamaCare, did not tell the whole story. This is about accountability \nfor past actions, and we must ask the question, the difficult question, \nan unfortunate question: Was this political? Were the books cooked?\n  CBO needs to take the responsibility for the differences between \ntheir projections and the most recent updates just released as of this \nmorning. We must have accurate estimates on the costs and benefits of \nthe legislation so we can do our jobs. This shouldn't be about politics \nor gaming the system. This is about people's lives, and it is our \nresponsibility to get that right. Let the hearings begin. Let the CBO \nprovide answers. The CBO must answer this Congress and America.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DONNELLY.

Madam President, on December 22, 2004, the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly adopted a resolution declaring the beginning of a \nsecond International Decade of the World's Indigenous People. As we \nenter the final year of this international campaign we should remind \nourselves of the importance of protecting indigenous populations and \ntake stock of what has\n\n[[Page S756]]\n\nbeen achieved and what more needs to be done.\n  I have always believed that as we advance and defend our national \ninterests around the globe we must also fulfill our moral obligations. \nAs chairman or ranking member of the subcommittee that funds the \nDepartment of State and foreign operations for over two decades, I have \nhad a unique vantage point from which to watch globalization evolve and \ntest our Nation's commitment to its ideals. As the world's population \nswells, technology advances, and competition for energy and natural \nresources intensifies, the rights and needs of indigenous populations \nare threatened by governments and corporations seeking to exploit the \nground on which they have built their lives and preserved their \ncultures and the wealth beneath it.\n  This has been the reality for too many indigenous cultures, and it is \nno surprise that they are among the most vulnerable and disenfranchised \npopulations on Earth. These groups have distinct ways of life and \nhistories, tied to land they have inhabited and protected for thousands \nof years. But their established roots rarely afford them representation \nin governments that hide behind laws and regulations proclaiming equal \ntreatment for indigenous populations who have virtually no role in the \npolitical process.\n  Recognizing that indigenous peoples have unique rights and needs that \nthe rest of humanity has a responsibility to protect, several years ago \nI undertook to create the position of advisor for indigenous peoples' \nissues at the U.S. Agency for International Development. I am pleased \nthat USAID recently established this office to implement and coordinate \na comprehensive, U.S. Government strategy on indigenous peoples, with \nspecific goals, guidelines, benchmarks, and impact assessments, \nincluding support for indigenous peoples' organizations.\n  The selection of Brian Keane to fill this role is an early indicator \nthat it will be addressed proactively. Brian, who has devoted his \nprofessional life to these issues, will work to ensure that U.S. \nGovernment policies and programs around the world are carried out in a \nmanner that respects the rights of indigenous peoples and responds to \ntheir needs. Brian's work in indigenous communities all across the \nglobe, and his advocacy on behalf of indigenous peoples to inform \ninternational policy making, has prepared him for his task.\n  This position must not be merely a symbolic post. From the Amazon \nrainforest to the Kalahari Desert, indigenous peoples have for \ncenturies faced existential threats due to racism, greed, misguided \npolicies of forced assimilation, and indifference. However, for the \nsurviving groups, the length of their struggle belies the acuteness of \nthe threat. In Brazil, the Guarani people have been driven from their \nland and are plagued by alcoholism, poverty, and a suicide rate many \ntimes the national average, replaced by expanding sugarcane farms.\n  Anthropologists explain that the loss of land by indigenous groups \noften leads to social disintegration and economic dependence on the \nstate, as we know only too well from our own experience. We see it in \nplaces like Botswana, where the San people, traditionally nomads, have \nbeen uprooted from their ancestral lands to make way for diamond mines, \nforced into settlements, and exposed to HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. \nTheir way of life, which the Botswana Government should be protecting, \ninstead is being destroyed.\n  The circumstances of each indigenous culture, whose members total as \nmany as 400 million people worldwide, differs from continent to \ncontinent but they face similar threats. To defend their rights, \nprotect their land, and preserve their cohesiveness, a key policy \nchange is needed. We must commit to honoring the principle of free, \nprior, and informed consent.\n  For too long, governments, often including our own, have paid lip \nservice to consulting native populations as a substitute for obtaining \ntheir consent for actions that directly affect them. More often than \nnot, such consultations have been cursory or conducted in a manner that \ndivides members of indigenous communities against each other. I am \npleased that in 2010 President Obama formally declared our Nation's \nsupport for the U.N. Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, \nreversing the position that the United States had held since the \ndeclaration's adoption in 2007.\n  While that was a positive step, combatting discrimination against \nindigenous peoples requires more than policy statements, it requires \naction. That is why I want to highlight the ongoing threat to these \npopulations and call attention to the new position of advisor for \nindigenous peoples' issues.\n  In today's globalized world, ensuring the rights of indigenous \npeoples is everyone's responsibility. Respect for their rights is not \nonly necessary for their continued survival as distinct cultures but \nalso to help ensure the well-being of the entire planet. Whether we are \ntalking about biodiversity protection, climate change or sustainable \ndevelopment, indigenous peoples have much to offer. Their ancestral \nknowledge, developed over millennia, has been vital to preserving what \nis left of the world's critical ecosystems and can play a key role in \nfinding solutions to challenges that humanity is currently facing.\n  I look forward to the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, a high-\nlevel plenary meeting of the General Assembly that will take place at \nthe United Nations in September of this year. Its main objective is to \nshare perspectives and best practices on the realization of the rights \nof indigenous peoples and to pursue the objectives of the U.N. \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The World Conference \nprovides an important chance to give real meaning to the principles \nexpressed in the declaration and is a historic opportunity for the \nUnited States to lead the international community by putting forward a \nconcrete plan of action aimed at ensuring that the collective rights of \nindigenous peoples, including the right to free, prior and informed \nconsent, are recognized and respected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/04/senate-section/article/S756-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S756-S757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I wish to speak about the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. I am joined on the floor \ntoday by my friend Senator Baucus, the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, to stress the program's importance.\n  Today CHIP provides health coverage to over 37,000 children in West \nVirginia and over 8 million children across the United States in \nworking families who cannot afford private health insurance. These kids \ndeserve a healthy start in life. They are our future leaders and \ndecisionmakers. They deserve the opportunities this program provides.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank Senator Rockefeller for speaking today on this \nimportant issue. I have always admired the Senator's hard work and \ndedication to provide health coverage not just to the children of West \nVirginia but children across the United States. He has been a real \ninspiration to me and many of our colleagues.\n  Back in 2007 and 2009, Senator Rockefeller and I worked together with \nfellow Democrats and Republicans to reauthorize CHIP. The legislation \nbrought legislators together from both sides of the aisle because CHIP \nwas not about politics, it was about helping kids. Even 10 years prior \nto that, the original legislation that created the Children's Health \nInsurance Program passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. CHIP has \nalways been very popular. Bottom line is this program works. It works \nfor children and it works for America.\n  Unfortunately, while this program has been authorized through the \nyear 2019, the funding expires next year. I believe it is critical for \nthe Senate to continue to fund CHIP beyond 2015 in order to continue to \nprovide essential health coverage to our lower income children and \npregnant women. I regret I will not be here to carry on the work of \nhelping these families.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I agree with Senator Baucus. Without the funds to \nrun this program, millions of children will lose health care coverage. \nBefore CHIP was established in 1997, 23 percent of low-income children \nwere uninsured. Today, according to the Urban Institute, that number \nhas dropped to 12.8 percent. I believe that number should be zero; no \nchild should be without access to the coverage they need to grow up \nhealthy and happy. Thanks to this program and other sources of \ncoverage, we are on our way to achieving\n\n[[Page S757]]\n\nfull coverage: more than 9 out of 10 American children now are insured.\n  Studies have shown that children enrolled in CHIP have demonstrated \nimprovements in their ability to pay attention in class, school \nattendance, reading scores, and participation in school and childhood \nactivities.\n  Our efforts are working but we must do more. We must continue to work \nto enroll kids who are eligible but not yet covered. We must ensure \nthat funding for this essential lifeline for families does not expire. \nI, too, regret I will no longer be in the Senate in 2015 to continue \nthis work. That is why I hope that we can solve the problem this year, \nand I am very glad my good friend, the senior Senator from Montana, and \nI could come to the floor today to deliver this important message.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/04/senate-section/article/S757-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Madam President, today I wish to recognize the Pittsburgh \nOpera on their 75th anniversary. Since its founding by five dedicated \nwomen in 1939, the Pittsburgh Opera has consistently worked to foster \nnew generations of artists and fans by making opera accessible to a \ndiverse audience. The stated mission of the Pittsburgh Opera is ``to \nculturally enrich Pittsburgh and the tri-state area, and to draw \nnational and international attention to the region''. Roughly 31,000 \npeople attend one of their five opera productions each year.\n  Over time, the Pittsburgh Opera established its own orchestra, has \nbecome a leader in the use of supertitles, and forming the Resident \nArtists Program to train young artists and increase awareness of opera, \ndeveloping community programming throughout southwestern Pennsylvania. \nIn so doing, the company has served not only Pittsburgh and the \ntristate area, but has become a respected national organization, \nattracting such luminaries as Luciano Pavarotti, Beverly Sills and Joan \nSutherland.\n  The Pittsburgh Opera has also been an invaluable steward for the \nfuture of opera and Pittsburgh's arts culture through its focus on \nenvironmental sustainability and fiscal management. In 2008, the \ncompany moved to new headquarters in the historic George Westinghouse \nAir Brake Factory, a cultural landmark that became the oldest LEED-\ncertified building in Pittsburgh in 2011, making the Pittsburgh Opera \nthe first opera company in the United States to receive LEED \ncertification in the operations and maintenance category.\n\n[[Page S758]]\n\n  Similarly, in 1997, general director Mark Weinstein sought, through \nfinancial management and long-range strategic planning, to ensure a \nsound future for the Pittsburgh Opera, increasing the company's assets \nand establishing a gold standard for financial management in the \nindustry. This planning, as well as the establishment of the Artistic \nExcellence Project to raise funds for engaging elite singers and \ndirectors, has ensured that the Pittsburgh Opera will continue to serve \nas a cultural centerpiece of Pittsburgh and a respected leader in the \ngreater opera community.\n  Again, I want to congratulate the Pittsburgh Opera on the impressive \nachievement of their 75th anniversary. I wish them the best and look \nforward to their continued enrichment of the arts community both in \nPittsburgh and nationwide.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, today I wish to recognize the Pittsburgh \nOpera, the seventh oldest opera company in the United States. The \nPittsburgh Opera is currently engaged in its 75th season, and I would \nlike to congratulate them on this momentous anniversary. The company \nstarted in 1939 when five ambitious women were determined to bring \nopera to their community. Within a year, these women had assembled \nmusicians, singers, sets, costumes, and lighting, and produced the \nopera company's first performance, Offenbach's ``The Tales of Hoffman'' \nat Carnegie Music Hall. Before long, the Pittsburgh Opera Society, \nunder the leadership of general director Dr. Richard Karp, had become a \nfully professional organization.\n  The Pittsburgh Opera is not only recognized as an asset to \nsouthwestern Pennsylvania, but it is known throughout the international \nopera community for the fine skill and artistry of its productions. It \nhas welcomed numerous celebrity vocalists over the years, and the \ncompany's notoriety only continues to grow and attract more talent. I \nbelieve that the Pittsburgh Opera has been undeniably successful in \nfulfilling its stated mission ``to culturally enrich Pittsburgh and the \ntri-state area, and to draw national and international attention to the \nregion,'' and I think that the 31,000 Pittsburghers and visitors who \nattend the opera's productions annually would agree.\n  The Pittsburgh Opera is also dedicated to fostering the development \nof future opera talent. The company has established and nurtured a \nresident artist program that ranks among the top five in the country \nand has the distinction of being the only program in the United States \nthat trains singers as well as stage directors. These artists present \ntwo fully staged productions of their own and also develop a variety of \ngeneral music programs to perform at public schools, community centers, \nand libraries.\n  Six years ago, after nearly 70 years without its own center, the \nPittsburgh Opera acquired and renovated the original home of the George \nA.

Madam President, today I wish to join grand master \nGerald E. Piepiora and the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted \nMasons of Maryland in welcoming the 2014 Conference of Grand Masters of \nMasons in North America, which will be convening in Baltimore from \nSunday, February 15, to Tuesday, February 18. This annual meeting is \nthe largest gathering of grand masters in the world and the first time \nthey have come to Baltimore. This delegation of grand masters \nrepresents 2 million Freemasons from all 50 States; Washington, DC; \nPuerto Rico; the Provinces of Canada; and the United Mexican States. In \naddition, a delegation of grand masters representing Freemasons from \naround the world also will be attending the conference.\n  Throughout their history, Freemasons--the oldest and largest \nfraternity in the world--have dedicated their lives to cultivating good \nmoral character both within themselves and in their communities. The \nMasonic fraternity is dedicated to caring for those less fortunate and \nto giving back to the community, contributing well over three quarters \nof a billion dollars annually to philanthropic causes in North America \nalone.\n  Maryland Masons have carried on this tradition since 1787 by serving \ntheir communities with local scholarship programs, student assistance, \nvolunteerism, educational support, and other charitable activities. \nMaryland Masons make important contributions to the quality of life of \nMarylanders at every stage of life, including the Maryland Child \nIdentification Program that provides free identification and protection \nagainst the problem of missing children; free childhood language \ndisorder clinics; transportation to regional Shriners Hospitals for \nchildren with orthopedic conditions, burns, spinal cord injuries, and \ncleft lip and palate; and retirement housing and continuing care for \nMasons and their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in welcoming this distinguished group \nof international guests to Maryland and in wishing the masons of \nMaryland continued success in their pursuit of fraternity, brotherly \nlove, relief, and truth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/04/senate-section/article/S758-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING WALTER J. ``JIMMIE'' FEW\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we often note in our record the \npassing of government and business leaders of renown, and that is \nappropriate. But it is also fitting to pause to reflect on some of \nthose millions of American citizens who reflect in their lives the \nhighest and best ideals of their faith and of America.\n  Jimmie Few of Mobile, AL, was one such person. I first got to know \nhim when, in 1991, we took part in a mission to Russia as part of a \nUnited Methodist Church delegation. This was shortly after the fall of \ncommunism. We spent over a week in the small city of Vyksa, 5 hours \neast of Moscow. We roomed together in the home of a Russian family. \nThis was the first chance the people of Vyksa had to actually meet and \nget to know Americans. Frequently, one of the Russians would, with \nsurprise, say, ``You look just like us!''\n  Jimmie was a very large man and naturally took charge. When an \nagreement was concluded, Jimmie would seal it with a firm--very firm--\nhandshake. He loved the Russians. Indeed, after this he made some 19 \nmore trips, assisting with orphanages, schools, and Bible schools as \nwell as advising Russians on economic matters. Jimmie was a very \nexperienced small businessman. He bought an orphanage a needed van on \none occasion and fixed a road to the orphanage in another.\n  This kind of humanitarian, religious mission is not unusual for \nAmericans. Thousands of such trips are occurring now involving hundreds \nof thousands of Americans who make trips to meet with millions around \nthe globe. They don't focus on the rich and powerful; they focus on \nthose in need, the poor and the children. No nation in the history of \nthe world has ever matched such selfless giving. It reflects well on \nthe United States, surely creating greater understanding among peoples, \nand it is in harmony, certainly, with the spirit of Jesus, which has \ninspired so many.\n  While Jimmy's business success and health suffered in recent years, \nhis good life of service to his Lord and to others exemplifies the best \nin humanity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/04/senate-section/article/S758-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S758-S759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING COLONEL WILLIAM EDWARD CALLENDER, SR.\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today, I would like to pay \ntribute to COL William Edward ``Bill'' Callender, Sr., U.S. Army, \nRetired. Bill was a friend, a national hero proven in combat, a man who \nloved his family, and a man who committed himself to service to others. \nTo an exceptional degree, he loved his country and most especially, he \nloved and honored those who served her in uniform.\n\n[[Page S759]]\n\n  The scripture says, in describing faith as more than intellectual \nassent, but action, that when Abraham was called, he ``went.'' When \nBill's Nation called him, he went--even into great danger. And, to a \nmost unusual degree, throughout the remainder of his life, he continued \nto hear that call and he went--in service to others in a host of ways \nand especially to veterans.\n  I believe Bill Callender was one of Alabama's most valuable citizens. \nVivian Cannon, of the Mobile Press Register, wrote at the time of his \nreceipt of the Distinguished Flying Cross, given for his actions on \nthat harrowing day in Vietnam when he flew his chopper into a very hot \nlanding gone to insert and later that day to extract American soldiers \nwho were under heavy fire--a very fine piece on these events. Her \narticle quotes a letter he wrote to his wife shortly after the events \nthat included this line: ``By the grace of God, we came out OK.'' Such \ncourageous actions cannot be bought with money. They arise from the \ncharacter of the hero, from love of country and from loyalty to \ncomrades.\n  It is part of the American sense of duty. Former Secretary of Defense \nBob Gates talks about it in his new book, ``Duty.'' When the President \nand we in Congress send our magnificent soldiers into harm's way to \nachieve a military objective deemed important, there is also a duty \nowed them and their dependents of the highest order. It is a bond that \nmust never be broken.\n  Perhaps Bill never forgot that experience in Vietnam and others like \nit that were up close and personal to him. There were those badly \nwounded he flew out for life saving care, those killed in action, and \nthose young, anxious faces he looked into when he flew them into areas \nof great danger where lives would be lost and where, by the grace of \nGod, Bill had been spared.\n  Thereafter, he began a lifetime of service to them and America. And \nserve he did--with joy and enthusiasm, wisdom and judgment, and \nresponsibility.\n  By nature, he was supportive and affirming. He was just a ``good \nguy'' and ``humble,'' says Wallace Davis of Volunteers of America. I \nadmired him greatly. He was a leader in the best sense of the word. He \ngave good advice and insight. I valued his judgment. He led by example.\n  When my senior military advisor, COL Pete Landrum, came to the Mobile \narea, we asked Bill to arrange meetings for veterans and sought his \ninput on key issues. He was the go-to guy. In fact, few, if any, \nveterans activities in the area happened without his leadership and \ncontribution.\n  Serving on the important Battleship Commission, his tireless advocacy \nfor the new Veterans Cemetery, working with the Veterans Administration \nand Congress and others, and his vigorous support for the Honor Flight \nProgram just reflect some of his work. He truly gave himself for many \ngood causes.\n  Bill leaves behind his wonderful wife, Jacqueline Bachar Callender; \nhis 3 daughters, Ginger (Jay) Hawkins, Cyndi Callender and Tammy (Jeff) \nHadley; 12 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren, and many great \nfriends who are feeling his loss but can take comfort in the knowledge \nthat we have had the privilege of being in the presence of a remarkable \nman who lived a wonderful life, consistent with the great heritage of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/04/senate-section/article/S759-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \n   IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13396 ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006, WITH RESPECT TO THE \n          SITUATION IN OR IN RELATION TO COTE D'IVOIRE--PM 29\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency, unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nenter into enhanced-use leases for certain buildings of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs at the West Los Angeles Medical Center, California, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that \nwould provide critical authority to the Department of Veterans Affairs \nto use enhanced-use leases to engage in public-private partnerships in \norder to provide supportive housing for homeless veterans at the West \nLos Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Campus in California.\n  Homelessness is a tragedy, and I am deeply concerned that it plagues \nmany of our Nation's brave and honorable veterans. I would like to make \nyou aware, that Los Angeles has the largest concentration of homeless \nveterans in the United States, currently estimated to be 6,300. What is \neven more unacceptable is that two buildings on the West Los Angeles \nVeterans Affairs Campus that can potentially provide supportive housing \nfor a portion of these veterans are currently vacant due to a lack of \nFederal funding.\n  There is good news, though. The community of Los Angeles has \nexpressed great interest in leveraging private resources and forging a \npartnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs to make progress in \nusing these facilities to provide housing and hope for homeless \nveterans in the area. However, giving this authority to the Secretary \nof Veteran Affairs requires legislative action, and so I am happy to \npresent to you today the solution that is required.\n  You should be aware that the solution I am proposing is a finely \ncrafted fix to a previous action Congress took in 2007 to safeguard the \nWest Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Campus. I moved in 2007 to prohibit \nthe ability of the Department of Veterans Affairs to lease or sale any \nproperty on the West Los Angeles Campus, due to concerns that these \nauthorities would likely be abused at the detriment to Los Angeles' \nveterans. Specifically, broad authorities were being used for \ncommercial development displacing prop on the West Los Angeles Veteran \nAffairs Department, and risked reducing or eliminating the important \nservices this campus provides to veterans. Today is a new day, and my \nbill will allow a very tightly limited authority to enter into \nenhanced-use leases at two specific vacant buildings on the campus to \nbe used for the sole purpose of providing supportive housing for \nveterans who are homeless.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this modification of \nlease authority in order to make real progress using private dollars to \ndeliver on our promise to California's veterans who have bravely served \nin the defense of the entire United States. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on enacting this authority as soon as feasible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/04/senate-section/article/S765-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S765-S767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 343--ESTABLISHING A SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE TO \nMAKE A FULL AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES \n OF APPARENTLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NATIONAL SECURITY \n AGENCY INTELLIGENCE-COLLECTION PROGRAMS, OPERATIONS, AND ACTIVITIES, \nINCLUDING PROGRAMS AFFECTING AMERICANS, TO MAKE FINDINGS BASED UPON THE \n INVESTIGATION, AND TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION \n                              AND FINDINGS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n       Whereas since June 2013, publications have revealed details \n     about certain National Security Agency intelligence-\n     collection programs, operations, and activities, including \n     intelligence-collection programs affecting Americans;\n       Whereas such publications appear to be based in substantial \n     part on unauthorized disclosures of classified information \n     concerning intelligence collection;\n       Whereas the unauthorized disclosure of classified \n     information is a felony under Federal law;\n       Whereas the National Security Agency relies on Federal \n     agency contractors to carry out important aspects of its \n     national security mission;\n       Whereas the extent of reliance on contract positions may \n     unwisely increase the number of individuals with potential \n     access to classified information and may increase the risk of \n     unauthorized disclosures;\n       Whereas such unauthorized disclosures may cause damage to \n     United States national security interests, intelligence \n     sources and methods, and relationships with key allies;\n       Whereas senior officials in the intelligence community may \n     have misled Congress or otherwise obfuscated the nature, \n     extent, or use of certain intelligence-collection programs, \n     operations, and activities of the National Security Agency, \n     including intelligence-collection programs affecting \n     Americans;\n       Whereas the provision of incomplete or inaccurate \n     information by officials of the intelligence community has \n     inhibited effective congressional oversight of certain \n     intelligence-collection programs, operations, and activities \n     of the National Security Agency, including intelligence-\n     collection programs affecting Americans, and undermined \n     congressional and public support of these programs;\n       Whereas intelligence-collection programs, operations, and \n     activities of the National Security Agency have been valuable \n     to combating terrorism and ensuring the security of the \n     homeland;\n       Whereas some such programs, operations, and activities that \n     are the subject matter of the unauthorized disclosures may \n     not have been authorized, or may have exceeded that which was \n     authorized, by law, or may not have been permitted under the \n     Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas a Review Group on Intelligence and Communications \n     Technologies was established by the President and issued a \n     final report entitled ``Liberty and Security in a Changing \n     World'' on December 12, 2013: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, since June of 2013, there have been steady \nand persistent unauthorized disclosures of apparently classified \ninformation regarding the activities and practices of the National \nSecurity Agency, NSA. These disclosures have caused grave damage to the \nUnited States. They have harmed our relations with friends and allies \nand harmed our ability to combat threats to the United States. They \nhave also undermined public support for U.S. intelligence programs by \ncasting doubt on the candor of key officials, the permissibility of the \nNSA's activities, the efficacy of the government's oversight, and \nwhether legitimate privacy interests are properly taken into account in \nconnection with important surveillance activities.\n  Last month, the President proposed some changes to how our Nation \nconducts certain intelligence collection activities. But the \nPresident's proposals left many crucial questions unanswered. Now is \nthe time for Congress to improve how it executes its constitutional \noversight duties--to examine certain intelligence collection activities \nand practices and ensure that we are fulfilling our obligation to \nprotect both the security of our Nation and the freedom of our \ncitizens.\n  The vital issues at stake here are complex, broad, and cut across \nmany areas of jurisdiction of established congressional committees, \nincluding national security, intelligence, technology, commerce, \nforeign affairs, and privacy. For these reasons, today I am introducing \nlegislation calling for the establishment of a Senate Select Committee \nto investigate how these leaks occurred and to make findings and \nrecommendations for legislation to address these issues which are vital \nto American national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/04/senate-section/article/S767-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S767-S768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 344--CONGRATULATING THE PENN STATE UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S \n   VOLLEYBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2013 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC \n              ASSOCIATION WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY (for himself and Mr. Casey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
