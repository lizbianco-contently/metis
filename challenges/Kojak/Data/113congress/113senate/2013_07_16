I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator withhold that request?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are going to move forward to the \nCordray nomination, which has been held up for some period of time. I \nwould like to thank everybody on both sides of the aisle who was \nengaged in this debate and discussion. I would particularly like to \nthank all of my colleagues who engaged in a long but productive \ndiscussion last night--which is our custom--of the many issues that \nseparate us, particularly some pending, what many of us believe to be a \ncrisis in the history of the Senate.\n  I wish to thank both our leaders, Senator McConnell and Senator Reid, \nand so many others who have been actively engaged in conversations that \nhave been going on. I look forward to a vote as soon as possible on Mr. \nCordray.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for believing what I thought was very \nimportant in our relations with the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we may have a way forward on this. I feel \nvery confident, as you know. That is why we need the time. So what we \nare going to do is go into a quorum. I think everyone would be well \nadvised, if they wish, to talk about substantive matters, if you wish \nto speak to Senator Markey. But we have a few i's to dot and t's to \ncross, I have to speak to the Vice President, and we are going to have \na phone call to make with Senators Schumer and Murray. So everything is \ngoing well.\n  I will say I hope everyone learned a lesson last night, that it sure \nhelps to sit down, stand, whatever it is, and talk to each other. It \nwas a very good meeting that lasted 4 hours. People were still as \nhighly engaged at the end of that 4 hours as they were in the \nbeginning.\n  I think we see a way forward that will be good for everybody. There \nare a lot of accolades to go around to a lot of people. I certainly \nappreciate my wonderful caucus.\n  One of my Senators, who has a lot of humility, told me this morning: \nIt doesn't matter what you ask me to do, I will do it.\n  I would hope this is not a time to flex muscles, but it is a time I \nam going to tell one person and no one else how much I appreciate their \nadvocacy, their persuasiveness, persistence, and--a word that truly \ndescribes this man is hard to find.\n  I was told by another Senator: You know what this man did? I said: \nYou know who he reminds me of? Bob Kerrey. I hope that doesn't \ndisparage John McCain. But John McCain is the reason we are at the \npoint we are. A lot of people have been extremely helpful. This is all \ndirected toward John McCain from me. No one was able to break through \nbut for him. He does it at his own peril.\n  Everyone, we are going to have a caucus today. We will explain in \nmore detail the direction we are headed. I think everyone will be \nhappy. Everyone will not think we got everything we wanted, but I think \nit is going to be something that is good for the Senate. It is a \ncompromise. I think we get what we want; they get what they want--not a \nbad deal.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to speak today on the nomination of \nRichard Cordray to be the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau. I want to speak against this confirmation.\n  Why is this nomination important? Once the Director is approved by \nCongress, by the Senate--not all the Congress, just by the Senate--we \nwill no longer have any control over a bureau that collects everyone's \nfinancial records in detail and can cancel a loan up to 180 days even \nif both parties to the loan are happy.\n  Mr. Cordray was recess-appointed. I think it was because the \nPresident thought he would not be approved by Congress.\n  What I am about to tell you already is under the direction of this \nnominee. That recess appointment put him in charge of the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. It sounds like a good title, but the \nreason this is of utmost concern to me and has been for the past 3 \nyears is the lack of congressional oversight and blatant privacy \nintrusions of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the CFPB.\n  The Dodd-Frank Act, which created the CFPB, has been a hot topic of \nconversation since its passage in 2010. There are a lot of important \ndiscussions about different parts of the bill and some of the \nconsequences we are seeing now, 3 years down the road. These are all \nimportant conversations to have, but today I am focusing on the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  The Bureau, as allowed by the Dodd-Frank Act, could direct up to $600 \nmillion every year, but it is not subject to the congressional \nappropriations process--the same congressional appropriations process \nthat approves the budgets of the other agencies, such as the Securities \nand Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Instead, the \nagency is funded from revenues from the Federal Reserve--the Federal \nReserve--before the revenues come to the Treasury, funds that are \nsupposed to be remitted to the Treasury for deficit reduction.\n  Some might ask: Isn't there a cap to the funding available to the \nCFPB? Yes, there is, but here is what it looks like. The cap was 10 \npercent of the Federal revenues for fiscal year 2010, 11 percent for \nfiscal year 2012, and it will be 12 percent for fiscal year 2013, with \nan inflation factor each and every year after that. This means 12 \npercent of the combined earnings of the Federal Reserve System, which \nwas $4.98 billion in 2009. At that time, 10 percent would have been \n$500 million. These numbers are astonishing, and anyone saying that the \nBureau is not funded by taxpayers is trying to pull a sleight-of-hand. \nThe funds may not come directly from the Treasury, but taxpayers are \ngoing to have to take up the slack for funds they are no longer \nreceiving from the Federal Reserve. I am not sure how we do that \nconstitutionally, to move somebody outside and still take Federal \nmoney.\n  In addition, the Director of the Bureau has unlimited discretion over \nhow the agency's money--these hundreds of millions of dollars I just \ntalked about--is spent. Let me repeat that. The Director of the Bureau \nhas unlimited discretion over how the agency's money is spent. He \ndoesn't submit a budget. Nothing is approved.\n  Not only that, the Director is allowed to put fines and penalties \ncollected by the Bureau into a slush fund that it does not have to \nreturn to the Treasury the way other agencies have to do. Do you think \nthat might encourage a lot of fines and penalties by this Bureau? I \nthink it would. I don't think it ought to be done that way.\n\n[[Page S5693]]\n\n  The same Director who has so much unchecked authority doesn't even \nanswer to the Office of Management and Budget and only has to submit \nroutine financial information to the Office.\n  There is also no inspector general for this Bureau. Here is one \nexample of why that is a problem. The Dodd-Frank Act expressly exempted \nauto dealers from the oversight purview of the Bureau. They listened to \nme when this bill was passing and found out that loans could be \ncanceled within 180 days by the Bureau without the approval of the \nautomobile dealer or the person who bought the automobile.\n\n  However, the Bureau doesn't think auto dealers should be exempt from \noversight, so it found ways to exert itself through the banks. Banks \nare now looking at auto loans made, and the Bureau has issued its first \nsignificant penalty in connection with the vehicle financing.\n  The Bureau has also issued what it calls a fair lending guidance \nbulletin directed at institutions that make indirect automobile loans. \nIn it the Bureau says indirect lenders will be viewed as participants \nin any discriminatory pricing by dealers due to their role in the auto \nloan credit decision process and suggests lenders impose controls on \ndealer markup and compensation policies. Is this revenge for them \ngetting an exemption in the bill?\n  The Bureau's interpretation of Dodd-Frank and this guidance will have \nwide ramifications for indirect lenders and ultimately auto dealers. \nBecause the bulletin issued is considered guidance and not a rule, \nthere has been no opportunity for the public--including consumers, \nlenders, and dealers--to comment on this policy interpretation that \nwill affect an industry that was exempted from the Bureau oversight.\n  The lack of accountability and congressional oversight over the \nBureau's budget and Director are troubling, to say the least, but the \npicture becomes even more concerning when the lens is shifted to what \nkinds of oversight power are afforded to and being practiced by this \nBureau--this Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It sounds like it is \nfor everybody.\n  Here is what I said when expressing my concern about this Bureau and \nthe Dodd-Frank Act on May 20, 2010:\n\n       This bill was supposed to be about regulating Wall Street; \n     instead it's creating a Google Earth on every financial \n     transaction. That's right--the government will be able to see \n     every detail of your finances.\n\n  Your permission is not needed.\n\n       They can look at your transactions from the 50,000 foot \n     perspective or they can look right down to the tiny details \n     of the time and place where you pulled cash out of an ATM or \n     charged to your credit card.\n\n  Unfortunately, we are now finding this fear has become a reality. A \nrecent Bloomberg article states that the Bureau is demanding records \nfrom banks and buying information from companies on at least 10 million \nAmerican consumers for ``use in a wide range of policy research \nprojects.'' This information gathering from banks includes credit card \nand checking account overdraft information as well as requirements to \nprovide records on credit cards and on products such as credit \nmonitoring.\n  In addition to the bank records it is collecting, the Bureau is \ncollecting data on payday loans from debt collection agencies and \nbuilding a mortgage database of loan and property records with \ninformation from agencies and other financial and property information \nholders.\n  The CFPD also says they are not including any personally identifiable \ninformation such as names and Social Security numbers while compiling \nall of this information. I made that statement at one of our listening \nsessions in Wyoming, and somebody from the audience yelled: No, they \njust check with the NSA.\n  What they are doing is taking all of that consumer data and layering \nit into consumer profiles to show a complete snapshot of each \nconsumer's finances. For example, they can say: There is a consumer at \na specified zip code who has $1,500 in the bank, $6,000 in credit card \ndebt, $10,000 in student loan debt, and a $200,000 mortgage.\n  To the American people who are listening to me speak right now, what \nhappens if you are one of the 10 million customers whose data is being \ncollected? Does this make you angry and uncomfortable? What happens if \nyou don't want all of your financial information compiled and used by \nthe Bureau for policy research projects?\n  I am sure you would like to hear me tell you that you can call or \nwrite the Bureau and say you don't want the Bureau collecting your \nfinancial records from your bank, your student loan from a third party \nprovider, your mortgage data, or your ATM data. I am sorry. You can't. \nYou can't tell them to stay out of your records. It is not possible. If \nyour data is being collected, you do not have the option to opt out nor \ndoes the CFPB need any kind of permission from you to gather your \npersonal financial information.\n  This is another issue I tried to work on when the Dodd-Frank Act \npassed. I had an amendment that would simply require a privacy release, \na signature from the consumer before the Bureau could collect the \nconsumer's financial data. Unfortunately, my amendment was not accepted \nand we find ourselves in the situation we are in today: Americans \ncannot tell the government they don't want their personal financial \ninformation collected and stored.\n  What I would like to know is how this information is reining in Wall \nStreet. The Dodd-Frank Act was sold to the public as a way to rein in \nWall Street. As far as I can tell, it has turned out to be the perfect \nexcuse for Big Brother to worm his way even further into our lives and \nour privacy.\n  Actually, Big Brother doesn't have to worm his way in. Dodd-Frank \nopened the door and invited him in, and that is what this lack of \noversight is signaling. Go ahead and collect millions of consumers' \ninformation. Don't tell us what you are using it for, and don't feel \nthe need to tell us much of anything else because this Director and \nthis Bureau will not be accountable to Congress.\n  Meanwhile, the message we are getting from the Bureau, and some of my \ncolleagues, is that Congress needs to sit back and butt out of the \nBureau's business. We are hearing the message that asking for \ncongressional oversight is akin to wanting consumers to be deceived and \ndiscriminated against.\n  Let's get one thing straight. None of my colleagues disagree that \nprotecting consumers is important. We all want consumers to get a fair \nshake and be able to make informed financial decisions. I never \nenvisioned the Federal Government making your financial decisions. I \nhave championed financial literacy for much of my time in Washington \nand believe strongly in the value of individuals having the tools they \nneed to make sound financial decisions for themselves and their \nfamilies. I repeat: I never envisioned the Federal Government making \nyour financial decisions, but that is not the issue. The issue is the \nneed for checks and balances and for consumers to be able to make a \nchoice as to whether their financial information is collected and used.\n  I cannot in good conscience, with these concerns weighing so heavily \non my mind, support moving forward with the confirmation of a Director \nto the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--the one already in charge \nof collecting your financial records--while doing a daily speech about \nhis good work.\n  Wait until his confirmation. We will see more intrusion into our \npersonal lives. Until it has changed so this man does not have this \nmuch power--power beyond anybody else in the Federal Government--there \nneeds to be some changes that will balance consumers' protections with \nprivacy protections and allow for a healthy and appropriate level of \ncongressional oversight over an agency that wields this tremendous \npower and has its own source of revenue and no oversight. Not even an \ninspector general has this kind of power. Until that happens, I have to \noppose this nomination. I hope my colleagues will join me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from New Mexico\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, this is a historic day in the \nSenate. These are qualified nominees. They have been delayed long \nenough. But we are also considering a larger\n\n[[Page S5694]]\n\nquestion; What kind of Senate do we want? What kind of Senate best \nserves the American people?\n  This is not about breaking agreements. This is about a Senate that is \nalready broken. We once were called the world's greatest deliberative \nbody, and we have become a graveyard for good ideas. The traditions of \nthe Senate have been buried--buried under the weight of filibusters, of \nchronic obstruction, and by a tyranny of the minority. The Senate has \nbeen driven by unprecedented partisanship.\n  The agreement of this past January was modest. Some of us felt it was \ntoo much so. The leaders agreed to schedule the President's nominees in \na timely manner, but that did not happen. That is not what we have \nseen. Nominees have been continually blocked--one after another, month \nafter month. That failure doesn't just violate an agreement, it \nviolates the trust of the American people.\n  People in New Mexico--people in the rest of the country--want to \nknow: Who is minding the store? The answer, too often, is no one. As a \nresult, important work is left undone. That is not by accident. It is \nby design, which is why we are here now. Because the months go by, and \nwe don't have a Secretary of Labor. We don't have a National Labor \nRelations Board. We don't have an administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency. These, and other, vital agencies are adrift.\n  Their work matters for the people in my State, for all Americans who \ncare about the rights of workers, the environment, health care, \nconsumer protection, and the integrity of our elections.\n  The American people spoke in November. They re-elected the President. \nThey expect a government to do its job, and gave the President the \nright to select his team to do that job. The people give the President \nthat right, but a minority in the Senate does not. Find 60 votes or \nfind someone else or leave the position empty. That is not the \ntradition of the Senate.\n  That is not advise and consent, it is obstruct and delay. In the end, \nit is the people of this country who are kept waiting.\n  These are qualified nominees. They should not be blocked yet again \nsimply because you don't like their policy or their program, or the law \nthey are commanded to uphold.\n  We have a chance here today--a historic chance--to restore the \nconfirmation process. We have a chance to restore the Senate to how it \nhas worked for over 200 years. I hope we will take this opportunity.\n  New Mexicans want a government that works, the American people want a \ngovernment that works, and today they will be watching to see if, \nfinally, it actually does.\n  In conclusion, I want to talk about the rules and what we engaged in \nyesterday, which I thought was a very productive endeavor. We had 3 \nhours with most Senators in the room in the Old Senate Chamber. We were \nable to exchange our thoughts outside of the limelight. I believe it \nwas very productive.\n  We had a lot of ideas come forward. Some of those ideas to resolve \nthis situation may end up being adopted in a little bit. It looks as \nthough Richard Cordray, the attorney general from Ohio, will get \ncloture at this point--at least that is the way it is looking--and then \nwe will have some debate on that nomination.\n  I have a couple of other points. First of all, Leader Reid has \nincredible patience when it comes to this whole issue of executive \nnominations. I have seen him over and over go beyond the pale when it \ncomes to patience. At this point he realized we were getting things \nclogged up, there was too much obstruction, so he needed to force the \nissue.\n  I am very proud he has done this because I think it has pushed us in \nthe right direction. As a result, we are going to get executive \nnominees in place on a timely basis, and we are going to get rid of all \nthe delay we have had.\n  I looked back in history at executive nominees. I remember my father \nwhen he became Secretary of the Interior in 1961. When I was first \nsworn into the Senate and came home, I told him we were having a hard \ntime getting executive nominees in place. He said: Tom, the amazing \nthing, if you highlight the 50 years ago and 50 years later, is I had \nmy whole team in place within 2 weeks. My entire team was in place in 2 \nweeks.\n  This is President Obama's fifth year as President, and he doesn't \nhave his team in place. That is the issue. I know we are focusing on \ntrying to do everything we can to find a solution as to how we allow a \nPresident who has been reelected--and by a pretty good margin--to have \nhis team in place.\n  I am very confident that Senator John McCain is working on a \ncompromise. He is a good friend to the family and somebody who cares \nabout moving forward with the issues rather than obstructing the \nissues.\n  As everybody knows, he was part of the Gang of 14. Senator McCain \nwith 13 other Senators came up with that compromise to move us forward \nin terms of the gridlock that we were facing with judicial nominations. \nSo I hope the discussions that are taking place are going to produce \nsomething.\n  I think it is a big breakthrough to see we are at the point where \nRichard Cordray, who has been waiting for 2 years--he is a very \ncompetent individual. He has served as the attorney general of Ohio, \none of our biggest States. He is a great consumer protection person--is \ngoing to get cloture, we will have debate, and my sense is we are going \nto get him into that consumer agency, and it will make a big \ndifference.\n  I see my good friend Senator Corker, so I want to make sure he gets \nto speak before we have this 11 a.m. vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thought last night's meeting was a \nhealthy meeting. I am glad we did what we did. I appreciate the two \nleaders sponsoring that meeting, and I appreciate the time in which \neveryone spoke.\n  I think with a lot of phone calls having been made this morning we \ncan and will move past the cloture vote for Mr. Cordray. I have had \nseveral conversations with him and others, this morning, but I do want \nto say this is a gesture of good faith. We will see what happens in a \nmoment when the vote takes place and, obviously, in this body, nothing \nhappens until it happens.\n  I hope Members on the other side will note this good-faith effort \nthat is taking place in a few moments. I hope it is going to happen. I \nthink it may.\n  I hope that over the course of the next 24 to 48 hours we can work in \na little more comprehensive manner. I think this would be something to \nget behind us during this next year and a half so we can move on to \nsolving our Nation's problems. I don't think it is healthy for this \nbody to constantly have potential rules changes hanging over the issues \nof our Nation, and we do have big issues.\n  We have an opportunity, potentially, to get the immigration issue \nbehind us. I know there are other pieces of legislation we could well \ndeal with. In the event we do move into this postcloture period, I hope \nMembers on the other side of the aisle will take note of that and will \nwork with us constructively toward a solution that brings this place \ntogether instead of pulling it apart.\n  I thank the Senator for his efforts. Again, I empathize and \nsympathize with his family over the personal loss that just occurred. I \nlook forward to working with the Senator from New Mexico as we move \nahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination of \n     Richard Cordray, of Ohio, to be Director, Bureau of Consumer \n     Financial Protection.\n         Harry Reid, Tim Johnson, Barbara Boxer, Elizabeth Warren, \n           Debbie Stabenow, Jon Tester, Al Franken, Jack Reed, Tom \n           Harkin, Ron Wyden, Patrick J.

I hope we don't have to use all of the 8 hours, but we will \nsee.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. \nto 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings and that the time \nduring the recess count postcloture on the Cordray nomination.\n  I express my appreciation for the strong vote this good man received.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. What I should have done and will do now is ask unanimous \nconsent that the time during this quorum call be divided equally on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thought I would make a couple of \ncomments regarding the activities of this Chamber a few minutes ago. We \nhad 71 votes in favor of closing debate on the nomination of Richard \nCordray to be Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the \nCFPB. The CFPB is vested with the responsibility of protecting \nconsumers from predatory financial practices.\n  We all discovered in the runup to the great recession just how \nimportant this protection is. We had many crazy predatory practices.\n  On credit cards we had fees that came out of nowhere and shifting \ntime periods from month to month in terms of when the payments were \ndue, even shifting destinations of where the credit card payments got \nmailed to, and also fees that could be wracked up on unsuspecting \nconsumers.\n  We certainly found out on mortgages how important financial \nprotection is because we had, starting from 2003 forward, a booming \nindustry in predatory teaser rate mortgages, where the mortgages might \nbe 4 percent for 2 years but then were changed after 2 years to 9 \npercent. One would think most would-be homeowners would look at that \ndeal and say: That is not a good deal. But here is what happened. They \nwent to a mortgage broker, and the mortgage broker said: I am your \nfinancial adviser. Mortgages have gotten very complex, they are very \nthick, and there is a lot of fine print, so you are paying me to sort \nthrough and find the best deal for you.\n  So first-time home buyers trusted their mortgage brokers. Unbeknownst \nto the new homeowners, those brokers were being paid kickbacks called \nsteering payments. They were being paid special bonuses outside the \nframework of the deal in order to steer the unsuspecting first-time \nhome buyer--the customer--into a predatory loan when the first-time \ncustomer actually qualified for a prime fixed-rate mortgage. Well, \nthose predatory mortgages proceeded to be put into securities, and \nthose securities were bought up by financial institutions across \nAmerica and beyond because the folks who were buying the securities \nunderstood that in a couple of years the interest rate would go way up \nand they would make a lot of money off those securities.\n  So this was a system rigged against the first-time home buyer, \nagainst the home buyer who wanted to start their journey to owning \ntheir piece of the American dream.\n  Those predatory practices should never have been allowed. Some here \nwill remember the responsibility for consumer protection was vested in \nthe Federal Reserve. But what happened in the Federal Reserve? The \nFederal Reserve carried on with its responsibility on monetary policy, \nbut it put its responsibility for consumer protection down in the \nbasement of its building. They locked the doors, they threw away the \nkey, and they said let the market be the market. They abandoned our \nconsumers across this country.\n  That is why we need a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It \ndoesn't have a conflict in its mission. It is not obsessed with a \ndifferent mission such as monetary policy. We need a bureau that says: \nNew predatory techniques will crop up and we will try to end them, try \nto end practices in predatory payday loans that can charge 350 to 550-\npercent interest on unsuspecting citizens. We need a bureau that will \nlook out and say we need to stop the practice on which online payday \nlenders get your bank account number and, without your permission, do a \nremotely generated check and reach in and grab the funds out of your \naccount. The list of predatory practices is endless because the human \nmind is endlessly inventive. So we have an important bureau--but an \nimportant bureau that cannot do its job unless there is a director to \nrun it.\n  Two years ago Richard Cordray was nominated to head the Bureau. He \nhas been waiting to get cloture on his nomination and a subsequent vote \nfor 2 years. He has been an interim appointee during that period of \ntime and, by all accounts, from everything I have heard from folks in \nthis Chamber, doing a very good job, working very hard with the great \ntechnical details of the financial world to find a fair and solid way \nforward.\n  The fact is his nomination, so long delayed, is not a reflection on \nhim personally. In fact, many Senators who have opposed allowing the \nvote to take place have come forward and said it is not about him \npersonally; it is about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \nForty-three Senators in this Chamber wrote a letter to say they would \noppose any nominee for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It was \na bold attempt to change back to a situation where there was no one to \nfight for consumer protection for our citizens in this Nation.\n  Today we end that drama in favor of fairness for American citizens, \nin favor of taking strong action against predatory mortgages and the \npredatory practices of the future. In 8 hours we will be voting up or \ndown on his nomination, as we should have long ago.\n  But let me shift gears here and say the vote we took today is \nsymbolic of much more than the important function of establishing an \neffective Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The vote we took a \nshort while ago is central to ending the paralysis that has generally \nhaunted this Chamber. That paralysis is something new. In\n\n[[Page S5696]]\n\nthe time from Eisenhower's Presidency through Ford's Presidency, there \nwas not one filibuster of an executive nominee. In President Obama's \n4\\1/2\\ years, there have been 16 such filibusters. So if we talk about \nthe norm and tradition of the Senate, the norm and tradition of the \nSenate is a reasonable and timely up-or-down vote. That is the \ntradition, and it is a tradition that fits with the Constitution. The \nConstitution calls for a supermajority for treaties to be confirmed, \nbut it only embeds a simple majority requirement for nominations. There \nis reasoning behind that: because our Founders envisioned three coequal \nbranches of government. They could never have envisioned it would be OK \nfor the minority of one branch to be able to deeply disable another \nbranch, be it the executive branch or be it the judiciary.\n  So the vote we took today is part of a larger conversation about \nending the paralysis and focusing on the challenge of executive \nnominations getting timely up-or-down votes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I first thank the Senator for his \nleadership. He has been the singular force in the Senate to have us \nreassess the rules of the Senate to make certain they are serving the \nneeds of our Nation. I thank Senator Merkley for his leadership, and I \nknow he felt a great sense of satisfaction with the vote that was just \ncast on the floor--a vote in which 71 Senators voted to invoke cloture \nand end the filibuster on the nominee to head the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau.\n  As the Senator from Oregon knows, this Bureau has been controversial \nsince its inception when we passed the Dodd-Frank finance reform bill \nafter the tragedies and scandals of Wall Street. There were many who \ndid not want to see us create a consumer protection agency. Yet we did. \nIt was the brainchild of one of our current colleagues, Senator \nElizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who, before she was elected, thought \nthis was an important agency--literally the only consumer protection \nagency in the Federal Government. But it wasn't welcomed by some \ncorners, particularly some financial institutions and others.\n  I think it is noteworthy at two levels, and I would like to ask the \nSenator from Oregon to respond. First, it is noteworthy that although \nit took 2 years, in that 2-year period of time this Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau has proven its worth.\n  I am working now on the exploitation of our military by for-profit \nschools. Holly Petraeus, the wife of General Petraeus, works for this \nagency, and she has focused her efforts on military families and the \nexploitation of the GI bill by these schools.\n  I think every American would agree that those who are guilty of it \nshould be held accountable, and this investigation is under way by this \nagency. Now Richard Cordray is there to head it. I think that is \nimportant, and that is why this vote which will be in a few hours on \nRichard Cordray's nomination is important.\n  But the second point is a larger global point about the Senate and \nperhaps Congress. We have in a very brief period of time--1 month--seen \ntwo very significant votes, in my estimation. The first was on the \nimmigration bill, where 68 Senators voted for the immigration reform \nbill, 14 Republicans joining all the Democrats. It was a breakthrough, \nand most of us feel it was the first time in a long time that we have \nseen Senators of both political parties sit down and hammer out an \nagreement that was reflected in the vote on the floor: 14 Republicans, \n54 Democrats.\n  Now we have the second evidence of bipartisanship with the vote that \nwas just cast, 71 who came forward--some 17 Republicans and 54 \nDemocrats, if I am not mistaken--voting in favor of ending cloture.\n  The point I would like to get to in this long question--and I would \nask the Senator from Oregon for his reflection on this--it seems to me \nthe key to getting things done on Capitol Hill these days, in a \nfractured political Nation, is bipartisanship--not just in the Senate \nChamber but in the House as well, that they have to reach beyond the \nmajority party--in our case Democrats and in their case Republicans--\nand start thinking about how we put things together on a bipartisan \nbasis that have a chance of passing and ultimately becoming law and \nsolving the problems facing our Nation.\n  When it comes to consumer protection, with a bipartisan vote, we move \nforward. A few weeks ago when it came to immigration reform, we had a \nbipartisan vote that moved forward. So I would ask the Senator to not \nonly reflect on this institution and the earlier vote but on the \ncurrent challenges we face politically and how these votes reflect on \nthose.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I would say to my colleague from Illinois that, indeed, \nthese are key milestones where the journey is to restore the \nfunctionality of this Senate so it can take on the significant issues \nAmericans expect us to take on.\n  The path forward is not yet one without obstruction. We have these \ntwo important milestones--one of going forward on immigration, a second \nof going forward in terms of putting a functioning Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau fully together. We have had some other recent moments \nthat fit this pattern, including passing the farm bill out of this \nChamber for the second time, passing a Water Resources Development Act \nthat would fund enormous amounts of infrastructure across this country \nto help provide both water supply infrastructure and wastewater \ntreatment infrastructure. These are good moments. But we also are \nreminded that the path is not completely clear.\n  For example, at this moment we should be in the middle of a \nconference committee on the budget. The Senate passed a budget and the \nHouse has passed a budget, but the conference committee is being \nfilibustered by this Chamber. That is evidence of the model we are \ntrying to break that is unexplainable to the American people. Folks \nback home want to know why we can't get a bill on the floor of the \nSenate to address the sequester. Because fewer kids are getting into \nHead Start, fewer kids are getting their inoculations, title I schools \nare not getting their funding. And, of course, there is a lot of \nconcern within the military world about our national security where \nprograms are being compromised. But we couldn't get the bill to the \nfloor of the Senate because it was filibustered.\n  So we have important milestones to grab hold of that are presenting a \nvision of the restoration of this Senate as a deliberative body, but we \nare going to have to work together in this bipartisan fashion we speak \nof to continue on this road.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague from Illinois \nemphasizing the important role of bipartisanship in making this Chamber \nwork. His question gave me an opportunity to talk about what has just \ntranspired as an important victory--an important victory for this \nChamber and its deliberation, an important victory for people across \nAmerica, families working to have their financial foundation solid \nrather than torn asunder by predatory practices.\n  In this journey, this effort to achieve a Senate that can again \nfunction as a deliberative body, I want to take this moment to thank my \ncolleague Tom Udall. Tom Udall and I came into the Senate together. Tom \nUdall immediately recognized that the Senate needed to address its \ninternal functioning because we were becoming more and more paralyzed. \nHe proposed before this body that we have a conscious debate every 2 \nyears about how to adjust the rules and to make this Senate Chamber \nwork much better, because we are not only being paralyzed on executive \nnominations but we have this terrible paralysis on legislation, with a \nfew important exceptions that my colleague from Illinois and I spoke \nabout.\n  I want to thank Tom for his work to help motivate this body to take \non these issues and to restore the functionality. I have been pleased \nto be a partner with him on this journey. I know it is a journey that \nis not yet done, but I do thank my colleagues--across the aisle and on \nthis side of the aisle--for the very frank discussions last night in \nwhich for 3 hours we bared our hearts, if you will, about what is \nworking and not working in this Chamber. That too is an important \nmoment\n\n[[Page S5697]]\n\nin this journey to make the Senate work. So I applaud the spirit that \ncame into the Chamber today that resolved the 2-year standoff in regard \nto having a functioning chair of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, and to set the tone, hopefully, for changing dramatically the \npartnership to restore the functioning of the Senate going forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I am glad an agreement has been reached \nin which President Obama will finally get Senate confirmation votes on \nhis appointees to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the \nDepartment of Labor, and the head of the Environmental Protection \nAgency. This agreement, as I understand it, will also provide that the \nPresident's new nominees for the National Labor Relations Board will be \nrapidly confirmed. That is a step forward.\n  While this agreement addresses the immediate need for the President \nof the United States to have his Cabinet and his senior staff \nconfirmed, this agreement today only addresses one symptom of a \nseriously dysfunctional Senate. The issue that must now be addressed is \nhow we create a process and a set of rules in the Senate that allows us \nto respond to the needs of the American people in a timely and \neffective way--something virtually everyone agrees is not happening \nnow. The Senate cannot function with any degree of effectiveness if a \nsupermajority of 60 votes is needed to pass virtually any piece of \nlegislation and if we waste huge amounts of time not debating the real \nissues facing working people but waiting for motions to proceed hour \nafter hour where nobody is even on the floor of the Senate.\n  The good news is that I think the Nation is now focused on the \ndysfunctionality of the Senate and the need for us to have rules or a \nprocess that allows us to address the enormous problems facing our \ncountry. When people ask why is it that Congress now has a favorability \nrating of less than 10 percent, the answer is fairly obvious: The \nmiddle class of this country is disappearing. Real unemployment is \nsomewhere around 14 percent. The minimum wage has not kept up with \ninflation. Millions of people are working in jobs that pay them poverty \nwages. Tens of millions of people today lack health care, while we have \nthe most expensive and wasteful health care system in the world. The \ngreatest planetary crisis facing our Nation and the entire world is \nglobal warming, and we are not even debating that issue.\n  The Senate is a very peculiar institution. It is peculiar in the \nsense that any one Member--one of 100--can come down here on the floor \nand utter two magical words that bring the Senate to a complete halt; \nthat is, ``I object.'' I will not allow the Senate to go forward, which \nmeans the whole government shuts down. I object. I object.\n  What we have seen in recent years--especially since Barack Obama was \nelected--is an unprecedented level of ``I object,'' of holds, of a \nvariety of mechanisms that bring the functioning of the Senate to a \nhalt. All of this takes place at a time when millions of people cannot \nfind jobs and at a time when kids are graduating college deeply in debt \nand millions of others are now choosing not to go to college because we \nare not addressing the issue of higher education. It takes place at a \ntime when our infrastructure--our roads and bridges and airports and \nrail systems--is crumbling, when our educational system is in need of \nmajor reform, and the gap between the people on top and everybody else \nis growing wider.\n  The American people perceive this country has major problems that \nmust be addressed. What does the Senate do? We are sitting here waiting \n30 hours for a motion to proceed, to see if, in fact, we can vote on a \npiece of legislation that requires 60 votes. Time and time again we do \nnot get those votes.\n  When votes come up, I would like to win, to be on the winning side. \nThat is natural. Everybody would. But what happens here--and the \nAmerican people by and large do not fully understand it--we do not vote \non issues. What happens is the debate ceases because we do not get \nmotions to proceed. So we do not vote on a jobs program, we vote on \nwhether we can proceed to a jobs program to create millions of jobs. We \ndo not vote on whether we can keep interest rates low for college \nstudents who are borrowing money, we vote on whether we can proceed to \nhave the vote.\n  What we have seen in the last several years is an unprecedented level \nof obstructionism and filibustering. Between 1917 and 1967 there was \nmore or less an agreement in the Senate that a filibuster would only be \nused under exceptional circumstances. There were only some 40 or 45 \nfilibusters in a 50-year period. When Lyndon Johnson was majority \nleader in the late 1950s, in his 6-year tenure as majority leader he \nhad to overcome a filibuster on one occasion. Since Harry Reid has been \nmajority leader in the last 6\\1/2\\ years, he has had to overcome 400 \nfilibusters or at least requirements for 60 votes. The amount of time \nwe are wasting is unconscionable.\n  Furthermore, what the American people do not know is that time after \ntime we are winning. We have the votes to win and have shown that on \nvery important issues. In terms of one major issue, just as an example, \nright now, rather tragically, we have a situation as a result of the \ndisastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision that corporations and \nbillionaires can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on elections.\n  As bad as that is, what is even worse, they can hide their \ncontributions--not make them public. Guess what. The Senate by a \nmajority vote said: That is wrong. If you are going to contribute huge \namounts of money into the political process, the people have a right to \nknow who you are.\n  We have a majority vote on this issue. We could not get it passed \nbecause we needed 60 votes.\n  The American people know our tax system is enormously flawed. We have \nmajor corporations--General Electric and other corporations--that in a \ngiven year, after making billions of dollars in profits, pay zero in \nFederal taxes. Legislation was passed on the floor of the Senate by a \nmajority--legislation that begins to address that issue--but we did not \nhave 60 votes.\n  We provided emergency relief to senior citizens who several years ago \nwere getting no COLAs for Social Security. We had a majority vote but \ncould not get 60 votes.\n  We had a majority vote to say that women should be paid equal pay for \nequal work. A majority of Senators said that. We couldn't get it \npassed.\n  What we have seen in recent years is reasonably good legislation \ngetting a majority vote, but we cannot get it passed because time after \ntime we need 60 votes. What we are operating under now is a tyranny of \nthe minority.\n  The American people go to vote. They elect Obama President, and they \nelect a Democratic Senate. People who campaigned on certain issues--as \npeople go forward trying to implement their campaign promises, they \ncannot do it because we cannot get 60 votes.\n  Once again, at one point in Senate history, from 1917 to 1967, the \nfilibuster was used very sparingly--only in exceptional circumstances. \nSince that point, have Democrats--and I speak as an Independent--have \nDemocrats abused the system? Have they been obstructionist? There are \ntimes when they have been. But since 2008 what has happened is the \nRepublicans have taken obstructionism to an entirely new level. \nVirtually every piece of legislation now requires 60 votes, and \nvirtually every piece of legislation requires an enormous amount of \ntime.\n  What do we do? My colleagues on both sides of the aisle have made the \npoint that the Senate is not the House. And they are right. In the \nHouse there are 435 Members and majority rules. The majority has a \nwhole lot of power. The minority doesn't have that much power. People \nhave said: We do not want the Senate to be like the House, and I agree \nwith that. The Senate should not be the House.\n  Senate Members should be guaranteed the right to offer amendments, \nnot be shut out of the process. Whether you are the minority or the \nmajority, you should have the right to offer amendments. There should \nbe thorough and lengthy debate. If a Member of the Senate wants to \nstand here on the floor and speak hour after hour to call attention to \nsome issue he or she believes is important, that Senator has the right, \nin my view, to do that. If that debate goes on for a week, it goes on \nfor a week. Senators, whether in the minority or the majority, have the \nright to call attention and to debate and focus on issues they consider \nto be\n\n[[Page S5698]]\n\nimportant. But at the end of that debate there must be finality. There \nmust be a majority vote--51 votes should win. The concept I support is \nwhat is called the talking filibuster. Minority rights must be \nprotected. They must have all the time they need to make their point. \nBut majority rights must also be protected. If democracy means \nanything, what I learned in the third grade was that the majority \nrules, not the minority.\n\n  What is happening in our country is not only enormous frustration \nabout the very serious economic and environmental problems we face, \nthere is huge outrage at the inability of Congress to even debate those \nissues.\n  For example, I am a very strong believer that the minimum wage in \nthis country must be significantly raised. It is now about $7.25. I \nwould like it to go up to $10 an hour, and even at $10 an hour people \nworking 40 hours a week will still be living in poverty, but we have to \nraise the minimum wage. My strong guess is that if we do not change the \nrules, despite overwhelming support in this country for raising the \nminimum wage, we will never get an up-or-down vote here on that issue \nbecause Republicans will obstruct, demand 60 votes, and filibuster the \nissue.\n  If my Republican friends are so confident in the points of view they \nare advocating, bring them to the floor and let's have an up-or-down \nvote. Let the American people know how I feel on the issue, how you \nfeel on the issue, but let's not have issues decided because we could \nnot get 60 votes for a motion to proceed. Nobody in America understands \nwhat that is about. Do you want to vote against the minimum wage? Have \nthe guts to come and vote against the minimum wage. Do you want to vote \nagainst women's rights? Come on up, have your say, and vote against \nwomen's rights. Do you want to vote against global warming? Vote \nagainst global warming. At least let us have the debate the American \npeople are demanding.\n\n  I will conclude by saying I am glad the President will finally be \nable to get some key appointees seated. I was a mayor so I know how \nterribly important it is for a chief executive to have their team \naround them. I am glad he will get some key appointees.\n  Everyone should understand that what we are doing today is dealing \nwith one very small part of an overall problem, which is the \ndysfunctionality of the Senate. I hope--having addressed the immediate \ncrisis--we can now go on and address the broader issue, which is making \nthe Senate responsive to the needs of the American people. Let's have \nserious debates on serious issues and let's see where the chips fall.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/16/senate-section/article/S5698-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, during the debate over the budget, Dr. \nCoburn and I offered an amendment to create a separate and independent \ninspector general within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  We introduced this amendment because, thanks to a quirk in Dodd-\nFrank, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is the only major \nFederal agency without its own inspector general. I think people know I \ntend to rely a great deal on inspectors general within the bureaucracy \nto be an independent check to make sure the laws are followed and that \nmoney is spent according to the law.\n  Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but it \ndid not create a protection bureau-specific inspector general. Instead, \nbecause Dodd-Frank funded the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nthrough the Federal Reserve, this Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nended up sharing an inspector general with the Federal Reserve.\n  This has created a problem. Right now, the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau's inspector general has a split role. He serves as \nboth inspector general for the Federal Reserve and for the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. I believe this creates a great deal of \nconfusion and, obviously, a bureaucratic battle for resources. In fact, \nthe inspector general has already had to create two separate audit \nplans. He also has had to hire employees who can oversee both the \nFederal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  The end result is an office split by two very important but very \ndifferent priorities. Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau within the Federal Reserve in order to fund the \nBureau without having to come to us on Capitol Hill to get \ncongressional appropriations. This is a problem but not a problem I am \ngoing to deal with right now. We had a marriage of convenience, the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau within the Federal Reserve.\n  The Bureau's function is very different from the Federal Reserve. \nDespite this, years after Dodd-Frank was passed, this unique situation \nremains. My concern is if you have one inspector general trying to \ncover two different entities, the end result is neither gets fully \noverseen. In other words, we don't have adequate checks within the \nbureaucracy to make sure that laws are abided by and that money is \nspent according to law.\n  Since the passage of the Inspector General Act of 1978, Congress has \nbelieved that each Department and each agency needs its own independent \ninspector general. This has been a longstanding bipartisan position.\n  Currently, there are 73 inspectors general, in every single Cabinet-\nlevel Department and almost all independent agencies. Even small \nindependent agencies such as the Federal Maritime Commission and the \nNational Science Foundation have their own inspector general.\n  In each of these agencies, if each of these agencies has their own \nindependent inspector general, shouldn't the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau--particularly since this Bureau doesn't have to come \nto Congress for appropriations. We don't get appropriations oversight \nsince some of their decisions can't even be challenged in the courts.\n  Now we are in this situation. The majority has opposed commonsense \nchanges such as this to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  During the budget debate when Dr. Coburn and I introduced the \namendment to create a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau-specific \ninspector general, the majority would not allow it to be brought up for \na vote. The position I heard over and over was the majority did not \nwish to relitigate Dodd-Frank in any way. I did not hear any concerns \nrelated to the merits of this proposal. Our amendment wasn't about \nrelitigating anything, it was about creating accountability and \noversight at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and doing that \nthrough an independent inspector general, such as 73\n\n[[Page S5699]]\n\nother independent agencies have these sorts of checks and balances.\n  Because the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is funded directly \nby the Federal Reserve, there are few, if any, congressional oversight \nchecks on the Bureau. This makes an independent inspector general even \nmore important.\n  Right now, it seems to me, since we don't discuss Dodd-Frank very \noften, we don't have legislation related to it. We don't have \nopportunities to amend. This nomination of Mr. Cordray, now before the \nSenate, is the only tool the Senate has to create transparency and \naccountability within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. As we \nconsider this nomination, I hope we will remember that and consider the \nSenate's role in overseeing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nwhat steps we can take to make the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nmore transparent and, hence, more accountable to Congress, and in turn \nto the American people.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, now that the so-called nuclear option has \nbeen averted and the Senate can now turn its attention to other matters \nof substance, rather than internal matters of how the Senate operates, \nI think it is important we evaluate how legislation that has passed \nthis body is working. I wish to focus specifically on the Affordable \nCare Act, which is better known as ObamaCare.\n  Amazingly, Senator Reid on Sunday, in one of the talk shows, was \nquoted as saying: ``ObamaCare has been wonderful for America.'' The \nHouse minority leader, former Speaker Pelosi, has said that \nimplementation of the health care law has been fabulous.\n  This stands in stark contrast to what Senator Max Baucus, chairman of \nthe Senate Finance Committee and one of the principal Senate architects \nof ObamaCare, has said--what he told Secretary Sebelius, the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services--that the implementation of ObamaCare is a \ntrain wreck in the making. And then you contrast that with what \nPresident Obama himself said about the Affordable Care Act, about \nObamaCare, and he said it is ``working the way it is supposed to.'' \nWell, not all of those things can be true at the same time, and they \nare not. Indeed, in the real world, unfortunately, it looks as though \nObamaCare is a slow-motion disaster in the making.\n\n  Notwithstanding the President's comments that it is working the way \nit is supposed to, the administration seems to be acknowledging by its \nown actions that it is not working the way it is supposed to. Indeed, \nthe administration has chosen to delay the so-called employers mandate, \nand they have begun to admit what Americans have been saying since at \nleast 2010 when ObamaCare passed--that it has simply proven to be \nunworkable.\n  Rather than accept the reality and support full congressional repeal \nof the law, the administration is instead refusing to enforce the law \nand is choosing to apply it selectively. The law clearly states that as \nof January 2014 all businesses with 50 or more full-time employees have \nto provide their workers with health insurance or else pay a penalty. \nTo be clear, I didn't support the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare--but \nthat is what the law says. Our Democratic colleagues, 60 of them in the \nSenate, and the majority in the then-Democratically controlled House \npassed the law and President Obama signed it, and that is what it says. \nBut the President has chosen to take unilateral action and to refuse to \nenforce the law that he himself signed and that congressional Democrats \npassed without a single Republican vote.\n  Whether you supported it or you didn't support it, many of us now are \nforced to acknowledge and I would think the administration itself would \nbe forced to acknowledge, that the law simply is not working as \nadvertised. It is now obvious that the employer mandate has prompted \nmany businesses to reduce the number of hours and transform full-time \njobs into part-time jobs in order to avoid the employer mandate. This \nhas contributed to a surge in the number of people working part-time \njobs for economic reasons. Last month alone that number was 8.2 million \npeople--8.2 million Americans who would like to have full-time work but \nsimply can't find it, in large part because of the implementation of \nObamaCare.\n  As I said, I voted against ObamaCare 3 years ago. I remember being in \nthis Chamber on Christmas Eve at 7 a.m. in 2009 when our Democratic \ncolleagues passed ObamaCare without a single vote from this side of the \naisle. Many of us were voicing concerns about the provisions of \nObamaCare, including the employer mandate, long before it became law. \nThe problems with the mandate will, of course, still be there in 2015 \nnotwithstanding the 1-year unilateral delay by the administration, and \nthey reflect broader problems in the Affordable Care Act as a whole.\n  I believe the most commonsense thing we can do is simply to repeal it \nand to start over and replace it with patient-centered reforms that \nactually address the biggest challenges that face most families in \nAmerica.\n  The President said: If you like what you have in terms of your health \ncoverage, you can keep it. Millions of Americans are now finding that \nnot to be the case. The President said a family of four will find their \npremiums reduced, on average, $2,500. Actually, rather than a reduction \nin cost, they are finding their premiums are going up and will go up \neven more when ObamaCare is implemented.\n  My point is that whether or not you voted for ObamaCare, it is \nimportant that we now acknowledge the sad reality that it is not \nworking the way even its most vigorous proponents wished it would. \nIndeed, it seems to be working out in a way most of its critics thought \nit would.\n  But what is important now is that we work together to give permanent \nrelief to this public policy train wreck for individual Americans and \nfor small businesses. That is actually how we are supposed to function \nunder our Constitution. Even under uniformly Democratic control, as the \nCongress and the White House were the first 2 years of this President's \nterm, if things don't work out the way even the most ardent proponents \nof a piece of legislation wish and hope it will, then our job under the \nConstitution is to work together to try to provide some relief and \nsolutions for the American people. That is true whether you objected to \nthe law in its first instance or you simply supported it. If it turns \nout not to work as advertised, it is our job to fix it, and we can do \nso by replacing it with high-quality care that is more affordable and \nis much simpler to use. Rather than have the Federal Government dictate \nto you and your doctor what kind of care you are going to get and under \nwhat terms, you can, in consultation with your private doctor, make \nthose decisions in the best interest of yourself and your family.\n  The bigger problem is that President Obama is simply deciding which \naspects of the law to enforce and which not to enforce, and that is \nbecoming somewhat of a trend, based on political convenience and \nexpediency. Time and time again he has made clear that if a law passed \nby Congress and signed by the President--whether it is him or another \nPresident--is unpopular among his political supporters, he will simply \nignore it and refuse to enforce it.\n  Shortly after ObamaCare became law, the administration began issuing \nwaivers from the annual limit requirements, which made it seem as if \ncertain organizations--oftentimes labor unions--would simply be \nexempted from and would receive preferential treatment based on their \npolitical connections. Meanwhile, to help implement ObamaCare, the IRS \nhas announced it will violate the letter of the law and issue health \ninsurance subsidies through Federal exchanges, especially in those \nplaces where the States have declined to issue State-based exchanges, \neven though the law makes clear these subsidies can only be used for \nState exchanges.\n  Let me restate that. The law says you can only use taxpayer subsidies \nfor State-based exchanges, but because many States have simply said \nthat this makes no sense for them and are refusing to create State-\nbased insurance exchanges, these individuals will now be\n\n[[Page S5700]]\n\nin the Federal insurance exchange. And even though the law says \ntaxpayer subsidies are not available for those, the IRS is papering \nover that provision of the law and simply disregarding it.\n\n  Again, we have seen this time and time again. We saw a similar \ndisregard for the rule of law during the government-run Chrysler \nbankruptcy when the company-secured bondholders received much less for \ntheir loans than the United Auto Workers' pension funds. Even though, \nunder the law, these bondholders were entitled to the highest priority \nin terms of repayment, they were subjugated to the United Auto Workers' \npension fund basically in an exercise of political strong-arming.\n  We saw this again in the Solyndra bankruptcy. Remember that? The \nObama administration violated the law by making taxpayers subordinate \nto private lenders. In other words, they put the taxpayers on the hook \nrather than the private lenders who helped finance Solyndra.\n  More recently, the administration--and this is something that is in \nthe news as recently as today--made unconstitutional recess \nappointments to the National Labor Relations Board and to the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals \nheld that the administration's argument in defense of its so-called \n``recess appointment power'' would ``eviscerate the Constitution's \nseparation of powers.'' It now appears, as part of the so-called \nnuclear option negotiations, that even the White House is now being \nforced to withdraw these nominees who were unconstitutionally appointed \nand offer substitute appointees.\n  We also know that the Obama administration unilaterally chose to \nwaive key requirements of the 1996 welfare reform law and the 2002 law \nknown as No Child Left Behind.\n  A government run by waiver or by the Federal Government picking \nwinners and losers is the antithesis of equal justice under the law. \nLook across the street at the Supreme Court of the United States, and \nabove the entry it says: ``Equal justice under law.'' That is the very \ndefinition of our form of government, which is designed for a congress \ncomprised of duly-elected representatives of the American people and \nthe President of the United States to write legislation that applies to \neverybody and not to issue waivers or exemptions or to simply refuse to \nenforce the law because it has proven to be inconvenient or not \npolitically expedient.\n  The U.S. Constitution obligates the President to make sure all of our \nlaws are faithfully executed. Yet, with President Obama, the pattern is \nunmistakable: inconvenient or unpopular legal requirements are \nrepeatedly swept aside by Executive fiat.\n  If the law is not working the way it is supposed to, the President \nshould come back to Congress and say: We need to amend the law. We need \nto replace this unworkable law with one that will actually serve the \ninterests of the American people.\n  But we are not seeing that happen. We are seeing the White House \ndecide on its own that it simply won't enforce a law. Last year, for \nexample, the administration unilaterally announced a moratorium on the \nenforcement of certain immigration laws. In effect, when Congress \nfailed to pass legislation the President wanted, the President himself \nsimply decided not to enforce the immigration laws. As that example \nshows, this administration has frequently relied on unelected \nbureaucrats to override the people's elected representatives.\n  It is simply improper and unconstitutional under our system for the \nPresident to decide unilaterally that he is not going to enforce the \nlaw. For example, when Congress refused to enact the so-called card \ncheck for labor unions, the administration simply turned to unelected \nbureaucrats at the National Labor Relations Board. And when Congress \nrefused to extend cap-and-trade energy taxes, the administration turned \nto unelected bureaucrats at the Environmental Protection Agency to \nattempt to accomplish the same objectives indirectly that had been \nprohibited by Congress because it couldn't get a political consensus \nfor doing it directly. Indeed, the President has now authorized the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to regulate virtually every aspect of \nthe American economy without congressional approval and without \nrecourse to the American people.\n  When Congress makes a mistake, when we do something the American \npeople don't approve of, they get to vote us out of office if they see \nfit. That is not true with this faceless, nameless bureaucracy, which \nis rarely held accountable, and particularly when the President \ndelegates to that bureaucracy the authority to regulate in so many \nareas and avoid congressional accountability and accountability at the \nWhite House.\n  Taken together, all these measures represent a basic contempt for the \nrule of law and the normal constitutional checks and balances under \nseparated powers. After witnessing the President's record over the past \n4\\1/2\\ years, is it any wonder why the American people and, indeed, \nMembers of Congress were skeptical about his promises to enforce our \nimmigration laws under the immigration bill that passed the Senate \nrecently?\n  Remember all of the extravagant promises that were made for border \nsecurity, for interior enforcement, for the implementation of a \nworksite verification system, for a biometric entry-exit system to \ndeter 40 percent of the illegal immigration that comes when people \nenter the country illegally and simply overstay their visas? If after \n17 years the Federal Government still isn't enforcing those laws \nalready on the books, how in the world can the American people have any \nconfidence whatsoever that the President and Congress can be trusted to \nenforce the laws that it passes?\n  After witnessing the President's performance, I think the American \npeople are deeply skeptical of his promises of future performance, and \nhis selective enforcement of our existing laws undermines public \nconfidence in the Federal Government.\n  I believe the executive overreach I have described is corrosive to \ndemocratic government.\n  If a Republican President had ignored these kinds of constitutional \nchecks, had refused to enforce laws he didn't like, refused to defend \nin court laws he didn't like, and used Federal agencies to flout the \nwill of Congress, you can be sure our friends on the other side of the \naisle would be complaining nonstop about the imperial President. Yet \nthey have largely given President Obama a pass.\n  But whether you agree with the President on health care, immigration, \nenergy policy, card check or other hot-button issues, we can all \nagree--we should all agree--that government should not be picking \nwinners and losers and that we urgently need to restore the rule of law \nand faithful execution of those laws to their rightful place in the \nhighest reaches of the Federal Government.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Maryland's Businesses\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, my good friend Congressman Steny Hoyer \npromotes America by using the phrase ``make it in America.'' The \nstatement expresses the pride of our country, the ingenuity, the spirit \nof American workers, and the fact that we can compete against any \ncountry in the world on a level playing field. We can make it in \nAmerica.\n  I rise today to share with my fellow Senators news of my recent visit \nto Maryland businesses that are contributing to our local and national \neconomy through manufacturing innovation. As part of what I call my \n``made in Maryland'' tour, I visited Volvo Group North America's \nmanufacturing facility in Hagerstown, MD, and the Flying Dog Brewery in \nFrederick, MD.\n  A few weeks ago I toured the Paul Reed Smith guitar factory on the \nEastern Shore. My ``made in Maryland'' tour has highlighted many of the \nleading job creators and key small businesses that have helped revive \nMaryland's manufacturing sector. The goal\n\n[[Page S5701]]\n\nwas to meet employees and business owners, take stock of their \nchallenges and successes, and identify ways the Federal Government can \nhelp them grow and innovate.\n  We have highlighted the diverse products being produced in our great \nState, and we celebrate the hard-working Marylanders who have made \nthese products and the companies that are providing jobs in our local \ncommunities.\n  For example, the Paul Reed Smith guitar factory in Stevensonville, \nMD, makes high-end guitars used by some of the most prominent musicians \nin the world--including Carlos Santana. Paul Reed Smith has operated \nfor nearly 30 years and now employs nearly 230 workers with revenues of \n$24 million. They are the largest private employer in Queen Anne's \nCounty, MD, and one of the top five employers on the upper shore.\n  As a region and country, we must stay focused on creating good jobs \nat home and strengthen and continue to build our economy. Manufacturing \nis good for Maryland, and it is good for America.\n  Let me tell you about my visit to Volvo Group, which employs 1,500 \npeople in Hagerstown, MD--accounting for 1 out of every 10 jobs in the \nregion's manufacturing sector. Employees at this facility are paid \napproximately 62 percent above the average wage in the region. These \nare good jobs that people are proud to hold.\n  Volvo has set the standard for environmentally aware manufacturing. \nThrough its partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy, Volvo has \ndeveloped the next generation of fuel-efficient engines and trucks. \nSince 2001, Volvo has invested $330 million to upgrade and renovate \ntheir facilities, allowing Volvo to build a state-of-the-art engine \ndevelopment laboratory to produce increasingly fuel-efficient engines.\n  This Volvo facility has shown outstanding success. Sixty of Volvo's \ntrucks a day have the same emission as one truck in 1990. That is an \namazing reduction of pollutants going into the air. In addition, the \nfacility recycles 84 percent of the site's waste, and it has achieved \nan 83-percent decrease in the use of diesel fuels.\n  Furthermore, Volvo remains invested in western Maryland by making \ngenerous contributions to local health and welfare organizations, civic \nand community organizations, art and cultural organizations, and \neducation initiatives across the region. This commitment to the well-\nbeing of Volvo employees is demonstrated by the August 2013 opening of \nan onsite Family First Pharmacy which will provide employees and their \nfamilies innovative state-of-the-art health care to be provided by \ndoctors, nurses, and pharmacists in cooperation with Walgreens.\n  As the Volvo facility is highly invested in the local community and \nits numerous employees, we must remain invested in assuring this \nsocially responsible company's future success.\n  Later in the day I traveled to Frederick, MD, and visited the Flying \nDog Brewery. They make a very different product than the most energy-\nefficient transmissions in the world that are assembled at Volvo, but I \nrecognize the same qualities in both of these unique companies and \ntheir employees: hard work, attention to detail, and a real pride and \npassion for the product being made. These are qualities that can never \nbe outsourced.\n  Small breweries such as Flying Dog have been anchors of local and \nAmerican economies since the start of our history.\n  This is a state-of-the-art facility that constantly works to perfect \nits product through innovative techniques. In addition to making a \nproduct whose high quality I can attest to, they are supporting 80 jobs \nand reinvesting profits back into the western Maryland community.\n  When I grew up, brewing in Maryland was a huge industry. We lost most \nof it, but it is coming back. Today, the brewing industry in Maryland \nis supporting more than $13 million in wages paid and contributing \nnearly $100 million to our State's economy.\n  My ``Made in Maryland'' tour was conceived to highlight manufacturing \nand innovation that is boosting our economy across our State. But I can \ntell my colleagues that agriculture, which is still our No. 1 industry, \nis being revived along the way too. During my tour of the Flying Dog \nBrewery, I met a farmer and his son who are fifth- and sixth-generation \nFrederick County family farmers celebrating the 175th year of their \nfamily farm. They told me their decision to begin growing barley, small \ngrains, and hops for local breweries is what kept their farm going. \nThey supply small grains and hops to Flying Dog and numerous Maryland \nbrewing companies for many of their seasonal, locally sourced brews. \nTheir farm, Amber Fields Malting and Brewing Company, in conjunction \nwith Brewer's Alley Restaurant and Brewery in Frederick, MD, introduced \nAmber Fields Best Bitter, which they describe as an English-style best \nbitter. This was the first commercially brewed beer in over 100 years \nto rely exclusively on barley grown and malted in Maryland. Amber \nFields Best Bitter and additional releases also featuring locally grown \ningredients are available through Brewer's Alley and their sister \nbrewery, Monocacy Brewing Company, both in Frederick, MD.\n  America's manufacturing sector--from autos and truck manufacturing to \nbeer makers and guitars--have played a major role in growing our \neconomy and our Nation to be the world's leader. It has also helped \ncreate the strongest middle class in history. To continue in our \nrecovery, we need to make sure companies such as Volvo Group, Flying \nDog Brewery, and Paul Reed Smith Guitars, which are creating jobs and \ninvesting in our economy here at home, have what they need to be \nsuccessful. Our job in Washington should be to make their job easier, \nbecause when they do better, we all do better.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, there has been some confusion about the \nPresident's health care law recently, so I come to the floor to try to \nclear up one point.\n  Just before the Fourth of July holiday, the Obama administration \nadmitted to the world that its health care law is not working out \naccording to plan. It did it in an unusual way--in a blog post--right \nbefore the Fourth of July holiday, but yet it is known to the world. By \nchoosing to delay the law's employer mandate, the President conceded it \nwould place a tremendous burden on America's job creators.\n  Then, just this past Sunday, the Senate majority leader went on \n``Meet the Press,'' on television, and said: ``ObamaCare has been \nwonderful for America.'' Wonderful for America? Senator Reid's comments \ndemonstrate once again that Democrats in Washington--the people who \nvoted for this law--are not listening to the American people.\n  I hear it when I return home to Wyoming every weekend. I did this \npast weekend. I hear it as Members of the Senate do when they talk to \nfriends from home. I heard it today from people from Gillette and \nEvanston and Cody that this health care law is unraveling. So I just \nwant to make a couple of things clear to everyone.\n  After 3\\1/2\\ years, we know the Obama health care law is not working. \nIt is a train wreck. If the law was wonderful, it wouldn't increase \npremiums. It wouldn't shrink paychecks. It wouldn't discourage job \ncreation. If the law was wonderful, we wouldn't put the feared IRS as \nthe enforcer of the health care law. If the law was wonderful, the \nadministration wouldn't have delayed one of its most critical parts. It \nis clear to me that even President Obama does not share Senator Reid's \nopinion that the health care law is wonderful.\n  This law is not wonderful for America. It is obviously terrible for \nAmerica's job creators. It is also terrible for many people trying to \nmake a living in this country.\n  There was an article on the front page of the New York Times \nrecently--Wednesday, July 10--with the headline: ``At Restaurant, Delay \nIs Help on Health Law.'' The delay is a help.\n  This article--front page, above the fold of the New York Times--\nlooked at\n\n[[Page S5702]]\n\na small Maryland restaurant called the Shanty Grille. What is going on \nat that restaurant makes the case better than any actuarial study, any \nsort of charts or any economic model ever could because it is a story \nabout real people and their lives. The article talked about how the law \nwas hurting everyone from the owner of the restaurant to the uninsured \nwaiter, to the chef who has insurance. All of them were hurt by this \nhealth care law. Because for each of these people and for millions of \nothers similar to them across the country, the reality of health care \nreform is that it has fallen far short of the President's many \npromises.\n  According to this article in the New York Times, the restaurant's \nowner is on a pace to finally this year turn a profit. It will be the \nfirst profit since the economic downturn a number of years ago. Four \nyears after the recession ended, he is finally set to recover and get \nback into the black. If he has to provide expensive Washington-\napproved, Washington-mandated health insurance for every employee, \nthough, that profit will quickly evaporate. So that would certainly \nharm this employer.\n  What about the employees? Let's talk about the people this is \ndesigned to help. It turns out the younger workers at the restaurant \nactually aren't too interested in having this health insurance \ncoverage. They say they would rather have more money in their paychecks \nso they could decide how they want to spend it, not how the President \nthinks they should spend it. So they stand to lose out once the law's \nindividual mandate starts in January because they are going to have to \ngo out and buy insurance which may be much more than they want or need \nor can afford.\n  The employees at the restaurant who already have health insurance are \nworried too. They are concerned they will not be able to keep their \ncurrent coverage. When the President stopped his disastrous employer \nmandate, I believe he actually made the right decision, but I have some \ndoubts about his reasoning. I think this was purely for political \nreasons.\n  Regardless of how and why the President made the decision, a 1-year \ndelay in this one policy doesn't solve the problem; it only extends the \nproblem.\n\n  First, this restaurant and other small businesses can't afford and \ncan't expand or hire more staff because they still face the mandate in \n2015. Actually, the final line in this article on the front page of the \nNew York Times, when we carry over and read the end of it, says: We are \nnot going to expand. ``No more expansion.''\n  Second, many businesses are cutting back workers to part-time status \nbecause of the health care law. President Obama has had nothing to say \nto those Americans looking for full-time work but trapped in a part-\ntime job, and part-time is defined by the health care law, which is \ndifferent than most Americans think of or define part-time work.\n  Third, the law still requires all of the employees, as with nearly \neveryone else in America, that they have to buy pricey health insurance \nstarting January 1. That is a problem for the President and he knows \nit.\n  Here is how an article in Politico put it this past weekend. This \narticle is entitled ``ObamaCare's Missing Mandate.'' It says:\n\n       The massive coast-to-coast campaign to get people to sign \n     up for ObamaCare is light on mentions of one central element: \n     The widely disliked individual mandate.\n\n  The Politico article goes on to say:\n\n       Poll after poll has found that Americans don't like being \n     told they have to get insurance or face a penalty. So the \n     groups doing outreach don't plan to draw much attention to \n     it.\n\n  The employer mandate has collapsed. The individual mandate is \nunpopular, so they just don't want to talk about it.\n  A lot of the people who do have to buy this new Washington-mandated, \nWashington-approved insurance will have to buy it through the \ngovernment exchanges. Of course, these may not be ready on time. There \nare 77 days left for these to be ready. Even if they are up and running \nby the deadline, we have seen ample evidence that premiums will be much \nhigher than they were before the mandate. That is especially true for \nyoung healthy adults who the President expects to pay more in order to \nhelp older sicker people pay less. But a lot of younger healthier \npeople are going to have to pay more for that one older sicker person.\n  These weren't the kinds of reforms Democrats promised when they were \nforcing this plan through Congress on strictly party-line votes. During \nthe debate, Republicans made suggestions to improve the health care \nlaw, but we were shut out of the backrooms where the Democrats struck \ntheir deals.\n  In the end Democrats drafted their law so badly that the negative \nside effects and unintended consequences were inevitable. The New York \nTimes article shows how some of these side effects are hurting millions \nof Americans--not just those working at the restaurant, including the \nrestaurant owner, in Maryland.\n  We all know President Obama likes to hold photo ops with people who \nhe says are helped by the law. It is time for him to meet with people \nsuch as the ones featured on the front page of the New York Times--\npeople who are being hurt by his health care law. It is time for the \nPresident to sit down with both Democrats and Republicans to truly talk \nabout how we can reform health care in this country. Delaying the \nemployer mandate for 1 year is not enough. It doesn't eliminate the \nburdens of this costly law.\n  The House is scheduled to vote this week to delay the individual \nmandate. The Senate should do the same. It is time for the President \nand for Senator Reid to listen to the victims of ObamaCare.\n  President Obama was right to recognize his health care law is not \nworking out. Senator Reid was totally wrong because ObamaCare is not \nwonderful for America. It is turning into a costly failure. The only \nappropriate course at this point is to permanently delay implementing \nthe rest of the law and to replace it with reform that works.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, earlier today the Senate held a first of a \nseries of cloture votes on controversial nominations by voting to \ninvoke cloture on the nominee to be the Director of the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. This agency is unlike any other Federal \nagency. Under its current structure, the CFPB has very broad discretion \nbut very little in terms of executive or congressional oversight.\n  It is not a debate about whether Republicans in the Senate support \nconsumer protection, as some would portray it. Both sides agree \neveryone benefits from a mortgage industry and marketplace free of \nfraud and other deceptive, exploitive practices.\n  Republicans did not object to consumer protection when it was placed \nin each of the prudential banking regulators. In fact, bills aimed \nspecifically at consumer protection passed with an overwhelming \nmajority in the Senate. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act \nof 2003 passed 95 to 2, and the Credit CARD Act of 2009 passed 90 to 5.\n  During the Dodd-Frank debate, the key point of contention was not the \nvalue of consumer protection but, rather, the Bureau's design.\n  One of the lessons of the financial crisis is that we need a \nsupervisory program that looks and considers how safety, soundness, and \nconsumer protection work together to create a better functioning \nfinancial system. What Republicans have been asking for is that the \nBureau be restructured in the same way as other similarly situated \nfinancial regulators, with accountability and transparency to Congress \nand to the taxpayers.\n  As outlined in two letters to the President sent by Republican \nSenators in May 2011 and this past February, the changes highlighted \nare not new. In fact, they exist in the current Federal regulatory \nlandscape. One of the key changes we seek is the establishment of a \nboard of directors to oversee the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nwith staggered terms.\n  This is the structure of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the\n\n[[Page S5703]]\n\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, and the Federal Reserve.\n  A board of directors would allow for the consideration of multiple \nviewpoints in decisionmaking and would reduce the potential for \npoliticization of regulations.\n  Indeed, the administration originally supported a board of directors \nfor the Bureau. In 2009, the Obama administration proposed a stand-\nalone Consumer Financial Protection Agency with a board of directors \nfunded through the congressional appropriations process. The Bureau \nalso should be subject to the congressional appropriations process, \nrather than, as the Dodd-Frank legislation did, to fund it through the \nFederal Reserve with no review by Congress.\n  While Mr. Cordray stated that he would come and testify before the \nAppropriations Committee, this is quite different than Congress being \nable to oversee how the monies that the agency utilizes are spent. For \nexample, the CFPB intends to spend close to $100 million to renovate \nits current headquarters. This amount is double the amount that the \nGovernment Services Administration has for property acquisition and \nrenovation in any 1 year.\n  Finally, consumer protection cannot and must not be detached from \nprudential regulation. Although the Bureau must consult with other \nprudential regulators before finalizing its rulemaking, the Bureau can \nsimply disregard their advice.\n  By establishing a solid safety and soundness check for prudential \nregulation, the link and coordination between prudential supervision \nand protection would be strengthened by allowing potential regulators \nto provide meaningful input into the CFPB's actions and proposals. Such \ncollaboration will only strengthen our financial system, not weaken \nconsumer protection.\n  Without it, the CFPB and prudential regulators may issue rules that \nresult in confusion for the regulated entities, as has already been the \ncase with conflicting guidance for private student loans, and the many \nquestions raised by the qualified mortgage final rule.\n  The Dodd-Frank solution was to have the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil review certain CFPB actions, but it set the threshold at two-\nthirds of the FSOC members. This very high threshold before the FSOC \ncan act renders its veto virtually meaningless.\n  Since the beginning of this year, I have encountered a number of \nitems with the CFPB that are a cause of concern and warrant greater \nscrutiny, but it is the Federal agency's data collection initiative \nthat is the most disturbing to me. Recently, we learned from press \naccounts--not from the agency but from press accounts--that the CFPB \nwas spending tens of millions of dollars to collect Americans' credit \ndata. We have learned from the recent IRS, Associated Press, and NSA \nscandals what happens when government agencies cross the line and watch \nour citizens instead of watching out for them. There is a trust deficit \nin government today.\n  During the last several months, I have raised significant concerns \nwith the CFPB's data collection efforts. I have been told that the \nBureau needs big data to level the playing field. However, the Bureau's \nefforts go far beyond simply leveling the playing field. Unfortunately, \nfor an agency that prides itself on transparency, I have encountered \nvery little concrete answers to very basic questions.\n  For example, I have asked the Bureau on three occasions to give me \ninformation on the number of Americans' credit accounts that the CFPB \nis currently monitoring. In response, the CFPB said the information was \nconfidential and could not be supplied.\n  Information coming from last week's hearing in the House Financial \nServices Committee indicates that the CFPB is undertaking unprecedented \ndata collection on possibly hundreds of millions of Americans' \naccounts, possibly as many as 900 million credit card accounts in the \nUnited States. The size of this data collection and the amount of money \nbeing spent by the agency are a cause of concern and should be for \nthose Americans whose financial and credit data is being sent to the \nBureau each and every single month.\n  The CFPB is collecting credit card account data, bank account data, \nmortgage data, and student loan data. In addition, the Bureau has hired \nthird parties to act as its agent to collect, aggregate, and produce \nconsumer credit data on behalf of the agency. Some contracts even \ncontain instructions to follow specific consumer accounts over time.\n  This ultimately allows the CFPB to monitor, on a monthly basis, an \nindividual consumer's financial activity. Some of the data collected \nand provided to the CFPB monthly includes account balances, ZIP Code+4 \nlocation data, the year of birth, and other demographic information. \nThus, the CFPB can know how much you owe, how much money you have, how \nmuch you pay each month, and where you live within a few blocks.\n  The Bureau has stated publicly on several occasions that it does not \ncollect personally identifiable information other than the voluntary \npersonally identifiable information consumers submit to the Consumer \nComplaint Database and in supervisory exams. However, two documents \ndrafted by the CFPB seem to raise doubts about this Federal agency's \nactions.\n  Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, the CFPB's System of Records \nNotice of November 2012 for the consumer and market research database \nstates that some of the collected data ``will be personally \nidentifiable information.'' In addition, a CFPB contract with a third \nparty data aggregator states:\n\n       Most, if not all, of the data will be confidential \n     supervisory information, and some of the data will contain \n     sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII).\n\n  Questions still remain about what type of personal information is \ncollected by the CFPB and what is collected by the agency's \ncontractors. But without the structural changes to the agency that we \nare asking for, it is hard to get answers to the question.\n  At the hearing in the House last week, a CFPB official was unable to \nstate how many agency employees have access to this enormous amount of \ncredit data. He was also unaware of any law which is used when \nemployees access the data.\n  I also question whether the Bureau has put in proper policies and \nprocedures to prevent the data from being reengineered and reverse \nengineered. I consider these to be very serious privacy concerns by the \nvery agency that was created to watch out for consumers, not to watch \nconsumers.\n  Banks constantly worry about cyber attacks. Recent news reports have \nrun stories about the Federal Reserve and the IRS being susceptible to \ncyber attacks.\n  What assurances do we have from the CFPB that these massive troves of \nconsumer credit information are safe? Data safety is particularly of \nconcern, given that both the GAO and the CFPB's inspector general have \nfound weaknesses in the CFPB data security programs and policies.\n  Because I was unable to get sufficient answers out of the CFPB, I \nturned to the Government Accountability Office and requested that it \nlook into the agency's data collection and security efforts. That \nreview is now underway.\n  With regard to the regulatory role of the agency, in the past 2 years \nthe Bureau has issued numerous new rulemakings, resulting in \nsignificant cumulative burdens for affected institutions, especially \nsmall and community banks that often only have a handful of employees. \nRemember, there is no board directing this agency. There is no board to \nwhom the Director of the agency responds. One single individual has \nbeen given the authority in this statute, without oversight by Congress \nof his or her budget, to single-handedly issue rules and regulations.\n  In the span of 10 days this past January, the CFPB issued more than \n3,500 pages of final rules affecting mortgage markets and other \nindustries. This represents more than 1 million total words of \nregulatory text. When I asked at an April hearing about the \noverwhelming number of regulations the Bureau issued in 1 single month, \nI was told that there were ``less than 100 pages of rules'' when \ntranslated into the Federal Register.\n  Well, 100 pages of rules is a lot, but this ignores the more than \n2,500 pages of guidance, analysis, and interpretations--which are all \nadmissible in court--and all of which are required reading for anyone \nwho has to comply with this complex web of rules.\n\n[[Page S5704]]\n\n  In order to understand and comply with these regulations, \ninstitutions are forced to hire lawyers and compliance officers, tying \nup resources that could be better spent on growing business, creating \njobs, and boosting the economy. Again, recall that the connection \nbetween safety and soundness regulations was severed with the creation \nof this agency.\n  Instead, these additional compliance costs are inevitably passed on \nto the consumers, which is especially harmful during a time of high \nunemployment and sluggish economic growth. If we were convinced that \nthe agency was at least protecting consumers rather than collecting \ndata on all individual Americans who have credit cards, student loans, \nmortgages, or bank accounts, then perhaps we could at least engage in a \ndiscussion or a debate about whether the agency's actions are \nappropriate and effective.\n  I am concerned that without the strong cost-benefit analysis and \ninput from the small business panels in crafting rules, even well-\nintentioned rules could make consumer credit more expensive and less \naffordable.\n  Another concern I have with the CFPB is the enactment of policy \nchanges outside of the established notice-and-comment rulemaking \nprocess.\n  In March, the CFPB posted a legal bulletin on its blog instructing \nauto lenders to adjust compensation practices to avoid violating fair \nlending laws. The bulletin includes significant legal interpretations \nand suggests that the Bureau may utilize its enforcement powers to \nensure that lenders adhere to its guidance.\n  The only example the CFPB uses in this bulletin on how auto lenders \ncan effectively comply with fair lending laws is flat pricing, as is \ninterpreted by many, that any other type of pricing will be a clear \nviolation in the CFPB's eyes. If the CFPB intends to make major policy \nchanges, then it needs to go through a regular notice-and-comment \nrulemaking, not a blog post.\n  This bulletin also, frankly, represents a backdoor attempt by the \nCFPB to regulate auto dealers, a group that is explicitly exempted from \nthe CFPB's regulatory purview by the Dodd-Frank legislation that \ncreated the agency, in what appears to be yet another example of CFPB's \noverreach.\n  In conclusion, I will continue to work toward oversight of the agency \nto ensure accountability and transparency for the American people. \nThose who are trying to paint our demands as being extraordinary need \nto look at the extraordinary data collection and actions of this agency \nand look at our regulatory landscape with similarly situated financial \nregulators.\n  Those who are trying to portray these demands as another attempt to \nwater down consumer protection need to realize that consumer protection \ndivested from safety and soundness does not make for a better financial \nsystem or for greater benefit to consumers.\n  We found in our review of the CFPB that the agency does have serious \nproblems in a number of different areas. The lack of prompt and \ncomplete responses from the agency regarding its big data collection of \nAmericans' credit accounts is very troubling but is indicative of the \nlack of transparency established when this agency was created.\n  The expenditure of nearly $100 million for building renovations is \nextremely troubling in these tight economic times.\n  While the confirmation of the nominee is now all but certain, there \nremains significant work and oversight to ensure the CFPB is an \naccountable agency and that it is transparent in its actions for all \nAmericans to see.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, did my friend from Idaho suggest the absence \nof a quorum?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, he did not.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will talk for a minute about the National \nLabor Relations Board nominees.\n  The NLRB has helped to protect the rights and safety of workers for \nabout 80 years. It is a vitally important watchdog for working \nAmericans. It is also important for employers. It also protects \nemployers. But unless we act before the Senate recess in August, the \nNLRB will lose its ability to operate. It will fail to have a quorum so \nit can't work or be effective. So the confirmation of full membership \nat the NLRB is a priority.\n  I understand Republican Senators were frustrated by President Obama's \nrecess appointment of two members to the NLRB. I accept that. No one \nhas raised any questions, however, about these two good people--Griffin \nand Block. They are fine public servants and the record should be \nspread with that fact. Republicans have insisted on the President's \nnominating new people, and he has done that. It is a right they have, \nand this is a compromise that was reached.\n  Republican Senators have also committed that the Senate will confirm \nthese new nominees quickly, certainly before the end of this month--the \nmonth of July. To that end, I met earlier with Senators Harkin and \nLamar Alexander, the chairman and ranking member of that big HELP \nCommittee, and they have given me their word they are going to file a \nnotice tonight that the committee will hold a hearing on these nominees \non Tuesday, they will then have a markup on Wednesday, and we intend to \nturn to these nominees next Thursday.\n  I have talked with the people at the White House, and I am confident \nthese nominees will be staunch advocates for the NLRB--for the rights \nand safety of workers, and for employers that are also protected with \nthis legislation. So when the Senate confirms them, the NLRB will once \nagain have a full team to protect the rights of workers--the workers in \nWest Virginia, workers in Nevada, and all over the country--the same \nthing they have done for 80 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motions with \nrespect to Calendar Nos. 100, 101, and 104 be withdrawn; that the vote \non the confirmation of the Cordray nomination occur at 5 p.m. today; \nthat if the nomination is confirmed, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate; that no further motions be in order; that any related \nstatements be printed in the Record; and President Obama be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action; finally, that the vote on the motion \nto invoke cloture on the Hochberg nomination occur at 10 a.m. tomorrow, \nWednesday, July 17.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Richard Cordray, of Ohio, to be Director, Bureau of Consumer \nFinancial Protection?\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Madam President, in the years leading up to the financial \ncrisis, the biggest banks and lenders created new ways to make record \nprofits off of consumers. They made predatory loans to working-class \nfamilies, created prepaid cards with exploitative fees, and gave out \nstudent loans to first-generation college students with interest rates \nsometimes as high as 20 percent.\n  Today millions of consumers are still trying to recover from these \nunscrupulous practices while companies keep looking for new ways to \nincrease their profits at the expense of these consumers. Congress \ncreated the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect Americans \nfrom consumer fraud and abusive fees and products.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for her role in this before she came to \nthe Senate.\n  More than 700 days since its creation, American citizens are now just \ngetting to vote for a consumer watchdog to head the organization. \nBecause of the CFPB, consumers can now decipher credit card \napplications and have help correcting erroneous credit reports.\n  Because of these successes, confirming Richard Cordray as the \nDirector was right. We know where he stands. We know for whom he \nstands--as a strong advocate for consumers, families, and small \nbusinesses.\n  No one doubted Richard Cordray's qualifications or temperament for \nthe job. This is the first time in American history when one party \nrefused to confirm a nominee because they didn't like the agency. A \nterrible precedent was being set. Thankfully a number of our colleagues \nunderstood--as we discussed last night--it was important to move past \nthat.\n  Richard Cordray served as Ohio's first State solicitor. He \nrepresented the U.S. Government before the Supreme Court. He has been \nelected the attorney general and State treasurer of Ohio. He has \nreceived bipartisan accolades and support from Ohio's business and \nconsumer groups.\n  Let me share a bit of a letter written by a Republican Member of \nCongress from my home State, Representative Steve Stivers.\n\n       Rich has always proven himself hardworking, collaborative, \n     and pragmatic.\n       If you take the time [. . .] to evaluate Rich's character \n     and disposition, you will find him to be an individual who \n     listens to your opinion and seeks mutually acceptable \n     solutions.\n\n  Representative Stivers is right. Under Cordray's leadership, the \nBureau has earned praise from industry and consumer groups alike for \nthe rules it has come up with. It has already recovered millions of \ndollars for consumers from credit card companies, credit repair \ncompanies, and others. That is why consumers won a victory today and \nshould be happy that the 2-year-long process that has prevented Richard \nCordray from being considered has finally come to an end and we can now \nmove forward.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/16/senate-section/article/S5705-5", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5705-S5706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO EDWARD EARL GIDCUMB\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished Kentuckian who is looked up to and admired by many in the \nCommonwealth for his character and his service to our country: Mr. \nEdward Earl Gidcumb. Mr. Gidcumb, or ``Earl'' to his friends, \ncelebrates his 88th birthday this July 31. He served America during \nWorld War II as a storekeeper, second class, in the U.S. Navy, and \nsurvived some harrowing experiences.\n  Earl's story is commemorated in a book titled ``WWII DC: The Long \nOverdue Journey,'' which details the experiences of World War II \nveterans from Kentucky and describes a trip made by these Kentucky \nveterans to the Nation's capital in 2004 to visit the National World \nWar II Memorial. Earl still is an active participant in the Kentucky \nveterans community as one of the few buglers left in western Kentucky; \nhe plays taps at military funerals and civic events. Earl also \ncontributed to the establishment of the Kentucky Veterans and Patriots \nMuseum in Wickliffe, Kentucky.\n  Earl was a high-school student when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor \non December 7, 1941. He graduated from high school on May 23 of 1943; \non May 25, he was sworn into Naval service in Marion, IL.\n  Earl underwent training in Chicago and then served aboard several \nvessels, the first of which, the U.S. Navy ship LST 218, was bound for \nPearl Harbor. Earl recalls, ``water supply was very short and we took \nsalt-water baths using a special soap for bathing in salt water. We \nslept in bunks stacked six high and down below the main deck . . . I \nstarted out in the Atlantic Ocean and ended up on the Pacific Ocean.''\n  Earl spent time in Pearl Harbor before being posted to the USS \nIndianapolis CA 35, a heavy cruiser. He received five battle stars \nwhile serving on the Indianapolis for 10 months. A few months after \nbeing transferred off that ship, the Indianapolis was sunk by a \nJapanese submarine.\n  ``I would not be here today if I had remained aboard the Indy,'' Earl \nsays. ``The second torpedo of the two that sunk it hit the part of the \nship where I slept each night. There [were] 1,196 aboard, 800 went down \nwith the ship, [and] 317 survived after several days in the water. Some \ndied from their wounds, some were eaten by sharks,\n\n[[Page S5706]]\n\nand the balance drowned. It was the Navy's worst naval disaster.''\n  Earl was transferred to Oregon, where he was joined by his wife, Jean \nMoore. Earl and Jean were high-school sweethearts and got married when \nEarl went home on 30 days' leave. After 45 years of marriage, sadly, \nJean passed away in 1989.\n  Earl was reassigned again, this time to the USS Bottineau APA 235, a \ntroop carrier. The ship went to Japan not long after the dropping of \natomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They received occupation troops \nfrom Honshu, Japan. Earl earned another battle star for an encounter \nwith a Japanese suicide plane in Okinawa Bay. After 2 years, 8 months, \nand 9 days of faithful service, Earl was discharged in 1946.\n  Looking back nearly 70 years later, Earl recalls the lessons he's \nlearned. ``I was only 17 when I entered service,'' he says. ``I had no \nidea what I was facing . . . I had no reason to be scared.''\n  ``I saw men put in LCVP vessels and sent to do battle on the beach to \ntake the island back from the Japanese. I saw some of the same men \nbrought back in body bags. I saw 450 Japanese planes shot down in the \nBattle of the Philippine Sea, all in one day. I saw a Japanese Zero so \nclose I could see the orange Japanese flag on the side of the plane. I \nsaw body parts of Japanese soldiers scattered everywhere when I went \nover the Island of Tarawa. We lost 8,000 Marines of our own. This was \nmy first battle.''\n  Madam President, I am grateful heroes like Mr. Edward Earl Gidcumb \nare still able to transmit their wisdom and share their stories with \nthe rest of us. The life story of Mr. Gidcumb is certainly inspiring. I \nknow my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in thanking him for his \nvaliant service to our country. It is thanks to him and his fellow \nsoldiers that America was able to triumph in World War II and advance \nfreedom and democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/16/senate-section/article/S5706-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMBATING PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, last week I introduced The Combating \nPrescription Drug Abuse Act, a bill to create a commission to recommend \nbest practices for preventing and reducing prescription drug abuse. I \nbelieve this bill is a necessary step in addressing our Nation's \nfastest-growing drug problem, which has been classified as an epidemic \nby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  An estimated 52 million people--20 percent of those aged 12 and \nolder--have used prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons at least \nonce in their lifetimes. Nearly one-third of people aged 12 and over \nwho used illicit drugs for the first time in 2009 began by abusing a \nprescription drug. In 2008, the number of opioid pain reliever deaths \nthroughout our population was four times higher than cocaine and heroin \ndeaths combined.\n  This epidemic ruins the lives of all segments of our population, and \nthe problem is only getting worse, especially for women. Men are still \nmore likely to die of prescription painkiller overdoses--over 10,000 \ndeaths in 2010--but women are tragically catching up. A Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention survey earlier this month found a 400 \npercent increase in women dying from prescription painkiller overdoses \nbetween 1999 and 2010, compared to 265 percent among men. During that \ntime, nearly 48,000 women died of prescription painkiller overdoses. In \n2010, prescription drugs were involved in 85 percent of the drug-\nspecified deaths among women. And for every woman who dies of a \nprescription painkiller overdose, 30 go to the emergency room with \nrelated complications.\n  I applaud the unyielding work of the law enforcement and health \nprovider communities in working to address this epidemic, but it is \nclear that we need to do more. My bill would create a 2-year, 30-member \ncommission led by the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency and Food and Drug \nAdministration tasked with issuing recommendations on how best to \nreduce prescription drug abuse.\n  Other members of the commission include representatives from law \nenforcement, patient groups, pharmacies, dispensers, and community-\nbased organizations, just to name a few. Importantly, both local and \nFederal stakeholders must be included, from both law enforcement and \nhealth care. The commission would be required to hold at least two \npublic hearings to receive input on best practices. The end product \nwould be a report requiring specific recommendations, and again, local \ninput is mandatory.\n  The time has come to revive the conversation on this critical issue \nwithin and among our law enforcement and health care communities and \nacross the Federal/local divide. I am proud that support for this bill \nis broad, ranging from the National Association of Drug Diversion \nInvestigators and the Peace Officers Research Association of \nCalifornia, to the American Academy of Pain Management and the National \nAssociation of Chain Drug Stores. I urge my colleagues to support the \nCombating Prescription Drug Abuse Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/16/senate-section/article/S5706-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL LAKE APPRECIATION MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, July is National Lake Appreciation \nMonth. This nationwide initiative is sponsored by the North American \nLake Management Society, a non-profit organization focused on making \npartnerships between citizens, scientists, and professionals to protect \nour Nation's lakes and reservoirs. National Lake Appreciation Month \nbegan in 2012 as a way to encourage us to explore and enjoy America's \nmany beautiful lakes, as well as increase efforts to clean and protect \nthem.\n  In addition to recreational uses such as boating, fishing, and \nswimming, lakes provide a variety of environmental and health benefits. \nThey absorb rainfall and runoff from land, help prevent floods, provide \ndrinking water, regulate the climate, and provide homes for precious \nwildlife. The Environmental Protection Agency's National Lake \nAssessment, conducted in 2007 and again in 2012, revealed that many of \nour lakes are imperiled due to poor nearshore habitat, too many \nnutrients, invasive plants and animals, and other threats. By \nprotecting the health of our lakes, we defend the vitality of the \nanimals and plants that depend on them and ensure that we can enjoy \nthem for years to come.\n  This year, Maryland has joined 23 other States in celebrating \nNational Lake Appreciation Month and in affirming the importance of \nlakes for our drinking water, energy production, food production, and \nrecreational value. Maryland boasts 60 large lakes over 5 acres in \nsize, and over 100 lakes in total. We use these lakes for fishing, \nboating, and other outdoor recreation, as well as for energy. For \nexample, Deep Creek Lake, our largest inland lake in Maryland, consists \nof 65 miles of shoreline, 18 species of fish, and a wide variety of \nother animal and plant species, some of which are endangered. The lake \nalso powers the Deep Creek Hydroelectric Power Plant, which provides \nenergy not only to Maryland, but also to communities in Pennsylvania \nand New Jersey. So far we have been able to keep this and other \nMaryland lakes healthy. In a recent test, it was found that Deep Creek \nLake's water clarity was still at a level similar to that of 1957. As \nfactors such as pollutants and runoff increasingly threaten the health \nof our lakes, it is important that we continue to work to fight against \nthem.\n  I am pleased to celebrate National Lake Appreciation Month, to \nencourage people both to enjoy America's beautiful lakes, and to do \ntheir part to keep them clean and healthy. Lakes are a very important \npart of our ecosystem in Maryland. We must continue to increase our \nefforts to care for our lakes and show our appreciation for all that \nthey provide us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/16/senate-section/article/S5706-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5706-S5707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO STEVE SCHORR\n\n Mr. HELLER.

After more than two-and-a-\nhalf decades of dedicated service to his company as well as to the \ncommunity, Steve is retiring this year. Steve not only leaves a lasting \nlegacy as a leader in broadcasting and in business, but he also enters \nretirement having made a profound impact as a civic volunteer and\n\n[[Page S5707]]\n\nphilanthropist. His many contributions to Southern Nevada's development \nand quality of life are truly remarkable and will be felt by Nevadans \nall across the State for years to come.\n  Prior to his tenure at Cox Communications, Steve established a strong \nreputation as a journalist, earning multiple Emmy Awards, two National \nFreedom Foundation Awards and an Armstrong Award for Broadcasting. He \nwas also inducted into the inaugural class of the Nevada Broadcasters \nAssociation's Hall of Fame. During his time as vice president of public \nand government affairs for Cox Communications, Steve has been a \ntireless advocate for community development and economic growth. As a \nbusiness executive, he has contributed to the expansion of his company, \nworking closely with local, State and Federal Governments on issues \nthat were critical to Nevada's private sector.\n  In addition to his commitment to excellence in broadcasting and in \nbusiness, Steve has consistently exemplified the very highest standards \nof community service. He has devoted his time to improving education in \nNevada, as an adjunct professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas \nGreenspun School of Communications. Steve Schorr Elementary School in \nLas Vegas is named in his honor. In addition, he has been honored with \nthe U.S. Department of Justice J. Pat Finley Lifetime Achievement Award \nfor his work on behalf of missing children in Southern Nevada. He also \ndevotes his time as a member of numerous civic boards and \norganizations, and has received the Governor's ``Point of Light'' Award \nfor his exceptional volunteerism.\n  I want to acknowledge and thank Steve for his many years of dedicated \nservice to Nevada as an educator, journalist, business executive and \nphilanthropist.

A bill to amend the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 \nto provide for the conduct of stewardship end result contracting \nprojects; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators McCain, Crapo, Risch, \nHeller, and myself I am pleased to introduce the Stewardship \nContracting Reauthorization and Improvement Act.\n  As we continue to search for ways to prevent future wildland fire \ntragedies, it is worth noting that the U.S. Forest Service and the \nBureau of Land Management, BLM, are about to lose one of their most \nvaluable tools in that ongoing fight.\n  The tool, known as stewardship contracting, allows the Forest Service \nand BLM--in collaboration with State and local governments, tribal \nagencies, and non-governmental organizations--to enter into contracts \nwith public or private entities to carry out a variety of land-\nmanagement projects, including those that can reduce the risk of \nwildland fire.\n  Stewardship contracts have been particularly useful in Arizona. The \nForest Service awarded the first such 10-year contract to the White \nMountain Stewardship Project in 2004, and the largest contract, the \nFour Forest Restoration Initiative, began in 2012. Unless Congress \nacts, the authority to enter into these agreements will expire at the \nend of September. Our legislation would not only extend the authority \nfor Federal agencies to enter into these agreements, but it builds on \npast experiences to make commonsense improvements.\n  For example, it would give the Forest Service and BLM flexibility \nwhen establishing cancellation ceilings. A cancellation ceiling \nrepresents the amount of money the government would have to pay its \ncontracting partner if the contract were cancelled. Typically, the \ngovernment has to obligate the full amount at the inception of the \ncontract. As noted in a 2008 GAO report, cancellation ceilings that \nrequire agencies to obligate large sums can serve as an impediment to \nlong-term landscape-scale contracts, precisely the types of agreements \nthat most significantly reduce wildfire risks.\n  Using Defense Department acquisition regulations as a model, our bill \nsolves this problem by allowing Federal agencies to obligate funds in \nstages that are economically or programmatically viable. It would also \nrequire those agencies to notify the House and Senate natural resource \ncommittees, as well as the Office of Management and Budget, if the \nagencies propose contracts that do not fully cover the cancellation \nceiling amount. Any extra value from a contract would be dedicated to \nfirst satisfying outstanding cancellation-related liabilities before \nbeing used to fund other stewardship projects. Finally, our bill \nincorporates key fire-liability provisions from timber sale contracts \ninto the stewardship model, establishing parity between the two \ninstruments.\n  Stewardship contracting and the resulting partnerships have helped \nrestore forests, reduce the risk of out-of-control wildfires, and \nprotect rural communities. I thank Senators McCain, Crapo, Risch, and \nHeller for their support and leadership. It is my hope that our \ncolleagues will act quickly to extend and improve this important land-\nmanagement tool.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1300\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the restoration of forest landscapes, \nprotection of old growth forests, and management of national forests in \nthe eastside forests of the State of Oregon; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I would like to reintroduce an \nimportant piece of forest legislation for my home State of Oregon.\n  This is legislation that I introduced in the last two Congresses. The \nlegislation gained the support of the administration through a number \nof improvements, but unfortunately it failed to get passed. I have \nsince made a few more updates and improvements as I continue talking to \nstakeholders who worked with me on this legislation. I am introducing \nthe bill today to reinvigorate the discussion and get stakeholders to \nfinalize any outstanding issues so we can finally get this bill done \nthis Congress. I am sending the message that restoring these forests in \nOregon is an urgent priority that needs to get done an I am going to \nkeep at it until this issue gets addressed\n  I am pleased that my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley has again \njoined me today in introducing this bill. He also recognizes the urgent \nneeds to restore Oregon's forests and help forest dependent communities \nand I am glad he is part of this fight.\n  Oregon's historic war over its forests restyled in gridlock that led \nto millions of acres of Oregon's Federal forest landscape containing \nchoked, overstocked stands that are at great risk of uncharacteristic \ncatastrophic fires, insect infestations and disease. The outcome of the \ndecades of conflict is very evident in Eastern Oregon's forests.\n  That is why I introduced legislation in the last two Congresses to \ntackle the challenges facing Oregon's Eastside forests and why I \nreintroduce this legislation again today.\n  The legislation I first introduced in 2009 reflected an agreement \nreached by leaders on both sides of these difficult issues Intense \nnegotiations resulted in that legislation with the goal of bringing \njobs and a healthier tomorrow to the 8.3 million acres on the 6 Federal \nforests in eastern and central Oregon. That agreement has already \nresulted in progress being made on forestry issues in Eastern Oregon. \nAlready there is more collaboration, less gridlock, more timber \nharvests and forests gradually beginning to get restored.\n  But we can't stop there. Since the last Congress, discussions and \nnegotiations with interested stakeholders have continued. Today's bill \nreflects some of those discussions as well as some of the real progress \nseen on the ground in Eastern Oregon, but it also preserves the core \nelements of the agreement that I crafted with the stakeholders to this \nagreement--a push to increase the timber produced from our national \nforests, landscape scale restoration efforts and protections for \nwatersheds and old growth.\n  Eastern Oregon today is down to only a small handful of surviving \ntimber mills. Yet those mills are urgently needed to process saw logs \nand other merchantable material from forest restoration projects. \nWithout them, there will be no restoration of Oregon's Eastside \nforests. But without far greater certainty of merchantable timber \nsupply, more mills will close.\n  That's why we not only need to introduce legislation today, we need \nto pass it this Congress. Because time is not on our side and at risk \nforests and mills won't wait forever for the perfect consensus.\n  Fortunately leaders on both sides of this issue recognize that \nOregon's forests will pay the price if more mills close. That \nrecognition is what brought us to the landmark agreement in the first \nplace.\n\n[[Page S5712]]\n\n  I expect continued discussions as the Senate process advances over \nthe best way to craft the bill to reflect current reality on the ground \nbut I want to build on the progress that has been made to this point.\n  I also want to point out that none of our efforts will succeed unless \nOregon Federal forests are also adequately funded to properly manage \nand restore these valuable Federal assets. I will fight, along with \nSenator Merkley and other stakeholders, for the funding to put our \npeople back to work and restore the health of our forests.\n  I thank the stakeholders that have continued to spend time and energy \nengaged in discussions with me on the details of this legislation. I \nknow there is further work ahead, and I look forward to working with \nthem to get the legislation ready for passage.\n  I want to also express my gratitude to Governor Kitzhaber, who also \nunderstands the importance of advancing efforts to treat and restore \nOregon's forests. He went to bat to putting state funding behind these \nefforts so I want to ensure that the Federal Government is also \nhonoring its commitment to manage these Federal treasures and be a good \nneighbor to state and private lands. I appreciate his efforts and look \nforward to continuing to work with him.\n  I am pleased to reintroduce this legislation today, and I intend to \nkeep working with all the folks in my State who are willing to talk in \ngood faith about restoring our Eastside forests. I want to continue to \nget input from stakeholders on any further revisions to the bill and \nget a final product that will pass this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Kirk, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Udall of New \n        Mexico, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1306. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 in order to improve environmental literacy to better prepare \nstudents for postsecondary education and careers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing bipartisan \nlegislation to provide support for environmental education in our \nNation's classrooms. I thank Senators Kirk, Murray, Tom Udall, Durbin, \nand Whitehouse for agreeing to be original cosponsors of the No Child \nLeft Inside Act of 2013.\n  According to the National Association for Environmental Education, 47 \nstates and the District of Columbia have taken steps towards developing \nplans to integrate environmental literacy into their statewide \neducational initiatives. In Rhode Island, organizations such as the \nRhode Island Environmental Education Association, Roger Williams Park \nZoo, Save the Bay, the Nature Conservancy, and the Audubon Society, as \nwell as countless schools and teachers, are offering educational and \noutdoor experiences that many children may never otherwise have, \nhelping inspire them to learn. In partnership with the Rhode Island \nDepartment of Education, these organizations have developed a statewide \nenvironmental literacy plan that is now being put into action.\n  Given the major environmental challenges we face today, our bill \nseeks to prioritize teaching our young people about their natural \nworld. For more than three decades, environmental education has been a \ngrowing part of effective instruction in America's schools. Responding \nto the need to improve student achievement and prepare students for the \n21st century economy, many schools throughout the Nation now offer some \nform of environmental education.\n  Yet, environmental education is facing a significant challenge, and \nremains out of reach for too many children. With many schools being \nforced to scale back or eliminate environmental programs, fewer and \nfewer students are able to take part in related classroom instruction \nand field investigations, however effective or in demand these programs \nare.\n  The No Child Left Inside Act would increase environmental literacy \namong elementary and secondary students by encouraging and providing \nassistance to states for the development and implementation of \nenvironmental literacy plans and promoting professional development for \nteachers on how to integrate environmental literacy and field \nexperiences into their instruction.\n  The legislation would also support partnerships with high-need school \ndistricts to initiate, expand, or improve their environmental education \ncurriculum, and for replication and dissemination of effective \npractices. Finally, the legislation would support interagency \ncoordination and reporting on environmental education opportunities \nacross the Federal Government. This legislation has broad support among \nnational and State environmental and educational groups.\n  The American public recognizes that the environment is a central \nissue to our future health and well-being. In the private sector, \nbusiness leaders also increasingly believe that an environmentally \nliterate workforce is critical to their long-term success.

Madam President, last week a letter was sent to majority \nleader Harry Reid and minority leader Nancy Pelosi of the House of \nRepresentatives, and I wish to read a few quotes from that letter. It \nsays:\n\n       When you and the President sought our support for the \n     Affordable Care Act, you pledged that if we liked the health \n     plans we have now, we could keep them. Sadly, that promise is \n     under threat. Right now, unless you--\n\n  Directed at the majority leader and the minority leader in the \nHouse--\n\n     and the Obama Administration enact an equitable fix, the \n     ACA--\n\n  Or the Affordable Care Act, which some people refer to as \n``ObamaCare''--\n\n     will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but \n     destroy the foundation of the 40 hour work week that is the \n     backbone of the American middle class.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       Since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, we have been \n     bringing our deep concerns to the Administration, seeking \n     reasonable regulatory interpretations to the statute that \n     would help prevent the destruction of non-profit health \n     plans. As you both know first-hand, our persuasive arguments \n     have been disregarded and met with a stone wall by the White \n     House and by the pertinent agencies.\n\n  This is a letter that was, as I said, sent last week to the leaders \nin the House and in the Senate. I wish to quote a few more passages \nfrom that letter.\n\n       We have a problem; you need to fix it. The unintended \n     consequences of the Affordable Care Act are severe. Perverse \n     incentives are already creating nightmare scenarios.\n       First, the law creates an incentive for employers to keep \n     employees' work hours below 30 hours a week. Numerous \n     employers have begun to cut workers' hours to avoid this \n     obligation, and many of them are doing so openly. The impact \n     is twofold: fewer hours means less pay while also losing our \n     current health benefits.\n\n  The summary of the letter at the end says:\n\n       On behalf of the millions of working men and women we \n     represent and the families they support, we can no longer \n     stand silent in the face of elements of the Affordable Care \n     Act that will destroy the very health and wellbeing of our \n     members along with millions of other hardworking Americans.\n\n  So when we look at this letter and the tone of the letter and some of \nthe statements made in the letter, we see that it talks about \ndestroying the health benefits of employees. It talks about nightmare \nscenarios being created by perverse incentives in the Affordable Care \nAct. As I said before, it says the Affordable Care Act will shatter not \nonly our hard-earned health benefits but destroy the foundation of the \n40-hour workweek that is the backbone of the American middle class.\n  If my colleagues are wondering who sent the letter--one might think \nit came from the National Federation of Independent Business or perhaps \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, the chamber of commerce, or \nsome business group that obviously has major concerns and issues with \nthe implementation of ObamaCare. But that letter came from Mr. James \nHoffa, who is the general president of the International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters; it was cosigned by Joseph Hansen, the international \npresident of the UFCW, and by D. Taylor, the president of UNITE-HERE--\nthree major union organizations that are very concerned\n\n[[Page S5714]]\n\nabout ObamaCare and its implementation and what it is going to mean to \nthe health care benefits many of their members already enjoy, as well \nas what it will do to wreck the 40-hour workweek that is, as they \ndescribe, the backbone of the American middle class.\n  So the list goes on of those who have deep and abiding concerns about \nthe adverse and harmful impacts of ObamaCare as we approach the \nimplementation stage the first of next year.\n  As we know, last week the administration announced they were going to \ndelay the implementation of the employer mandate. I think many of us \nreceived that news as welcome news because we have argued that many of \nthe penalties associated with the legislation and its implementation \nare going to be very harmful to job creation and to economic growth and \nthat we are going to see more and more employers starting not only to \nnot hire people but actually to reduce the size of the workforce. In \nfact, a survey of employers around the country suggested that 40 \npercent of them were, in fact, doing that. They were not hiring new \npeople. Also, 20 percent of the employers in this country were actually \nreducing--laying people off--because of the concerns about the mandates \nincluded in ObamaCare.\n  So the administration reacted to that by saying: OK, we have been \nlistening to you. We hear you. We are going to delay the employer \nmandate.\n  That is the penalty attached if employers don't offer a government-\napproved health plan with lots of bells and whistles and things in it--\nthings that they didn't believe they could afford. So we get the 1-year \ntemporary relief from that.\n  But I think the question that has to then be asked of the \nadministration is this: If you are going to provide relief from the \nemployer mandate, what about everybody else? What about all of the \nother Americans who are going to be impacted and harmed? What about the \nindividual mandate where we have 6 million Americans who are, when it \nis fully implemented, going to be faced with a tax of about $1,200?\n  We have all kinds of families across this country who are seeing, \nbecause of the higher taxes and many of the mandates associated with \nthe legislation already, higher premiums. In fact, when the President \ntook office, he promised he was going to reduce premiums for families \nin this country by $2,500. Well, according to the Kaiser study--and \nthey track premiums--since the President has taken office, health \ninsurance premiums for families in this country have actually increased \nby $2,500. So when the President made the argument that he would lower \ninsurance premiums for families in this country by $2,500, just the \nopposite has happened. We have seen premiums actually go up. I think \npremiums are going to continue to go up as this becomes implemented and \nbecomes, ultimately, the law of the land.\n  A lot of my colleagues on the other side have said: Why do you guys \nkeep complaining about this? It is the law of the land. In fact, it is \nthe law of the land, which I think begs the question of, why is the \nadministration not enforcing it? Why has the administration been \ndelaying implementation of ObamaCare, at least as it pertains to the \nemployer mandate?\n  I think there are a lot of obvious reasons for that. They got tired \nof hearing about the adverse impacts it was having on the economy and \nhaving on jobs. We saw the jobs numbers from the month of June, and the \nnumber of people who have been pushed into part-time jobs was actually, \nin the month of June, up by 322,000 individuals.\n  In other words, what we are seeing is that a lot of people who were \npreviously full-time workers and who want to work full-time in our \neconomy are being pushed into part-time jobs. Why is that happening? \nWell, at least one of the reasons, I would argue, is that under \nObamaCare the requirements that apply to employers apply to full-time \nworkers. So if an employer doesn't have full-time workers--and the law \ndefines that as 30 hours a week--if an employer doesn't have people \nworking more than 30 hours a week, they are not covered by the mandates \nin the legislation. So what are many employers doing? Many employers \nwere then cutting the hours of their employees to get under that 30-\nhour threshold so they wouldn't be hit with these costly new mandates.\n  What does that mean for the average family in this country? It means \nthat fewer and fewer people have full-time jobs, higher take-home pay, \nand more and more Americans are having to do part-time work--probably \nfinding two part-time jobs to help pay the bills. That is a crushing \neffect on an economy that is already struggling to recover. A lot of \npeople who I would argue want to get back into the workforce are trying \nto find full-time work and are being met with resistance from employers \nbecause employers are having to deal with these costly mandates \nincluded in the Affordable Care Act.\n  So if we look at the effect, the net result so far of ObamaCare, \nwhich, again--we have mentioned this many times here--is 2,700 pages in \nterms of legislation and 20,000 pages of regulations--in fact, the size \nof the stack of regulations is now 7\\1/2\\ feet tall, so it is about a \nfoot taller than I am. Just last week another 606 pages of regulations \nwere issued in terms of the implementation of this law. Can we imagine \naverage Americans trying to comply with 20,000 pages of regulations or, \nfor that matter, businesses trying to comply with them?\n  There is so much uncertainty associated with this law and the impact \nit is going to have and fears about the impact it is going to have, and \nnothing is being done to make that any easier for most Americans. It \nwas made easier for employers last week when the penalty for the \nemployer mandate was delayed by 1 year.\n  We believe that if they are going to delay the employer mandate for a \nyear, we ought to delay the implementation of this law for everybody \nand not just do it for a year. Let's do it permanently. Let's start \nover. Let's do this the right way. It didn't take a 2,700-page bill, it \ndidn't take 20,000 pages of regulations, it didn't take a government \ntakeover of one-sixth of our economy to try to solve the problems and \nthe challenges we have in our health care system today. Yet that was \nthe solution the President and our Democratic colleagues in Congress \ncame up with. As a consequence, we have higher taxes, we have higher \npremiums, we have fewer jobs, and we have lower take-home pay for many \nAmericans.\n  I wish to point out in terms of the issue of premiums even the \nadministration has acknowledged that some people are going to see their \npremiums rise under the health care reform law. There are estimates \nfrom the Society of Actuaries study that was released in 2013 that \nshowed the State of Ohio's current average cost to cover medical \nexpenses for an individual health insurance plan to be $223.\n  Based on the proposals submitted to the Department, the average to \ncover those costs in 2014 under ObamaCare is going to be $420, \nrepresenting an increase of 88 percent when compared to--this is a \nstudy of actuaries--their study. So an 88-percent increase in the State \nof Ohio. That, of course, again was in the individual health care \nmarket.\n  There have been studies done that suggest that the Federal health \ncare law, the Affordable Care Act or, as I said, ObamaCare could nearly \ntriple premiums for some young and healthy men. The premium for a \nrelatively bare bones policy for a 27-year-old male nonsmoker in the \nindividual market would be nearly 190 percent higher.\n  So I do not think many of the people who are going to be impacted \nhave seen the full impact yet. But when it is fully implemented, there \nare going to be lots of other impacts on premiums, adverse impacts on \npeople in this country, especially in the individual market. As I \nmentioned earlier, we have already seen significant increases in \npremiums with regard to families.\n  So if we look at this thing and sort of assess where we are today, \nnot too far, just a few months away from what is alleged to be the full \nimplementation of this--of course, now with the exception of the \nemployer mandate--I think we can come to one very simple conclusion; \nthat is, that the result has led to fewer jobs, it has led to more \npeople being pushed into part-time work as opposed to full-time jobs, \nand therefore lower take-home pay for middle-class Americans. It has \nled to higher premiums. We are already seeing the effect of that with \nregard to premiums that are being paid by families and those who have \nto buy their insurance in the individual marketplace.\n\n[[Page S5715]]\n\n  We know there are lots of higher taxes in the legislation. If we look \nat the impact on many people who provide health care services, the \nmedical device manufacturers have a big tax they are dealing with, \npharmaceutical companies, health insurance plans--we can go right down \nthe list. All of those new taxes are going to get passed on, in many \ncases passed on to people who are not high-income earners but middle-\nclass Americans who are trying to keep their heads above water and keep \nhealth care coverage for their family.\n  These are the real-world impacts of ObamaCare as we know it today. \nThat is why I think we see, even organizations that are very \nsympathetic to the President, very sympathetic to his agenda, fans of \nhis agenda, people who worked very hard to get him elected in office--\nthe labor unions in their letter make that argument, that they worked \nvery hard. They walked the neighborhoods. They did all of the \ngrassroots organizing that was necessary to get the President elected. \nHere they are reacting to the Affordable Care Act, to ObamaCare, in the \nsame way I think most Americans are.\n  That is why we consistently see public opinion polls that are very \nnegative toward the law. In fact, there was a Rasmussen survey recently \nthat said 55 percent of Americans disapprove of the law, 39 percent are \nin favor of it. But a significant and decisive majority of Americans \nbelieve this is going to be bad for them, bad for their own personal \nsituation, finances, when it comes to covering their families but also \nbad for the economy and bad for jobs.\n  Higher premiums, higher taxes, fewer jobs, more part-time jobs, fewer \nfull-time jobs, lower take-home pay, that is what we today know as \nObamaCare. There is a better way. We could go back and start over, do \nthis the right way; step-by-step, incrementally, deal with the \nchallenges that we have in our health care system, and there are many \nof them. But it did not take a massive takeover of one-sixth of the \nAmerican economy, a massive new government program, 2,700 pages of \nlegislation, over 20,000 pages of new regulations in terms of \nimplementation to solve the challenges we have in our health care \nsystem today.\n  There is a better way. I hope the feedback, if you will, the response \nthat the President and his team are getting, not only now from those \npeople who were opposed to it--many of us were arguing when this was \nbeing debated in the Senate that this, in fact, would be the impact. We \ntalked about the impact on premiums because of the mandates and the new \ntaxes. We talked about the taxes. We talked about the impact on the \neconomy and jobs and pointed out that this was going to have an \nadverse, harmful impact on the ability of our economy to create jobs \nand to get that unemployment rate down and get people back to work in \nthis country.\n  Many of us were working those arguments. Many of the organizations \nthat were opposed to the legislation were saying the same things. Now \nwe have those who were actually endorsing and in favor of the \nlegislation coming out and saying it would shatter not only our hard-\nearned health benefits but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work \nweek that is the backbone of the American middle class. Perverse \nincentives are already creating nightmare scenarios.\n  That is what is included in the letter that was submitted last week \nto the leaders in the Congress, written by major labor organizations in \nthis country. Those are not rightwing conservatives, rightwing \nRepublicans who are reacting this way to ObamaCare; these are allies of \nthe President who have realized and come to the conclusion that this is \nincredibly problematic, not only for them and their members and the \nemployees of a lot of companies out there with regard to the current \nhealth care benefits that they already have but also what it means for \nthe 40-hour work week and what it means for the take-home pay for \nmiddle-class Americans across this country.\n  We can do better. We should do better. It is not too late. It is \nnever too late to do the right thing. I hope that as more and more of \nthis anecdotal and empirical evidence comes forward about the \nimplementation of this legislation, we will do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/16/senate-section/article/S5715-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
