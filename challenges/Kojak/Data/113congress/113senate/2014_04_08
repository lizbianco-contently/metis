The clerk will read the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2575) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to repeal the 30-hour threshold for classification of a \n     full-time employee for purposes of the employer mandate in \n     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and replace it \n     with 40 hours.\n\n  Mr. REID. I object to any further proceedings at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be \nplaced on the calendar.\n\n\n                             Equal Pay Day\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Ralph Waldo Emerson said this: ``America is \nanother name for opportunity.''\n  ``America is another name for opportunity.''\n  Today this body, the Senate, should put Emerson's words to the test \nas we turn attention to the question of equal pay. For working American \nwomen, millions of whom are primary wage earners for their families, \nthe Paycheck Fairness Act represents a unique opportunity, a chance to \nbetter provide for themselves and their families.\n  It is unconscionable that American women currently take home an \naverage of 77 cents for every dollar their male colleagues earn for \ndoing the exact same work. Wage disparity is true regardless of whether \na woman has a college degree, what job she holds or how many hours she \nspends at the office or factory or wherever it might be.\n  Consider this just for a brief moment: For a woman to make the same \nsalary as a man in 1 year for doing similar work in America, she must \nwork not only that year but also an additional 3 months and 8 days. \nThat is why today, April 8, the eighth day of the fourth month, is \nEqual Pay Day. It represents the extra work American women have to put \nforth to provide for their families. This is an injustice and should \nnot be permitted to take place in America. While President Obama and \nDemocrats have made significant progress toward helping women achieve \nequal pay, there is still much for us to do.\n  Five years ago the very first law President Obama ever signed, the \nfirst act he performed in the Oval Office, was to sign the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act. Remember, this is the legislation based on the \ngood woman who found out--after having worked at this place for so many \nyears, having additional responsibilities than all the men--they were \nall getting paid much more than she. She was the boss getting paid less \nthan the people who worked for her. Why? Because she is a woman.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter legislation is the biggest step Congress has \ntaken on behalf of women to help them with their wages since the Equal \nPay Act of 1963. The bill provides that the statute of limitations \ndoesn't begin to run until someone finds out they are being cheated by \ntheir employer. The legislation helped address the pay gap, but women \nstill suffer from discriminatory wage disparity.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act goes a step further by providing \nprotections for women in the workplace. This legislation addresses \nunequal wages by empowering women to negotiate for equal pay and giving \nemployers incentives to obey current law.\n  I was happy to hear all the news accounts that I was able to be \nbriefed on--along with those I listened to on public radio while I was \ndoing my exercises--the detailed accounts about how\n\n[[Page S2204]]\n\nwomen are not treated fairly. The legislation we are working on enables \nwomen to fight against wage discrimination while also preventing \nretaliation against employees who discuss salary information. Before \nLilly Ledbetter and even today if you discuss what someone else makes \nyou can be fired. That is the way it is in most places in America. It \nwould finally give much needed assistance to victims of gender-based \npay discrimination.\n  Simply put, the Paycheck Fairness Act gives American women the fair \nshot they deserve. Unfortunately, efforts to address this issue have \nnot been well received by Republicans. A similar bill addressing equal \npay--despite a Republican filibuster--passed Congress and the Congress \nbefore that. Let's hope the third time is a charm for American women. \nLet's hope Republicans will finally do what is right.\n  In any other circumstance Republicans would be up in arms with this \ntype of economic discrimination--I would hope. They should be up in \narms in terms of equal pay for women also. Why is it that so many \nRepublicans are content to allow women working the same hours in the \nsame job to make less money than their male coworkers? It is hard to \ncomprehend, since women make up nearly half the U.S. labor force and \nmore than half of the people enrolled in college. We are finding that \nthe majority of students enrolled in professional schools, law schools, \nmedical schools are women. Is it reasonable to assume that women should \nbe treated unfairly? Is it reasonable to assume that Republicans in \nthis body have wives, daughters or sisters who are or will be affected \nby this wage disparity and shouldn't we do something about it?\n  I urge my colleagues to keep those loved ones--people such as my \ndaughter and my many granddaughters--in their minds and in their \nthoughts when considering the question of equal pay for women. We will \nhave the first vote the day after tomorrow. We will have this vote. To \ndo otherwise would simply be unfair.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                        NCAA Championship Kudos\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to take a minute to congratulate \nthe Kentucky Wildcats for an extraordinary season. My home State has \nheld on to the NCAA national championship trophy for the past 2 years, \nwith the Louisville Cardinals claiming it last year and the Kentucky \nWildcats winning it in 2012. John Calipari's young Wildcats started \nfive freshmen who played like seasoned veterans and made an incredible \nrun that captivated both our State and the Nation.\n  While the Commonwealth will now relinquish the trophy to Connecticut, \nI only ask that my colleagues, Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal, \nsee to it that the trophy remains in pristine condition--pristine \ncondition--as my State will undoubtedly reclaim it next year.\n\n\n                         Job Creation Solutions\n\n  Mr. President, America's middle class is struggling. They need \nserious job creation solutions, but that is not what they have been \ngetting from the President. He seems more intent on staging campaign-\nstyle rallies to bemoan an economy he has been presiding over for the \nlast 5\\1/2\\ years, not to offer solutions but more to do what he does \nbest, which is to shift the blame to others.\n  Meanwhile, yesterday in the Senate Republicans were hoping the \nmajority leader would finally work with us to pass a job creation \npackage that contains ideas from many of our Members--legislation with \nprovisions several key Democrats support as well--but that is not what \nthe majority leader chose to do. Instead of focusing on jobs, he \nlaunched into another confusing attack on the left's latest bizarre \nobsession.\n  Think about that. The percentage of Americans in the workforce is \nalmost at a four-decade low, and Democrats chose to ignore serious job \ncreation ideas so they could blow a few kisses to their powerful pals \non the left.\n  At a time when so many Americans are desperate--desperate for a good \njob, at a time of fewer opportunities, people are hurting, college \ngraduates cannot find a job, working families cannot afford to pay \ntheir bills--what Americans need right now are real job creation \nsolutions, not some tone-deaf, blame-deflection rally or some daily \nbout of shadow boxing on the Senate floor.\n  Some say this is all embarrassing, but there is one positive side to \nthe Washington Democrats' never-ending political road show. It throws \nthe divide between the two parties into stark relief. On the one side \nwe have a Washington Democratic Party that simply has run out of ideas. \nWhen it comes to fixing the economy, they have tried just about \neverything their ideology will allow: taxing, regulating, spending, \nstimulating, you name it, and none of it has worked. So at this point \nthey have basically dropped any pretense of doing anything serious on \nthe economy. That is why we heard them essentially admit that their \ngoverning agenda is actually a political document drafted by campaign \nstaff, that the proposals it contains are basically just show votes \ndesigned specifically not to pass. So that is one side of American \npolitics: a party that is out of ideas, campaign-obsessed, and utterly \nbeholden to the far left.\n  On the other side we have a Republican Party that is committed to \ngetting our economy working for the middle class. We believe in the \npower of ideas, and we know that with the right forward-looking \npolicies we can and will break through the stagnation of the Obama \neconomy. The Republicans' focus is on offering more opportunity to the \nmiddle class and those who aspire to it. Our focus is on offering \ninnovative ways to generate the kind of stable, well-paying jobs that \nAmericans actually want. We also know we can get more done as a country \nif both parties can work together to see these policies through and \nleave behind the sterile campaign theatrics that have been on daily \ndisplay in the Senate under the Democratic majority.\n  I am asking our Democratic colleagues to consider dropping all the \nshow votes, the blame deflecting, and the perpetual campaigning. What I \nam asking is for them to consider shifting from policies that don't \nwork--in other words, what they have been trying for the last 5\\1/2\\ \nyears--to ones that will. Every Senator was sent here to get things \ndone for our constituents, and we can. We can pass a positive jobs \nagenda for the American people. All we need is for Washington Democrats \nto work with us for a change.\n\n  I have one other item. This morning IRS Commissioner Koskin will \ntestify before the Finance Committee. I am sure Members will be \nreminding him of this, and I know several sent a letter yesterday too. \nBut I would like to underline the point. Commissioner Koskin led \nCongress to believe that his agency will not be imposing anti-free \nspeech rules before this November's election. It is a point he \nbasically reiterated again just the other day, so Congress plans to \nhold him to what he has been leading the American people to believe.\n  Honestly, what he really needs to do is to stop the IRS from stepping \non the First Amendment all together. He needs to stop this proposed \nregulation just as the Secretary of the Treasury told us he could do if \nhe wanted. In fact, the House of Representatives recently voted to halt \nit too.\n  Remember, tens of thousands of Americans made their opinions known \ndirectly to the IRS about this regulation. It was an unprecedented \nresponse and nearly all of the comments were opposed. The comments came \nfrom straight across the political spectrum.\n  Commissioner Koskin needs to live up to what we told the Senate when \nwe confirmed him when he led us to believe he would be an independent \nvoice for reform. As I said before, Commissioner Koskin has a choice. \nHe can be a hero--like the IRS commissioner who stood up to President \nNixon--or he can be another pawn of this administration. Both Congress \nand the American people expect him to make the right decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2204-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my wife and I are blessed with a son and \ndaughter who are good people, hard workers with good values. We \nbasically believe the following: If they did the same job, they deserve \nthe same pay--my daughter and my son. Most Americans agree with that. \nPeople should be judged on what they do, their performance, their \nproductivity, not on their gender. That is at the heart of the issue \npending before the Senate at this moment.\n  Tomorrow we will take a vote. It is a procedural vote, so it takes 60 \nSenators to vote to move forward on what is known as the Paycheck \nFairness Act. We have 55 Democrats. The simple math tells you that \nunless five Republican Senators join us to move forward on this issue, \nthat is the end of the story. It would be unfortunate if it is the end \nof the story.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act amends the Equal Pay Act to discourage \ndiscrimination based on gender and to help narrow the pay gap in \nAmerica. No. 1, the bill provides women the same remedies for sex-based \npay discrimination that are available to people today based on racial \nor national origin discrimination. No. 2, the bill prohibits \nretaliation against workers who disclose their wages. Think about that \nfor a second.\n  Lilly Ledbetter worked in a tire factory in Alabama for years. Toward \nthe end of her work life, she received an anonymous note that said: \nLilly, you have been underpaid. You have been making less than the men \ndo in the same job in this plant since you have been here. She was \ncrushed. She thought she was a valued employee. No one ever questioned \nthe quality of her work, and she was being paid less than the men doing \nthe same job at her factory.\n  She filed a lawsuit, and it made it all the way to the Supreme \nCourt--across the street. Not surprisingly, this conservative, \nbusiness-oriented, Republican-oriented Supreme Court said: Sorry, Ms. \nLedbetter. You should have reported that pay discrimination when it \nfirst started. Well, why didn't she? She didn't know. How could she \nknow? Payroll information is not published--except perhaps for \ngovernment employees. That payroll information was not available to her \nto file the lawsuit when it first occurred. When she found out about \nit, she filed the lawsuit across the street, and the learned Supreme \nCourt said: Too late.\n  So we changed the law. The very first law signed by the President of \nthe United States Barack Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, \nwhich said that Lilly Ledbetter and women just like her across America, \ndeserve an opportunity for equal pay for equal work. What we have \nbefore us today--this Paycheck Fairness Act--is an effort to make sure \nthat law is strong and helps women across America.\n  No. 1, it says that women cannot be discriminated against in the \nworkplace simply because they are women. No. 2, you can't threaten \nretaliation if one worker tells another what the pay is at that \nparticular place of work. No. 3, it adds programs for training, \nresearch, technical assistance, and awards to recognize pay equity \nemployers.\n  The Equal Pay Act was signed into law almost 50 years ago, but the \npay gap between men and women in America is just about the same today \nas it was then. According to the U.S. Census Bureau--as we heard over \nand over--women earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. African-\nAmerican women make 70 cents on the dollar, and Hispanic women make \nabout 60 cents on the dollar.\n  In my State of Illinois, 37 percent of married employed mothers are \ntheir family's primary wage earners. Yet they face the same income \ndisparity. It turns out to be a yearly gap of $11,596 on average \nbetween men and women who work full time in my State. That is what the \ndisparity in pay between men and women means in the State of Illinois. \nIt is not just less take-home pay for women doing the same job, it \nmeans fewer Social Security benefits when they retire. They are not \nearning at the same level as men. They pay for this discrimination for \na lifetime.\n  The National Partnership for Women and Families found that ending \nthis wage gap would provide women in my State with additional earnings \nthat would be the equivalent of 97 weeks of food, 13 months of rent, 7 \nmonths of mortgage payments or 3,000 gallons of gas. It is a big deal \nfor a struggling family--particularly for a woman who is a struggling \nwage earner in Illinois.\n  Regardless of occupation, education, industry or marital status, pay \nfor women in my State lags behind their male counterparts. Women in \nIllinois who work in business and financial management earn 72 percent \nof their male counterpart's salary. That is what is before the Senate.\n  Is it wrong? Yes, it is. Are we prepared to say so in legislation? \nTune in tomorrow and find out whether five Republicans will join us to \nraise this issue of pay fairness for women across America.\n  I am not encouraged by the statement that was just made on the floor \nby the Senate Republican leader. He referred to this whole conversation \nabout paycheck fairness and minimum wage increases--so that people who \ngo to work every single day do not live in poverty--as ``the left's \nlatest bizarre obsession.'' He said that we were blowing a few kisses \nto our powerful pals on the left with this legislative agenda. He \ncalled it tone deaf, blame deflection, and shadow boxing on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The Senate Republican leader said the divide between the two parties \nis in stark relief. He is right. He went on to say: We should drop any \npretense of doing anything serious in this Chamber if this is what we \nare going to discuss.\n  How serious is equal pay for equal work to working people across \nAmerica? I think it is critical. It is one thing for the Senate \nRepublican leader to talk about job creation. We all want it. We are \ndesperate for it. We are moving toward it in many different ways, but \nlet's talk to those who are working and have jobs and whether they are \npaid fairly. Is that important to them? Of course.\n  Simply having a job may be important, but when you get to the heart \nof it, people want to be rewarded for good work. They don't want to \nwork 40 hours a week, get up every morning, get on the bus in the dark, \nput their kids in their neighbor's house for daycare, head to their \njob, and at the end of the week realize they are still living in \npoverty. And that is what today's minimum wage does.\n  The women on those buses and the CTA trains that we see every morning \nin Chicago, with their shopping bags full of the basics so they can go \nto work and leaving their kids behind, want to believe they will be \npaid fairly for what they do. That is not much to ask.\n  According to the Republican leader, it shows the stark contrast \nbetween the two parties. It is a stark contrast. The Republican leader \nsays that we want to work for a commitment to jobs and focus on the \npower of ideas. I want to focus on the power of an idea too. It is the \nidea of fairness and fair play. It is as basic as being an American, to \nbelieve that people ought to be treated fairly, and that when they do \nthe same work they are entitled to the same pay. That is not too much \nto ask. In fact, we should demand it.\n  I suppose we are going to have a critical, historic vote tomorrow. I \nam hoping five--just five--Republicans will step up on behalf of \nworking women across America and join us on this Paycheck Fairness Act. \nWithout them, this idea will die for now, but it is not going to die \nforever. The American people have the last word. They will have it in \nthe election. They can decide if this is important. They can decide \nwhether--as the Republican leader said--this is just a bizarre \nobsession on the part of the left to think of fair pay for the same \nwork. I think it is pretty basic to America.\n  This is our chance. Paycheck fairness and a minimum wage to keep \npeople who get up and go to work every day out of poverty are \nfundamental to a good workplace and a workforce across America which is \nrespected by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, last week the men and women at the Fort \nHood Army post in Killeen, TX, witnessed a shocking act of violence as \na gunman suddenly and inexplicably opened fire, killing 3 fellow \nsoldiers and wounding 16 others. Yet, even as our attention has focused \non the horror of this event, I think it is also important to talk about \nthe very best of humanity demonstrated during this time of tragedy and \ncrisis.\n  The men and women at Fort Hood saw the very best of humanity in the \nmilitary police officer who confronted the shooter, for example.\n  They saw it in Private Jacob Sanders, who risked his own life in the \nhopes of saving one of the victims.\n  They saw it in SGT Jonathan Westbrook, who was shot and wounded by \nthe gunman but still managed to radio Fort Hood officials and sound the \nalert so that others might be protected and safe.\n  They also saw it in SFC Danny Ferguson, who served a combat tour in \nIraq and had recently gotten home from a second one in Afghanistan. \nLast Wednesday Sergeant Ferguson used his own body to prevent the \nshooter from entering a crowded room. He gave his life so that his \nfellow soldiers could keep theirs. He showed the kind of heroism that \nfew of us could even imagine, the kind of heroism that defines our men \nand women in uniform.\n  So even as we mourn the terrible loss of Sergeant Ferguson, we want \nto also take a moment to celebrate his wonderful example and his \nwonderful life, just as we celebrate the remarkable lives of SGT \nTimothy Owens and SSG Carlos Lazaney-Rodriguez.\n  Sergeant Owens served his country in Iraq and in Kuwait. He also \nserved as a counselor at Fort Hood. According to his mother, he \ncounseled literally ``hundreds of people.'' His brother Darrell \ndescribed him as someone who ``would help anybody who needed help.''\n  Sergeant Lazaney-Rodriguez was a native of Puerto Rico, and he served \nmultiple combat tours in Iraq. He too made a distinct impression on his \nfriends and fellow soldiers at Fort Hood. One of them described him as \n``the epitome of what you want a leader to be in the Army.''\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, as we mourn the loss of Sergeant \nFerguson, Sergeant Owens, and Sergeant Lazaney-Rodriguez, we should \ntake a moment to celebrate their lives and their service. All three of \nthese men chose--they volunteered--to devote their lives to a noble \ncause--the defense of our country--and our memories of their work and \ntheir sacrifice will live forever.\n  Before I conclude, I wish to say one more word about Fort Hood, where \nI will be traveling to tomorrow with the President. Fort Hood is also \nknown as The Great Place. They call it The Great Place. I had the honor \nof visiting the post last Thursday, and I will do so again tomorrow for \nthe memorial, as I said. As we all remember, Fort Hood was also the \nscene of an earlier mass shooting in November of 2009. That was yet \nanother day where we saw both the worst and the best of humanity. We \nsaw the very best of humanity in people such as Michael Cahill, a \ncivilian physician's assistant and retired soldier, and Army CPT John \nGaffaney, both of whom charged the gunman--MAJ Nidal Hasan--and gave \ntheir lives in order to save the lives of others around them.\n  Over the last 13 years, the Fort Hood community has made enormous \ncontributions to America's missions in Iraq and in Afghanistan, where \nmore than 550 of their soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice. In \nfact, the last combat brigade to leave Iraq was a Fort Hood brigade--\nthe Third Brigade of the storied 1st Cavalry Division.\n  I sometimes think about the fact that most Americans probably don't \nhave a close friend or relative who has served in the Armed Forces. So \nin some ways the American people have become isolated to some degree \nfrom the realities of war and national security. For them the war in \nAfghanistan is something they read about in the newspaper or they hear \nabout on TV, but it is not very real to them unless they have a family \nmember or a loved one or a friend who has served.\n  For the families at Fort Hood and in the surrounding Texas \ncommunities of Belton, Copperas Cove, Harker Heights, Killeen, and \nTemple, it is something much different, something much more personal \nbecause it is a family member, it is a loved one, it is a friend who \nhas served, and many of them have lost their lives in the process \nbecause they believed that keeping the American people safe was more \nimportant than their own personal security and safety.\n  I wish to take this moment to let the families and friends of the \nvictims at Fort Hood know that--and, indeed, to tell all the good \npeople at Fort Hood--your fellow Americans are thinking about you, we \nare praying for you and keeping you close in our hearts during this \ndifficult time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here this morning on a very \nserious and important subject--the Paycheck Fairness Act. I thank my \ncolleagues who were with me earlier today at an event we attended. The \nPresident is doing an event right now. He has announced he will require \nall Federal contractors to follow the rule that there should be no \nretaliation against people in the workplace who share information about \ntheir pay. It sounds like a basic principle of fairness but, \nunfortunately, the law has gaps that permit discrimination--gender \ndiscrimination, unequal pay for the same work. So today on Equal Pay \nDay, I am here to advocate for the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will \nhelp fill some of those gaps.\n  This issue is not a man's issue, it is not a woman's issue. It is a \nfamily issue. It is not about women, it is about paycheck fairness. So \nit is as much about men as it is about women. Right now 40 percent of \nall our families are supported by women either as the sole or primary \nbreadwinner. That means the children in those families, and the men, \ndepend on that income and on the fairness of their paychecks to keep a \nroof over their head and to keep food on the table.\n  Paycheck fairness is about a fair shot--a fair shot for every woman \nand\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\nevery person in American society. It is part of a larger agenda which \nincludes raising the minimum wage, which we still have to do, and \nrestoring unemployment insurance, which the Senate did yesterday but we \nstill have to do in the House. That larger agenda about a fair shot \ngoes to the core of the American conscience about what is right, but it \nalso happens to be what is economically smart. Paying women equal to \nmen for the same work means that women will come to jobs and they will \nwork better in those jobs, more productively. Women have so much to \ncontribute in jobs where they serve equally or better than men.\n  Unfortunately, the promise of the Equal Pay Act, signed in 1963 by \nPresident Kennedy, has yet to be achieved. That promise was that \nequality would prevail in the workplace. Yet 51 years later the \ndisparities are glaring, the gaps between gender pay are unacceptable \nand inexcusable. Women make only 77 percent of every dollar earned by \nmen. The disparity is even greater in certain professions. In the \njanitorial profession, among supervisors, and among CEOs, women make 70 \ncents or less on the dollar. The same is true among financial advisers \nand among product inspectors. So the disparities cut across all \nprofessions. In fact, in 97 percent of all professions, women make less \non average than men. That is why we must work to change the law.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act would accomplish a number of very simple \nstraightforward goals. No. 1, it would enable workers to share \ninformation without fear of retaliation. Right now, a worker can be \nfired or demoted if he or she shares information about what they are \nmaking. The Lilly Ledbetter Act of 2009 advanced these goals and made \nsome progress, but this threat of retaliation is real and completely \nunconscionable and it should be directly prohibited by law.\n  Second, the burden should be on the employer to establish that pay \ndisparities are business related or job specific. Those disparities \nought to be the job of the employer to justify, not the employee. After \nall, it is not the employee who makes those decisions, it is the \nemployer. So the employer ought to be the one to present a \njustification based on objective and real business-related or job-\nspecific factors.\n  Finally, the Paycheck Fairness Act provides for punitive damages. \nOnly by establishing punitive damages can the evil and harm done by pay \ndiscrimination be effectively deterred. The economic penalty will \ndiscourage employers by providing real consequences for their \ndiscrimination.\n  This issue is really an American issue that has resonance coast to \ncoast, job to job, and person to person, but mostly it has resonance \namong families. The estimates are that eliminating the gender pay gap \nwill reduce poverty among families headed by single working mothers \nfrom 28.7 percent to 15 percent. It will reduce poverty, most \nimportantly, among children. It will give those children a leg up that \nthey lack now. It will give their moms a sense of justified dignity and \nself-respect. It will make a practical difference in the lives of \nfamilies, raising the self-respect and dignity of men as well as women. \nIf they are the beneficiaries of false factors, simple gender \ndiscrimination, how can they justify the additional pay that they as \nmen make?\n  Discovering and proving discrimination is a formidable, daunting, \nsometimes insurmountable challenge. Discovering it is difficult enough. \nThat is why sharing of information is necessary. Proving it is \nsometimes virtually impossible without the kind of law the Paycheck \nFairness Act will provide, the rights and making those rights real that \ncan be achieved, ending systemic pay discrimination that undermines and \ndisserves our entire society. It demeans all of us. It fails to give \npeople a fair shot when that is the ethos, the core conscience of \nAmerican economic profit. A fair shot is not only fair, it is smart. It \nwill promote jobs and economic growth, which all of us deeply want and \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, 2 weeks ago the New York Times published \nan article on the congressional Democrats' plan for the rest of the \nyear. It boiled down to one thing: Campaigning. That is right; 8 months \nout from the election, Democrats in Congress have given up on \nlegislating. Instead, they are going to spend the next 8 months focused \non show votes, which will--and I quote from the story--``be timed to \ncoincide with campaign-style trips by President Obama.''\n  While these votes will focus on ``pocketbook issues'' Democrats hope \nwill appeal to voters, the votes are not designed to actually \naccomplish anything. The New York Times goes on to say:\n\n       Democrats concede that making new laws is not really the \n     point. Rather, they are trying to force Republicans to vote \n     against them.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Privately, White House officials say they have no intention \n     of searching for any grand bargain with Republicans on any of \n     these issues. ``The point isn't to compromise,'' a senior \n     White House official said.\n\n  So that is where we are. The economy is stagnant, unemployment is \nhovering at recession-level highs, 10 million Americans are \nunemployed--nearly 4 million of them for 6 months or longer--household \nincome has fallen, health care costs are soaring, and Democrats have \ndecided to give up doing anything about it so they can get reelected in \nNovember.\n  This political strategy was front and center last week when Democrats \nblocked all Republican amendments during the Senate debate of the \nemployment benefits extension bill. Republicans wanted to offer a \nnumber of amendments that were focused specifically on job creation. \nAfter all, the only reason we are considering extending unemployment \nbenefits for the 13th time since 2008 is because so many Americans \nstill don't have jobs. While unemployment benefits can provide limited \nshort-term help, they do nothing to get unemployed Americans what they \nreally want--steady, good-paying jobs with an opportunity for \nadvancement.\n  Republicans thought that we should accompany yet another extension of \nemergency unemployment benefits with measures to make it easier and \ncheaper to create jobs for the millions of Americans currently \nsearching for work. We proposed amendments to create jobs with measures \nsuch as reining in burdensome regulatory requirements and improving job \ntraining for people who are unemployed. Democrats, however, didn't want \nto take any votes on Republican proposals, so they simply refused to \nallow amendments to be considered. That is not the mark of a party that \nis serious about helping the unemployed.\n  If Democrats were really serious, they would be focused on permanent \nrelief through jobs rather than merely treating the symptoms of \nunemployment. Democrats brought up unemployment benefits not because \nthey offer real, long-term help to the unemployed but because they \nthink these benefits might win them a few votes in November.\n  They are planning to keep on doing the same thing. Soon Democrats \nplan to bring up a 40-percent minimum wage hike that the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office estimates will cost up to 500,000 jobs by \nthe end of 2016. By the way, 57 percent of those job losses--according \nto the CBO--would be held by women. But that is not stopping the \nDemocrats who hope that a minimum wage hike will gain them votes at the \npolls even if it hurts workers in the process.\n  This week Senator Reid filed cloture on the motion to proceed to a \nsimilarly political bill, the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act. All \nSenate Republicans believe in equal pay for equal work. Paycheck \nfairness has been the law of the land since 1963. Democrats are playing \npolitics with equal pay and attempting to distract from the real harm \nthat their policies have done to women. Right now there are 3.7 million \nmore women living in poverty than there were when the President took \noffice. Since the President took office,\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\nthe poverty rate for women has increased from 14.4 percent to 16.3 \npercent. Income for female college graduates has dropped by over \n$1,400, and the median income for women is down by $733 since the \nPresident took office.\n  It would be nice if this legislation that is being proposed by the \nDemocratic majority provided women with real economic help, but it is \nfar more likely to line the pockets of trial lawyers. In fact, this \nelection-year ploy would actually hurt women by increasing Federal \nregulations that would cut flexibility in the workforce for working \nmoms and end merit pay to reward quality work.\n  If Democrats were really serious about helping women, they would work \nwith us on bills to create jobs and to expand workplace opportunities \nfor women as well as for men--bills such as Senator Rubio's legislation \nto amend the National Labor Relations Act to allow employers to give \nmerit-based pay increases to good workers; or Senator Collins' bill to \nrepeal ObamaCare's 30-hour workweek rule, which is reducing hours and \nlowering wages for many workers, particularly women, who make up 63 \npercent of those affected; or the bill proposed by Senator Mike Lee, \nwhich would help employers balance work and family life by allowing \nprivate sector employers to give workers the choice of monetary \ncompensation or comp time for the overtime hours that they work; or \nSenator McConnell and Senator Ayotte's bill, which would give hourly \nworkers access to flexible work arrangements like comp time off and \nflexible credit hours; or my bill combining several of my colleagues' \nproposals to stimulate job creation and increase hours and wages \nthrough energy development, job training, and regulatory relief. Then, \nof course, there is Senator Fischer's proposal to give women the tools \nand knowledge they need to fight discrimination at work.\n  Many of these proposals have passed the House of Representatives and \nare awaiting action by the Senate. These bills would create new jobs, \nopen new opportunities, and help reverse the economic decline that \nwomen have experienced over the past 5 years. But Democrats don't seem \nto be interested in providing economic relief to women. They are \ninterested in elections and scoring political points.\n  Democrats can go on campaigning for the rest of the year if they \nwant. They can twist the legislative process for their own political \nends and ignore the economic pain they have caused women and men. \nMeanwhile, the middle class in this country continues to fall further \nand further behind.\n  Republicans in the Senate will continue to propose legislation to \ncreate jobs and opportunities for Americans and help make up the ground \nthat the American people have lost in the Obama economy. Democrats can \nstill change their minds and join us, and I hope they will because the \nsituation has not gotten any better. We still have chronic high \nunemployment, lower take-home pay, and lower household income.\n  We have almost 4 million people who have been unemployed for more \nthan 6 months. The labor participation rate--the number of people who \nare actually in the labor workforce today--is at the lowest level we \nhave seen in 35 years, meaning there are millions of Americans who left \nthe workforce.  Those statistics are crying out for solutions that will \ndo something about the need for jobs in our economy, that will do \nsomething about growing and expanding our economy, so those people who \nare unemployed can find the work they need to improve their standard of \nliving and that of their families as well.\n\n  So I hope all of these issues I have mentioned--these are all \namendments that have been filed by my colleagues on the Republican side \nof the aisle. So far there is no indication, no suggestion that any of \nthese amendments are going to get an opportunity to be offered, to be \ndebated, and to be voted on--amendments that actually would improve the \noutlook for not only men in this country but women as well, by growing \nthe economy, expanding the economy, creating the types of good-paying \njobs that will create opportunities for advancement for hard-working \nAmericans.\n  If the Senate is going to continue to be a place where debate and \namendments are shut down, blocked by the other side simply so they can \nhave show votes designed to appeal to a political audience as we head \ninto the midterm elections; if we aren't going to be doing anything to \nsolve the real-world problems millions of Americans who are unemployed \nhave, or millions of Americans who have been hurt by this economy, and \nmillions of Americans who have seen their standard of living and their \nquality of life eroded by bad policies coming out of Washington, DC, \nthat make it more difficult and more expensive to create jobs--that is \nwhat we ought to be focused on. Republicans come to the floor, as we \ndid last week when we were debating unemployment insurance, with \namendments designed specifically at growing the economy and creating \njobs. At every turn we have been blocked from offering those amendments \nand, in turn, we are talking about nothing more than political rhetoric \nin an election year that does nothing to address the real problems of \nthe American people. They deserve better. We can do better. I hope we \nwill. I hope the Democrats will change their minds and join us and \nallow us to have that debate, to have those votes, and allow us to do \nsomething meaningful for middle-class families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2208-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2208-S2210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, today is Equal Pay Day. I mentioned that \nto someone earlier and they said: What does that mean? What that means \nis an American woman working full time in America today--I am talking \nabout an average American woman working full time, year-round--had to \nwork all last year and up to today of this year to earn what the \naverage male made last year up to December 31. That is what Equal Pay \nDay is. Think about that. A man gets paid up to December 31, and a \nwoman has to work all that year and up to today to get the same pay.\n  It is shocking that in 2014 that is still happening in America--\nshocking--because we passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963. In 1963, a woman \nmade about 60 cents on the dollar for what a man made. Today, it is 77 \ncents, so I guess we can say we have made some headway. So 1963, 1973, \n1983--in 40 years, we have gone from 60 cents to 77 cents.\n  What we found out, through our committee hearings of the committee I \nam privileged to chair, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, is that a lot of employers in this country are not abiding by \nsome of the provisions of the Equal Pay Act. I compliment Senator \nMikulski, who is a member of our committee as well as the Chair of the \nfull Appropriations Committee, for her leadership in bringing this \nbill, the Paycheck Fairness Act, to the Senate.\n  When we passed it in 1963, 25 million female workers, as I said, \nearned about 60 cents on the dollar. Now it is 77 cents. Again, the \ndeficit and what it means for a lifetime of earnings is startling. Over \nthe course of a 40-year career, women, on average, earn more than \n$450,000 less than men. And get this: Women with a college degree, or \nmore, face an even wider gap of more than $700,000 over a lifetime \ncompared with men with the same higher education. So, again, the \nconsequences are enormous, impacting not just women but their families \nas well, and not just impacting women during their working lives, but \nkeep this in mind: When a woman is making that much less, then a woman \nis getting that much less in her retirement, in her Social Security, or \nmaybe her 401(k), or a defined benefit, whatever it might be. So women \nget whacked twice during their working life and then when they retire \nbecause they have made substantially less than men.\n  Again, I congratulate Senator Mikulski for bringing this bill forward \nand for her indefatigable work on this issue. It is time to pass the \nPaycheck Fairness Act. It is simple, commonsense legislation to make \nsure we have procedures and processes that are in place, to make sure \nthe Equal Pay Act, passed in 1963, has some teeth, so employers can't \njust skirt around it anymore, and so there will be avenues for women to \ntake to make sure they are not discriminated against in terms of pay.\n\n[[Page S2209]]\n\n  For example, right now it can be a violation of company policy if a \nwoman wants to talk to another person about what their salary is. Some \ncompanies say employees can't do that. This bill says, yes, employees \ncan do that. Employees can talk to someone else. They don't have to \ntell--we don't force anybody to tell what their salary is--but an \nemployee can make inquiries and can discuss it with other fellow \nemployees, and an employer cannot retaliate against an employee for \ndoing that. That is a huge step forward, by the way: a little bit of \ntransparency, a little bit of knowledge that a woman can have to \nunderstand whether she is being discriminated against in her \nemployment.\n  Of course, we have a good deal of anecdotal evidence and many \nexamples of employers retaliating against women for discussing salary \ninformation. So this bill is long overdue and we need to pass it.\n  We can't just stop there on this paycheck fairness bill. We have to \npass it and then we have to do a few other things. We have to tackle \nthe more subtle discrimination that occurs when we systematically \nundervalue the work traditionally done by women. The fact is millions \nof female-dominated jobs--jobs that are equivalent in skill, effort, \nresponsibility, and working conditions to similar jobs dominated by \nmen--pay significantly less than male equivalent-type jobs. For \nexample, why is a housekeeper worth less than a janitor? Think about \nit: Eighty-four percent of the maids such as those who clean our rooms \nin hotels--are female; 75 percent of janitors are male. While the jobs \nare equivalent in terms of skill, effort, responsibility, and working \nconditions, the median weekly earnings for a maid are $399. For a \njanitor, it is $484.\n  Truckdrivers--a job that is 96-percent male--have median weekly \nearnings of $730. In contrast, a childcare worker--a job that is 93-\npercent female--has median weekly earnings of $390. Why do we value \nsomeone who moves products more than we value someone who looks after \nthe safety and well-being of our children? I am not saying that \ntruckdrivers are overpaid; I am just saying that jobs we consider \n``women's work'' are often underpaid, even though they are equivalent \nin skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. Quite \nfrankly, some of the jobs women do, such as nursing or home health \naides, require a lot more physical effort than being a truckdriver. \nMaybe in the old days truckdrivers had to be strong to muscle those \ntrucks around. Now everybody has power steering and power brakes and \neverything else. A person doesn't have to be some big, heavy-weight \ngiant to drive trucks anymore. But to be a nursing aide, if you are \nrolling people who weigh over 250 pounds and doing other things, that \ncan take quite a bit of effort. So why are nursing and home health \naides paid so much less than truckdrivers?\n  That is why in every Congress since 1996 I have introduced the Fair \nPay Act, which would require employers to provide equal pay for \nequivalent jobs. My counterpart in the House is Delegate Eleanor Holmes \nNorton, and together we have introduced it in every Congress since \n1996. It requires employers to provide equal pay for jobs that are \nequivalent in skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions, \nbut which are dominated by employees of a different gender, race, or \nnational origin.\n  People may say maybe that is a stretch. Well, in 1983, the \nlegislature of my State of Iowa, working with a Republican Governor, \npassed a bill stipulating that the State of Iowa could not discriminate \nin compensation between predominantly male and female jobs. They had to \npay equivalent wages. So they hired Arthur Young & Company and they \nevaluated 800 job classifications in State government and, finally, in \nApril of 1984, determined that 10,751 employees should be given a pay \nincrease. Since 1984 in Iowa we have had that equivalency.\n  In Minnesota, our neighbor to the north and the neighbor of the \nPresiding Officer to the east, they went even a step further. Minnesota \nat that time passed a bill providing for equivalent pay not only in \nState jobs but clear down to the local level. That was in Minnesota. So \nit can be done. The women in this country are currently being paid less \nnot because of their skills, not because of their education, working \nconditions, or responsibility, but simply because they are in what we \ncall female-dominated jobs. This bill would make sure they receive \ntheir real worth. It will make a huge difference for them and their \nfamilies who rely on their wages.\n  What my bill would do basically is require employers to publicly \ndisclose their job categories and their pay scales. They wouldn't have \nto publish what every employee is making; they would have to say here \nare our job classifications and here are the pay scales in those job \nclassifications. So it would give women information about what their \nmale colleagues are earning or anyone who is in that pay scale, so they \ncan negotiate a better deal for themselves in the workplace. Right now, \nwomen who believe they are a victim of pay discrimination must file a \nlawsuit and endure a drawn-out legal discovery process to find out \nwhether they make less than the man working beside them, but with \nstatistics readily available, this could be avoided. The number of \nlawsuits would go down if employees could see upfront whether they are \nbeing treated fairly.\n  Several years ago our committee had Lilly Ledbetter come and testify \nbefore our committee. We had provided her with a copy of the Fair Pay \nAct that I have been introducing since 1996, and she took a look at it \nand its description. I asked her, if the Fair Pay Act had been law when \nshe was hired, would it have obviated her wage discrimination case. She \nsaid with the information about pay scales the bill provides, she would \nhave known from the beginning she was a victim of discrimination and \ncould have tried to address the problem sooner before it caused a \nlifelong drop in her earnings and before she had to go all the way to \nthe Supreme Court to make things right.\n  So, again, it is time to get done and put some teeth in it, but it is \ntime to take the next step, because the biggest gap right now between \nwhat women make and what men make--among the various known reasons for \nthe gap, like education, race, union status, and work experience--is \noccupation; that is, the number of women who are in what we have \ntraditionally known as women's jobs--housekeepers, maids, child care \nworkers, nurse assistants, and so on. It is time to take the step that \nmy State and Minnesota--and there are other States; I just mentioned \nthose two because I am familiar with them--have taken to address this \nproblem of equivalency.\n  The next thing we need to do to make sure Equal Pay Day is not today \nbut is December 31, like when men get paid for a full year, is to raise \nthe minimum wage. Hopefully, we will be voting on that soon to raise \nthe minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour.\n\n  Again, the majority of low-wage workers are women because of the \ntrends I just mentioned. Jobs primarily held by women are undervalued \nand underpaid and most of the low-wage workers are women. So again we \nhave to raise that, and we need to raise tipped wages.\n  Tipped wages right now are $2.13 an hour. It has not been changed \nsince 1991. Who are most of the tipped workers? Women, and many of them \nare providing income for their families, for their children. I said \nthis the other day to a group and they were astounded. They thought I \nmust be wrong about it, but I am not wrong. Do you know how someone \ngets classified as a tipped worker? A lot of people do not know this. \nHow does someone get classified as a tipped worker? Under the law, if \ntheir employer says they make more than $30 a month in tips, they can \nbe classified as a tipped worker. Think about that, $30 a month.\n  Let's say if someone works 5 days a week and they are working 20 days \na month, that is $1.50 a day. If they get $1.50 a day in tips, they can \nbe classified as a tipped worker and they can pay them $2.13 an hour--\nunconscionable.\n  It has not been raised since 1991. Our minimum wage bill, which we \nhope to have on the floor shortly, would raise that tipped wage over 6 \nyears from its present level to 70 percent of the minimum wage, and \nthen it is indexed for the future.\n  So there are three things we need to do: pass the Paycheck Fairness \nAct championed by Senator Mikulski, address and pass the Fair Pay Act, \nand\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\nraise the minimum wage. If we do those three things, Equal Pay Day will \nnot be today, it will be December 31 for everybody.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2210-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               150TH ANNIVERSARY OF GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I see the time has come to recess for \nthe caucuses, but I just wish to say that today is another important \nday. Today is the 150th anniversary of the date that Abraham Lincoln \nsigned the law authorizing the institution we now know as Gallaudet \nUniversity in Washington, DC. That was 150 years ago today. What began \non April 8, 1864, as a school with just eight students has flourished \ninto the world's first and only institution of higher education \ndedicated to deaf and hard-of-hearing students, renowned \ninternationally for its outstanding academic programs and also for its \nleading research into the history, language, and culture of deaf \npeople.\n  I take pride in the fact that it was Senator James W. Grimes of Iowa, \nthen-chair of the Committee on the District of Columbia, who initiated \nthat legislation allowing the school to confer degrees. Dr. T. Alan \nHurwitz, who is now the current distinguished president of Gallaudet, \nwas born and raised in Sioux City, IA, not too far from the Presiding \nOfficer's State of North Dakota. In fact, Dr. Hurwitz's father and my \nbrother were classmates at the Iowa School for the Deaf. We are proud \nof the many Iowa students, including a recent intern in my office, \nJoseph Lewis, who are graduates of Gallaudet.\n  It is a wonderful school. If you have never been there, you ought to \ngo and take a look at it. They do fantastic work at Gallaudet, \nattracting people from all around the globe to go there. In 1894 it was \nnamed after Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, and then in 1986 it was conferred \nuniversity status by the Congress. Again, 150 years ago today, on April \n8, 1864, Abraham Lincoln signed it into law.\n  In 1864, the school was known as the Columbia Institution for the \nInstruction of the Deaf and Dumb and Blind. It was inspired by the work \nof Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, who had traveled to Paris to study the \nsuccessful work of French educators who pioneered the use of a manual \ncommunication method of instructing the deaf--in other words, sign \nlanguage. In 1894, the name of the institution was changed to Gallaudet \nCollege in honor of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. In 1986, by act of \nCongress, the college was granted university status.\n  My brother Frank was deaf from an early age. During his childhood, in \nthe 1940s and 1950s, most Americans had very backward, ignorant \nattitudes toward deaf people. It pained me to witness the brazen \ndiscrimination and prejudice that he faced on a daily basis and I \npromised that if I ever got into a position of power, I would change \nthings to prevent that kind of discrimination in the future.\n  As it turned out, I did rise to a position of power. I was determined \nto make good on my promise to pass legislation to end discrimination \nagainst people with disabilities, and an unexpected event gave a huge \nimpetus to my legislative ambition.\n  In 1988, Gallaudet University was hiring a new president. At that \ntime, the school had never had a deaf president. There were three \ncandidates: one was deaf and two were hearing. The Board of Visitors \nselected a hearing president.\n  To the students at Gallaudet, who believed passionately that the time \nhad come for a deaf president, this was unacceptable. They rose up in a \nmovement that came to be known as Deaf President Now. They organized \nprotests. They boycotted classes. Some 2,000 Gallaudet students marched \nfrom their campus to the U.S. Capitol Building. They demanded a \npresident at Gallaudet who could relate to them in a way that no \nhearing person could.\n  I had the privilege of speaking to them. I told them, ``You are my \nheroes.'' They are still my heroes because they kept up their protests \nuntil they won. Gallaudet got its first deaf president, I. King Jordan.\n  But that is not all those students won. The protests by the students \nat Gallaudet struck a chord with other people with disabilities all \nacross America. Those students were like a spark that ignited a \nbrushfire.\n  They rose up and said: Enough. No more second-class citizenship. No \nmore discrimination. And other people with disabilities took up the \nsame rallying cry.\n  As the chief Senate sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nADA, there is no question in my mind that the students' successful \nprotests at Gallaudet were one of the key reasons why we were able to \npass the ADA 2 years later.\n  Today, Gallaudet University is a diverse, bilingual university \ndedicated to the intellectual and professional advancement of deaf and \nhard-of-hearing individuals through American Sign Language and English. \nI have always been an admirer and supporter of Gallaudet. I respect it \nas a place that opens doors and creates opportunity. At Gallaudet, the \nfocus is on ability, not disability, and, as with all schools, \nsometimes it is on extraordinary ability, such as Adham Talaat, the \nacademic all-American defensive end who helped to lead the Gallaudet \nfootball team to a 9 and 1 record this past season or faculty member \nDr. Laura-Ann Pettito and her Visual Language and Visual Learning \nCenter, where she and her graduate students map the brain to better \nunderstand how we decode auditory and visual language or 2011 graduate \nJames Caverly, who starred in the play ``Tribes'' about a hearing \nfamily with a deaf son.\n  Gallaudet aims not only to educate but also to empower, and this is \nan incredibly important gift to give to the men and women who attend \nGallaudet. I join with my colleagues in the Senate in saluting this \nremarkable institution on its 150th anniversary.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2210-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 3:15 \np.m. will be controlled by the majority.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise today to speak on paycheck \nfairness, the bill we will be voting on tomorrow in the Senate. During \nthe next hour 11 Democratic women will be coming to the floor to speak. \nI am not going to introduce each one. We want to get right to the \nissue. Rather than talking flowery talk about each other, we want to \ntalk about the need for paycheck fairness.\n  I ask unanimous consent that each Senator be permitted to speak for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am the leadoff speaker. I want to be very clear on \nwhy we are on the Senate floor. We believe women need a fair shot to \nget equal pay for equal work. We want the same pay for the same job. We \nwant it in our lawbooks, and we want it in our checkbooks. We want to \nfinish the job we began with Lilly Ledbetter 5 years ago.\n  Five years ago, one of the first bills that we passed in the Obama \nadministration was the Lilly Ledbetter bill. We reopened the courthouse \ndoors to women who wanted to seek redress for the way they were treated \nunequally in the workplace. But we need to finish the job. That is what \npaycheck fairness does.\n  What does ``finish the job'' mean? Well, right now in the United \nStates of America, there is a veil of secrecy--a veil of secrecy. Where \nis it? In the workplace. Right now, in companies and businesses, \nemployees are forbidden to talk about the pay they receive with another \nemployee. In many places, when an employee seeks redress, she is \nretaliated against. Last but not at all least, there are loopholes\n\n[[Page S2211]]\n\nthat many employers use to justify women being paid less. They invent \nexcuses, and they call them business necessity explanations. Well, we \nare on the floor today to say we want to end the soft bigotry of low \nwages for women. Equal pay for equal work. No secrecy. No retaliation. \nNo loopholes. No way. Today is the day for equal pay.\n  We are on the floor today because it is Equal Pay Day. What does that \nmean? It means the women of the United States of America have to work \nin many instances 15 months to earn what a man doing the same job, with \nthe same experience and the same seniority, earns in 1 year.\n  Now, we are not against the guys. There are many men who do jobs they \nhate so their daughters can have the jobs they love. After working to \nensure that they have a good home and a good education, they see their \ndaughters are paid less.\n  We all know there is a generalized wage suppression going on in the \nmiddle class--another topic and another debate. But right now we are on \nthe job and we want to be paid for what we do. It is hard to believe \nthat women are almost half of the workforce and yet during that time, \nas we make up 50 percent of the workforce, we still make only 77 cents \nfor every dollar a man makes; African-American women earn 62 cents; \nLatino women 54 cents--almost half. This is a disgrace.\n  We need to change the law. That is what we seek to do by bringing up \nthe Paycheck Fairness Act. Our President has tried to do his part. He \nsupported the Lilly Ledbetter bill. Today we were at the White House, \nwhere he took an Executive order step to ban retaliation against \nemployees who work for Federal contractors. So we are going to start \nbeing a model employer by banning retaliation not only within the \nFederal Government but with our Federal contractors. He also then \ncalled upon the contractors to submit data, information, so that we \nwould know what are the gender differences that are going on on the \nvery contracts we have.\n  When we signed the Equal Pay Act--it was in 1963 under Lyndon \nJohnson--women made only 59 cents. You know what. That was 50 years \nago. In 50 years we have gained 18 cents. Well, that is not the way to \ngo. The way to go is to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. What we want to \ndo is make sure that, as I said, there is no retaliation, no excuses.\n  We hear this all the time: Oh, the guys do harder jobs; they are the \nbreadwinners. But so are many women now who are heading households or \nwho are single breadwinners.\n  The other important thing is that no longer will women be limited in \npay to just backpay when they have been discriminated against.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. My time is up. I am so into this bill. I have been at \nthis legislation for a long time. But what I have now is hope. Help is \non the way. Reinforcements are here.\n  Now I turn to Senator Elizabeth Warren and then Senator Claire \nMcCaskill and Senator Cantwell, in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I thank Senator Mikulski for her \nincredible leadership on this issue.\n  I come to the floor today in support of equal pay for equal work. I \nhonestly cannot believe we are still arguing over equal pay in 2014. \nCongress first moved to solve this problem more than 50 years ago when \nthe Equal Pay Act was signed into law.\n  In 1963 women were earning 59 cents on the dollar for every dollar \nearned by a man. Today women earn only 77 cents on the dollar compared \nto what a man earns.\n  Women are taking a hit in nearly every occupation. Bloomberg analyzed \ncensus data and found that median earnings for women were lower than \nthose for men in 264 out of 265 major occupational categories. In 99.6 \npercent of all occupations, men get paid more than women--99.6 percent. \nThat is not an accident; that is discrimination.\n  The effects of this discrimination are real and they are long \nlasting. Women, for example, borrow roughly the same amount of money as \nmen to pay for college, but according to the American Association of \nUniversity Women, these women make only 82 cents on the dollar compared \nwith men 1 year after graduating. So women take out the same loans to \ngo to college, but they face an even steeper road to repay those loans.\n  Unequal pay also means a tougher retirement. The average woman in \nMassachusetts who collects Social Security will receive about $3,000 \nless each year than a similarly situated man because the benefits are \ntied to how much people earn while they are working.\n  This is a problem--a big problem--and women are fed up. Fifty years \nand a woman still cannot earn the same as a man for doing the same \nwork. Women are ready to fix it, but it is not easy.\n  Today some women can be fired just for asking the guy across the hall \nhow much money he makes. Earlier today the President issued Executive \norders to stop Federal contractors from retaliating against women who \nask about their pay and to instruct the Department of Labor to collect \nbetter data for the gender pay gap. Good for him, and good for women \nworking for contractors. Now the Congress should extend these \nprotections to all women.\n  The Senate will soon vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act. This is a \ncommonsense proposal: No discrimination and no retaliation when women \nask how much the guys are getting paid. We will get basic data to tell \nus how much men and women are getting paid for key jobs.\n  So there it is. It is basic protection, basic information--a fair \nshot. That is essentially what this bill does.\n  Sure, sometimes men are paid more than women. Employers can pay \ndifferent salaries based on factors such as skill, performance, \nexpertise, seniority, and so forth. The Paycheck Fairness Act does not \ntouch any of that. It simply provides the tools that women need to make \nsure salary differences have something to do with the actual job they \nare doing and not just the fact that they are women.\n  Several States have already adopted similar rules. Businesses in \nthese States continue to thrive without any explosion of lawsuits. This \nbill is about good business, a level playing field for men and women, \nan equal chance to get the job done, a fair shot for all of us.\n  America's women are tired of hearing that pay inequality is not real. \nWe are tired of hearing that somehow it is our fault. We are ready to \nfight back against pay discrimination.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski and all of my colleagues who are speaking on \nthe floor today for their leadership on this important proposal. I urge \nthe Senate to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to strengthen America's \nmiddle-class families and to level the playing field for hard-working \nwomen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, every once in a while it is probably \nhealthy for all of us to sit back for a moment and reflect on why we \nare here. What is the Senate supposed to be about? Why do we come to \nthe Senate? Why did our Founding Fathers lay out a Constitution that \nhad these branches of government?\n  In the branch of government in which we reside, we are called the \nlegislative branch. So what is that about? I think what the Founding \nFathers wanted us to do is to make our laws reflect the values and \npriorities of the American people.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act is a simple step toward making our laws \nreflect two of the most important values we have in the United States \nof America.\n  I guarantee you that if you walked up to any of my colleagues who \nintend to vote against this and said, do you believe in equality and \njustice, they would say, of course we believe in equality and justice.\n  Then why would you not support this legislation, because it is just \nthat simple. We are just trying to make the laws of this country \nreflect the American ideals of equality and justice.\n  Well, they say, there are laws on the books.\n  Well, here is the deal. You cannot get justice if you do not have the \nfacts. If the facts are a secret, a protected secret, then justice is \nalways going to be elusive and equality is going to be something to \nwhich we give lipservice,\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\nnot something we will truly enjoy in this country.\n  So this is just a step to say to American business: Let's understand \nwhy two people doing the same job have two different levels of pay. \nExplain it to us.\n  What is so evil about that? What is so evil about expecting a \nbusiness to be able to explain why a man and a woman with the same \nexperience, the same credentials, and the same work output are paid \ndifferently. If there is a good reason, then there is no litigation, \nthere is no rush to the courthouse. But if there is not a good reason, \nthat is where that justice comes in. That is where a woman has an \nopportunity to go into the hallowed halls of our courts--the envy of \nthe world, I might add--to have a fair shot at justice.\n  The notion that someone can be fired for trying to get the facts \nabout their own compensation, the notion that retaliation would somehow \nbe embraced by my colleagues who do not intend to vote for this \nlegislation I do not understand. I know they are trying to explain to \nthe American people that this has something to do with us having a love \naffair with America's trial lawyers. I have never heard more rubbish in \nmy life. It is not the trial lawyers whom we care about. It is the \nwomen. It is the single moms.\n  It is the women who have this sinking feeling in the pit of their \nstomach that they are getting paid less, that they are helpless because \nthey can't get at the information. When they do, they have the entire \nburden of proof of showing that somehow they weren't inferior to their \nmale colleagues.\n  There is absolutely no possible reason that any of us would be trying \nto help lawyers with this. It is their clients, guys; it is the women \nof America. It is the women of America who want the laws to reflect our \nvalues, equality, and justice. This is a simple step. It is nothing to \nbe afraid of.\n  Frankly, the only thing anyone who opposes this bill should be afraid \nof is the wrath of American women across this country who are sick and \ntired of being told it is none of their business what their colleague \nis getting paid and: By the way, I don't have to explain to you why you \nmake less even though your work output has been superior to your male \ncolleagues. It is time and it is about our values.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I join my colleagues and thank the Senator from \nMissouri for her statement as somebody who has been involved in \nbasically making sure the law is implemented and upheld too. I \nappreciate her views.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski for her leadership in advocating for equal \npay for equal work. She has been a champion for many years and she is \ninsistent now that we pass this legislation, and that is why we are \nhere, because we want our colleagues to understand how important it is \nto pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nlegislation and end the discrimination many women face in America. This \nis a critical issue, not only for women but for men because, obviously, \nthe households of America deserve to have both people making equal pay.\n  The message from the American people is clear: They want Congress to \nfocus on the most important economic issues of the day; that is, jobs. \nAnd certainly having a job that pays you equally for the work you do \nwith your coworkers is critically important.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act is exactly what we should be working on, \nways to strengthen the pocketbooks of many Americans.\n  While we have made progress over the past five decades since we \npassed the Equal Pay Act, we still have a long way to go. In my State, \nthe State of Washington, women are paid 78 cents for every $1 that men \nearn for the same work. That amounts to an average wage gap of $11,000 \nper year. The truth is that many women are the breadwinners in their \nfamily, and they should be paid as breadwinners. They should not face \ndiscrimination.\n  Today women make up 48 percent of the workforce in the State of \nWashington, and these families are very important to our economy. On \naverage, mothers in Washington provide 41 percent of their household \nincome, and nationally 40 percent of women are the sole primary \nbreadwinners for their households. This is an important issue for our \neconomy. Think of the boost they would get, the boost we would see if \nthey were paid equally.\n  Right now one-third of those families headed by women in Washington \nlive in poverty, so closing the wage gap means they would be able to \nafford 82 more weeks of food, according to the National Partnership for \nWomen & Families. It would mean better economic freedom, it would mean \nthe ability to buy more essentials, and it means their families would \nbe better off.\n  But, more importantly, people need to realize that not only does this \npay gap affect women's ability to support their family, the pay gap \nalso reduces their ability to save for the future. From around the age \nof 35 through retirement, women are typically paid about 75 to 80 \npercent what men are paid, and over their lifetime a woman in \nWashington will earn $500,000 less than her male counterpart. That is \nmoney that can be saved and invested for the future. So we must pass \nthe Paycheck Fairness Act to end this disparity because this act will \nrequire employers to provide justification other than gender for paying \nmen higher wages than women for the exact same job. It protects \nemployees who share that information with others from being retaliated \nagainst, and it provides victims of pay discrimination with the same \nremedies available to victims of other discrimination, including \npunitive and compensation damages.\n  This is important legislation. It is important legislation that will \nend the discrimination women are seeing in the workplace.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act will also help eliminate the pay gap to \nhelp these families who are struggling in our economy. But just in case \npeople get the wrong idea, I want to make sure people are clear. Even \nin fields such as engineering and computer science, women earn, on \naverage, only 75 percent of what their male counterparts earn. A woman \nwith a master's degree will only make 70 cents for every $1 of her \nequally educated male counterparts.\n  It is time the Senate end the pay discrimination by passing the \nPaycheck Fairness Act. That is why I have been happy to sponsor this \nlegislation and work with my colleagues. I want young women growing up \ntoday to know this is not an issue they are going to have to deal with \nin the future. They will get equal pay.\n  I thank my colleagues. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle will help us in invoking cloture and providing the votes we need \nto pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I am proud to join this fight for paycheck fairness, \nan effort led by the dean of the women in the Senate, the first \nDemocratic woman ever elected to the Senate in her own right, and the \nlongest serving woman in Congress today--Senator Barbara Mikulski.\n  This is the same fight many of our own mothers and grandmothers \nfought, equal pay for equal work. The promise made by the Equal Pay Act \n50 years ago, literally half a century ago, continues to be broken \nevery single day in this country.\n  When that happens, it doesn't just hold back women individually, it \nholds back entire families. It holds back the entire American economy.\n  Today women make up more than half of America's population and nearly \nhalf the workforce. Women are outearning men in college degrees and \nadvanced degrees and a growing share of primary household earners. But \nto this day men are still outearning women for the exact same work. On \naverage, women earn 77 cents for every $1 a man earns and even less for \nwomen of color. African-American women earn 69 cents on the dollar and \nLatinas earn just 58 cents on the dollar.\n  In the years leading to the Equal Pay Act, only about 11 percent of \nfamilies relied on women as the primary wage earner for kids under 18--\njust 11 percent. Today 40 percent of primary or sole wage earners are \nwomen: 40 percent of families with kids under 18 who rely on women to \npay the bills, balance\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\nthe family finances, make the tough choices around the kitchen table, \nand provide for their kids.\n  But you would not know this by looking at America's workplace \npolicies. They are stuck in the past. They are stuck in the ``Mad Men'' \nera. Congress and State capitols have simply failed to keep up with the \npace of the new economy and the face of the modern American workplace.\n  This has to change. How can two-income families and sole female-\nbreadwinning households get ahead when they are shortchanged every \nsingle month? If we want a growing economy and a thriving middle class, \npay women fairly. It is that simple. When women earn equal pay, \nAmerica's GDP could grow by up to 4 percent. It is common sense, and it \nis the right thing to do to strengthen our economy and to strengthen \nour families.\n  So today, on Equal Pay Day, let's get this done. Let's pass the \nPaycheck Fairness Act and give America's women the fair shot they \ndeserve to earn their way ahead in today's economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I rise to speak about the importance of closing the \npay gap for women. I am a cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act--an \nimportant bill--and I am so honored to be here with my colleagues and \nthe leader of the women in the Senate, Senator Mikulski.\n  Today is Equal Pay Day, but it also marks the week where things are \nfinally warming up in my State after a long deep-freeze. We look as \nthough we are going to have 70 degrees. The snow will melt, the flowers \nwill bloom, and the message we are all here to bring is it is time to \nstop freezing the women of America out of this economy. The women of \nAmerica want to be treated fairly.\n  Now all the work we are doing--whether it is the minimum wage bill or \nthe unemployment compensation--is stuck somewhere in a deep freezer \nover in the House of Representatives, somewhere between the frozen peas \nand the chocolate ice cream, and it is time to thaw out the freezer in \nWashington, DC, and help the women of America. That is what this bill \nis about, that is what the minimum wage bill is about. People deserve a \nfair shot at the American dream.\n  I thank again Senator Mikulski and I thank her for her leadership in \nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. In 2009 we passed that bill to make \nsure that workers who face pay discrimination based on gender, race, \nage, religion, disability, or national origin have access to the \ncourts. In doing so, we restored the original intent of the Civil \nRights Act and the Equal Pay Act. Now it is time to prevent that pay \ndiscrimination from happening in the first place.\n  We all know women have made great strides in this economy. We have \nmade great strides in this body. We now have 20 women in the Senate \nbut, of course, we are still only at 20 percent. The Fortune 500 now \nhas 23 women CEOs, but I still think anyone who looks at this knows \nthere are great strides that have been made but great progress ahead.\n  Despite all this progress, women in this country still only earn \nclose to 80 cents for every $1 made by men. This pay gap has real \nconsequences for American families. Two-thirds of today's families rely \non a mother's income either in part or in entirety, and in more than \none-third of families the mother is the main breadwinner.\n  As Senate chair of the Joint Economic Committee, we released a report \nthis week that shows lower wages impact women all through their working \nlives. I think that is something people don't always think about, the \nfact that if women consistently make less money, and then you retire, \nand you are actually going to live longer than men, you have a lot less \nmoney to retire with in the first place.\n  In fact, women who retire have about $11,000 less per year than men. \nThat is very significant when you look at the age range where women \nwill be in retirement.\n  The other piece we don't always think about--unless you are in their \nposition--is women in the sandwich generation, women who are taking \ncare of aging parents at the same time they are taking care of \nchildren. That is happening every single day in this country as women \nare having to take leave from work or leave their job to take care of \nan aging parent while they are still struggling to afford to send their \nkids to college, to send their kids to daycare.\n  This legislation will build on the promises of the Equal Pay Act and \nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It will give women new tools and \nprotections to guard against pay discrimination and will help reaffirm \nthat basic principle that all women deserve equal pay for equal work.\n  I am hopeful we can get this done for the people of this country. It \nwas the late Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota who said: ``We all do \nbetter when we all do better.'' I still believe that is true, and so do \nmy colleagues who join me today.\n  We need to focus on this bill. We need to unfreeze some old beliefs, \nand we need to bring a little Spring into the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, Senator Mikulski and I were just \nwhispering to each other about how far we have come since the day Anita \nHill came to the Hill and we couldn't do much to help her, but we \norganized and recognized that women had to be here in numbers \nsufficient to make a difference and clearly, today, we are.\n  My colleague Senator Mikulski is our dean of the women. All she is \nbasically saying, with all of us as an echo chamber, is this: Women \ndeserve a fair shot. It is long past time for us to stop shortchanging \nhalf of the country and their families.\n  I want to show us a chart that looks at what happens to a woman in a \nyear when she gives up $11,000 because she is not being paid, for the \nsame job, the same amount a man is. What could that $11,000 do?\n  She could buy a year of groceries, she could provide a year of rent, \na year of daycare, she could buy a used car, and she could afford \ncommunity college. That is 1 year. Look at what happens over the course \nof a lifetime when because a woman is not getting her fair share, the \nequal amount that she deserves, she is only getting 77 cents on the \ndollar. It is $443,000. What could she do with that? Pay off her entire \nmortgage, send three kids to the University of California--a great \nschool, I might say--and buy 8,000 tanks of gas.\n  What is the point of all of this? It is to show that the dollars \nwomen are not getting could be going into the community, could be \nmaking sure their families are taken care of, and would make all the \ndifference in the world. Now, I was a little startled to see some of my \nRepublican friends on the other side--Republican Members of the House--\nsay this is demeaning to women. That is what I got out of a news \nreport--that women don't need this. Would they have said that about \nchildren? Did children need protection against child labor? The answer \nis yes. Did workers need protection from a 14-hour day when they were \nbeing exploited? Yes. Did we need to make sure people in hazardous \nworkplaces, such as chemical companies, have appropriate protective \ngear? Yes. Did we need to make sure there are fire exits in a crowded \nfactory, after we saw a horrific fire called the Triangle fire? Yes. \nNow we need to make sure that women get equal pay for equal work.\n\n  This is just part of the continuum of bending that arc of history \ntoward justice. That is what is happening here under the leadership of \nSenator Mikulski and all of us who stand on her shoulders. I have to \nsay it is a great day. It is a great day to hear my colleagues come to \nthe floor and speak as one. We are speaking not only for the women of \nAmerica, who make up more than half, but for their families.\n  That is the point. Two-thirds of women are either the sole head of \nhousehold or they share in providing for the economic well-being of \ntheir families. This is a matter of justice. It is a matter of \nfairness. It is a matter of a fair shot. I am proud to stand with my \ncolleagues.\n  I hope and pray we will get the 60 votes necessary. There is a \nfilibuster going on, as usual. We need a supermajority. But I would say \nto my colleagues on the other side that too many women have to be super \nwomen. So give them a supermajority. They are super women who are \nholding down\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\nnot one job but two jobs. So please help us. Let's celebrate tomorrow \nwith a great vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I want to start by expressing my deep \nthanks and appreciation to Senator Mikulski for her tremendous \nleadership in the fight for equal pay and for bringing the Paycheck \nFairness Act to the forefront of the debate this session.\n  The role of women in our families and in our economy has really \nshifted dramatically over the last few decades. Today 60 percent of \nfamilies rely on earnings from both parents. That is up from 37 percent \nin 1975--60 percent. Women today make up nearly half the workforce, and \nmore than ever women are likely to be the primary breadwinner in their \nfamilies. Women are making a difference in our economy, in board rooms, \nlecture halls and small businesses.\n  But despite the important progress we have made since the Equal Pay \nAct passed now 50 years ago, including passing the Lilly Ledbetter Act \nin 2009--thanks again to Senator Mikulski--giving women more tools to \nfight against pay discrimination, women's wages have not caught up with \nthe times. Across the country today women still earn 77 cents on the \ndollar, on average, to do the exact same work as men. It would take a \ntypical woman until today to earn what a man would earn doing the same \nwork in 2013.\n  That difference really adds up. In Seattle, in my home State, last \nyear women earned 73 cents on the dollar--73 cents on the dollar--\ncompared to their male counterparts. That translated to a yearly gap of \n$16,346. Nationwide, over a typical woman's lifetime, pay \ndiscrimination amounts to $464,320 in lost wages. That is not only \nunfair to women, it is bad for our families, and it is bad for our \neconomy.\n  At a time when more and more families rely on women's wages to put \nfood on the table or stay in their homes or build a nest egg for \nretirement or help pay for their children's education, it is absolutely \ncritical we do more to eliminate pay discrimination and unfairness in \nthe workplace. The Paycheck Fairness Act would tackle pay \ndiscrimination head on. It would ramp up enforcement of equal pay laws \nand strengthen assistance to businesses to improve equal pay practices. \nI hope we can all agree that 21st century workers should be compensated \nbased on how they do their job, not whether they are male or female.\n  I hope to be able to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act as quickly as \npossible for working women and their families in this country, but we \ncan't stop there. We need to build then on these critical reforms with \nother steps toward giving women a better and a fairer shot at getting \nahead. One out of four women in the United States today would benefit \nfrom raising the minimum wage. That is 15 million American women who \nare making the equivalent of about 2 gallons of gas per hour. It is \nclearly time to raise the minimum wage and give working women in the \ncountry some much deserved relief.\n  There are other ways we can, and should be, updating our policies to \nhelp working women and their families make ends meet. For example, \nthanks to our outdated Tax Code, a woman who is thinking about \nreentering the workforce as the second earner in her family is likely \ngoing to face higher tax rates than her husband. That would come in \naddition to increased costs that she would then have with child care \nand transportation and the possibility of losing tax credits and other \nbenefits as her household income rises. All of this means struggling \nfamilies will experience higher tax rates than what many of the \nwealthiest Americans pay. This can discourage a potential second \nearner, such as a mom who is talking about reentering the workforce and \nreturning to her professional career.\n  I recently introduced the 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act, which \nwould help solve this problem by giving struggling two-earner families \nwith children a tax deduction on the second earner's income. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimates that change alone would cut taxes by an \naverage of $700 for 7.3 million families next year.\n  The 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act would also expand the EITC for \nchildless workers and lower the eligibility age so that people without \ndependents and young workers just starting out can benefit from the \ncredit.\n  By the way, this has bipartisan support. It builds on work incentives \nfrom the EITC and is paid for by getting rid of wasteful corporate tax \nloopholes that both Ways and Means Chairman Camp and Democrats agree \nought to be closed.\n  Opinion leaders from across the political spectrum have said this \nbill would provide much-needed relief to workers and families. One \nconservative commentator wrote in the National Review that the 21st \nCentury Worker Tax Cut Act is ``a serious proposal that has the \npotential to better the lives of a large number of workers.'' A New \nYork Times editorial columnist says it would be ``a huge benefit to \nlow-income childless families and two-earner families.''\n  So I am hopeful that here in Congress we will see similar support on \nboth sides of the aisle for a bill that would help women and working \nfamilies keep more of what they earn.\n  We have come a long way in terms of the opportunities women have in \nour country today, but there is no question we have a lot more work to \ndo. If we take these steps I have talked about, and that others here \nare talking about, we will do much to break down the very real barriers \nthat still exist today. We will help working women and their families, \nwe will strengthen our economy, and we will expand opportunity for the \nnext generation of women who enter the workforce.\n  So I am here today to urge my colleagues to support the Paycheck \nFairness Act and then build on that step by continuing to help level \nthe playing field for American women and their families.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, this isn't only a women's fight, \nthough we reserved this time. There are many good men in the Senate who \nwill stand shoulder to shoulder with us, and I know the Senator from \nWest Virginia would like to have 2 minutes before he presides. I yield \nhim 2 minutes. Actually, I should yield him 77 percent of what we got, \nbut he is for equal pay and so gets equal time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. That would be 1 minute and 45 seconds, I say to the \nChairwoman.\n  I thank the chairwoman for what she does and how well she has been \nleading this charge for all of us. As a proud husband of a brilliant \nand talented woman, my wife Gayle, and as the father of two daughters \nand the grandfather of six granddaughters, all of whom are gifted and \nmake great contributions to our country, I believe it is past time \nwomen earn the same amount as men in the workplace. We need to correct \nthis unfairness to make sure women are paid what they deserve.\n  As we join together today to celebrate Equal Pay Day in the year \n2014, it just defies common sense that working women in West Virginia \nearn only 70--not 77 but 70--cents to every dollar a man makes. Too \nmany families are working too hard to make ends meet, and especially in \nfamilies where women are the breadwinners.\n  In West Virginia there are more than 81,000 family households headed \nby women. About 36 percent of those families, or nearly 29,200 family \nhouseholds, have incomes that fall below the poverty level. Eliminating \nthe wage gap would provide much needed income to women whose wages put \nfood on the table, pay the bills, and maintain a respectable quality of \nlife for their children and families.\n  Growing up I was blessed to be raised by two strong, hardworking \nwomen--my grandmother, affectionately known as Mama Kay, and my mother. \nBy example, both of these wonderful ladies taught me that women can \nwork just as hard, if not harder, with more responsibilities, and they \nshould get paid the same as a man. As a matter of fact, they probably \nshould get overtime. There is no reason why they shouldn't have \nreceived the same pay for the same job as men, and that certainly \nresonates today.\n  Since I joined the Senate, I have been proud to have cosponsored the \nPaycheck Fairness Act. The very first vote\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\nI took in the Senate was for paycheck fairness. Until Congress passes \nthis truly commonsense bill, I will continue to fight for paycheck \nfairness because the bottom line is people should earn the same pay for \nthe same work, period, no excuses.\n  As a former governor, most of my decisionmaking was made around good \nstrong women who sat down and gave me the facts and nothing but the \nfacts, and I appreciated that.\n  It shouldn't matter whether you are a man or a woman. You should be \ntreated fairly no matter what, no matter where you are or what you do.\n  I thank our chairman, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Senator Heitkamp.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Thank you so much. I want to thank our great friend and \ngreat leader from the State of Maryland for continuing her hard work. I \nwonder if she ever wakes up in the morning and wonders when it is ever \ngoing to be done. When are we going to see justice? I am sure she has \nlearned over the years that until you stand up every day and live a \nlife where you are trying to make positive change in America, it \ndoesn't get done. She is somebody who has never given up.\n  It is interesting that North Dakota, as West Virginia, is one of \nthose States where women earn less than men, and below the national \naverage less than men. When we look at the national average and 77 \npercent, that is a horrible statistic. But what is really horrible is \nif you live that statistic.\n  Not one person in this body lives that statistic. We are all treated \nequally. It doesn't matter what gender we are. If we are Members of \nCongress, we are treated equally. Imagine the outpouring of sympathy \nand support if we got 77 percent of a male's salary. We would think \nthat was atrocious. We would think how could that possibly happen in \nAmerica. But it happens every day in America.\n  It happens every day for working women who are supporting their \nfamilies, women who go to work 40, 50 or 60 hours to support their \nfamilies and to improve the economies of their State. And they keep \nspinning their wheels. They keep working at trying to change this and \ndon't seem to get any further ahead. How many of us could take a 25-\npercent reduction in salary? That is really what we are asking every \nwoman in America to do--not across the board but certainly on average--\nasking every woman in America to take a 25-percent reduction in her \nsalary. That is not fair, and it should not be the facts of 2014. It \nshould not be the way things are.\n\n  There has been a lot of discussion around the opportunities for \nwomen, and obviously we have grown. You cannot see 20 women in the \nSenate and not think that we are making some progress. But we have to \nthink not only about women in professional occupations but women who \nare school cooks and janitors, such as my mother. The women who are \nworking every day at the diner to put food on their family's table and \nfood on the tables of their patrons.\n  So when we are talking about this, I must also mention the need for \nan increase in the minimum wage, which is a topic for further \ndiscussion on the floor. I would like to remind my fellow Senators that \nthe current minimum wage, which is overrepresented by women in terms of \nthe number of people earning minimum wage, is less than 9 percent of a \ncongressional salary. We have people in this body who think that the \nsalary they receive is inadequate, but we expect people to work 40 \nhours a week for the minimum wage. Even if you had two minimum wage \njobs--think about it--working 40 hours a week on two of those minimum \nwage jobs, you still would make less than $32,000 a year working 80 \nhours a week. That is the story of many women in this country.\n  When we were growing up and women were in the workforce, it used to \nbe they were working for that extra income. There was this excuse given \nover and over: She is just supplementing the income, and the man is the \nbreadwinner. She is earning a little extra so she can buy a \nrefrigerator or whatever it is.\n  That is not the reality of today. The reality of today is that more \nwomen are the primary or the sole breadwinners for their family. We \nhave to correct this problem.\n  I have listened to the debate on the other side saying there are \nother ideas on how to do this. This won't promote or give a way forward \nfor change. These are the same people who think if you just maintain \nthe status quo, somehow things will magically change in the Senate. \nAfter 20 or 30 or 40 years of this struggle, what would suggest to us \nthat we are going to get parity if we don't take some pretty proactive \naction here in the Senate and in the Congress to say that what a woman \ndoes is valuable and it is at least as valuable as what a man does in \nthe exact same job. That is who we are in this country. We are gender \nneutral, and that is what we are trying to do. We are trying to \nmaintain gender neutrality, maintain a good economy because we know if \nwe put more money into women's family budgets, that money is going to \ngo out and grow our economy even more.\n  The bottom line is this. Let's have a little sympathy in this body \nfor people who earn less than 20 percent of what a Senator earns. Let's \ngive them a show of support, a thank you from a grateful country for \nthe hard work they put in every day. Let's tell them that the words in \nthe Constitution and the promise of equality are still not realized, \nbut we can work together to make that a reality in their lives.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I would like to start by thanking Senator \nMikulski for organizing us today and much more importantly for her \nleadership over the years on this issue. We are so proud to have her as \nour dean.\n  I come to the floor today on Equal Pay Day to stand and speak about \nan issue that impacts women and families in every State across this \ncountry. Today I rise to give voice to the belief that we need to be \nworking together across party aisles to build an America where hard \nwork is rewarded and where there is a fair shot for everyone to realize \ntheir pursuits and dreams.\n  In America today the growing gap between rich and everyone else is at \nits largest point in 100 years. The absence of upward mobility for \nhard-working families demands action because if we cannot close this \ngap we might someday talk about the middle class as something we used \nto have, not something that each generation can aspire to.\n  As I have traveled through my home State of Wisconsin, they have told \nme that the powerful and well connected seem to get to write their own \nrules while the concerns and struggles of middle-class families often \ngo unnoticed here in Washington. They feel as if our economic system is \ntilted towards those at the top and that our political system exists to \nprotect unfair advantages, instead of making sure that everybody gets a \nfair shot.\n  I rise to give voice to the fact that there is paycheck inequality \nfor hard-working American women across this country and that it is time \nwe do something about it. Working women make up over 50 percent of our \nworkforce, and they are working harder than ever to get ahead. And they \ndeserve to get ahead. Many are working full time, and many are working \ntwo jobs to make ends meet. Yet far too many are barely getting by, and \nfar too many women and children are living in poverty. The least we can \ndo is level the playing field and give women a fair shot at getting \nahead because they deserve equal pay for equal work. It is simply \nunfair that women are paid on average 77 cents for every dollar paid to \na man. This reality is holding women back, and it is holding our entire \neconomy back.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues today to deliver a call for action \nto pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and give women equal pay for equal \nwork. This legislation will help close the paycheck gap for women, it \nwill help create upward mobility for women, and it will help strengthen \nthe economic security of millions of families across our country.\n  Let me take the time to tell you just one story of one woman. Shannon \nis a single mother of three from Two Rivers, WI. Shannon is working \nhard to\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\nsupport her family, but the pay gap is holding her back. Shannon has \ncontinued her education to advance her career as an interpreter in a \nschool, but she faces the grim reality that women teachers are often \npaid less than their male counterparts.\n  In fact--and this is so hard to believe--statistics collected by our \nDepartment of Labor make it clear that women earn less than men in \nalmost all occupations commonly held by women. Passing the Paycheck \nFairness Act will help close the pay gap and provide Shannon and so \nmany others with financial freedom for their families.\n  It would help Shannon manage issues that working moms face every \nsingle day--unexpected car problems, children outgrowing their pants \nand shoes, the anxiety of not being able to save a little bit from \ntheir paycheck to someday send their children to college. To put this \nin the simplest terms possible, it would give Shannon a fair shot at \npassing on a stronger future for her children.\n  Today women working full time in Wisconsin go home with $10,324 less \na year than their male counterparts. In Wisconsin, 31 percent of \nhouseholds headed by working women have incomes that fall below the \npoverty level. This is simply wrong, and it is our job to work together \nto change that. Millions of American women get up everyday to work hard \nfor that middle-class dream: a good job that pays the bills, health \ncare coverage you can rely on, a home you can call your own, a chance \nto save for your kids' college education, and a secure retirement. But \ninstead, gender discrimination is holding women and their families \nback. Eliminating the pay gap will make families more secure.\n  Nearly 60 percent of women would earn more if women were paid the \nsame as men of the same experience with similar education and hours of \nwork. The poverty rate for women would be cut in half. It is wrong for \nus to ignore the gap between the economic security that American women \nwork so hard to achieve and the economic uncertainty that they are \nasked to settle for. With a record number of women in the workforce \ntoday, the right thing to do is to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and \nempower women with a fair shot at equal pay.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in working to pass the Paycheck \nFairness Act because it would strengthen families and our economy by \nproviding working women with the tools they need to close the gender \npay gap. It will show the American people our commitment to working \ntogether to provide a fair shot for everyone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Paycheck Fairness Act. \nI would like to first commend the senior Senator from Maryland for her \nfearless and tireless leadership on this issue. She has been a protean \nforce when it comes to this issue and many others. I deeply admire and \nrespect her.\n  This week I held my annual roundtable with the Women's Fund in \nProvidence. We talked about equal rights, equal pay, and economic \nopportunity and justice with women who are creating jobs and fighting \ninequality everyday.\n  Today, as my colleagues have pointed out, we mark Equal Pay Day. \nWomen would have to work until April 8 of this year just to earn what \nmen did as of December 31 of last year. Passing the Paycheck Fairness \nAct will move us one step closer to being able to commemorate Equal Pay \nDay on December 31 each year for both men and women, and that is what \nwe should be striving for.\n  This year we are marking the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act \nand the war on poverty. We have come a long way, but our efforts to \nform a more perfect, more equal union must continue forward. When \nPresident Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law in 1963, women were \nearning an average of 59 cents on the dollar compared to men.\n  No matter how you slice it, median annual earnings, weekly earnings, \nby level of education or occupation, there is still a gender gap in pay \ntoday.\n  The Women's Fund of Rhode Island issued a report showing that gender \ndiscrimination in pay is even more striking for minority women. In \nRhode Island African-American women make 61 cents for every dollar that \na white male makes. For Latinas the figure is 51 cents. This gender \ndiscrimination pay gap affects women at all educational levels.\n  According to the Council of Economic Advisers, women are more likely \nto complete college--that is right. Today women are completing college \nmore than men. In 2012, 25- to 34-year-old women were 21 percent more \nlikely than men to be college graduates, but this is not closing the \nearnings gap. To all those who say it is all about education, and these \npeople have more education, that is wrong. It is not.\n  Women who earn advanced degrees start off on a relatively even \nfooting--people with a Master's or a Ph.D. But again, over the course \nof their careers the wage gap widens in favor of men. The National \nPartnership for Women and Families reports that women with Master's \ndegrees are paid 70 cents for every dollar paid to men with Master's \ndegrees, and women with Master's degrees earn less than men with \nBachelor's degrees.\n  Equal pay for equal work is not only an issue of equity. It has real \neconomic consequences. Families rely on women's income. Data analyzed \nby the National Partnership for Women and Families show that women are \nthe primary or sole breadwinners in 40 percent of families. If we \neliminate gender discrimination in pay in Rhode Island, a working woman \nwould have enough extra money to buy 74 more weeks of food for her \nfamily, to make 6 more months of mortgage and utilities payments, or to \npay 11 more months of rent. That just doesn't help the woman; it helps \nthe family.\n  One of the best tools in fighting poverty is to close the pay gap. \nThe Paycheck Fairness Act will help fulfill the promise of the Equal \nPay Act by improving the remedies available to women facing gender \ndiscrimination. These are commonsense and fair improvements for our \nmothers, our daughters, our sisters, our fathers, our sons, and our \nbrothers.\n  We must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. We believe everyone deserves \na fair shot, and that includes equal pay for equal work. I urge my \ncolleagues to come together to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, and with \nthat I will yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, almost 51 years after the enactment \nof the Equal Pay Act, women now make up almost half of the workforce; \nhowever, gender-based wage discrimination is still pervasive. \nStatistics show that there is a significant difference in the pay of \nmen and women performing the same or substantially similar jobs, \nregardless of the education level or type of occupation. Looking at the \naverage pay for women, women get paid about 77 cents for every dollar \nearned by similar male workers.\n  The experience of women in the workforce is better in California but \nnot by much. According to the most recent census estimates, in \nCalifornia, the average pay for a woman working full time, year round \nis $41,956 per year, while the average for a man is $50,139. This means \nthat, on average, women in California are paid less than 84 cents for \nevery dollar paid to men. Put another way, this amounts to a yearly gap \nof $8,183 between full-time working men and women in the State. Over \nthe course of a career, on average, women stand to lose $434,000 in \nincome and thus enjoy fewer Social Security, pension, and retirement \nbenefits.\n  Latina women face greater disparities in the workplace as they are \npaid approximately 54 cents for every dollar paid to men. Women of \ncolor fare similarly.\n  As a group, full-time working women in California alone lose over \n$37.5 billion each year due to the wage gap.\n  According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, if the \ngender-based ``pay gap'' were eliminated, a working woman in California \nwould have enough money for approximately 59 more weeks of food, 4 more \nmonths of mortgage and utilities payments, 7 more months of rent, or \n2,103 additional gallons of gas.\n  A Redondo Beach resident wrote to me, ``I know that at my current \nage, I have been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars less than my \ncolleagues, though I am also paying my rent . . .\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\nsupporting my kids, and trying to figure out how I can possibly pay for \ncolleges for them. If I had been earning a fair wage, I could afford \ncollege, and healthcare, and would have some retirement savings, all \nthings that I cannot currently do.''\n  She is absolutely right--it is estimated that it takes a woman 4\\1/2\\ \nmore months of work to earn the same as her male counterpart earns in \njust 1 year. Yet she still must pay for the same monthly expenses as \nher male colleagues. In Redondo Beach, her monthly expenses can be \ncrippling.\n  A single adult with two children living in Redondo Beach spends \nmonthly around $536 in food, $767 in child care, $451 in medical care, \n$1,420 in housing, and $639 in transportation, not to mention taxes. \nConsidering that over 1.7 million households in California are headed \nby women, over 500,000 of whom fall below the poverty level as it is, \ndenying California women equal pay for equal work adds to their burden \nand affects their families.\n  This is not just a problem for low-income women and families. The pay \ngap exists across the spectrum of education levels and occupations. \nAccording to the 2012 S 500 CEO Pay Study, although companies run by \nfemale chief executive officers performed better on average than those \nrun by men--looking at the total shareholder return for their \ncompanies--those female CEOs were paid an average of about $500,000 \nless per year than their male CEO counterparts. And the pay gap is \nwider for women with higher education, making it more difficult for \nthem to pay off their school loans.\n  Congress tried to address the problem by passing the Equal Pay Act in \n1963, which amended the Fair Labor Standards Act, making it illegal for \nemployers to pay unequal wages to men and women who perform \nsubstantially the same work. However, as is reflected in wage data \nstatistics and in the stories shared by women across the country, while \nthe Equal Pay Act was a step in the right direction, more needs to be \ndone to clarify the law.\n  Congress recently had to correct the courts on how to interpret pay \ndiscrimination laws in line with their original intent by passing the \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. Through Lilly Ledbetter, Congress \namended title VII of the Civil Rights Act to clarify the timeframes in \nwhich employees could bring a claim against employers who engage in pay \ndiscrimination.\n  But according to recent studies, Congress needs to strengthen the law \nfurther in order to effectively close the pay gap between men and women \nacross the spectrum. The disparity in pay between men and women is the \nsame as it was in 2002. If we keep going at this rate, without \ncongressional action, women will not reach pay equity until 2058.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act therefore provides Congress with an \nopportunity to eliminate this unfair pay gap. It will reasonably update \nthe Equal Pay Act by eliminating loopholes used for far too long in \ncourtrooms; strengthening incentives to employers to prevent pay \ndiscrimination through remedies available under current law to victims \nof race-based and national origin discrimination; improving wage data \ncollection so that we can better evaluate the pay gap; and by \nstrengthening education, training, outreach, and enforcement efforts to \nclose the pay gap.\n  This bill also importantly provides that employers are prohibited \nfrom retaliating against employees who share salary information with \ntheir coworkers. Nearly half of all workers in the United States are \nstrongly discouraged or even have workplace policies against the \nsharing of salary information. This secrecy makes it extremely \ndifficult for employees to detect pay discrimination and contributes to \nthe pay gap. For example, Lilly Ledbetter was paid less than her male \ncoworkers for almost 20 years but did not realize it because a company \npolicy prohibited her from discussing her pay with her coworkers. She \ndiscovered the pay discrimination only when someone sent her an \nanonymous note.\n  Under the Paycheck Fairness Act, employees would therefore generally \nbe protected from retaliation when they discuss or inquire about their \nwages or the wages of another employee. They would also be protected \nfrom retaliation if they make a charge, file a complaint, or \nparticipate in a government or employer-initiated investigation. These \nantiretaliation provisions would generally not protect employees such \nas payroll or HR personnel who have access to wage information as an \nessential function of their job. Rather, the antiretaliation provisions \nwould enable employees to learn about their employers' wage practices \nwithout being afraid of losing their jobs. With such information, \nemployees will be better suited to close the gender pay gap for \nthemselves and others.\n  I recognize the concerns of business owners who maintain that \namending the Equal Pay Act will open them up to liability and risk \nharming their business. I have heard concerns that employers fear that \nthis bill will infringe on their private business practices should it \nbecome law.\n  After considering and reconsidering the effects of this legislation \nwith the concerns of business owners in mind and after consulting with \nexperts in employment and labor law, I came to the conclusion that this \nbill is necessary to level the playing field and does not have to \nnecessarily affect business practices so long as those business \npractices do not discriminate against women.\n  As under the current law, employers would not be helpless or \ndefenseless--they can proactively conduct an internal pay-equity \nanalysis to ensure equal pay for equal work before government \nintervention. In fact, the bill provides for a 6-month waiting period \nfrom the time of enactment, and the Department of Labor would assist \nsmall businesses with compliance.\n  Should a claim arise, employers have affirmative defenses that they \ncan raise to justify pay differences, such as if the wages are set \nbased on a seniority system; a merit system; a system that measures \nearnings by quantity or quality of product; or a bona fide factor other \nthan sex, such as education, training, or experience, which is job-\nrelated and serves a legitimate business interest.\n  I am not in the habit of supporting bills that advance women just \nbecause I am a woman. I am supporting this bill because I believe in \nadvancing equal rights and uplifting millions of families who rely on a \nwoman's paycheck in order to eat.\n  I am not alone in hearing stories about paycheck disparities in \nCalifornia. My colleagues have heard similar stories from women in \ntheir States. We also know that women are critical to driving this \neconomy, and by ensuring equal pay for equal work, the entire economy \nbenefits.\n  With the knowledge of pervasive inequality still today in pay among \nmen and women and considering that the majority of Americans support \nthe government taking steps to enable women to get equal pay for equal \nwork, it is our duty to vote in favor of cloture and for swift passage \nof the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for those comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:30 p.m., \nthe Senate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar Nos. 556 \nand 502; that there be 2 minutes for debate equally divided between the \ntwo leaders or their designees prior to each vote; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote, with no intervening \naction or debate, on the nominations in the order listed; further, that \nthe motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; \nthat no further motions be in order to the nominations; that any \nstatements related to the nominations be printed in the Record; that \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for weeks Republicans have been trying \nto get Democrats to focus on the one issue Americans say they care the \nmost about, and that is jobs and the economy. Everyone agrees we are in \nthe midst of a jobs crisis in our country. Republicans are saying: Here \nare some concrete things we can actually\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n\ndo about it. But Democrats have completely shut us out. If government \nisn't part of the solution or if it doesn't drive a wedge between one \ngroup of people and another, they are just not interested.\n  Here is one idea that I proposed and Democrats have brushed aside: \nHow about helping workers better balance the demands of work and family \nby allowing them time off as a form of overtime compensation? This is \nan idea that is tailored to the needs of the modern workforce. It is \nsomething a lot of working women say they want, and it is something \ngovernment employees have already enjoyed for years. What we are saying \nis to give today's working women in the private sector the same kind of \nflexibility working women have in the government.\n  Everybody is familiar with the idea of getting paid time-and-a-half \nfor overtime work. What this bill would do is give people the choice of \ngetting a proportionate bump in time off for overtime work. So if you \nwork an extra hour, you can get an hour-and-a-half off work. This \nshould be a no-brainer. This is a concrete proposal to help men and \nwomen adapt to the needs of the modern workplace and for the workplace \nto adapt to the modern workforce. This is not just a way to help \nworkers, it is a way to especially help working women. Flexibility is a \nmajor part of achieving work-life balance, especially for working moms. \nThat is what this amendment is all about.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 2199, that all postcloture time be yielded back \nand the Senate proceed to the consideration of the bill and that it be \nin order for me to offer amendment No. 2962, and then for the majority \nleader or his designee to offer an amendment, and then it be in order \nfor the leaders or their designees to continue to offer amendments in \nan alternating fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request I would \nlike to put forward as well. I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is \ninvoked on the motion to proceed to S. 2199, that all postcloture time \nbe yielded back and the Senate proceed to consideration of the bill, \nand that it be in order for me to offer amendment No. 2964, and then \nfor the majority leader or his designee to offer an amendment, and it \nbe in order for the leaders or their designees to continue to offer \namendments in an alternating fashion with the following amendments on \nthe Republican side in order: McConnell amendment No. 2962, Fischer \namendment No. 2963, Alexander amendment No. 2965, and Lee amendment No. \n2966.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would my friend give the subject matter of \nthose three amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from South Dakota state the \nsubject matter of those amendments?\n  Mr. THUNE. The McConnell amendment has to deal with flexibility in \nthe workplace and comp time, the Fischer amendment has to do with \nantidiscrimination in the workplace, and I believe the Lee amendment \nalso deals with comp time flexibility in the workplace.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, is here, and I think \nhe can speak to his amendment. Most of them deal with the pending \nbusiness, S. 2199, which is the Pay Equity Act that the majority leader \nexpects to get a cloture vote on later. We simply ask to have an \nopportunity to offer amendments that pertain to that bill, on issues we \nthink are important in addressing the issue that is before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, is the Alexander amendment, \nwhich the Senator from South Dakota suggested, the 350-page amendment \nthat was offered last week?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if I may respond to the majority \nleader, the answer is no. The Alexander amendment, I say to my friend \nfrom Nevada, is a pretty simple amendment. It talks about giving \nworking parents more flexibility so they can go to soccer games and \npiano recitals; in other words, to be better parents.\n  A few years ago Captain Kangaroo, Robert Keeshan, and I--along with \nsome other people--started a company. After our company merged with \nanother company, it became the largest worksite daycare company in \nAmerica. What we found out was that the greatest value working parents \nwith young children wanted was flexibility. Our fear is that this \nproposal, which is called paycheck fairness, would actually limit the \nflexibility of employers can give to working parents so they can go to \ntheir children's activities.\n\n  My amendment is a very simple amendment. It is only a paragraph or \ntwo, and it simply restates the law and makes it clear that if you run \na dry cleaner with three people in it, you don't have to hire a lawyer \nto define a job for an employee with a child in such a way that that \nemployee can go to the piano recital or soccer game. Instead of being \nabout more litigation, it is about giving more flexibility for working \nparents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Before my friend from South Dakota leaves the floor, 2964 \nis the big one?\n  Mr. THUNE. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I am happy to see a number \nof Republican colleagues come to the floor. We have been talking about \nthis issue for days now and to discuss, I thought, the subject of equal \npay for women. But there has been no talk about equal pay for women. \nThe closest of anything in that regard that has been suggested has been \na bill that says if you have to work overtime, then you have a choice \nof going home or doing the overtime.\n  The reason we don't have laws like that is because the employer can \ntake advantage of the employee because the employee is at the beck and \ncall of the employer, and I think most labor laws would protect against \nthat now.\n  I am surprised we have literally heard no one come to the floor \nexcept on the one occasion--and I could have missed it--where the \nRepublican Senator made the statement that Senator Mikulski's \nlegislation was a trial lawyer's dream. The women who have come to the \nfloor to talk about this--and the men who have come to talk about this \ntoday, including the Presiding Officer, and I heard his statement--are \nsimply trying to say we need to be sure this is a fair shot for the \nmiddle class, and in this instance it is women. But the Republicans \nalways want to change the subject. Why don't we have a debate on \nwhether women are entitled to have the same pay as men?\n  The Senate is debating the motion to proceed to the equal pay bill, \nso the question before the Senate is whether we should even begin \ndebate on this matter. If Senators wish to offer amendments, they would \nhave to begin the debate.\n  I am always happy to talk about amendments, but the amendment of my \nfriend from South Dakota is nothing that is reasonable. What that \namendment does is offer lots of amendments. I think if we look closely \nat this 350-page amendment, we might even find the kitchen sink in it. \nIt has everything else in it. It is really a perfect example of trying \nto divert attention from the subject at hand. This is not a serious \neffort to legislate equal pay for equal work.\n  My colleague's unanimous consent request would also allow for a \npotentially unlimited number of amendments. We have been there before, \nand we know that does not work. Providing an unlimited number of \namendments is just another way of saying they want to filibuster the \nbill, which they have done so artfully over the last 5 years.\n  My door remains open to further discussions, but I object to the \nrequests that have been made, including the one that I anticipate from \nmy friend from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Is there anything pending? I want to make sure there are no \npending requests for unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n[[Page S2219]]\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I think what we just heard was a number of \nour Members have amendments they are going to talk about and offer when \nwe get on the bill--and I assume we will at some point--so we can \ndebate and vote on them. We are talking about an issue that is \nimportant to people across this country, and we have amendments that we \nthink would improve, strengthen, make better the bill that is going to \nbe on the floor that has been described as the Pay Equity Act by the \nDemocrats.\n  We actually think there is a better way to do this. We think there is \na way that actually would improve the wages, provide better job \nopportunities, and better opportunities for advancement for women.\n  This morning the majority leader quoted Ralph Waldo Emerson who said, \n``America is another name for opportunity.'' I could not agree more \nwith that statement. The American dream is to work hard and achieve \nupward mobility. Americans want good jobs, and they want to earn a fair \nwage. But the current Obama economy is doing everything it can to hurt \nthe American dream.\n  The economy is stagnant. There are 10 million Americans who are \nunemployed--nearly 4 million for 6 months or longer. Household income \nhas fallen. Right now there are 3.7 million more women living in \npoverty than there were when the President took office. I will repeat \nthat. There are 3.7 million more women living in poverty today than \nthere were when the President took office. The median income for women \nhas dropped by $733 since President Obama took office. That is why this \nbody should be focused on enacting policies that lift the government-\nimposed burdens that impede job opportunities and economic growth.\n\n  I have offered an amendment--and I just asked unanimous consent to be \nable to have it debated and voted on when we get on this bill--that \nactually is focused on enacting policies that lift the government-\nimposed burdens that impede job opportunities and economic growth. It \nis called the Good Jobs, Good Wages, and Good Hours Act. It would help \nreturn America to a place where there are good job opportunities.\n  My amendment would help create good-paying jobs by reining in \nburdensome regulatory requirements, shielding workers from the damaging \neffects of ObamaCare, approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, and providing \npermanent tax relief to employers that are looking to expand and hire.\n  Republicans could not agree more that women should have equal \nopportunities and pay in the workplace. Unfortunately, the legislation \nour friends on the other side are pushing will not accomplish that \ngoal. Their legislation would increase Federal regulations that would \ncut flexibility in the workplace for working moms and end merit pay \nthat rewards quality work.\n  The Democrats seem to be trying to change the subject of how their \nideas are actually hurting women in the workforce. Of those affected by \nthe Democrats' ObamaCare 30-hour workweek that is reducing wages, 63 \npercent are women. So that policy of going to a 30-hour workweek that \nwas defined as such in ObamaCare, 63 percent of the impact of that is \nbeing felt by women. Of the roughly 500,000 jobs that CBO projects will \nbe lost by the end of 2016 thanks to the Democrats' 40-percent minimum \nwage hike, 235,000 of those--or 57 percent--would be jobs that are held \nby women. Disproportionately, these policies are going to hurt women.\n  The poverty rate for women has increased to 16.3 percent from 14.4 \npercent as of when the President took office. So the poverty rate is \nhigher. We have women who are living in worse economic conditions than \nwhen the President took office. If the Democrats were truly serious \nabout fixing that problem--if they are truly serious about helping \nwomen--they would work with us on bills to create jobs and to expand \nworkplace opportunities for women and for men as well. That is exactly \nwhat my amendment does. It addresses the problems created by ObamaCare, \nit includes a provision pushed by Senator Collins that would restore \nthe 40-hour workweek I mentioned earlier, and it will finally repeal \nthe job-destroying medical device tax for which Senators Toomey, Hatch, \nand Coats have been tirelessly fighting.\n  My amendment ensures that veterans and the long-term unemployed are \nnot punished by the costs of the ObamaCare employer mandate in that \nlegislation. Senator Blunt has raised that issue in the Senate on \nbehalf of veterans, and in the House a similar bill passed by a margin \nof 406 to 1.\n  My amendment also provides permanent, targeted tax relief to millions \nof small businesses. Small businesses create 65 percent of all new \njobs. Yet this administration has done little more than punish them \nwith more regulations and higher taxes.\n  The amendment also halts harmful EPA regulations until the EPA \nconducts additional analysis of the impact those existing rules would \nhave on jobs.\n  It is time this body recognizes that the policies the other side is \nadvancing are not achieving the outcomes they claim will occur. We need \nto renew our commitment to helping all Americans, including women, find \njob opportunities that allow them to achieve the American dream. We \nneed to return this country to a place where America truly is another \nname for opportunity.\n  Earlier today the President and CEO of the Small Business & \nEntrepreneurship Council, Karen Kerrigan, wrote an article that says \nthis proposal I am speaking about ``offers a set of really good policy \nproposals to help women entrepreneurs and women in the workforce.''\n  That is why I sought unanimous consent to have this amendment debated \nand voted on, along with many of my colleagues, including the Senator \nfrom Nebraska Mrs. Fischer and the Senator from New Hampshire Ms. \nAyotte, who are here to speak about amendments they want to put forward \nas a part of this debate. I asked unanimous consent earlier for those \namendments to be considered as well and once again that has been \nblocked by the majority leader. That is the wrong way to deal with an \nissue of this consequence.\n  If we want to help people--if we want to create jobs and grow the \neconomy, which ultimately helps lift all the boats, improves the \nstandard of living for middle-class families, women and men--the best \nway to do that is to get a growing, vibrant economy instead of a \nstagnant economy, which is what we have today, with too many who have \nbeen unemployed for a long period of time.\n  I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will come to the \nconclusion that if we are going to debate this issue, we need to debate \nit in a comprehensive way that takes into consideration all of the \nideas out there, including those that will be offered by my colleagues \nthis afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I strongly affirm the principle of equal \npay for equal work. Both the Equal Pay Act and title VII of the Civil \nRights Act, which were passed on a bipartisan basis, have helped \nincrease career opportunities for women and ensure they receive equal \npay for equal work. That is a principle we strongly support.\n  Women have made progress. They now hold more than half of all \nmanagerial and professional jobs--more than double the number of women \nin 1980--and women comprise a majority in the five fastest growing job \nfields. According to the Department of Education, women receive 57 \npercent of all college degrees, 33 percent more than in 1970.\n  We believe--the reports prepared for the U.S. Department of Labor \nrecognize--that commonly used wage gap statistics don't tell the full \nstory. Factors including differences in occupation, education, fields \nof study, type of work, hours worked, and other personal choices shape \ncareer paths and they shape earning potential. Moreover, salaries alone \ndon't account for total compensation. Still, some women continue to \nstruggle with gender-based pay discrimination, directly impacting a \nwoman's livelihood, financial future, and her job security. With 60 \npercent of women working as the primary breadwinners, lost wages \ndetrimentally impact families as well as single women.\n  We fully agree that gender-based pay discrimination in the modern \nworkplace is unacceptable. We just have different ideas from some of \nour colleagues about the best way to combat this. Prevailing concern \namong women with wage discrimination indicates\n\n[[Page S2220]]\n\nthat there is more work to do. That is why I have worked with Senator \nCollins, Senator Ayotte, and Senator Murkowski to file an amendment to \nmodernize key portions of that 51-year-old Equal Pay Act.\n  Our proposal prevents retaliation against employees who inquire \nabout, discuss or disclose their salaries. It reinforces current law \nwhich prohibits pay discrimination based on gender, and it requires \nemployers to notify the employees of their rights, but we don't stop \nthere because I believe we need a solution that addresses both \ndiscrimination and the opportunity gap or the need to provide both men \nand women with good-paying jobs.\n  Our amendment consolidates duplicative job training programs and it \nprovides Federal grants to States for the creation of industry-led \npartnerships. This program is meant to provide to women and men who are \nunderrepresented in industries that report worker shortages with the \nskills they need to compete. Such industries include manufacturing, \nenergy, transportation, information technology, and health care. \nImportantly, no new spending is appropriated.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nblocking consideration of what I believe is this very commonsense \namendment and a number of other Republican amendments that would also \nhelp with job creation.\n  This is nothing more than election year politics. I find it very \ndisappointing. As women and as lawmakers, we believe our proposal to \ndirectly address discrimination in the workplace is reasonable, it is \nfact-based, and it is a great approach. More government and more \nlawyers will not lead to more pay for women.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to praise my colleague from \nNebraska for her leadership on the important amendment she has just \ndescribed, the Workplace Advancement Act, which will address legitimate \nissues to ensure that laws we have had in place for half a century, \nincluding the Equal Pay Act and title VII of the Civil Rights Act, are \nenforced and that women are informed of their rights in the workplace \nto ensure what we all believe in, which is that women should be paid \nthe same for the same job. Frankly, as a woman, I would like the \nopportunity to outperform and to be paid more.\n  One of the concerns I have is about what I view the majority leader \nmeant when he came to the floor and said that this was an important \nissue to them. If this is such an important issue, why didn't they have \na markup in the HELP Committee where everyone could offer their \namendments to deal with this legitimate issue that I believe my male \nand female colleagues feel is important? Why is it that when we have \nbrought legitimate amendments to the floor, including my colleague's \namendment, the Workplace Advancement Act, as well as a provision that \nwould allow greater flexibility for employees with comp time--the same \nthat is enjoyed by those in the public sector--and my colleague from \nSouth Dakota who has a strong amendment to help create a better climate \nfor job creation and more opportunity in this country--if this is such \na serious issue, which I agree this is an important and serious issue, \nthen why is it these amendments are being blocked? Why is it we are not \nhaving a legitimate debate? Unfortunately, what I fear is that an \nimportant and legitimate issue is being turned into a political ploy of \nelection-year politics.\n  I share the sentiments of my colleague from Nebraska. I am very \ndisappointed by this. In fact, one of the concerns I have about the \nbill pending on the floor--the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act--is that \nit will actually have the impact of reducing flexibility for working \nfamilies. It could have the impact of reducing the ability of employers \nto award merit pay.\n  I had the privilege of serving as the first woman attorney general in \nmy State. Before I went to the attorney general's office, I worked at a \nprivate law firm. I have had the opportunity, in the position in which \nI serve, to meet incredible women leaders in the health sector and in \nthe business sector. There are many instances, frankly, where women, \nbased on merit, have outperformed their male colleagues. So what we \ndon't want to do is create and pass a law that actually reduces the \nopportunity for employers in the workplace to reward merit because \nwomen want the opportunity to earn more than men when they do a better \njob, just as my male counterparts want. That is one of my concerns \nabout the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  That is why I very much appreciate what I think is a better approach \nby my colleague, which reinforces the enforcement of laws that have \nbeen in place, that rightly prohibits discrimination based on sex in \nthe workplace, including discrimination based on people being paid \ndifferently even though they are performing the same job, where there \nare no merit differences. That is wrong. It is unacceptable. The ideas \nof my colleague from Nebraska are very good and I would hope the \nmajority leader would allow a vote.\n\n  I would also like to discuss the amendment that was offered by \nSenator McConnell, of which I am a cosponsor, that would provide \nworking families with more flexibility in the workforce. In fact, what \nit would do is allow the same options currently available to those in \nthe public sector to working families in the private sector. It would \nallow workers--if they want to; and it is their choice--to receive comp \ntime instead of overtime pay so they can have more time off if they \nwant and they choose. This is all voluntary. So if they want more time \noff to go to that soccer game, if they want more time off to have time \nto care for their children or more time to care for an elderly parent, \nthen private sector employers will have the same ability to enter into \nthose agreements voluntarily with their employees, to give their \nemployees more flexibility in the workplace.\n  What we know is that today nearly 60 percent of working households \nhave two working parents. I happen to live in one of those households, \nand we struggle in our household to get to all the events we want to \nget to for our children. I have a 9-year-old and a 6-year-old, and this \nis a huge challenge that so many parents face.\n  So the Family Friendly and Workplace Flexibility Act, which is an \namendment Senator McConnell offered earlier, that I am a proud \ncosponsor of, would provide this needed flexibility for employees, \nworkers, and let them decide with their employer whether they would \nlike to receive more comp time. Right now public sector employees have \nthe right to do this. They have this flexibility. It seems we should \nprovide the same legal framework allowing private sector employees this \ntype of flexibility, with more and more families trying to balance both \nparents working and challenging circumstances in the workplace.\n  In fact, some companies, such as Dell, Bank of America, and GE \nalready provide flexible workplace arrangements to their salaried \nemployees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. What this \nwould do is allow these types of agreements to other employees, to have \naccess to the same kinds of benefits, if they choose. It is their \nchoice. This is giving families more flexibility, more opportunity to \ndeal with the challenges so many of us are dealing with in terms of \nbalancing work and family and wanting to be good parents, wanting to be \ngood at our jobs.\n  It seems to me this is a commonsense amendment, and I am disappointed \nthe majority leader would also block this amendment, as well as the \nexcellent amendment offered by my colleague from Nebraska, and, \nobviously, the amendment that was offered--a very good amendment--by my \ncolleague from South Dakota to deal with this underlying issue of \ncreating a better climate of opportunity for women and men throughout \nthis country.\n  I believe this is a serious issue. But if it is a real serious \nissue--which I think we all share a feeling of on both sides of the \naisle--then why is this being treated more like a political ploy \ninstead of having a legitimate debate on the floor? Why didn't this go \nthrough the regular committee process, where people can offer their \namendments and have a markup that can improve and make sure we are \naddressing the underlying issue?\n  To me, it is disappointing that the Senate continues to operate in \nthis way because this is not the first time I\n\n[[Page S2221]]\n\nhave come to the floor or my colleagues have come to the floor with a \nlegitimate amendment that is relevant to the bill that is pending on \nthe floor, yet have been blocked by the majority leader on an important \nissue.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah has an amendment he \nis going to speak to in a moment. I just want to say one thing. I \nappreciate the observation made by the Senator from New Hampshire Ms. \nAyotte with regard to this going through a regular order process. If \nthis were a serious discussion, there would have been an opportunity to \nhave a debate at the appropriate committee, the HELP Committee.\n  You just heard great presentations by the Senator from Nebraska and \nthe Senator from New Hampshire on amendments that they would like to \nhave considered and debated and voted on--substantive amendments that \naddress what is at the heart of this issue. I think we all understand \nwhat this is about. I mentioned this morning on the floor the New York \nTimes story from a couple weeks ago about what the intention is with \nregard to these issues. Again, this is from the New York Times story, \nand I quote: ``to be timed to coincide with campaign-style trips by \nPresident Obama.'' ``Democrats concede,'' the Times reports, ``that \nmaking new laws is not really the point. Rather, they are trying to \nforce Republicans to vote against them.'' The article goes on to say--\nand I quote again:\n\n       Privately, White House officials say they have no intention \n     of searching for any grand bargain with Republicans on any of \n     these issues. ``The point isn't to compromise''. . . .\n\n  That is reporting from the New York Times, and quoting a White House \nofficial with regard to this.\n  This is clearly designed as a political ploy, as my colleagues from \nNew Hampshire and Nebraska pointed out. If we were serious about this, \nthere would be an open process where we could consider amendments--\namendments that improve and strengthen the legislation that is before \nus--and actually it would be a better approach to addressing the issue \nthat is before us; that is, to try to create better salaries, better \nwages, better opportunities for women. I say that as somebody who is \nthe father of two adult daughters who are both in the workplace. I want \nto see them have every opportunity to advance themselves and to \nmaximize the potential they have. But we cannot do that if we have \npolicies coming out of Washington, DC, that make it more difficult, \nmore expensive to create jobs, that throw a big wet blanket on our \neconomy, and stifle the growth we need to create those types of \nopportunities for all Americans.\n  The Senator from Utah is here. He is going to speak to his amendment. \nBut I think it is very clear what this is about; that is, simply trying \nto score a political point rather than have a serious, meaningful, \nsubstantive debate about solving an issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from South \nDakota, for his leadership in this area. I agree with his comments and \nsupport those statements, along with the other actions taken by my \ncolleagues from New Hampshire, Kentucky, and Nebraska, in addition to \nothers.\n  I too had an amendment I wanted to present in connection with this \nlegislation. I too offered that up and identified reasons why this is \nboth relevant and germane to the legislation at hand. Unfortunately, \nthe majority leader saw fit to block this, to object to it, to refuse \naltogether to allow the U.S. Senate--which is supposed to be the \nworld's greatest deliberative legislative body--to consider these or \nany of the other amendments that were presented along with them.\n  We are not asking for passage by unanimous consent. We recognize some \npeople might not share our views. We recognize there might be a \ndiversity of opinion within the body. We nevertheless believe, as U.S. \nSenators, we are entitled to have these amendments considered because \nthey are relevant, because they are germane. We also think they should \nbe considered because they would benefit the American people.\n  This is the sort of thing we are supposed to do. It is what we do. \nWhat we are supposed to be doing as Senators is to be offering \namendments and voting on amendments to make legislation we consider \nbetter. You see, the amendment process can make a bad bill good or at \nleast better, and that is exactly why we have an obligation to consider \namendments.\n  It is important to point out here that one of the reasons why I ran \nthis amendment in the first place has to do with the fact that one of \nthe struggles facing working families today is the constant struggle \nmoms and dads feel as they try to juggle the work-life balance. Parents \ntoday need to juggle work, home, kids, community, and other obligations \nthey face.\n  For many families, especially families with young children, the most \nprecious commodity parents have is time. But today Federal labor laws \nseverely, and I believe unfairly, restrict the way moms and dads and \neveryone else can use their time. That is because many of those laws \nwere written decades ago--decades ago--before the Internet existed; \ndecades ago, when a number of demographic factors were aligned much \ndifferently than they are today, when a number of social trends \noperated much differently in our economy than they do today. Because of \nthese laws--these same Buddy Holly-era, Elvis-era laws--because of \nthese same antiquated laws that need to be updated, an hourly employee \nwho works overtime is not allowed to take comp time, not allowed to \ntake flextime. Even if she prefers it, her boss cannot even offer it \nwithout violating Federal law.\n  Today, if a working mom or a working dad stays late at the office on \nMonday or Tuesday, and instead of receiving extra pay wants to get \ncompensated by leaving early on Friday and spend the afternoon with the \nkids, that kind of arrangement could well be violating Federal law. \nThat sounds unfair, especially to parents, and it is unfair, especially \nto parents and their children and everyone else.\n  It also seems like the kind of arrangement that should not be \nprohibited by Federal law but ought to be perfectly acceptable. But how \ndo we know that for sure? Well, we know that for sure because Congress \ngave a special exemption from that very law--the law I just described a \nmoment ago--that is available only for government employees. This is \nunacceptable. The same work-life options that have been made available \nby Congress itself to government employees should be available to the \ncitizens they serve.\n  In May of last year, the House of Representatives responded to this \ndeficit in existing Federal law by passing the Working Families \nFlexibility Act, sponsored by Representative Martha Roby of Alabama, to \nequalize the comp time rules, existing within a government employment \ncontext, for all workers. Last fall, I introduced companion legislation \nin the Senate proposing to do exactly the same thing.\n  Now, today, I would like to offer an amendment that is modeled on \nthis same legislation to end this flextime discrimination, this comp \ntime discrimination against private sector workers. You talk to any \nworking mom or any working dad and they will tell you they need more \ntime.\n  Now, Mr. President, as you well know, we cannot legislate another \nhour in the day. If we could, I am sure it would have been done by now, \nand, frankly, I am a little surprised someone has not tried it. But we \nknow mathematically it will not work. It would not do any good. But \nwhat we can do is to help working people so they can better balance the \ndemands they face--the demands of family and work and community and \nevery other demand they face. We can ease some of this pressure by \nremoving an unnecessary, outdated, and manifestly unfair Federal \nrestriction on utilizing comp time in the private sector.\n  There are real problems in this world. There are bad things that can \nbe and must be prohibited by Federal law. But the fact that working \nparents would prefer, quite understandably, to spend more time with \ntheir families is not one of those things that needs to be prohibited, \nnor is it one of those things that we should allow to continue to be \nprohibited, especially when it is prohibited in a patently unfair \ndiscriminatory fashion--one that inures to the\n\n[[Page S2222]]\n\nbenefit of government employees, inures unfairly to the detriment of \neveryone else.\n  Congress needs to stop punishing America's moms and dads for wanting \nthe same fair treatment that government employees are able to receive \nthrough comp time and flextime programs. The United States of America \ndeserves to have amendments like this one, and other amendments, that \nwould make our laws less intrusive, less oppressive, less unfair, that \nwould lead to the development of a more fair, just economy, and a more \nfair, just system of laws.\n  We are never going to be able to get there if we are not even allowed \nto debate and discuss and vote on it, consider, much less pass, \namendments. It is time to restore the Senate to what it was always \nintended to be, which is the world's greatest deliberative legislative \nbody. That cannot happen when amendments like this one are \ncategorically blocked from consideration. We must end this. We must do \nbetter. We can and we must and we will.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Highway Trust Fund\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last October families and communities \nacross our country were forced to endure a completely unnecessary \ngovernment shutdown. Coming after years of budget uncertainty and \nconstant crises, the shutdown hurt our workers and threatened our \nfragile economic recovery. It shook the confidence of people across the \ncountry who expected their elected officials to come together to avoid \nsuch a needless and self-inflicted crisis. It was a dark time here in \nCongress. I think many of my colleagues regret letting the tea party \nminority push us into that.\n  When the shutdown finally ended, I sat down with House Budget \nCommittee chairman Paul Ryan in a budget conference that many of us had \nbeen trying to start for months. We worked through the issues. We \ncompromised. We reached a 2-year budget deal that rolled back the \ndevastating cuts from sequestration. We prevented another government \nshutdown and restored much needed certainty to the budget process.\n  That budget deal was a strong step in the right direction, but it was \nnot the only step Congress needs to take to create jobs and economic \ngrowth. It was not the only step we need to take to ensure that we do \nnot lurch to another avoidable crisis because if Congress does not act, \nwe are headed toward another crisis in just a few months--not a budget \ncrisis this time but a construction shutdown that could ramp up when \nour highway trust fund reaches critically low levels.\n  It will get worse and worse if we do not solve the problem. So I have \ncome to the floor today to call on my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to work together to avert this looming crisis and to do it \nin a commonsense way that gives our States the multiyear certainty they \nneed to plan projects, to invest in their communities, and to create \njobs.\n  Since the mid-1950s our Nation has relied on the highway trust fund \nto support transportation projects that create jobs and keep our \neconomy moving. The fund helps to repave our roads so they are not \npockmarked with potholes. It helps congestion on our Nation's highways, \nand it helps repair bridges that are outdated and unsafe.\n  But as soon as July--just a few months from now--the Department of \nTransportation predicts the highway trust fund will reach a critically \nlow level. If this is not resolved, construction projects to improve \nour roads and our bridges could shut down and leave workers without a \npaycheck.\n  We are already seeing some consequences from this crisis. In \nArkansas, 10 construction projects, such as building highway \nconnections and replacing bridges, have already been put on hold. The \nState of Colorado wants to widen a major highway to ease congestion \nbetween Denver and Fort Collins, but officials say that with this \nfunding shortage in the highway trust fund, that project could be \ndelayed. These are not isolated cases. States from Vermont to \nCalifornia might have to stop construction in its tracks because of \nthis highway trust fund shortfall.\n  This crisis will also cut jobs. As we all know, construction is at \nits peak in the summer months. But without funding States may have no \nchoice but to stop construction and leave workers without a job. That \nis going to hurt communities with needless delays on the very \nimprovements that would help our businesses and spur economic growth.\n  This is unacceptable. It is unnecessary. Congress needs to work to \navoid this construction shutdown. There is no reason--none--to lurch to \nanother avoidable crisis when workers and families across the country \nare struggling. We need to ensure that construction can continue this \nsummer. We need to support workers. We need to deliver a multiyear \nsolution for the highway trust fund.\n  Fortunately, we can solve this in a way that should have bipartisan \nsupport. President Obama and House Republican Dave Camp, who chairs the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, have proposed using corporate revenue \nto shore up the highway trust fund. That approach makes a lot of sense. \nBy closing wasteful corporate tax loopholes, we can support \nimprovements to our roads and bridges that benefit everyone--including \nour big businesses, so they can move their products quickly and \nefficiently--and make our broken Tax Code a bit fairer in the process. \nWe can start by taking a close look at the tax loopholes House \nRepublicans have proposed closing in Chairman Camp's recent plan.\n  Replenishing the highway trust fund with revenue by closing wasteful \ncorporate loopholes will provide multiyear funding so we can provide \nour States with the certainty they need to plan. That kind of certainty \nhas been absent for a long time. It has forced States to hold off on \nbigger projects that will help create jobs and long-term economic \ngrowth.\n  I am very hopeful that Democrats and Republicans can work together to \nrestore some certainty to States around our country. I know bipartisan \nsupport is possible, especially on an issue as important as this one. \nSince the highway trust fund's inception under Dwight D. Eisenhower, \nRepublicans and Democrats have come together to invest in this national \npriority. Under Democratic and Republican Presidencies--from President \nClinton to President Reagan to President Clinton--we updated and \nsupported the highway trust fund. Even 2 years ago in a hyperpartisan \nelection year, Congress reached a bipartisan agreement so that we could \ncontinue to build the roads and bridges and transit systems our \ncommunities need. In the past Republicans and Democrats have stepped up \nto support our workers and make sure we can invest in our \ntransportation systems that put workers on the job and help businesses \nmove their goods and help our economy grow.\n  There is no reason to wait until the last minute to get this done. \nThe threat is growing on our construction sites and for jobs across the \ncountry. We have to give our States and our communities the confidence \nthat Congress will not push them into another crisis.\n  Six months ago our communities and families endured a needless \ngovernment shutdown. Americans are sick and tired of the dysfunction of \nWashington, DC, and constant crises. There is no reason for Congress to \nput them through anything even remotely similar, especially over \ntransportation projects that will benefit our families, our \ncommunities, and our economy.\n  We must act to prevent a construction shutdown this summer. Let's \nbuild on the common ground that Democrats and Republicans share on this \nissue. Let's work together to show the American people that Congress \ncan act to support our workers, families, and communities. Let's \nprevent a construction shutdown and give the highway trust fund some \ncertainty. We need to make sure our States can keep investing in jobs \nand economic growth at this critical time.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I believe we are done with the voting \nat this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in legislative session.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I would like to talk for a moment \nabout the critical importance to women and families across Michigan and \nthe country of ending pay discrimination against women so women will \nfinally get equal pay for equal work.\n  I was so proud to see so many colleagues on the floor earlier today, \nincluding the distinguished Presiding Officer, speaking about the \nimportance of women being able to earn a full dollar instead of 77 \ncents on every dollar.\n  Part of giving everyone in this country a fair shot to get ahead is \nnot only making sure they are getting paid a fair wage, which we are \nfighting to make sure happens, but also to make sure they are not \ngetting paid less simply because of their gender. If somebody is \nworking 40 hours a week, they ought to be paid the same for 40 hours a \nweek if it is the same job. That is what the Paycheck Fairness Act is \nreally all about. It gives everyone, regardless of their gender, the \ntools they need to help end gender discrimination in pay and hold those \nengaged in discriminatory behavior accountable. That is really what it \nis all about, and we will have a chance very soon to vote.\n  I hope we would all agree that discrimination because of gender or \nfor any reason has no place in our society. Yet too many Americans \nrightly feel they are trapped in a rigged game where heads, the \nprivileged and powerful win, and tails, everybody else loses.\n  When it comes to pay, we know the system is rigged against women. \nToday, in 2014, women still only make 77 cents for every dollar \ncompared to a man doing exactly the same work. That is the national \naverage. It is even worse in many places around the country. Frankly, \nit is even worse for women of color, with African-American women \ngetting paid even less and Latinas doing worse still.\n  My colleagues and I have been speaking on the floor today not just \nbecause we are voting on the Paycheck Fairness Act tomorrow but also \nbecause today is what we are calling Equal Pay Day. April 8 is the day \nwomen finally catch up. When you look at all the work that was done \nduring the whole calendar year of 2013, and then add January, February, \nand March through April 8, that is how long it has taken women to make \nthe same income as a man in the same job who worked last year. A woman \nhas to work 1 year, 3 months, and 8 days in order to earn the same \namount as a man who has worked 1 year. That is just not right, and that \nis what this debate is all about.\n  Some people say we are just talking about pennies on the dollar and \ndismiss the issue as nonsense or worse. Those pennies add up--hour \nafter hour, day after day, week after week, year after year.\n  In my home State of Michigan, pay discrimination robs the average \nworking woman and her family of more than $13,000 in wages every single \nyear--$13,000 out of their pocket just because they are a woman rather \nthan a man in the same job. While these women are working for \ndiscounted wages, they certainly don't get a 23-percent discount on \ntheir gas. They don't pay 23 cents less on every dollar at the grocery \nstore or when the rent or the mortgage comes due.\n  In fact, I have a chart to show what the average working woman and \nher family in Michigan could buy with the $13,000 a year she has worked \nhard every day to earn but never sees in her paycheck. She could buy \njust over 2 year's worth of food for her family. She could pay for \nalmost a year on her mortgage and utility. Can you imagine that? \nMortgage and utility payments go right out the window because she is \nnot getting equal pay for equal work. She could buy almost 3,500 \ngallons of gasoline for her car. That is enough gas for me to drive \nback and forth from Detroit to Los Angeles more than 16\n\n[[Page S2224]]\n\ntimes. That is how much a woman loses in her pay every year because of \ndiscrimination and lack of equal pay for equal work. But gender \ndiscrimination is not just about numbers on a page. In fact, it is not \nabout numbers on a page. It is about real women who are working hard, \nwho have suffered and continue to suffer, because we have not given \nwomen and their families the tools they need to make sure they can get \nequal pay for equal work. That is what this is about: knowing what your \ncoworkers in the workplace are making so you can find out whether you \nare being paid fairly--the information, the tools women need.\n\n  Let's be clear. Women aren't the only ones paying the price for wages \nlost and benefits denied. Gender discrimination in pay costs everybody \nin the family. The cost of gas is for everybody in the family. The cost \nof food is for everybody in the family. The inability to buy some extra \nsports equipment or clothing or pay for the cost of college affects \neverybody in the family. I hear far too many stories about this problem \nfrom my constituents in Michigan.\n  Linda from South Lyon wrote to tell me her story. Not only does she \nmake less than her male counterparts, but a senior executive even \nbragged to her that he hires women because he can pay them less. This \nis 2014, and we have an executive who thinks it is OK to even say that.\n  Last week I met Kerri Sleeman, an engineer from Hancock, MI, who came \nto the Senate to testify about her story. I have to say, in Hancock, \nMI, we still have 20 feet of snow. This is the Upper Peninsula of \nMichigan. One has to be tough to live in beautiful Hancock, MI, and \nhave a lot of great winter clothing. But it is an absolutely gorgeous \nplace.\n  Kerri was working for an auto parts supplier that was forced into \nbankruptcy in 2003. As with the company's other employees, she had to \nbe involved in the bankruptcy process to get her last paycheck and the \nother wages she was owed. One day she received an update from the \nbankruptcy court about the claims against her former company and she \nmade a shocking discovery: All of the men she had been supervising had \nbeen paid more than her--all of them. All of them. An engineer in \nHancock, MI.\n  Kerri said: It was heartbreaking. It was embarrassing. It was \ninfuriating. And it will affect me for the rest of my life.\n  Can my colleagues imagine it? First, she is out of a job. She has to \ngo to court just to get her paycheck, and then, adding insult to \ninjury, she finds out she has been discriminated against for years \nwithout even knowing it. Kerri lost out on thousands of dollars in pay \nand benefits simply because she is a woman. As is the case for most \npeople, she could have used that money. She said she would have used it \nto help pay the copay for her husband's heart surgery, which instead \nshe had to put on her credit card. Her story underscores why we need to \npass this vital legislation before the Senate.\n  Kerri not only lost out on her pay at her job week after week, month \nafter month, she will lose out on Social Security benefits for the rest \nof her life as well. This is not fair. It is not how things should \nwork. Kerri deserves a fair shot, and she has not been given it.\n  We have heard other stories such as Kerri's before, and one of those \nwas that of Lilly Ledbetter, who worked hard at a Goodyear tire plant \nand was discriminated against for nearly 20 years. She did not realize, \nagain, that she was being paid less. Just as with Kerri, she will never \nget the Social Security benefits she would have earned if she hadn't \nbeen paid less for just being a woman. The law that bears her name--the \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act--was a huge step in the right direction. \nBut today more than 50 years after we passed the Equal Pay Act--\nimagine, 50 years ago we thought we dealt with this; 50 years ago, the \nEqual Pay Act--and 5 years after we passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct, we still have so much work to do to make sure women are actually \nreceiving equal pay for equal work.\n  It was a great day when the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became the \nvery first bill President Barack Obama signed into law after he took \noffice. I wish to thank the President for today signing two Executive \norders that will help protect the employees of Federal contractors from \npay discrimination. As the President has said, he doesn't want his \ndaughters or anyone's daughters to be paid less just because they are \nwomen. I agree. I know the Presiding Officer does as well.\n  Now we must do our part here in the Senate to make sure all Americans \nhave the tools they need to protect themselves from this form of \ndiscrimination and hold those responsible accountable.\n  This is not about special protections. In fact, I find any language--\nany discussion of ``special protections''--so offensive, as I know \nwomen in Michigan and across the country do: somehow protections \nbecause we want to go to work and know we are being paid the same as \nthe person next to us, who just happens to be a man, and we are women. \nThis is simply about treating all Americans fairly. That is exactly \nwhat Democrats are committed to. We want to make sure everybody has a \nfair shot to get ahead. It has to start with equal pay for equal work. \nThat means paying a fair wage, paying men and women what they earn, and \nit means if a woman works 40 hours a week, she should get paid for 40 \nhours a week, not for 30 hours or 31 hours.\n  The difference in pay simply because of gender discrimination really \nis the difference. That $13,000 I talked about earlier is the \ndifference between whether a woman is able to fully benefit from her \nwork and have what she needs to put food on the table and gas in the \ncar and tuition for her son or daughter to be able to go to college, \nand all of the other things we want for our families.\n  What this chart shows just isn't good enough. We want the full \ndollar, because 77 cents on every dollar is not enough. If we truly \nreward work, it shouldn't matter if a person is a man or a woman. A \nperson's work should be equally rewarded for the same jobs. It is time \nthe Senate come together--and we are going to have a chance to do \nthat--to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. It is right for women and \ntheir families. It is right for our economy. It is simply the right \nthing to do.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                          Fair Sentencing Act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, there are reports that after we return \nfrom either this break or the next, the Senate may take up the so-\ncalled Fair Sentencing Act, so I rise today to start discussing this \nbill with my colleagues, particularly those who do not serve with me on \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Over the past 30 years, this Nation has achieved tremendous success \nin cutting crime. There are fewer victims who suffer fewer physical and \nfinancial injuries. Neighborhood safety has improved, reducing fear and \nhelping economic growth. These gains have been hard won. Congress \nplayed a major role, enacting mandatory sentencing guidelines, \nmandatory minimum sentences, providing assistance to law enforcement, \nand building more prisons. The mandatory guidelines, combined with \nabolishing parole, led to lengthier sentences, and what is fair about \nit all is that we have fewer disparities in sentencing. No longer would \nthe sentence depend on whether the criminal faced a tough or a lenient \njudge, and factors such as the defendant's race and income could not be \ntaken into account.\n  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court, applying novel readings of the \nConstitution, struck down mandatory sentencing guidelines. As a result, \nFederal judges are departing downward from the guidelines, issuing \nshorter sentences and injecting more disparity into the system. States \nare reducing their incarceration rates. While there are probably \nmultiple contributing factors, crime rates recently have been rising. \nThe only means left for Congress to ensure that criminals are sentenced \nto appropriate sentences then is mandatory minimums, now that the \nSupreme Court has judged sentencing guidelines as being \nunconstitutional.\n  Those convicted of the manufacture, sale, or possession with intent \nto distribute, and importation of a wide range of drugs, including \nheroin, cocaine, PCP, LSD, ecstasy, and methamphetamine may have their \nsentences cut in half or even more from the current mandatory minimums.\n  Supporters of the bill say it allows for shorter sentencing only for \n``nonviolent offenders.'' I am going to prove the bill does more than \nthat. The term\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\n``nonviolent offenders'' is highly misleading. First, that phrase \nconjures up people in jail for simple possession, and this bill does \nnot apply to simple possession at all, for any drug.\n  Second, the types of offenses the bill applies to are violent. \nImporting cocaine is violent. The whole operation turns on violence. \nDealing heroin also involves violence or the threat of violence.\n  Third, the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced might \nhave been violent. The mandatory minimum sentence would be cut even if \nthe criminal's codefendant used a gun.\n  Fourth, the criminal himself could have a violent history. Although \nthe bill does not apply to a drug crime for which the defendant used \nviolence, it does apply to criminals with a history of violence. That \nis, the bill would permit a shorter mandatory minimum where the \ndefendant was not violent on this occasion, but was in the past. \nSupporters of the bill never acknowledge that it would apply to drug \ndealers with a history of violent crime.\n  Other provisions of the bill expand the safety valve that allows \njudges to impose mandatory minimum sentences on offenders with minimal \ncriminal history. The bill's proponents never identify which violent \noffenders who fail to qualify for even the bill's expanded safety valve \nshould be able to receive the bill's shorter mandatory minimum \nsentences.\n  And don't pay attention to the smoke screen that the bill leaves the \nmaximum sentence alone. Judges are not sentencing anywhere near the \nmaximum today. The whole point of the bill is to allow judges to ignore \ncurrent mandatory minimums for serious offenses such as heroin \nimportation and cocaine dealing, and sentence defendants to half the \nminimum they are now receiving.\n  We know from the experience of the States that when mandatory minimum \nsentences are reduced, judges use their greater discretion only to \nsentence the same or more leniently, even when the drug offender has a \nhistory of violence. For instance, the State of New York changed its \ndrug sentencing laws to give judges more discretion. Judges began in \nthe overwhelming majority of the cases to sentence offenders to the now \nlower minimum sentences. New York judges have sentenced drug \noffenders--even offenders with prior felony convictions--to the lower \nminimums. Do we really want offenders such as these out on the streets \nearlier than is the case now, and while out there on the street to prey \non our citizens? That is what they will do.\n  Although supporters of the bill claim it will reduce costs, what it \nwill really do is shift costs from prison budgets to crime victims.\n  As Professor Matt DeLisi of Iowa State University testified before \nour Judiciary Committee, juvenile drug use is the best predictor of \nchronic offending and that, in his words, ``drug users offend at levels \n3-4 times greater than persons not convicted of drug crimes.'' He \nstated that criminal justice research shows that ``releasing 1% of the \ncurrent Bureau of Prison population would result in approximately \n32,850 additional murders, rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, \nburglaries, auto thefts, and incidents of arson.''\n  So the empirical data are clear. Lower mandatory minimum sentences \nmean increased crime and an increased number of victims. Why would we, \nthen, vote to increase crime and create more crime victims?\n  Various police organizations answer that question by coming out \nagainst this bill.\n  The National Narcotic Officers' Association has written--and I will \ngive you a fairly long quote:\n\n       As the men and women in law enforcement who confront \n     considerable risk daily to stand between poison sellers and \n     their victims, we cannot find a single good reason to weaken \n     federal consequences for the worst offenders who are directly \n     responsible for an egregious amount of personal despair, \n     community decay, family destruction, and the expenditure of \n     vast amounts of taxpayer dollars to clean up the messes they \n     create.\n\n  End of quote from the National Narcotic Officers' Association.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association has also come out \nagainst the bill. They stated:\n\n       It is with great concern that the Federal Law Enforcement \n     Officers Association views any action or attempt . . . that \n     would alter or eliminate the current federal sentencing \n     policy regarding mandatory minimum sentencing.\n       The mandatory minimum sentencing standard currently in \n     place is essential to public safety and that of our \n     membership.\n\n  End of quote from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.\n  Law enforcement is telling us that this bill would be bad policy and \ncreate more crime victims, but it is also saying that were this ill-\nconsidered legislation to pass, the safety of police officers, who \nsafeguard us, would be jeopardized. How can we possibly do that to \nthose who bravely protect us--our law enforcement people?\n  The bill is particularly misguided in light of current conditions \nconcerning drug use. We are in the midst of a heroin epidemic right \nnow. Deaths from heroin overdoses in Pennsylvania are way up. In the \nState of Vermont, the Governor devoted this year's entire state of the \nState message to the heroin problem. Cutting sentences for all heroin \nimportation and dealing makes no sense at all considering the concerns \nof these Governors and other State leaders and law enforcement people.\n  Now let's turn to what the Obama administration thinks. Typical of \nits pattern of disregarding the law across a large range of areas, this \nadministration refuses to charge some defendants for crimes they duly \ncommitted if doing so would subject them to mandatory minimum \nsentences. Typical with this administration's pattern of disregarding \nthe law, it is not taking action in most situations where States have \nenacted laws decriminalizing marijuana, even though that is contrary to \nFederal law. Do you think the Obama administration would stand silently \nby if a State enacted laws that allowed guns, rather than drugs, to be \nsold inconsistently with Federal law? Well, of course not.\n  According to a story this week in the Washington Post, one of the \nreasons for the heroin epidemic is that marijuana decriminalization is \nleading growers to produce more heroin for importation into this \ncountry. That is because the availability of marijuana is rising and \nconsequently the price is falling. So there is money available to be \nspent elsewhere. So many who used to grow marijuana now can make much \nmore money cultivating opium poppies for heroin export to this country. \nBut the administration supports this bill, which allows judges to lower \nmandatory minimum sentences for heroin importation. Doesn't that boggle \nthe mind?\n  My conservative colleagues who rightly oppose the administration's \nlawlessness in so many areas should think twice before supporting the \nadministration here. They should oppose a bill that gives judges \nadditional authority only for lowering sentences for dealing, \nmanufacturing, and importing LSD, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, and \nmethamphetamine.\n  The National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys has \ncourageously disagreed with the public opinion of their employer, the \nDepartment of Justice and Attorney General Holder. The National \nAssociation of Assistant United States Attorneys--and, remember, these \npeople are on the Federal payroll enforcing and prosecuting under \nFederal law--this organization has written in opposition to the bill:\n\n       Mandatory minimums deter crime and help gain the \n     cooperation of defendants in lower-level roles in criminal \n     organizations to pursue higher-level targets.\n       They have been demonstrably helpful in reducing crime.\n\n  End of quote from the National Association of Assistant United States \nAttorneys.\n  So why on Earth, then, would we cut sentences for sellers and \nimporters of the worst drugs now plaguing our cities, our suburbs, and \neven rural areas?\n  Not every mandatory minimum sentence may be set at the perfect level. \nWe should and can have a discussion concerning lowering some sentences \nand maybe even raising others--others that probably should be raised, \nsuch as for child pornography, terrorism, sexual assault, domestic \nviolence, and various fraud offenses.\n  We can reduce jail time but not sentences. Many States have done this \nfor inmates whose risk assessments and behavior in jail, including \nsuccessful completion of programs proven to reduce recidivism, earn our \nconfidence that these people, out of prison, are\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\nless likely to reoffend. But we should not cut sentences up front for \nserious offenders such as heroin dealers. We should not do so where \nthese offenders have a history of violence. We should not drastically \ncut the only tool we have to reduce sentencing disparities among \njudges.\n  The mislabeled Fair Sentencing Act is the wrong answer to the \nproblems we face. I hope the Senate will not take up this bill, but if \nit does, my colleagues should take a clear-eyed look at this very \ndangerous bill and oppose it, as I will.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. More than 50 years ago, President Kennedy signed the \nEqual Pay Act, making equal pay for equal work the law of the land. Yet \nwage discrimination still persists. Today women continue to be paid \njust over three-quarters of what their male counterparts receive for \nperforming the same work. More women than ever before are graduating \nfrom college, but over the course of their careers they will each make \nan average of $1.2 million less than a man with the same level of \neducation.\n  Unfortunately, that is not unique. Across a wide array of industries \nand with all different occupations, well-qualified women continue to \nearn an average of 77 cents for each dollar that our male counterparts \nearn, regardless of performance or educational background. Pay \ndiscrimination hurts women, it hurts families, and it hurts our \neconomy.\n  Back in the early eighties, I served on New Hampshire's Commission on \nthe Status of Women. During that period I chaired a task force on \nwomen's employment in New Hampshire, and we wrote a report about what \nwe found. Sadly, we found a lot of discrimination against women in \nemployment. At that time women were only making 59 cents for every $1 a \nman earned, but the conclusion of our report was this was not only an \nissue for the women, it was an issue for their spouses, for their \nfamilies, and for the economy of New Hampshire. The same is true today.\n  In 2011, women were the sole or primary breadwinner in more than 40 \npercent of households with children. Equal pay for these women is not \nsolely about a fair paycheck. It is also about paying for a visit to \nthe pediatrician, it is about being able to afford the prescription \ntheir children need, it is also about paying the heating bills during a \nlong winter or providing Internet access so their kids can do their \nhomework. There is a lot the average woman could do with the extra \n$10,000 she would earn each year if it were not for pay discrimination.\n  As Governor, I signed a law to prohibit gender-based pay \ndiscrimination in New Hampshire and to require equal pay for equal \nwork. In the year before that law was signed, women in New Hampshire \nmade 69 percent of their male colleagues' wages. Today, in New \nHampshire, they make 78 percent, so we make about 1 penny more in New \nHampshire than national average. But at this rate, my granddaughters--\nsome of whom are still in grade school--will enter and leave the \nworkforce before we achieve equal pay for equal work. The estimate is \nthat if we continue at this rate, it will be 2056 before we achieve \nequal pay for equal work.\n  Today on Equal Pay Day, I call on Congress to pass the Paycheck \nFairness Act so that all of our daughters, granddaughters, their \nhusbands, families, and their children can get a fair paycheck. This \ncommonsense legislation would update the Equal Pay Act to require that \npay differences be based on legitimate business reasons, and it would \nprotect women so they can't be penalized by their employers for \ndiscussing their salaries. Pay discrimination is not fair, it is not \nright, and it needs to end.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to support the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank Senator Shaheen for her leadership on these \nissues and so many other issues in the Senate. I listened to the \nSenator's comments and I fully concur in the information the Senator \nhas brought forward, that paycheck fairness is not just a matter of \nfairness for women, it is a matter of fairness for our country. Not \nonly will women benefit, our economy will benefit and our country will \nbenefit by making sure that equal pay for equal work is what happens in \nour country.\n  I thank the Senator, and I yield.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank Senator Cardin of Maryland and point out that I \nknow this is an area where he also has worked very hard over many \nyears. It is the kind of issue that men and women should be able to \nagree on. This is something that is not fair for women, but it is also \nnot fair for their husbands and their sons. I know the Senator feels \nthat way. Because when your wife isn't getting what she deserves, then \nyou and your family are also hurt as a result.\n  Mr. CARDIN. It is not just my wife, I also have two beautiful \ngrandchildren, granddaughters, and they are going to do just fine, but \nI want to make sure they are treated fairly in the workplace--and I \nwant all people treated fairly in the workplace.\n  I thank Senator Shaheen. As I said, equal pay for equal work. \nPaycheck fairness is truly an American value. I thank all our leaders \nhere. I particularly want to acknowledge Senator Mikulski, my colleague \nfrom Maryland, for her extraordinary leadership on pay equity issues, \non this particular issue of paycheck fairness, and for the work she has \ndone throughout her whole career as a real leader on gender issues.\n\n  As Senator Shaheen pointed out, today is Equal Pay Day, and the \nreason for that is women, on average, earn about 77 percent of what a \nman earns for doing the same work. We are not talking about different \nwork, but we are talking about doing the exact same work that women are \ndiscriminated against in the amount of compensation they receive. So on \naverage women have to work 3 additional months every year to earn the \nsame amount of money a man earns for doing the same work. That is not \nright and it needs to change.\n  Today I was at the White House with the President and some of our \ncolleagues. Lilly Ledbetter was there. I know the Presiding Officer \nrecalls that Lilly Ledbetter has been one of the real leaders on pay \nequity. She worked at Goodyear for over 20 years, and after being there \nfor two decades she found out from one of her coworkers--who \nanonymously passed along information to her about what people were \nmaking--that for 20 years she was receiving less compensation for doing \nthe exact same work her male counterparts were doing. She had no idea \nabout this. There was no justification for the difference. So she \ndecided she would do something about it, not just for herself but for \nthose who are in the workplace and should be treated fairly.\n  So she filed an action and she took this case all the way to the \nSupreme Court of the United States, but guess what the Supreme Court \ndid. They said: Lilly Ledbetter, you are right. You were discriminated \nagainst. You were paid less because of your gender, but guess what. \nBecause it has been going on for so long, you don't have any remedy. \nNow that is absolutely ridiculous, that 5-to-4 decision of the Supreme \nCourt.\n  That cost Lilly Ledbetter hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost \ncompensation as a result of that discriminatory action. So Congress \ntook action and changed that, and I was proud to be part of the \nCongress that cast that vote. It was the first bill signed by President \nObama shortly after he took office, and I remember the pride we all had \nthat we were able to take a major step forward on behalf of an \nenforceable right for women to be paid equal pay for equal work.\n  But the job wasn't done. Tomorrow we can take another giant step \nforward by advancing, and I hope enacting, the Paycheck Fairness Act. I \nhope colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this \nlegislation so we can continue to make progress down this road of equal \npay for equal work.\n  In the White House today President Obama took action on his own. As \nhe has said he would, he used his Executive power to do what he can to \nadvance the cause of equality in this\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\ncountry. So he signed two Executive orders. The first is what we call \nthe sunshine executive order that will require Federal contractors to \nallow their employees to share information about their salaries. They \ncan no longer take retaliatory action because coworkers share their \nsalary information. The second Executive order will require contractors \nto provide information to the Department of Labor as to what their \nsalary and compensation amounts are based on gender so there can be a \nrecord to make sure employers that are doing work for the Federal \nGovernment and that are benefiting from the U.S. taxpayers are doing \nthe right thing as far as equal pay for equal work.\n  These are two very important changes the President has instituted \nthrough the use of the power of the White House. We can do something \npermanent about it by the passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act. That is \nour responsibility, and I hope we will get that done. It will make a \nbetter America. As we pointed out, yes, it is about women being treated \nfairly in the workplace, it is about my two granddaughters being \ntreated fairly in the workplace, but it is also about our economy and \nit is about our values. It is all of the above.\n  I might also mention that it affects retirement security. Because \nwomen aren't paid as much, they do not have as much money when they \nretire. They are more strapped when it comes to how they spend their \nmoney. They have less money available for their retirement security. \nWomen over the age of 50 receive only about 56 percent of what men of \nsimilar age receive in pension benefits because they haven't earned as \nmuch. A good part of that is because they are not being paid fairly in \nthe workplace. Paycheck fairness will certainly help.\n  We want to give a fair shot to every woman in this country. Many are \nthe sole support for their families. Eliminating the wage gap will \nprovide $450 billion of additional income into our economy. You know \nwhat that goes for. It goes to buy a new car or help pay for their \nchildren's education. It provides the wherewithal so women can go out \nand pay their rent, their mortgage payments, the wherewithal to take \ncare of their families. They can even put money away for retirement so \nthey have the security they need after they retire. It helps to grow a \nmiddle class in this country, and that is what we all should be about.\n  So paycheck fairness helps give women a fair shot of equal pay for \nequal work. It requires employers to demonstrate that wage disparities \nbetween men and women holding the same position and doing the same work \nare not related to their gender. That seems simple enough. Doing \ndifferent work, obviously the pay is different. Same work, why is there \na difference?\n  The bill ensures the remedies available to victims of gender \ndiscrimination are similar to the remedies available to those who are \ndiscriminated against based upon their race or national origin. We have \nin place a way we can correct this. We know how to use those tools. Let \nus also use them for those who have been discriminated against in their \npay because of their gender.\n  The legislation updates the Equal Pay Act to make it more in line \nwith class action procedures available under title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. This gives us an effective remedy to take care of a \nclass of workers who have been discriminated against in the workplace, \nand it also prohibits employers--this is very important--from punishing \nor retaliating against workers who share salary information.\n  That is what the President did today with the stroke of his pen for \nthose companies that do business with the Federal Government. We can \nmake it universal in the workplace. We can shine a light on what is \nhappening. As former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis observed: \n``Sunlight is said to be the best disinfectant.'' We strive for greater \ntransparency in our government because we know that will help provide a \nbetter government. So we allow our workers to share information without \nfear that they will be discriminated against or that actions will be \ntaken against them by their employer.\n  Our mission as Senators is clearly written in the first few words \ncontained in the preamble of the Constitution. Our mission is to ``form \na more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, \nprovide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure \nthe Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.''\n  Paycheck fairness is essential for our carrying out that mission. I \nurge my colleagues to support this very important legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Tribute to Governor Michael O. Leavitt\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, this week the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce \nwill honor my friend, the former Governor of Utah, Michael Leavitt, \nwith our Giant In Our City Award. I would like to take this opportunity \nto honor my fellow Utahn, whose example as a public servant is \ninstructive for all those who wish to make a difference.\n  Mike Leavitt, who is a native of Cedar City, was the 14th Governor of \nthe great State of Utah. He was handily elected to three terms as \nGovernor, a feat that only one other Utahn has ever accomplished. In \n2003, during his third term, he was nominated by President George W. \nBush and confirmed by the Senate as Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency. After just over 1 year at the EPA, Governor Leavitt \nwas nominated and confirmed as the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, where he served through the end of the Bush administration. \nHe is the coauthor and author of several books, and he has most \nrecently served on Mitt Romney's campaign as the head of Governor \nRomney's transition team.\n  These accomplishments alone are enough to warrant praise and \nadmiration for Governor Leavitt, but I would like to underscore the way \nin which he served in these positions to explain the virtues of \nleadership and service. It has been said those who lead best lead by \nexample, and Mike Leavitt is one of those best leaders. He has \ncontinuously focused on efficiency, relationships, professionalism, and \nimprovement. These qualities are not only cultivated in Mike Leavitt \npersonally, but they are also fostered in all those with whom he works.\n  Governor Leavitt's efforts to make government work for the people--as \ngovernment always should work--stands as one of his greatest \naccomplishments. Such accomplishments often require innovation and \nentrepreneurship, which Mike Leavitt learned prior to his governorship \nas the president and CEO of the Leavitt Group. An example of this \ninnovation is the emergence of a new kind of education in the mid-\n1990s. When many in the education sector were skeptical of the \npossibility of online learning, Governor Leavitt proposed a new idea \nfor a competency-based online university. He worked to gain the support \nof other Governors, and after many months of preparation, Western \nGovernors University was established. This institution was part of \nGovernor Leavitt's mission to expand access to and reduce the cost of \nhigher education. Today WGU is recognized as one of the most innovative \nand affordable universities in the country.\n  Governor Leavitt encouraged his fellow Utahns to avoid focusing on \nwhat is wrong with America, a lesson we as Senators would do well to \nfollow. He reminded Utahns to focus on what is right with America, as \nhe believes wholeheartedly in the greatness of our Nation. He once \nsaid: ``In the history of mankind, there has never been a nation as \nadmired, as willing and as capable of inspiring and fulfilling hope.'' \nThe dignified competence of that statement is needed in these Halls and \nneeded around the world today.\n  Utah was an example of such dignified confidence in 2002 when the \nState hosted the Winter Olympics. Governor Leavitt's precision in \npreparing the State for the games produced a tremendous success not \nonly for Utah but also for our country. Working on the issues that are \nconstitutionally reserved to the States and to the people, Governor \nLeavitt oversaw the expansion of Utah's transportation network and \nmanaged facilities and lands with great care. He\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\nsought out skilled leaders to help in this grand effort, and thousands \nupon thousands of Utahns volunteered countless hours to make the 2002 \nOlympics one of the most successful Olympic Games in history.\n  Multiple volumes of the Congressional Record could be filled with \nexamples of service and leadership exemplified by this great Utahn, \nespecially from his years leading the EPA and HHS. However, in the \ninterest of brevity, I will simply say that this country needs more \ncitizens like Mike Leavitt. We need men and women who are able to focus \non the details and simultaneously think on a macro scale. We need \nleaders who believe in our founding principles and who make important \ndecisions with those very same principles in mind. We need leaders who \nwill make government more efficient, more responsive, more deliberate, \nand more meaningful. Such meaningfulness may often require less from \nthe Federal Government. When action is required from us in this body, \nlet prudence, love for country, love for our fellow beings and \ndedication to principles, displayed so admirably by Governor Mike \nLeavitt, be our guide.\n\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                               Fort Hood\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to speak about the tragic shooting last week at Fort Hood. The \nshooting claimed the lives of three innocent people. One was a son of \nIllinois, and 16 others were wounded.\n  As chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I often begin \nsubcommittee hearings by quoting the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Martin Dempsey. At his speech at the National Press Club \n2 years ago, General Dempsey spoke about the number of challenges \nfacing the military, from Afghanistan to sequestration, and the need to \ntake care of our troops when they transition to civilian status. \nGeneral Dempsey said: ``No matter how well we address the other \nchallenges''--and I quote him--``if we don't get the people right, the \nrest of it doesn't matter.''\n  His words reflect a basic truth. More than weapons systems or \nstockpiles of ammunition, the strength of our military and the security \nof America depend on the men and women who volunteer to risk their \nlives for us.\n  Investigators are still trying to understand what happened as an Army \nspecialist went on a shooting rampage at Fort Hood. Press reports \nspeculated on a host of possible motives, from mental health \ndifficulties following a recent deployment, grief over the death of his \nmother, and even financial pressure. As we wait for the answers to this \ntragedy, we are grateful for the discipline and bravery of the military \npolicewoman who confronted the shooter and cut short what could have \nbeen an even worse tragedy. We are grateful for the military chaplain \nwho shielded bystanders and helped them reach safety.\n  In my State of Illinois, we are mourning Army SGT Timothy Owens. He \nis from downstate, my neck of the woods, born in Effingham, IL, and \ndreamed of being a soldier since he was a little boy. He used to wear \ncamouflage and bomber jackets with sunglasses to look like a soldier, \nin hopes that someday that would come true.\n  He went to high school in Rolla, MO, where he met Billy, the young \nwoman who would later become his wife. They were married just last \nAugust.\n  After high school Tim and his family moved back to Effingham where \nTim worked and taught tae kwon do in the local gym. In 2003 Tim Owens \ndecided to pursue his life long dream. He enlisted in the U.S. Army. \nSergeant Owens served proudly in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he recently \nsigned up for 6 more years. His tours in Iraq and Afghanistan gave him \nspecial understanding and empathy for other soldiers who faced \ndifficulties when they returned home. He used his skill and compassion \nin his work as a counselor at Fort Hood helping veterans deal with post \ntraumatic stress disorder and other mental health challenges. It was a \nheartbreaking irony that Sergeant Owens was killed when he tried to \npersuade the shooter at Fort Hood to lay down his weapon. Sergeant \nOwens was 37 years old.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to Sergeant Owens' friends and family, \nespecially his wife and his parents. Tim Owens served America \nhonorably, and I know they are proud of him.\n  We also pray for the families of the other soldiers who lost their \nlives last week at Fort Hood and all those who were injured. Losing \nsoldiers on friendly soil seems almost incomprehensible. Yet this is \nnot the first time we have seen this sort of senseless death at a U.S. \nmilitary facility. It is not even the first time we have seen it at \nFort Hood.\n  Tomorrow at Fort Hood President Obama will lead a memorial service to \nhonor those who died last week. As we remember the soldiers who were \nlost and pray for those who were wounded, we also need to ask ourselves \nif there is more that we can do to protect the members of our military \nand their families.\n  In the speech 2 years ago, General Dempsey said the vast majority of \nservicemembers end up stronger from the experience that they served. He \nsaid: ``They are disciplined, they are courageous . . . they have a \nsense of purpose.'' They are men and women we should be very proud of, \nand we are.\n  There are also a few who for some reason or another need help. Some \nmay bear invisible wounds from war. As we wind down our involvement in \nAfghanistan, our task as a Nation is to get all of the people right, as \nGeneral Dempsey reminded us. Servicemembers and veterans who are \nstruggling with health issues, including mental health issues, need to \nget the care that is necessary to bring them back to a full \nparticipation in life.\n  Military families shouldn't have to struggle to put food on their \ntable or a roof over their heads. A grateful Nation can do a lot better \nthan that. No member of the military who risked his or her life \noverseas should have to worry about losing his or her life on a \nmilitary base in America. In the midst of the tragedy last week many \npeople at Fort Hood acted nobly and courageously, but something went \nterribly wrong.\n  We owe it to our servicemembers and their families to understand how \nthis terrible loss happened so we can work to make sure it does not \nhappen again.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you very much.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Madam President, I am now here for the 64th time to ask my colleagues \nto wake up to the threat of climate change. It was almost exactly 2 \nyears ago in April 2012 that I began speaking on the floor every week \nthat the Senate is in session.\n  I have tried to make a compelling case for my colleagues. First and \nforemost I have relied on the overwhelming scientific evidence and the \nnear unanimity of the scientific community.\n  Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that the increase of \ncarbon dioxide in our atmosphere due to human activities is driving \nunprecedented changes, and, of course, they are changes that Americans \nsee all about them in their lives now. If 97 doctors told you that you \nneeded surgery, who among us in our right mind would heed the advice of \nthe three doctors who said they were unsure and we should delay the \ntreatment?\n  I have talked about global warming. I have talked about the weirding \nof the weather--heat waves, extreme downpours, drought, shifting \nseasons. I have talked at length about the devastating toll on our \noceans, which hold such peril in my home State, Rhode Island, the Ocean \nState. Our oceans are warming, rising, and becoming more acidic, and \nall of that is undeniable. It is measurable. It threatens our coastal \ncommunities and marine species alike.\n  I have described the potential for deep economic disruption in \nindustries such as fishing and farming or inundation or wildfire. I \nhave looked at the threat to human health. I have conveyed the deep \nconcerns of corporate\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\nleaders who understand that climate change is bad for business and of \nfaith leaders who appeal to our moral duty to conserve God's creation \nand to spare those who are most vulnerable to catastrophe. I have \nanswered the claims of those in this Chamber who deny the reality of \nclimate change and the need for action, and I have called out the \nnetwork of fossil fuel propaganda that seeks to mire this Congress in \nphony manufactured doubt.\n  I have been joined by colleagues who share my commitment to rouse \nthis Congress from its oil- and coal-induced slumber, including the \nhistoric all-night stand on the floor that reached hundreds of \nthousands of Americans. But unfortunately, it seems we still have some \nways to go. I could stand here until I am blue in the face supplying \nthe Chamber with reasoned arguments and scientific facts on climate \nchange, and some here in Congress would ignore it because they reject \ninformation from scientists and they ignore empirical evidence.\n  So maybe it is time to bring in some muscle--the American military. \nClimate change threatens our strategic interests, our military \nreadiness, and our domestic security in many ways. It is a serious \nnational security issue. Don't take my word for it. Our top military \ncommanders and strategic planners at the Department of Defense say so.\n  Four years ago the Department of Defense released the Quadrennial \nDefense Review, clearly linking for the first time climate change and \nnational security. The 2010 review concluded that the effects of \nclimate change can contribute to increases in regional instability \ndriven by demand for food, water, and natural resources, and to extreme \nweather events which will increase the need for humanitarian aid and \ndisaster relief, both within the U.S. and abroad.\n  Then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen put \nit this way. I will quote him:\n\n       The scarcity of and potential competition for resources \n     like water, food, and space, compounded by the influx of \n     refugees if coastal lands are lost does not only create a \n     humanitarian crisis, but it creates conditions of \n     hopelessness that could lead to failed states and make \n     populations vulnerable to radicalization.\n\n  That is the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Last year 9 retired generals and admirals joined 17 former members of \nthe House and Senate and several former cabinet level officials and \nissued this warning. They said:\n\n       The potential consequences to climate change are \n     undeniable, and the cost of inaction, paid for in lives and \n     valuable U.S. resources will be staggering.\n\n  The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review was released last month in tandem \nwith the Department of Defense budget request, and it is just as \nstraightforward in its warnings on climate change.\n  I will quote:\n\n       Climate change poses another significant challenge for the \n     United States and the world at large. . . . Climate change \n     may exacerbate water scarcity and lead to sharp increases in \n     food costs. The pressures caused by climate change will \n     influence resource competition while placing additional \n     burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions \n     around the world.\n\n  The second installment of the current Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change assessment report, released just last week, echoes what \nour own military leaders are already telling us. According to the \nreport, ``Climate change can directly increase risks of violent \nconflicts in the form of civil war and inter-group violence by \namplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts such as poverty \nand economic shocks.''\n  In response to our changing climate, the Department of Defense is \nconducting a comprehensive assessment of the risks to U.S. military \ninstallations. This is not a trivial effort and it is not being \nundertaken without cause.\n  The Pentagon is also working with other nations to strengthen the \nnetwork of humanitarian assistance for disaster response. The reach of \nour military stretches to every corner of the globe and so do the \neffects of climate change. Our commanders recognize the need to adapt \nin every theater.\n  Much has been made of the U.S. military and diplomatic pivot to the \nPacific region. While ADM Samuel J. Locklear, commander, U.S. Pacific \nCommand, has called climate change the biggest long-term security \nthreat in the Pacific because it ``is probably the most likely thing \nthat is going to happen . . . that will cripple the security \nenvironment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often \ntalk about.'' The head of our Pacific command is describing this as the \nmost likely thing to happen to cripple the security environment.\n  The threat extends from pole to pole. Former Supreme Allied Commander \nand Commander of U.S. Forces in Europe James Stavridis is wary of the \nongoing reduction in Arctic sea ice. He states, ``This will present \npotential problems, from oil spills, dangers to wildlife, search and \nrescue for commercial shipping and tourist boats, and open zones of \nmaneuver for the navies of the Arctic nations to interact.''\n  Our American military leaders are clear in sounding this alarm. In \nCongress some of us are taking these warnings seriously. The Bicameral \nTask Force on Climate Change, which I lead with Congressman Waxman, \ninvited national security experts to share their perspective on climate \nchange. Retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Stephen Cheney is CEO of the \nAmerican Security Project, founded in 2005 by former Senators John \nKerry, Chuck Hagel, Gary Hart, and Warren Rudman. He stressed that \nclimate change is not a new issue within national security issues and \nthat the United States must engage the world on this issue, which of \ncourse we cannot do while we are paralyzed by false denial.\n  Retired Army BG Gerald Galloway spoke of the risk extreme weather \nevents pose to military installations. He said:\n\n       When communities and installations are unaware of their \n     vulnerability to these events, the results can be disastrous. \n     A failure to be prepared shifts the military's focus from \n     maintaining a constant level of readiness to dealing with \n     each of these climate change impacts as they occur. Both \n     floods and increased temperatures can bring training to a \n     halt or restrict critical movements.\n\n  This message was echoed by retired Army CPT Jon Gensler, who \ndescribed the difficulty of maintaining our readiness, particularly in \nresponding to ever-increasing requests for disaster-related \nhumanitarian assistance.\n  The consensus is clear from the people to whom we have entrusted our \nnational security: Climate change is a serious threat to national \nsecurity and to global security for which we need to plan and prepare. \nThat is the message Secretary of State John Kerry brought to an \naudience in Jakarta, Indonesia, earlier this year. He said:\n\n       In a sense, climate change can now be considered another \n     weapon of mass destruction, perhaps the world's most fearsome \n     weapon of mass destruction. . . . The fact is that climate \n     change, if left unchecked, will wipe out many more \n     communities from the face of the earth. And that is \n     unacceptable under any circumstances--but it is even more \n     unacceptable because we know what we can do and need to do in \n     order to deal with this challenge.\n\n  Yet Congress sleepwalks, refusing to listen, refusing to speak of it, \nrefusing to act when duty calls us to act, when history calls us to \nact, and when decency calls us to act.\n  I have a book in my office written by Geoffrey Regan. It is entitled \n``Great Naval Blunders: History's Worst Sea Battle Decisions from \nAncient Times to the Present Day.'' It is an interesting book to read. \nIt is a long history of episodes of folly and error that have ended in \ndisaster. It contains the account of a fleet of British naval ships \ndocked at harbor as a great typhoon bore down on them. The ships' \ncaptains knew the typhoon was so strong that it would tear the ships \nloose from their anchors and wreck them. They knew their only safe \nstrategy was to up anchor, head out of the harbor, and try to weather \nthe storm at sea, but none of the captains wanted to be the first ship \nto leave the port so they all stayed and the typhoon swept down and \nthey were destroyed.\n  Regan calls this ``an error of judgment that will forever remain a \nparadox in human psychology.'' We can make those kinds of errors of \njudgment, and for those captains and crews, the error was fatal. Facing \ncertain destruction, those sea captains refused to take the action that \nthey knew was necessary to save their ships, to save themselves, and to \nsave their crews.\n  I think of that story as we stand in the Senate unable to respond to \nwhat\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\nis looming down on us from climate change. The science could not be \nclearer. It is grownup time around here, and we need to take it \nseriously. The fact that one side of the aisle can't even use the word \n``climate change'' is a terrible sign.\n  John Wayne, a great American actor whom we all know, had a number of \nwonderful roles in his life. One of John Wayne's roles was to play \nSergeant Stryker in the movie ``Sands of Iwo Jima.'' In that movie, \nSergeant Stryker had a memorable phrase: ``Life is tough, but it's \ntougher if you're stupid.'' We have all the information in front of us \nthat we need to avoid being stupid. Collectively, that is what we are \nbeing. Similar to those captains, knowing what is bearing down on us, \nwe are somehow unable to take the action that will protect us, our \ncountry, and will protect our children and future generations. There is \nno better way to describe it than through the words of Sergeant \nStryker: ``Life is tough, but it's tougher if you're stupid.''\n  It is time to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNET.

DAY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fallen soldier \nfrom my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Nearly 64 years after \nbeing killed in the Korean war, Army CPL William F. Day's remains were \nfinally returned home last week.\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\n  Corporal Day was 25 years old when he was deployed to the Chosin \nReservoir in North Korea. On November 29, 1950, his company was \noverwhelmed by enemy forces and began a fighting withdrawal from their \nposition. Three days later, Corporal Day was reported missing in \naction.\n  Gloria Shonrock, Day's daughter, was only 4 at the time and has lived \nher life not knowing the location of her father's final resting place. \nUnbeknownst to her at the time, Day's remains were contained in one of \n208 boxes given to the United States by North Korea between 1991 and \n1994. Two years ago, Shonrock provided her DNA to the Department of \nDefense POW/Missing Personnel Office, which they were able to use to \nidentify her father's remains.\n  Now, over 60 years after being reported missing in action, Corporal \nDay is back in his old Kentucky home. Day was laid to rest yesterday in \nLa Center, KY, next to his mother, Mattie Day, in a funeral with full \nmilitary honors.\n  Corporal Day made the ultimate sacrifice in giving his life for our \ncountry. That his remains were returned home after so many years is a \nremarkable testament to our Nation's commitment to leaving no man \nbehind. I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring this fallen \nhero.\n  The Paducah Sun recently published an article chronicling the \nincredible story of the discovery and return of Corporal Day's remains. \nI ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n\n                  [From The Paducah Sun, Apr. 3, 2014]\n\n                La Center Korean War Veteran Comes Home\n\n                           (By Leanne Fuller)\n\n       Army Corporal William F. Day, of La Center, was reported \n     missing in North Korea on Dec. 2, 1950. After a long and \n     winding search of nearly 64 years, his remains were brought \n     home Wednesday.\n       Day's daughter, Gloria Shonrock--along with her husband, \n     Ernie Shonrock; other relatives, and two military liaisons--\n     brought the veteran's remains from Nashville, Tenn., to \n     Morrow Funeral Chapel in La Center Wednesday. They were \n     escorted from Nashville by Patriot Guard Riders, Shonrock \n     said, and welcomed into Ballard County with an escort of \n     firetrucks, ambulances and police vehicles.\n       Shonrock was four when her father was reported missing. \n     While Shonrock's mother didn't talk about Day often while she \n     was growing up, the absence was still felt.\n       ``I'd sit at the recess and cry because I wanted my daddy \n     and--you know--you grow out of that, but you still want your \n     dad,'' she said.\n       Shonrock said she has been searching for information about \n     her father since 1992, a search that took her from her home \n     in Erie, Colo., to Washington, D.C., and La Center.\n       Day's remains were found among 208 boxes of remains North \n     Korea gave the United States between 1991 and 1994. In a \n     recent announcement of the identification of Day's remains, \n     the Department of Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) \n     said the boxes were believed to contain remains of 350 to 400 \n     U.S. servicemen.\n       However, the remains were heavily commingled, which made \n     identification difficult. Two years ago, Shonrock provided \n     DNA to help identify her father's remains. Five years ago, \n     she said, her uncle, Herman Day, and her father's niece, \n     Mattie Terrell, also provided DNA.\n       In the search for her father, Shonrock attended yearly DPMO \n     conferences in Washington and various cities across the \n     country. At last year's conference, she said, X-ray records \n     had been found that could possibly be used to identify the \n     remains.\n       ``And between the DNA and those X-rays, they found my \n     dad,'' Shonrock said.\n       Scientists from the Joint POW/MIS Accounting Command and \n     the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory used the DNA \n     and X-rays to identify Day's remains, which were located in \n     Hawaii before they were flown to Nashville. Shonrock said Day \n     was the 100th person identified from the remains contained in \n     the 208 boxes.\n       ``It's been hell sometimes, and good other times,'' \n     Shonrock said of the long process. ``And then it's been hell \n     again because you have to deal with the government, and you \n     sit there and hurry up and wait.''\n       Among the good that came out of her search is that a \n     military office in Colorado helped connect Shonrock with \n     relatives on her dad's side of the family.\n       ``I had an aunt in Washington, and I had this aunt and \n     uncle here in Kentucky,'' Shonrock said. ``And I've been here \n     many times to see them.''\n       On Monday, Day will be buried in La Center--with full \n     military honors--next to his mother, Mattie Day. Day's name \n     is among those listed on the veterans monument at Ballard \n     Memorial High School, and before the funeral a memorial \n     service will be held in his honor at the school.\n       According to the DPMO, Day was assigned to Company C, 32nd \n     Infantry Regiment, 31st Regimental Combat Team in November \n     1950, deployed east of North Korea's Chosin Reservoir. The \n     31st RCT, known as Task Force Faith, was engaged by \n     ``overwhelming numbers of Chinese forces.'' On Nov. 29, 1950, \n     what was left of the task force began fighting a withdrawal \n     to positions near Hagaru-ri, south of the reservoir.\n       ``Personally it's a closure that I don't have to worry \n     about where he's at anymore,'' Shonrock said, ``or whether \n     he's in a ditch in Korea in the frozen area where he passed \n     away, or . . . where he's at: because he's been in Hawaii \n     since 1992-94.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2231-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I support the confirmation of Gen. \nFrank Taylor to be the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at \nthe Department of Homeland Security, DHS.\n  General Taylor has a long and distinguished career in national \nsecurity, starting with his 31 years in the U.S. Air Force, most of \nwhich was spent in counterintelligence. In his final assignment for the \nAir Force, General Taylor led the Air Force Office of Special \nInvestigations where his office provided independent investigations of \nfraud, counterintelligence, and major criminal matters.\n  In 2001, he was named Coordinator for Counterterrorism, the top \ncounterterrorism position in the State Department, where he was a key \nadvisor to Secretary of State Colin Powell. After that position, \nGeneral Taylor served as the Assistant Secretary of State in charge of \ndiplomatic security where he was in charge of security for over 250 \nU.S. embassies and consulates worldwide.\n  General Taylor has spent the past 9 years in the private sector, most \nas the chief security officer for General Electric where he was \nresponsible for GE's global security operations and crisis management. \nIn that position, he has seen the government's homeland security \nfunctions from the outside, giving him an important perspective on the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's support to the private sector.\n  General Taylor will have to put his extensive experience and \nleadership skills to good use as Under Secretary of DHS for \nIntelligence and Analysis. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis has \nbeen without a leader confirmed by the Senate for over a year now, and \nit has a large number of missions, like DHS as a whole.\n  I hope and expect that General Taylor will provide strong leadership \nto the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at DHS and I look forward to \nworking with him.\n  General Taylor was approved by the Intelligence Committee on March 4, \n2014, and the committee received several letters supporting him, \nincluding from the International Association of Chiefs of Police and \nthe Major Cities Chiefs Association which represents the law \nenforcement agencies in largest cities in the U.S.\n  I fully support General Taylor's confirmation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2231-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2231-S2232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CARLIN CONFIRMATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I supported the confirmation of Mr. \nJohn Carlin to be Assistant Attorney General for National Security in \nthe Department of Justice, DOJ.\n  Mr. Carlin was serving as the Acting Assistant Attorney General for \nNational Security, the top position in the National Security Division \nat the Department of Justice, which brings together the \ncounterterrorism, intelligence, and counterintelligence efforts within \nDOJ.\n  The National Security Division is also important because it reviews \nand approves requests to the FISA Court for surveillance authorities.\n  Mr. Carlin has superb experience for the position to which he has \nbeen confirmed, having served as the Acting Assistant Attorney General \nsince his\n\n[[Page S2232]]\n\npredecessor, Lisa Monaco, went to the White House last year to be \nPresident Obama's top advisor for counterterrorism and homeland \nsecurity.\n  Before his position as Acting Assistant Attorney General, Mr. Carlin \nwas the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General and chief of staff \nfor the National Security Division. From 2007 to 2011, he served in \nleadership roles at the FBI, including as chief of staff to FBI \nDirector Robert Mueller.\n  Mr. Carlin also served in a variety of positions in the Department \nbetween 1999 and 2007, including as a career Federal prosecutor, where \nMr. Carlin served as National Coordinator of DOJ's Computer Hacking and \nIntellectual Property, CHIP, program. Before that, he was an assistant \nU.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, where he prosecuted cases \nranging from homicide and sex crimes to cyber, fraud, and public \ncorruption matters.\n  In one noteworthy case, he obtained a guilty verdict against Modou \nCamara on charges of conspiracy, fraud, and money laundering, in \nconnection with real estate transactions in which Camara persuaded \nunqualified buyers to submit fraudulent loan applications through a \nfirst-time homebuyer program run by the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's, HUD, Federal Housing Administration, FHA. Through this \nscheme, Camara bought properties at low prices and sold them--usually \non the same day that he purchased them--at an artificially inflated \nprice for a large profit. When Camara's recruited purchasers failed to \nrepay their loans, HUD was forced to reimburse the lender. HUD lost \nover $1 million due to Camara's scheme.\n  As a prosecutor, he also obtained convictions in cases against a \ndefendant who tortured and murdered a baby girl, a defendant who bribed \nformer Congressman ``Duke'' Cunningham, and a defendant who was charged \nwith first-degree murder.\n  Mr. Carlin was approved by the Intelligence Committee on March 4, \n2014, and by the Judiciary Committee on February 6, 2014. Both \ncommittees received several letters in support of Mr. Carlin from \nsenior officials and colleagues from both sides of the aisle.\n  I fully support Mr. Carlin's confirmation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2232-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, this is a special week. The Week of \nthe Young Child, launched by the National Association for the Education \nof Young Children in 1971 and carried out in communities across the \ncountry, is a time to raise public awareness about the importance of \nhigh-quality early childhood education and to recognize the millions of \npeople who care for and teach young children every day.\n  The theme of this year's Week of the Young Child is ``early years are \nlearning years.'' Research is compelling that children are ready to \nlearn from birth--what they need are the positive conditions and \nopportunities to learn and thrive not only to be prepared for school \nbut to prepare to be productive adults.\n  Early childhood education is about development and learning, but it \nis also an economic driver. Nobel laureate James Heckman and others \nnote that when we invest in high-quality early childhood education, \nstarting with infants, the taxpayer benefits from lower expenditures \nfor special and remedial education, reduced juvenile crime rates, and \nhigher graduation rates.\n  Even though we know about the importance of early childhood \neducation, for many families the costs are too much for the family \nbudget, especially high-quality programs. The child care and \ndevelopment block grant, helping families afford childcare and helping \nstates raise the quality of care, serves only one in six eligible \nchildren. In fact, roughly 260,000 fewer children received assistance \nin 2012 than in 2006. I am glad we ended the cuts to Head Start in \nfiscal year 2014, but even so, we help less than half of the eligible \npreschoolers and only 4 percent of eligible Early Head Start infants \nand toddlers. State pre-K is growing, but it is uneven quality among \nour States and doesn't reach all the eligible children whose families \nwould want to enroll them. Early intervention services--a significant \nintervention for children's early school readiness--is woefully \nunderfunded as well.\n  The educators who work with these young children in childcare, Head \nStart and other program settings are very underpaid. A childcare \nprovider makes about $20,000 a year. The turnover rate is high. When \nteachers get a degree, they can move to better jobs to support their \nown families, but it means inconsistency of relationships for children \nand difficulty sustaining quality for providers. We must do more to \nensure early childhood educators get the specialized degrees and \ncredentials they need and then compensate them on par with their \nschool-based colleagues.\n  In my State of Alaska, one snowy night over a year ago in Anchorage, \nI met with about 50 strongly committed Alaska educators to talk about \nhow to improve our schools and prepare our students for the competitive \n21st-century economy.\n  From that conversation, the idea for three bills evolved. I then \nintroduced a package of legislation, the Keep Investing in \nDevelopmental Success, KIDS, Act. These three early childhood bills \nwill address access, quality, and affordability in early education \nprograms.\n  First, we will amend the Tax Code to provide a tax credit for early \nchildhood educators. The Tax Relief for Early Educators Act will expand \nthe deductions for certain expenses for early childhood education and \nincrease the childcare tax credit so more parents can afford to put \ntheir children in quality early child development programs.\n  Second, we will create a new student loan forgiveness program for \ngraduates of associate's or bachelor's programs in early education. The \nPreparing and Reinvesting in Early Education Act--or PRE ED--will \nprovide needed relief for early educators and encourage more to work \nwith kids through age 5. Well-trained educators providing quality early \neducation makes all the difference in a child's success.\n  Third, we need to reward companies offering onsite or near-site \nchildcare with a company cost-share. We know it works for the company \nand for the employee--just look around our State. In Alaska BP, Credit \nUnion One and Fairbanks Memorial Hospital are great examples. They all \noffer quality onsite centers. They know it makes more productive \nemployees.\n  The Child Care Public-Private Partnership Act will establish a \nprogram to provide childcare through partnerships. Through new grant \nincentives for small and medium companies, we can help more Alaska \ncompanies do the same.\n  These bills recognize the importance of childcare in the lives of \nworking families. They will make it easier for early childhood \neducators to provide stimulating and effective instruction in safe \nenvironments\n  As we recognize and celebrate this week of the young child, we need \nto be perfectly clear in our commitment to continue to support and \nexpand the education of children. I believe all of my colleagues in the \nSenate should join together to make this a priority because, as this \nyear's theme says so well, the early years are indeed the learning \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2232-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2232-S2233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ALLEN MAXWELL\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, recently, we tragically lost \nMonticello, AR Mayor Allen Maxwell very suddenly and unexpectedly. He \ndid a tremendous job as mayor. No one valued his family and community \nmore than Mayor Maxwell.\n  After a successful career in the private sector, Allen embarked on a \nsecond career in public service that included a stint as U.S. \nRepresentative Jay Dickey's chief of staff in the 1990's. Six years \nlater, he was motivated to run for an elected office of his own. It was \nan excellent decision that ended with a successful election to the \nArkansas House of Representatives where he represented district 10 for \n3 terms and focused on creating jobs in Arkansas's manufacturing sector \nbefore being term-limited out.\n  Committed to making Arkansas a better place to live and do business, \nAllen knew he could still contribute and decided to run for mayor of \nMonticello. He won with 70 percent of the vote, focused his energies on \ninfrastructure and capital improvements, and left his mark on \nMonticello before his sudden and untimely passing.\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\n  Mayor Maxwell was a great example for us all. A humble public servant \nwho entered this field for the right reasons--he truly wanted to help \nArkansans and make the State that he loved better. My staff and I \ngreatly missed his presence at the annual meeting with legislators in \nWashington. We continue to pray that his family and friends are \ncomforted by the fact that major efforts for his community and region \nand concern for his fellow man will continue to live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2233-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES FRANKEL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to salute \nJames B. Frankel, a respected lawyer, environmental activist, and a \npillar of the San Francisco community who recently celebrated his 90th \nbirthday.\n  James Frankel was born on February 25, 1924, in Chicago to Louis and \nThelma Frankel. After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1945, \nJim went on to earn a law degree from Yale University, where he met his \nfuture wife Louise. Shortly thereafter the couple moved to San \nFrancisco, where they raised their family.\n  In San Francisco, Jim maintained an active law practice until his \nretirement in 2000. He also contributed to the training and education \nof future lawyers, serving as an adjunct professor of law at Yale, UC \nBerkeley, Stanford, and UC Hastings.\n  Those of us who know Jim know that he is an inspiring and vibrant man \nwho has always been generous with both his time and his energy on \nbehalf of so many worthy causes. As an avid nature lover and \noutdoorsman passionate about backpacking, skiing, and the annual \nbicycle trips across Europe that he continued to take well into his \neighties, Jim was an early supporter of the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, for which he served as a trustee for nearly 20 years.\n  My family is lucky to have known Jim for many years, and I have \nalways admired his boundless passion and tireless zest for living life \nto its fullest. As Jim celebrates his 90th birthday, I am honored to \njoin Louise, their children and five grandchildren, and Jim's many \nfriends and admirers in offering my very best wishes on this wonderful \nmilestone and many more years of continued happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2233-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO ANN YOUNG\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, public service is a noble calling. \nThe work done by dedicated and hardworking government employees \nbenefits countless Americans from coast to coast and many across my \nhome State of Michigan. Indeed, there are many people who work \ntirelessly day after day to make sure the services we all rely on are \nthere when we need them most. That is why it is no exaggeration to say \nthat diligent and long-serving workers like Ann Young form the backbone \nof our great Nation. And, I am delighted to honor Ann, who recently \nretired after more than 40 years of Federal service.\n  Ann Young began her career in the Federal Government in 1973 with the \nAnimal and Plant Inspection Service within the Department of \nAgriculture and ended up staying in Federal health service for more \nthan four decades. Thousands of hardworking Michigan farmers rely on \nthe expertise and services provided by the Department of Agriculture, \nmany of those families reside in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. \nThroughout her career, Ann and her colleagues have been there for these \nfamilies, always ready to lend a hand and do what is needed. Her work \nwith the U.S. Forest Service and in the area of rural development has \ntruly made a difference.\n  Ann has dedicated her professional life to helping others. She \nfollows in a long and unbroken line of workers who have done the same. \nShe will be missed by those in the Upper Peninsula who have relied on \nher work for so many years. And, she will be missed by her colleagues \nwho have benefitted from her wisdom and insight. She can now take a \nwell-deserved break, enjoy life and spend more time with the people she \nholds dear. She is certainly in the perfect place to do it--The Upper \nPeninsula of Michigan, home to extraordinary natural beauty.\n  I am delighted to recognize the work of Ann Young and wish her the \nbest as she begins the next chapter of her life. She has certainly \nearned it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2233-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:43 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 404.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan urging the Congress of the United \n     States to repeal section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \n     Reform and Consumer Protection Act; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 19\n\n       Whereas, In response to the 2008 economic recession, the \n     Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was \n     enacted in July 2010 to increase accountability and improve \n     transparency in the nation's financial system. Among its \n     provisions, section 1502 of the act creates new reporting \n     requirements for publically traded companies that produce \n     products containing gold, tin, tantalum, or tungsten, known \n     as ``conflict minerals.'' These reporting requirements and \n     their public disclosure are meant to deter the purchase of \n     conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n     (DRC) and the surrounding nations of Central Africa Republic, \n     South Sudan, Zambia, Angola, the Republic of the Congo, \n     Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda; and\n       Whereas, The final rules on section 1502, issued by the \n     United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), \n     taking effect May 31, 2014, is exceedingly complex and \n     detrimental to American manufacturers, creating new, overly \n     taxing compliance costs, especially for American small \n     businesses, as well as unrealistic and burdensome reporting \n     requirements. The new rules require publically traded \n     manufacturers to trace conflict minerals through their entire \n     supply chain, all the way back to the smelter. The SEC \n     estimates the initial cost of compliance to be between $3 \n     billion and $4 billion, with annual costs thereafter between \n     $207 million and $609 million. However, the National \n     Association of Manufacturers estimates total costs to be $16 \n     billion; and\n       Whereas, The SEC rule on conflict minerals jeopardizes \n     Michigan's unparalleled efforts to restructure, create an \n     improved business environment, and recover jobs lost during \n     the recent recession. According to the Bureau of Labor and \n     Statistics, as of October of this year, our unemployment rate \n     of 9 percent ranked 48th among the states, 1.7 percent higher \n     than the nation's average. Moreover, the stalwart of the \n     Michigan economy--manufacturing--is still recovering. The \n     state of Michigan condemns the human rights violations \n     occurring in the DRC and surrounding nations. However, \n     absorbing the exorbitant costs of complying with section 1502 \n     will undermine our footing in the ongoing battle to grow \n     manufacturing jobs; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (The Senate \n     Concurring), That we urge the Congress of the United States \n     to repeal section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \n     and Consumer Protection Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the Chairman of the United States \n     Securities and Exchange Commission, and the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-211. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington urging Congress to update and amend the \n     Communications Decency Act; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8003\n\n       Whereas, The Communications Decency Act was enacted in \n     1996, nearly seventeen years ago when the internet was still \n     in a fledgling state and accessible only to about twenty \n     million Americans; and\n       Whereas, The internet of 1996 would be largely \n     unrecognizable in 2013, lacking nearly all of the popular \n     sites of today, such as YouTube, Google, Twitter, Facebook, \n     Wikipedia, Craig's List, and Backpage.com; and\n       Whereas, Today, the internet makes it possible for \n     companies such as Backpage.com to earn millions of dollars \n     annually from the sale of location-specific internet \n     advertisements, some of which directly facilitate the sex \n     trafficking of minors and other victims; and\n       Whereas, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \n     assures internet service providers like Backpage.com nearly \n     complete immunity from liability for the significant and \n     known role they play in promoting today's sex trafficking \n     industry through the sale and distribution of adult escort \n     advertisements on the internet; and\n       Whereas, When the Communications Decency Act was written in \n     1996, section 230 was intended to encourage internet service \n     providers to promote the growth of the internet without \n     incurring liability for third-party communications during a \n     time when the average American with internet access spent \n     thirty minutes each month on the web, compared with today's \n     average of twenty-seven hours per month; and\n       Whereas, The internet has evolved in ways few expected, \n     making section 230 of the Communications Decency Act now \n     outdated within the context, scope, and capability of today's \n     internet to instantly disseminate information and facilitate \n     rapid communication; and\n       Whereas, Without a change to section 230 of the \n     Communications Decency Act, states remain powerless to enact \n     meaningful reforms to hold accountable those internet service \n     providers who profit from the sale of adult escort \n     advertisements while turning a blind eye to their role in \n     facilitating crimes against children and refusing to \n     implement any bona fide measures to verify the age of persons \n     featured in those advertisements;\n        Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     Congress update and amend the Communications Decency Act to \n     reflect the current scope and power of the internet, to \n     acknowledge the publisher-like role of companies like \n     Backpage.com who profit from the sale and distribution of \n     advertisements on the internet, and to authorize states to \n     enact and enforce laws holding internet service providers \n     responsible when they knowingly facilitate child sex \n     trafficking through the sale of adult escort advertisements. \n     Be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-212.

That Wyoming urges EPA, in developing, \n     guidelines for regulating carbon dioxide emissions from \n     existing power plants, to respect the primacy of Wyoming and \n     to take into account the unique policies, energy needs, \n     resource mix and economic priorities of Wyoming and other \n     states.\n       Section 2. That EPA should issue guidelines and approve \n     state-established performance standards that are based on \n     reductions of carbon dioxide emissions that are practical and \n     achievable by measures undertaken at fossil-fueled power \n     plants.\n       Section 3. That Wyoming and other states should be given \n     maximum flexibility by EPA to implement carbon dioxide \n     performance standards for fossil-fueled power plants within \n     their jurisdiction.\n       Section 4.

Now therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming:\n       Section 1.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of Guam \n     requesting the President of the United States, the House of \n     Representatives, the Senate, and the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services further consider and amend the provisions of \n     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to facilitate \n     its equitable implementation in the territories; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                      Resolution No. 316-32 (COR)\n\n       Whereas, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     (PPACA) is intended to promote healthcare for millions of \n     Americans in the fifty (50) states and the District of \n     Columbia, by providing access to affordable healthcare, \n     ensuring quality through market reforms, and advancing \n     prevention and public health; and\n       Whereas, existing health insurance providers in the U.S. \n     offshore territories shall have to meet higher standards of \n     minimum coverage pursuant to the market reforms, which \n     include: essential health benefits, guaranteed issue, \n     guaranteed renewability, prohibitions on excluding \n     preexisting conditions, adjusted community rating, and other \n     consumer protections; and\n       Whereas, the PPACA also seeks to set up a healthcare \n     exchange system nation-wide, through which Americans could \n     buy or purchase not only affordable coverage, but coverage \n     with better essential health benefits; and\n       Whereas, to help accomplish this in the fifty (50) states \n     and Washington, D.C., the PPACA additionally provides the \n     means to partially offset the states' costs of operating the \n     exchanges, or the optional implementation of an equivalent \n     qualifying program, through what are known as the individual \n     and business mandates, as provided pursuant to specific \n     applicable excise tax provisions of the Internal Revenue \n     Code; and\n       Whereas, the Public Health Services Act (PHSA), that \n     includes benefits for the territories, provides that, ``The \n     term ``State''\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\n     means each of the several States, the District of Columbia, \n     Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and \n     the Northern Mariana Islands'' (PHSA 2791(d)(14)); and\n       Whereas, in Title I of the PPACA, it amends the PHSA, and \n     provides that, ``In this Title, the term ``State'' means each \n     of the 50 States and the District of Columbia'' (ACA \n     1304(d)); and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \n     has determined that PPACA's Public Health Service Act \n     provisions, to include market reforms (e.g., guaranteed \n     issue, guaranteed renewability, prohibitions on preexisting \n     condition exclusions, essential health benefits, adjusted \n     community rating, and other consumer protections), will apply \n     to health insurance coverage sold in the territories; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \n     has determined that PPACA's individual and business mandates \n     are not applicable to Guam; and\n       Whereas, the individual and business mandates are necessary \n     to help offset the costs of anticipated increases in health \n     insurance premiums, the implementation of which is directly \n     impeded by the exclusion, and is further exacerbated; and\n       Whereas, the selective inclusion or denial of applicability \n     to Guam places Guam in an untenable position, insofar that \n     the market reforms are applicable, but the means to partially \n     fund it through the individual and business mandates are \n     specifically excluded; and\n       Whereas, the PPACA's inequitable and unequal applicability \n     to America's off-shore territories will likely have the \n     unintended opposite impact of driving up the cost of \n     healthcare coverage if certain provisions are not amended so \n     as to properly include or exempt the territories to the \n     extent necessary and realistically practicable; and\n       Whereas, the Attorney General of Guam has raised in his \n     response to a Legislative inquiry (LEG 12-0708), that the \n     government could find itself liable, and stated, in part, \n     ``If we establish an Exchange, Guam will have to pay the \n     Advance Premium Tax Credit under U.S.C.A. Sec. 36B. This is \n     an unfunded mandate that Guam has to pay and it has been \n     estimated that this will cost Guam 74 Million Dollars per \n     year. If Guam does not establish an Exchange, there is the \n     possibility that a class action lawsuit could be brought for \n     payment of this credit much like the Earned Income Tax Credit \n     lawsuit in the past''; and\n       Whereas, Guam's Insurance Commissioner has estimated that \n     it would cost the government of Guam a minimum of 74 Million \n     Dollars annually to cover the eligible members in an \n     exchange, yet Guam's share of the startup appropriation under \n     the PPACA is only 24 Million Dollars, which is a one-time \n     subsidy and is not an annually recurring appropriation, a \n     situation that, ``if a territory elects to implement health \n     insurance exchanges, they will receive a limited allotment of \n     subsidy funding that only covers a fraction of needed funds'' \n     (see NAIC--October 16, 2013, letter to Secretary); and\n       Whereas, the individual and business mandates are tied into \n     specific excise tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, \n     which are not applicable to Guam, and it must be duly noted \n     that Section 31 of the Organic Act (48 U.S.C.) was enacted by \n     the Congress primarily to relieve the U.S. Treasury of making \n     direct appropriations to the government of Guam. Although \n     Congress delegated collection and enforcement function of the \n     income tax to the government of Guam, the government of Guam \n     is powerless to vary the terms of the Internal Revenue Code \n     as applied to Guam, except as permitted by Congress. [Bank of \n     America v. Chaco, C.A. Guam 1976, 539 F 2d 1226]; and\n       Whereas, pursuant to the taxation limitations established \n     in the Organic Act of Guam, as previously provided by the \n     U.S. Congress in 1950, Guam is now prevented from \n     unilaterally implementing under local law the individual and \n     business mandates, by way of Guam's implementation of the \n     mirrored excise tax provisions taken from the Internal \n     Revenue Code and established under local law; and\n       Whereas, Guam's four domestic health insurance carriers \n     have stated, in a January 23, 2014 briefing before the Guam \n     Legislature, that the resulting impact of the PPACA market \n     reforms will cause carriers to raise premium rates to offset \n     the costs of implementing the applicable market reforms; and\n       Whereas, although the PPACA is intended to increase access \n     to affordable healthcare for millions of Americans in the \n     fifty (50) states and the District of Columbia, it will have \n     the unintended opposite impact for Americans in the off-shore \n     U.S. territory of Guam; and\n       Whereas, the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners (NAIC) has duly considered the impact to the \n     U.S. territories, and has stated, in a letter to the U.S. \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, dated October 16, \n     2013, ``We urge you . . . to provide the Territories with the \n     flexibility that they need to determine whether and how the \n     market reforms should be applied''; and\n       Whereas, the NAIC paper further states, ``Though the \n     statute itself is unclear, (HHS) has determined that the \n     ACA's market reforms will apply to health insurance coverage \n     sold in the territories, while the individual and employer \n     mandates will not. If a territory elects to implement health \n     insurance exchanges, they will receive a limited allotment of \n     subsidy funding that only covers a fraction of needed funds. \n     As a result, the threat of adverse selection driving up \n     premiums is much higher than it is in the states''; and\n       Whereas, the Guam Legislature takes due note of the NAIC \n     paper which highlights ``the often-stated position taken by \n     the ACA's congressional sponsors and the administration that \n     these reforms are not possible without the individual mandate \n     and the subsidies''; and\n       Whereas, the Guam Legislature supports the veracity of the \n     information provided, and endorses the statement, findings \n     and arguments put forward by the NAIC to the Secretary; and\n       Whereas, Guam's inability to participate is not from an \n     unwillingness on our part, but, rather, from a failure to \n     duly consider the situation of Guam, the size of our \n     population and insurance risk pool, our economy, and the \n     conflicting statutes and unfunded mandates the Congress has \n     unilaterally established; and\n       Whereas, the American citizens of the off-shore U.S. \n     territory of Guam must not be excluded from the opportunity \n     to be legitimately included in the PPACA; and\n       Whereas, it would only prove just and proper for the \n     Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human \n     Services, and the honorable Members of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives and the U.S. Senate, to duly consider the \n     issues and matters raised in this Resolution; and\n       Whereas, at the urging and request of Americans in the \n     respective fifty (50) states and District of Columbia, \n     numerous extensions and accommodations have been granted by \n     the administration and the Secretary of the U.S. Department \n     of Health and Human Services, yet no extensions or \n     accommodations have been provided to the Americans in the \n     off-shore U.S. territories; now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that I Mina'Trentai Dos Na Liheslaturan Guaahan \n     (the 32nd Guam Legislature) does hereby, on behalf of the \n     people of Guam, request that the President of the United \n     States, the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, \n     and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human \n     Services further consider and amend, as necessary, the \n     provisions of the PPACA so as to facilitate its equitable \n     implementation in the territories, which must be inclusive of \n     a determination to:\n       1. Include Guam in the mandates and provide for the phased-\n     in applicability of the provisions of the PPACA, and fully \n     provide the correlated premium subsidies and additional \n     Medicaid subsidies; and\n       2. Finally address the October 16, 2013 letter the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) sent to \n     Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Department of Health and \n     Human Services, regarding the inequities and challenges that \n     Guam and other U.S. territories are facing with the \n     implementation of PPACA; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Speaker certify, and the Legislative \n     Secretary attest to, the adoption hereof, and that copies of \n     the same be thereafter transmitted to the Honorable Barack \n     Obama, President, United States of America; to the Speaker of \n     the U.S. House of Representatives; to the President of the \n     U.S. Senate; to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of \n     Health and Human Services; to the Secretary of the U.S. \n     Department of the Interior; to the Assistant Secretary of the \n     Interior for Insular Affairs; to the Honorable Jack Kingston, \n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \n     Education, and Related Agencies, 113th Congress, U.S. House \n     of Representatives; to the Honorable Tom Harkin, Chairman, \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, U.S. \n     Senate; to the Honorable Madeleine Z.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing the \n     President and Congress of the United States to support \n     Michigan's application for a state-sponsored EB-5 regional \n     center; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 315\n\n       Whereas, Attracting job-producing investments is critical \n     to the continued economic recovery of the state of Michigan \n     and the United States as a whole. Michigan--a longstanding \n     leader of our nation's industrial economy--sustained \n     significant damage in the aftermath of the 2002 and 2008 \n     economic downturns. In recent years, however, Michigan's \n     economic engine has begun turning again, marked by increasing \n     property values and per capita incomes as well as an \n     unemployment rate that continues to decline. With strides \n     still to go, capital investments, including foreign direct \n     investments, can infuse new growth in Michigan's economy and \n     is an important element for Michigan's continued recovery; \n     and\n       Whereas, The EB-5 investor-immigrant program is a \n     constructive tool for attracting foreign investments to \n     Michigan. In this program, immigrants willing to invest at \n     least $1,000,000 in capital to create a new business or take \n     over an existing, troubled business can obtain an employment-\n     based visa. For targeted unemployment areas--areas like \n     Detroit that are experiencing an unemployment rate at least \n     150 times the national average--or rural areas, an \n     employment-based visa can be issued with a minimum investment \n     of $500,000. This capital investment\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\n     goes toward creating American jobs, rebuilding and \n     revitalizing our neighborhoods, and bringing new money to our \n     local economies. EB-5 participants, as required by the \n     federal statute, must directly create or retain at least ten \n     domestic jobs within two years, jobs that otherwise may have \n     never come to the United States; and\n       Whereas, EB-5 regional centers serve as a mechanism for \n     coordinating and attracting potential investor-immigrants as \n     well as offering investor-immigrants enhanced services. \n     Public regional centers can serve as international marketers \n     for the area in which they represent. Public regional centers \n     also serve as concentrators of economic development, \n     compounding investment after investment into their local \n     economies. Investor-immigrants using regional centers also \n     benefit from a broader interpretation of the EB-5 job \n     creation requirement. While the minimum investment \n     requirements remain the same, immigrant-investors going \n     through an EB-5 regional center may count indirect job \n     creation as well; and\n       Whereas, The establishment of a state of Michigan EB-5 \n     regional center would be a crucial component in the ongoing \n     effort to rebuild our economy. State-sponsored regional \n     centers provide an unparalleled ability to attract and retain \n     potential investors. States like Michigan can bring investor-\n     immigrants to the table in ways private regional centers \n     cannot and develop solid, lasting relationships. Statewide \n     regional centers can also develop and deploy an estimable \n     portfolio of statewide resources like industrial site \n     searches, facilitate connections with local suppliers, \n     laborers, and other businesses, and provide a general \n     orientation of the government and economic environment to \n     business owners; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the President and Congress of the United States \n     to support Michigan's application for a state-sponsored EB-5 \n     regional center; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, Chairman and Ranking Member of the United \n     States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Chairman and \n     Ranking Member of the United States House Committee on the \n     Judiciary, Director of the United States Citizenship and \n     Immigration Services, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-217. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing the \n     President and Congress of the United States to support \n     Michigan's request for 50,000 EB-5 visas to assist in the \n     economic recovery of the city of Detroit; to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 316\n\n       Whereas, Professionals with advanced skills in science, \n     technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) are crucial to \n     the continued development of our economy. However, Michigan \n     continues to suffer from a shortage of workers with advanced \n     training in STEM-related skills, and this shortage is \n     expected to worsen over the coming years with STEM-related \n     occupations growing 1.7 times the rate of non-STEM-related \n     occupations. By 2018, Michigan is estimated to have 274,000 \n     more STEM-related positions available than professionals to \n     fill them. While we are committed to increasing STEM \n     proficiency in our own students, Michigan must also seek out \n     and retain professionals with advanced degrees to help build \n     our economy now; and\n       Whereas, The city of Detroit has a special need for skilled \n     professionals to help rebuild, revitalize, and reinvigorate \n     the city. In recent years, Detroit, an iconic American city, \n     has seen an unprecedented decline in population, and the loss \n     of local revenue has made it difficult for the city to meet \n     its financial obligations. Recruiting skilled professionals \n     is one step toward achieving economic recovery and relieving \n     the city's acute unemployment. In addition to adding a \n     valuable new dynamic to the local economy, with their \n     employment comes new consumers, increasing demand, and job \n     growth in other sectors; and\n       Whereas, Allowing immigrants to fill vacant STEM positions \n     would provide an economic boost to the state of Michigan and \n     the city of Detroit. Through the recruitment and retention of \n     foreign-born professionals, targeted immigration can help \n     quench the unmet demands of Michigan's labor market--avoiding \n     the suppression of economic production and growth that \n     results--and help fortify the long-term health of its \n     economy. Immigrants working in the United States also \n     leverage their skills to contribute to the American economy \n     rather than increasing the productivity and value of another \n     nation's economy; and\n       Whereas, Federal employment-based visa programs, \n     particularly the EB-2 program, grant foreign-born \n     professionals legal working status in the United States. \n     Designed for individuals with advanced degrees or its \n     equivalent, the EB-2 program permits foreign-born \n     professionals with STEM-related or business skills to be \n     employed with domestic businesses, businesses otherwise \n     unable to fill these jobs with the existing labor market. \n     This program also encourages immigrants with exceptional \n     abilities--abilities in science, art, or business that are \n     significantly above those of ordinary workers in the field--\n     to obtain an EB-2 visa; and\n       Whereas, The state of Michigan has requested a pilot \n     program be instituted to reallocate 50,000 EB-2 visas over \n     the next five years for use in the city of Detroit. As \n     proposed, 5,000 visas would be made available to foreign-born \n     professionals the first year, 10,000 visas for the next three \n     years, and 15,000 visas would be available in the fifth year. \n     Rather than taking from the national pool of annually-\n     available EB-2 visas, the administration would reallocate any \n     unused EB-1, EB-2, EB-3, and family-based preference visas \n     into the EB-2 pilot program, making them available for \n     employment opportunities in the city of Detroit; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the President and Congress of the United States \n     to support Michigan's request for 50,000 EB-2 visas to assist \n     in the economic recovery of the city of Detroit; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, Chairman and Ranking Member of the United \n     States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Chairman and \n     Ranking Member of the United States House Committee on the \n     Judiciary, Director of the United States Citizenship and \n     Immigration Services, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-218.

A bill to extend the authorization for the Automobile \nNational Heritage Area in Michigan; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the automobile is central to who we are as \nMichiganians. The automotive industry helped create the middle class, \nshape the labor movement, establish America's dominance in \nmanufacturing, and spur new innovation across a range of other economic \nsectors.\n  For these reasons, Congressman Dingell in the House of \nRepresentatives and I in the Senate introduced legislation in 1998 to \nestablish the Motor Cities National Heritage Area. That legislation \nspecified the heritage area would serve not only to preserve and \ninterpret the history of our Nation's automotive heritage, but that it \nwould also promote current and future economic opportunities.\n  The MotorCities National Heritage Area has provided over one million \ndollars to support tourism projects that have boosted economic activity \nand jobs. These grants attract additional investment because funding is \ntypically matched by more than $6 for each $1 in grant funding. \nMotorCities also connects a broad range of auto-related organizations \nand attractions, and has connected more than 100 organizations, which \nhas bolstered their visibility and impact.\n  Michigan is a magnet for car enthusiasts and history buffs around the \nglobe and MotorCities helps them learn about our history and celebrate \nit with us. When visitors come to Detroit to see where Henry Ford built \nthe Model T or to Lansing to learn about the rise of Oldsmobile, the \nexistence of the Motor Cities National Heritage Area enhances their \nvisit.\n  These activities will not be supported by the National Park Service \nafter September 30, 2014 due to a sunset clause in the original \nenabling legislation. For this reason I am introducing today \nlegislation to extend the date for which federal assistance may still \nbe provided. Congressman Dingell is introducing similar legislation in \nthe House.

Mrs. FISCHER (for herself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Ayotte, and Ms. \nMurkowski) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by her to the \nbill S. 2199, to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide \nmore effective remedies to victims of discrimination in the payment of \nwages on the basis of sex, and for other purposes; which was ordered to \nlie on the table; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Workplace Advancement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1963, Congress passed on a bipartisan basis the \n     Equal Pay Act of 1963 to prohibit discrimination on account \n     of sex in the payment of wages for equal work performed by \n     employees for employers engaged in commerce or in the \n     production of goods for commerce.\n       (2) Following the passage of such Act, in 1964, Congress \n     passed on a bipartisan basis the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n       (3) Since the passage of both the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1964, women have made significant \n     strides, both in the workforce and in their educational \n     pursuits.\n       (4) Currently, according to a Prudential Research Study, 60 \n     percent of women are the primary earners in their households \n     and the Bureau of Labor Statistics has found that 47 percent \n     of women are members of the workforce.\n       (5) According to the Department of Education, women receive \n     57 percent of all college degrees, a 33 percent increase from \n     1970.\n       (6) Women hold the majority of positions in the 5 fastest \n     growing fields, and women are more likely than men to work in \n     professional and related occupations.\n       (7) Despite this significant progress, surveys suggest \n     there is a concern among American women that gender-based pay \n     discrimination still exists.\n       (8) Over the last 15 years, the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission has received on average 2,400 \n     complaints annually alleging gender-based pay discrimination. \n     This represents two to three percent of charges filed with \n     the Commission during the same time period. Even though the \n     Commission determines that no discrimination occurred in a \n     majority of these complaints, the extent to which these \n     allegations continue underscores there is still progress to \n     be made.\n       (9) A number of factors contribute to differences in total \n     compensation, including variations in occupation, education, \n     hours worked, institutional knowledge, and other business \n     reasons and personal choices that shape career paths and \n     earning potential.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON WAGE DISCRIMINATION.\n\n       Pursuant to Federal law in effect on the date of enactment \n     of this Act:\n       (1) In general.--No employer shall discriminate, within any \n     establishment in which employees are employed by the \n     employer, between employees on the basis of sex by paying \n     wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than \n     the rate at which the employer pays wages to employees of the \n     opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs the \n     performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and \n     responsibility, and which are performed under similar working \n     conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to--\n       (A) a seniority system;\n       (B) a merit system;\n       (C) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality \n     of production; or\n       (D) a differential based on any other factor other than \n     sex.\n       (2) Limitation.--An employer who is paying a wage rate \n     differential in violation of this section shall not, in order \n     to comply to comply with the provisions of this section, \n     reduce the wage rate of any employee.\n       (3) Notice.--Every employer, employment agency, and labor \n     organization, as the case may be, shall post and keep posted \n     in conspicuous places upon its premises where notices to \n     employees, applicants for employment, and members are \n     customarily posted, a notice to be prepared or approved by \n     the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that sets forth \n     excerpts, from or, summaries of, the pertinent provisions of \n     title Act and of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n     and information pertinent to the filing of a complaint.\n\n     SEC. 4.

KEYSTONE XL PERMIT APPROVAL.\n\n       (a) In General.--In accordance with clause 3 of section 8 \n     of article I of the Constitution (delegating to Congress the \n     power to regulate commerce with foreign nations), TransCanada \n     Keystone Pipeline, L.P. is authorized to construct, connect, \n     operate, and maintain pipeline facilities for the import of \n     crude oil and other hydrocarbons at the United States-Canada \n     Border at Phillips County, Montana, in accordance with the \n     application filed with the Department of State on May 4, \n     2012.\n       (b) Presidential Permit Not Required.--Notwithstanding \n     Executive Order No. 13337 (3 U.S.C. 301 note), Executive \n     Order No. 11423 (3 U.S.C. 301 note), section 301 of title 3, \n     United States Code, and any other Executive order or \n     provision of law, no presidential permit shall be required \n     for the facilities described in subsection (a).\n       (c) Environmental Impact Statement.--The final \n     environmental impact statement issued by the Secretary of \n     State on August 26, 2011, the Final Evaluation Report issued \n     by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality on \n     January 3, 2013, and the Draft Supplemental Environmental \n     Impact Statement issued on March 1, 2013, regarding the crude \n     oil pipeline and appurtenant facilities associated with the \n     facilities described in subsection (a), shall be considered \n     to satisfy--\n       (1) all requirements of the National Environmental Policy \n     Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); and\n       (2) any other provision of law that requires Federal agency \n     consultation or review with respect to the facilities \n     described in subsection (a) and the related facilities in the \n     United States.\n       (d) Permits.--Any Federal permit or authorization issued \n     before the date of enactment of this Act for the facilities \n     described in subsection (a), and the related facilities in \n     the United States shall remain in effect.\n       (e) Federal Judicial Review.--The facilities described in \n     subsection (a), and the related facilities in the United \n     States, that are approved by this section, and any permit, \n     right-of-way, or other action taken to construct or complete \n     the project pursuant to Federal law, shall only be subject to \n     judicial review on direct appeal to the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n     SEC. 112. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF EXPORTATION OF NATURAL GAS TO \n                   UKRAINE AND NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION \n                   MEMBER COUNTRIES AND JAPAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--In accordance with clause 3 of section 8 \n     of article I of the Constitution of the United States \n     (delegating to Congress the power to regulate commerce with \n     foreign nations), Congress finds that exports of natural gas \n     produced in the United States to Ukraine, member countries of \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Japan is--\n\n[[Page S2249]]\n\n       (1) necessary for the protection of the essential security \n     interests of the United States; and\n       (2) in the public interest pursuant to section 3 of the \n     Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b).\n       (b) Expedited Approval.--Section 3(c) of the Natural Gas \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 717b(c)) is amended by inserting ``, to \n     Ukraine, to a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization, or to Japan'' after ``trade in natural gas''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (b) \n     shall apply to applications for the authorization to export \n     natural gas under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. \n     717b) that are pending on, or filed on or after, the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n\n                      Subtitle B--Saving Coal Jobs\n\n     SEC. 120. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Saving Coal Jobs Act of \n     2014''.\n\n                   PART I--PROHIBITION ON ENERGY TAX\n\n     SEC. 121. PROHIBITION ON ENERGY TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings; Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) on June 25, 2013, President Obama issued a Presidential \n     memorandum directing the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to issue regulations relating to power \n     sector carbon pollution standards for existing coal fired \n     power plants;\n       (B) the issuance of that memorandum circumvents Congress \n     and the will of the people of the United States;\n       (C) any action to control emissions of greenhouse gases \n     from existing coal fired power plants in the United States by \n     mandating a national energy tax would devastate major sectors \n     of the economy, cost thousands of jobs, and increase energy \n     costs for low-income households, small businesses, and \n     seniors on fixed income;\n       (D) joblessness increases the likelihood of hospital \n     visits, illnesses, and premature deaths;\n       (E) according to testimony on June 15, 2011, before the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate by \n     Dr. Harvey Brenner of Johns Hopkins University, ``The \n     unemployment rate is well established as a risk factor for \n     elevated illness and mortality rates in epidemiological \n     studies performed since the early 1980s. In addition to \n     influences on mental disorder, suicide and alcohol abuse and \n     alcoholism, unemployment is also an important risk factor in \n     cardiovascular disease and overall decreases in life \n     expectancy.'';\n       (F) according to the National Center for Health Statistics, \n     ``children in poor families were four times as likely to be \n     in fair or poor health as children that were not poor'';\n       (G) any major decision that would cost the economy of the \n     United States millions of dollars and lead to serious \n     negative health effects for the people of the United States \n     should be debated and explicitly authorized by Congress, not \n     approved by a Presidential memorandum or regulations; and\n       (H) any policy adopted by Congress should make United \n     States energy as clean as practicable, as quickly as \n     practicable, without increasing the cost of energy for \n     struggling families, seniors, low-income households, and \n     small businesses.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to ensure that--\n       (i) a national energy tax is not imposed on the economy of \n     the United States; and\n       (ii) struggling families, seniors, low-income households, \n     and small businesses do not experience skyrocketing \n     electricity bills and joblessness;\n       (B) to protect the people of the United States, \n     particularly families, seniors, and children, from the \n     serious negative health effects of joblessness;\n       (C) to allow sufficient time for Congress to develop and \n     authorize an appropriate mechanism to address the energy \n     needs of the United States and the potential challenges posed \n     by severe weather; and\n       (D) to restore the legislative process and congressional \n     authority over the energy policy of the United States.\n       (b) Presidential Memorandum.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the head of a Federal agency shall not \n     promulgate any regulation relating to power sector carbon \n     pollution standards or any substantially similar regulation \n     on or after June 25, 2013, unless that regulation is \n     explicitly authorized by an Act of Congress.\n\n                            PART II--PERMITS\n\n     SEC. 131.

Mr. President, I want to return today to the subject of \nimmigration. Today marks the 285th day since the immigration bill \npassed right here in the Senate with almost 70 votes, and 285 days \nlater we are still waiting for the House of Representatives to act on \nthat bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Every single day the House drags its feet on immigration, our borders \nremain less secure, our visa system keeps us less competitive, our \neconomy suffers, and millions of families remain in the shadows.\n  Hard-working immigrants who came here to live the American dream and \nwho are part of the fabric of our communities all over the State of \nColorado and all over the United States of America are suffering \nbecause Congress has not passed a bill, families such as Dulce Saenz's \nfamily from Hudson, CO.\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\nWhen Dulce's father was deported, she and one of her sisters stayed in \nColorado to start college while her mom and younger sister moved to \nMexico to be with their dad. It was a heartbreaking decision for the \nfamily to separate, but that is what they needed to do. Now all three \nsisters have gone to the University of Denver in Colorado. They have \nstarted careers in public service. But they rarely see their parents. \nThey worry about their safety.\n  It is clear to everybody I talk to here and at home that our current \nimmigration system is broken. It is also clear to me and I think to \nmany people that separating families does not reflect our history and \nit does not do honor to the values that shape that history. So while \nthe House stalls, the Secretary of Homeland Security is reviewing our \ndeportation policy and exploring other ways we can help keep families \ntogether. It is a good step in the absence of a bill. We should \nprioritize deportation in a way that reflects our values as a country, \nupholds the rule of law, and keeps families together. But in the end, \nthe only way to come to a full and permanent solution is to pass this \nimmigration reform bill.\n  Of course, this is not unusual in Washington these days when we have \nbecome so used to getting the bare minimum accomplished, keeping the \nlights on for another week or for another month. But what is so \nfrustrating on this issue is that we have bipartisan agreement that the \ncurrent immigration system is broken and that it is doing no favors to \nthis country.\n  The coalition we built in favor of reform is unprecedented. I was not \nsurprised. When we started this in Colorado, first I would travel \naround the State and I would hear peach growers in Palisade say one \nthing about what they hoped for in an immigration bill, I would hear \nthe cattle ranchers say something else, the ski resorts say something \nelse, our high-tech community, our immigrant rights community--\neverybody coming together to say: You know what, it is long past time \nto get this fixed.\n  When we brought this to the national level, working together with the \nso-called group or gang of 8 on immigration, we were able to build a \ncoalition that really is unprecedented. In the 5 years I have been \nhere, I have not seen universal agreement on anything like we have seen \non the immigration bill.\n  In June of last year, right here in the Senate, we passed a strong \nbipartisan bill--a bill that strengthens our economy and reduces our \ndebt, a bill that keeps families together, protects our borders and our \ncommunities, and gives families who came to this country for a better \nlife a chance to earn citizenship and contribute to our economy and to \nour society.\n  As I mentioned, I was part of that Gang of 8 who negotiated the bill. \nFor those who despair about the lack of leadership in Congress--and I \nhear about this all the time, as I know all of my colleagues do--I tell \nthem that for my part, as one American, the greatest sign or signal of \nlegislative leadership that I have seen in the past 5 years was the \nleadership provided by John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, and \nJeff Flake, the four Republicans who sat at that table for 7 or 8 \nmonths and negotiated the immigration bill. It was a lot harder for \nthem to stay there than it was for the Democrats. But those four \nRepublicans sat at the table for 8 months and negotiated a bill because \nthey knew it was the right thing to do for the country and, \nparenthetically, the right thing to do for their party in that order.\n  Yet here we are. After all that bipartisan agreement, after all that \nbipartisan work, after a great bipartisan vote on the floor of the \nSenate on one of the most immediate issues facing this country, 9 \nmonths after our bill passed the Senate we still do not have a bill at \nthe President's desk.\n  The House of Representatives is privileged to have the opportunity to \nrise above politics as usual and to do something big, something real, \nsomething consequential that will last for this country. The House of \nRepresentatives has the privilege to show that stalemate does not have \nto be standard operating procedure in Washington, DC.\n  This issue is completely bipartisan at home. I hear about this as \nmuch from Republicans--maybe even more from Republicans in farm country \nthan I do from Democrats, the chance to do something important for our \nNation and for our future. But until the House acts, families, farmers, \nand businesses all across my State and all across the United States \nwill continue to suffer, farmers such as Eric Hanagan and Michael \nHirakata outside of Rocky Ford, who cannot get the seasonal workers \nthey need and are forced to watch crops--in their case, melons--die in \nthe field.\n  Colorado's high-tech companies on the front range--ranging from \nbioscience, engineering, and aerospace--cannot always find the \nemployees they need. In fact, they often cannot find the employees, \nwhich introduces an entirely different subject that relates to our K-12 \neducation system, but that is not the topic of the speech today.\n  We know that almost one-quarter of STEM graduates from Colorado's \nSTEM--math and science graduates from Colorado's leading universities \nare immigrants who are graduating in the United States, many of whose \neducation has been subsidized by us. Instead of saying to them, \n``Please stay here; build our business here; go work for one of our \nhigh-tech companies here,'' we are saying to them, ``Go home. We would \nmuch rather have you compete with us from India. Go home. We would much \nrather have you compete with us from China.'' It is ridiculous. It \nmakes no sense.\n  The Senate bill, the bill we passed, changes that. The bill we passed \nsays: If you are a STEM graduate from another country and you graduate \nfrom an American university and you have a job offer in the United \nStates of America, we will staple the green card to your diploma.\n  That is what we need in this country. That is what the high-tech \nindustry in Colorado needs out of the House of Representatives.\n  I mentioned tourism at our ski resorts. They will continue to suffer. \nThis is Colorado's second largest industry.\n  There are a lot of reasons to act, there are a lot of economic \nreasons to act, but I think there are also fundamental reasons that \nhave to do with who we are as a country. It is often said that America \nis a nation of immigrants. Of course that is true. There is literally \nno other country in the world for which immigration is so central to \nits history and to its identity.\n  I have heard enough speeches in this Chamber to know that for a lot \nof us, for a lot of the 100 of us, it is very personal as well. I am a \nfirst-generation American. I know there are many others who are here. \nThere is not a person in this Chamber who does not have immigration as \npart of their family's history.\n  But this is not just a theoretical idea, that we are a nation of \nimmigrants. I want to take a moment to reflect on what this really \nmeans. This is a photo I am proud to say I actually managed to take \nwith my cell phone. My daughters would be shocked to know that I was \nable not only to get the picture taken, but it is not even blurry.\n  I had an occasion--I hope the Presiding Officer has had the \nopportunity to do it--to do something I never imagined I would ever \nhave the chance to do. I attended a naturalization ceremony held for \nActive-Duty servicemembers at Fort Carson, CO. Let's be clear. These \nare men and women who are serving the United States of America in \nuniform. On that day they became citizens of the United States. Until \nthat day they were not citizens but still they were serving and are \nserving in our Armed Forces. The 13 soldiers and spouses who became \nU.S. citizens that day represented 12 different countries. This is a \npicture of them--12 different countries among the 13.\n  I am going to read the list. I was so blown away by the list that I \nasked one of the people from the INS who was there to give me what is \ncalled the oath ceremony nationality report from which they read the \nnames of the countries. It is an astonishing list. Here are the \ncountries these folks are from: China, the People's Republic of China, \nColombia, Haiti, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nicaragua, the Philippines, \nSouth Korea, Togo, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom--12 different \ncountries.\n  Every single one of them came here in pursuit of the American dream, \njust as generations of people from around\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\nthe world have sought out the United States to build their future. \nThese are the people--and people just like them all across the United \nStates of America--who are going to determine our future, just as every \ngeneration of immigrants has helped us to determine our future. Whether \nit is refugees fleeing persecution, whether it is parents seeking \nopportunity for their children, it is those stepping forward to \nsacrifice for our shared values, as all of these young men and women \nare, who make America the country we love. There is no way to argue \nthat our current immigration policies reflect that history or our \nvalues.\n\n  Let me paint a picture of what our country would look like if this \nimmigration bill were passed. Just to be clear, again, it is not \nimaginary; we passed the bill in the Senate.\n  If people on the other side have issues with the bill, what I say is \nwe have no monopoly on wisdom. Bring your ideas; improve the bill. I \ncan think of some things I would do to improve that bill, but you can't \njust do nothing. You can't do nothing, because if we pass the bill in \nthe House, those who come to this country for a better life, including \nyoung people--whose parents brought them here as children, and they are \nhere through no fault of their own--would have the opportunity to enter \na tough but fair path to citizenship. With a path in place we would \nthen see higher wages, more consumption of goods and increased taxes.\n  It would reduce our debt. This bill--and this is not me talking, \nMichael Bennet from Colorado, this is the Congressional Budget Office--\nwould reduce our debt by nearly $1 trillion over 20 years. I am unaware \nof any other piece of legislation that has passed with a bipartisan \nmajority in the Congress that reduces our debt by $1 trillion but this \nwould. It wouldn't do it in across-the-board cuts. It would do it \nbecause of the growth it would create in our economy, the incremental \neconomic growth. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has said that \nif we pass this bill, we would see an increase of almost 6 percent of \nincremental GDP growth over this 20-year period, 3 percent in the first \n10 years and 5 percent in the second 10 years.\n  Second, our bill would put into place an efficient and flexible visa \nsystem that would catapult our competitiveness in a changing 21st \ncentury economy. Canada, our neighbor to the North, is figuring out how \nto attract the world's talent to its shores. That is what they are \nspending their time doing. We, a historic nation of immigrants, are \nsaying please go home and compete with us from someplace else or maybe \ngo to Canada and compete with us from there. Talented entrepreneurs and \ninnovators from around the world would have the opportunity to stay if \nwe passed this bill and create jobs to fuel our economy. It is well-\ndocumented how many Fortune 500 companies were started by immigrants, \nbut millions of small businesses across the United States have been \nstarted by immigrants as well. High-skilled workers in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math and lower skilled workers in \nindustries such as hospitality and tourism would come into the country \nto fill jobs where there are no available U.S. workers. This was a bill \nthat labor and the chamber endorsed. That is the first time that has \nhappened. It was a difficult and painful negotiation, but we were able \nto get it done, and they agreed we ought to get it done.\n  It is very important for Colorado and a lot of other States. We would \nstabilize the challenges facing our agricultural industry with a new \nstreamlined program for agricultural guest workers that is more usable \nfor employees and protects our workers.\n  Again, this is the first bill ever. We call this portion the AgJOBS \nbill, the first one--first one--to be endorsed by the growers and the \nfarm workers. That has never happened before, but working with Senator \nRubio, Senator Hatch, and Senator Feinstein, we were able to get that \ndone.\n  Finally, and more importantly, our borders would be more secure with \nnew fencing, double the number of border agents, and increased spending \non new technology. We have what they call full situational awareness on \nthe border to allow us to interdict threats rapidly and successfully--\nand, very importantly, with a mandatory employment verification system \nand more effective entry-exit system, we would prevent future waves in \nillegal immigration so we don't end back up in the problem we are \nfacing today. Then our small businesses all across the country can stop \nbeing the INS and concentrate on building their businesses. These are \nall changes our Nation urgently needs, and there are more.\n  I am not here to argue for some partisan piece of legislation that \ndidn't attract votes on both sides. This bill was entirely bipartisan \nfrom beginning to end. I have heard a laundry list of excuses out of \npeople in the House why they haven't addressed immigration reform, but \nat some point it is time for those excuses to stop and for the stalling \nto stop. If they want to show the country they are serious about \ngrowing our economy and keeping families together, then they need to \nshow us they are serious about immigration reform.\n  I actually think the Speaker wants to pass a bill. In fact, I think \nhe could pass a bill if he put it on the floor tomorrow and let the \nHouse work its will. But it is not my job, obviously, to try to tell \nhim how to do his job. It is no one's job in the Senate to tell him how \nto do his job, but I suppose it is our job to give him encouragement, \nto say we will be there to support you if you can find a way to get \nthis bill passed.\n  If they want to show the country they are serious about growing our \neconomy and keeping families together, then they need to show us they \nare serious about immigration reform. It doesn't have to be a carbon \ncopy of what we passed, although if they look at it, what they will \nfind is the elements that are in there hang very well together.\n  Look at this photo. Again, this is what America looks like. This is \nwhat Colorado looks like. This is what America looks like. It is what \nit is all about. These are faces of people who want to contribute. This \ndiversity is how we thrive as a country, and it is how we are going to \nthrive in the future. It has always been our strength, and it is what \nsets us apart in many ways from countries all over the world.\n  These new citizens want to contribute to our economy and to our \ncommunities. They want to serve our country, they want to pay taxes and \nabide by the law, and they want to build a better life here for \nthemselves and their families.\n  This picture is exactly why we need reform. These brave men and women \nsay it all. They say it much better than I do.\n  I see my colleague from Pennsylvania is in the Chamber, so I will \nwrap up.\n  Let me say that two of the things that set us apart from countries \nall over the world, two of the essential components that make us the \nUnited States of America, are our commitment to the rule of law and our \nunderstanding of ourselves as being a nation of immigrants. Almost no \nother country in the world can say what we can say about that. I can \ntell you no other country in the world was having that naturalization \nceremony the day we were having it at Fort Carson.\n  This bill gives us a chance to reaffirm those two ideas that we are a \nnation committed to the rule of law and that we are a nation of \nimmigrants.\n  I had the chance this weekend to spend some time in my wife's \nhometown in the Mississippi Delta. It is one of the poorer parts of the \ncountry, and it has been for a very long time. It is a tough place in a \nlot of ways. We have a lot of great family there. After we finished, we \nwent to Memphis to visit the civil rights museum, which has just \nreopened. If anybody has the chance to go, they should go to visit it, \nbecause what you see is the history of a struggle from the 1600s \nforward--generation upon generation--trying to perfect this country and \nkeep it true to the idea that in this case we are all created equal.\n  For a long time we weren't able to perfect that. We still are having \nto perfect it. We are making progress, and that is what we are meant to \ndo. Today we have that chance. The House has that chance tomorrow or \nnext week or next month to make sure that we honor our commitment, this \ngeneration's commitment to a generation of immigrants and to the \ngenerations that are coming after them. I hope they will take up that \nchallenge.\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\n  I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania and the Presiding Officer as \nwell for his patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I wish to say a word of commendation for the remarks the \nSenator from Colorado just made about a very important issue, and that \nphotograph he took is, indeed, an inspiration to all Americans. Each of \nus can be inspired by that photograph, what it represents, by the \nsacrifice that undergirds that photograph, and also for his reminding \nus about those sacrifices and those commitments, so we want to thank \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2290-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2290-S2292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, this legislation on equal pay is about \njustice, in a word. We could almost say that equal pay equals justice. \nThere is probably no simpler way to say it. It is really, when you \nconsider what this means, a very simple concept: If a woman does the \nsame job, the same work, does all of that in the same way a man does \nand is hired by a company, she should be paid the same wage.\n  It seems so simple, so elementary, but unfortunately we have had more \nthan one generation now where that has not been the case. Depending on \nwhat study or what year we are talking about, women make, on average, \n76 cents for every dollar a man makes, or 77 cents. It has always been \nin that band of similar numbers.\n  I think for a lot of families it is disturbing. How do I tell, in my \ncase, my four daughters to just do well in school and work hard, as \nthey have, and get good grades, and once you are on a career path, you \nwill be fairly compensated for your work because of all that hard work \nyou did and the good work you do for an employer. What can I say if \nthey come to me--I hope this never happens--10 or 20 years from now and \nsay: You know, what you told me isn't true. I did well in school, I \nworked hard, I got hired and worked hard in the job I have had, and I \nam getting paid 76 cents for the $1 a man makes doing the same work in \nthe same place at the same time. It makes no sense.\n  So really, in essence, it is about whether we are going to be true to \nour words and true to the values of this country, and it is about \ngiving people a fair shot on something as fundamental as the wages they \nare paid for their labor--to use an expression from the Bible, laboring \nin the vineyards; laboring at a job and being paid in a fair manner.\n  There was a report not too long ago--not this year but a few years \nago--that looked at a State-by-State weekly pay comparison. In that \nreport, Pennsylvania women made, on average, $694 a week, while men in \nPennsylvania were paid $849 a week--an 18.3-percent differential. But \nthat is not the end of the story. It gets worse. For people 50 years \nand older, just looking at that age category, for women workers 50 \nyears and older in Pennsylvania at that time, just a few years ago, the \ndifferential was $732 and $984 for men--almost $250 a week above in \nthat age category--and for all women at that time, about $150 of \ndifference each and every week. Imagine what that does to someone's \nsense of achievement or sense of dignity when they know they are doing \nthe same work every day and they are being underpaid over and over \nevery week, every month, every year, and in some cases decade after \ndecade. So when we say this is a matter of justice, in some ways that \nmight be an understatement.\n  We have a chance to remedy that, and it is very simple. Are we going \nto take steps to remedy that or are we going to reject the steps it \nwill take to bring a measure of justice, a fair shot for women? They \nare not asking for anything that a man wouldn't ask for or demand. They \nare just asking for basic fairness--to be treated the same for the same \nwork.\n  I won't go into all the elements of the legislation, but some of them \ninvolve what happens in the event of a conflict--if a woman is \ndiscriminated against based upon her pay and she brings an action in a \ncourt, what will be the rules that govern that case. I think we should \ndo everything possible to make sure that if an employer has a defense, \nthey have to earn that defense, especially in this kind of litigation.\n  One part of the legislation prohibits retaliation for employee \ncomplaints. In other words, if a woman is inquiring about or discussing \nor disclosing the wages of herself or some other employee, she is not \nretaliated against. It is hard to believe we have to legislate and make \nthat the subject of debate. One would think that if a woman is working \nin a company for years and she is aggrieved and has a claim to make and \nis asked what the foundation of her claim is, her questions, her \ninquiries, her comparisons between and among different sets of data, \nwhat she makes, what a man who does the same work has been paid--that \nthose basic questions should never, ever be the subject of retaliation \nby an employer, but too often they are. So we have to legislate. We \nhave to specifically prohibit that kind of conduct by an employer, as \nmaddening and as frustrating as that is.\n  One would think that employers would want to make things right; that \nthey would want to make sure that if a man is paid a buck for his work, \na woman doing the same work is paid the same amount. She shouldn't have \nto ask. She shouldn't have to be worried about any kind of reprisal or \nretaliation or punishment. But the state of the law today is such that \nretaliation goes without sanction in the United States of America. It \nis very insulting to women and insulting to families.\n  So there is lots we can do, but the most important thing we can do is \nto get a favorable vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act before us. I hope \nwe get a bipartisan vote. This shouldn't be the subject of support of \njust one party. This should be bipartisan. The people who are asking \nfor this help, who have been asking for it for decades, aren't members \nof just one party. They happen to represent one-half or more of the \nAmerican people, when women have asked for that.\n  If any of my colleagues think for whatever reason that this is not \nthe right thing to do for today, they should do it for future \ngenerations. Do it for your own daughters, your own granddaughters, \nmaybe your great-granddaughters. But to forgo the opportunity to do \nsomething about this at long last--President Kennedy signed the \noriginal legislation. A lot of people in the United States weren't even \nborn then. Yet here we are still debating, still striving to get a \nbasic measure of justice in place. So I do believe equal pay equals \njustice.\n\n\n                         Afghanistan Elections\n\n  Mr. President, I will turn to another subject this evening. I know we \nhave to wrap up, and I am the last speaker of the evening, but this is \na topic that doesn't get enough attention even though it was the \nsubject of a lot of coverage and attention in the last couple of weeks \nand especially the last couple of days; that is, the elections in \nAfghanistan.\n  Many people know that some of the reporting indicated that the \nresults were good in terms of turnout. There are a lot of questions to \nreview, but we don't know the results of the elections. It is, however, \nremarkable how the Afghan people turned out to choose their second \ndemocratically elected President. About 60 percent of the 12 million \neligible voters defied Taliban threats to cast their votes. I am \nhopeful these elections are a step toward a smoother transfer of power \nlater this year.\n  By the way, that voter turnout number in terms of eligible voters is \na little higher than we had in the United States of America in 2012. \nSecretary Kerry said last week that this election has been ``Afghan \nowned from the start.''\n  The Afghan government security forces and civil society worked \ntogether to make these elections happen despite concerted efforts by \nthe Taliban to sow fear and destroy democratic progress.\n  The service of our men and women in uniform set the stage for this \nprogress. U.S. training and mentoring helped the Afghan National \nSecurity Forces get to the point where it could secure polling centers \nand allow these elections to happen.\n  We know in 2009 the international security forces bore the brunt of \nthe election's security efforts, including, of course, American \nfighting men and women--our soldiers, at that time.\n  The State Department, USAID, and NGOs also put a tremendous amount of \nwork in supporting Afghan institutions\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\nin this process of carrying out an election.\n  The role Afghan women played in these elections is particularly \nremarkable. In the National Defense Authorization Act's amendment last \nyear, I urged the administration to focus especially on ensuring there \nwere enough female poll workers and security personnel to ensure all \nAfghan women who wanted to vote could do so safely and without fear of \nintimidation.\n  Female voters turned out in numbers never seen before in Afghanistan, \nwhich speaks to their tremendous bravery and unwavering commitment to \nfighting for their rights as Afghan citizens. This is an incredible \nnumber. About one third of the 7 million voters, according to the \nreports, were women. Many women were voting for the first time. I don't \nhave an enlargement, but this is a photograph which appeared a day \nafter the election which depicts a line of 50 or more women standing in \nthe rain under a plastic tarp waiting to vote.\n  The American service men and women and, of course, taxpayers have \nmade a tremendous investment in Afghanistan to make it the nascent \ndemocracy it is today. From harsh Taliban rule, Afghanistan is emerging \nas a fledgling democracy, with tremendous gains in education and health \ncare.\n  Just imagine. Girls who were literally at zero in their \nrepresentation in schools a little more than a decade ago now \nconstitute 42 percent of Afghan children enrolled in school. That \ndidn't happen because of just some policy in effect. There was a lot of \nbravery and valor demonstrated by families and by young girls going to \nschool under terrible threats--threats of death and intimidation. We \nall know about the terrible stories of young girls walking or riding to \nschool and having acid thrown in their faces. Despite specific attacks \non girls or young women, they keep going to school.\n  It also happened because of the great sacrifice of our fighting men \nand women--those killed in action or wounded in action, tens of \nthousands of Americans. In Pennsylvania to date we have lost 91 \nsoldiers killed in action and almost 740 wounded in action.\n  So all of these results--whether it is about democracy or whether it \nis about girls in school, women being able to vote, or a range of other \nmetrics, health care and otherwise--came with tremendous sacrifice, the \nkind of sacrifice most of us don't really have a sense of. At least I \ndon't.\n  The results will be returned later this month on the election in \nAfghanistan. If a runoff is necessary, I hope all parties will work \ntogether to ensure the process is credible, transparent, and free from \nviolence.\n  Once President Karzai's successor is in place, the Afghan government \nand the Afghan people should move quickly to sign the bilateral \nsecurity agreement and affirm the commitments the Afghan government has \nmade to the international community and, by doing so, recognize the \ntremendous sacrifice of our fighting men and women and those of the \ncoalition forces as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article about the election from the New York Times dated April 5, \n2014.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 5, 2014]\n\n           Afghan Turnout Is High as Voters Defy the Taliban\n\n          (By Rod Nordland, Azam Ahmed and Matthew Rosenberg)\n\n       Kabul, Afghanistan.--Defying a campaign of Taliban violence \n     that unleashed 39 suicide bombers in the two months before \n     Election Day, Afghan voters on Saturday turned out in such \n     high numbers to choose a new president and provincial \n     councils that polling hours were extended nationwide, in a \n     triumph of determination over intimidation.\n       Militants failed to mount a single major attack anywhere in \n     Afghanistan by the time polls closed, and voters lined up \n     despite heavy rain and cold in the capital and elsewhere.\n       ``Whenever there has been a new king or president, it has \n     been accompanied by death and violence,'' said Abdul Wakil \n     Amiri, a government official who turned out early to vote at \n     a Kabul mosque. ``For the first time, we are experiencing \n     democracy.''\n       After 12 years with President Hamid Karzai in power, and \n     decades of upheaval, coup and war, Afghans on Saturday were \n     for the first time voting on a relatively open field of \n     candidates.\n       Election officials said that by midday more than three and \n     a half million voters had turned out--already approaching the \n     total for the 2009 vote. The election commission chairman, \n     Mohammad Yusuf Nuristani, said the total could reach seven \n     million. ``The enemies of Afghanistan have been defeated,'' \n     he declared.\n       But even as they celebrated the outpouring of votes, many \n     acknowledged the long process looming ahead, with the \n     potential for problems all along the way.\n       International observers, many of whom had fled Afghanistan \n     after a wave of attacks on foreigners during the campaign, \n     cautioned that how those votes were tallied and reported \n     would bear close watching.\n       It is likely to take at least a week before even incomplete \n     official results are announced, and weeks more to adjudicate \n     Election Day complaints. Some of the candidates were already \n     filing fraud complaints on Saturday.\n       With eight candidates in the race, the five minor \n     candidates' shares of the vote made it even more difficult \n     for any one candidate to reach the 50 percent threshold that \n     would allow an outright victory. A runoff vote is unlikely to \n     take place until the end of May at the earliest.\n       The leading candidates going into the vote were Ashraf \n     Ghani, 64, a technocrat and former official in Mr. Karzai's \n     government; Abdullah Abdullah, 53, a former foreign minister \n     who was the second biggest vote-getter against Mr. Karzai in \n     the 2009 election; and Zalmay Rassoul, 70, another former \n     foreign minister.\n       Both Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah praised the vote. ``A proud \n     day for a proud nation,'' Mr. Ghani said.\n       Still, a shortage of ballots at polling places was \n     widespread across the country by midday Saturday, and some \n     voters were in line when polls closed.\n       More worrisome, the threat of violence in many rural areas \n     had forced election authorities to close nearly 1,000 out of \n     a planned-for 7,500 polling places, raising fears that a big \n     chunk of the electorate would remain disenfranchised.\n       But when it came to attacks on Election Day, the Taliban's \n     threats seemed to be greatly overstated. Only one suicide \n     bombing attempt could be confirmed--in Khost--and the bomber \n     managed to kill only himself when the police stopped him \n     outside a polling place.\n       In three scattered attacks on polling places, four voters \n     were reported killed. Two rockets fired randomly into the \n     city of Jalalabad wounded eight civilians. One border \n     policeman, in southern Kandahar Province, and another \n     policeman in remote western Farah Province were confirmed \n     killed in Taliban attacks, according to preliminary reports.\n       Bad as all that was, it was a lower casualty toll than on a \n     normal day in Afghanistan, let alone an election on which \n     both the insurgents and the government had staked their \n     credibility. Interior Minister Umar Daudzai said there were \n     140 attacks nationwide on Saturday, compared with 500 attacks \n     recorded by the American military in 2009.\n       In preparation for the election, the Afghan government \n     mobilized its entire military and police forces, some 350,000 \n     in all, backed up by 53,000 NATO coalition troops--although \n     the Americans and their allies stayed out of it, leaving \n     Afghans for the first time entirely in charge of securing \n     their own election.\n       ``Voting on this day will be a slap in the faces of the \n     terrorists,'' said Rahmatullah Nabil, the acting head of the \n     National Directorate of Security, the Afghan domestic \n     intelligence agency.\n       Sensitive to concerns about potential fraud--more than a \n     million ballots were thrown out in the 2009 presidential vote \n     and then again in the 2010 parliamentary elections--the \n     police were quick to report their efforts to crack down on \n     Saturday.\n       Among those arrested were four people in Khost who were \n     caught with 1,067 voter registration cards. Several people, \n     including an election official, were caught trying to stuff \n     ballot boxes in Wardak Province.\n       ``This has been the best and most incident-free election in \n     Afghanistan's modern history and it could set the precedent \n     for a historic, peaceful transition of power in \n     Afghanistan,'' said Mohammad Fahim Sadeq, head of the \n     Afghanistan National Participation Organization, an observer \n     group.\n       In many places where voting was nearly impossible in 2009, \n     the turnout was reported to be strong. One was Panjwai \n     district, a once-violent haven of the Taliban just outside \n     Kandahar City, where hundreds lined up to vote. ``I left \n     everything behind, my fears and my work, and came to use my \n     vote,'' said Hajji Mahbob, 60, a farmer. ``I want change and \n     a good government and I am asking the man I am going to elect \n     as the next president to bring an end to the suffering of \n     this war.''\n       Even where the Taliban did manage to strike, voters still \n     turned out afterward. A bomb set off at a polling place in \n     the Mohammad Agha district of Logar Province killed two \n     voters and wounded two others, according to the district \n     governor, Abdul Hamid. ``The explosion dispersed the voters \n     who were holding their voting cards and waiting to vote,'' \n     said Zalmai Stanakzai, a car repair shop owner who was there. \n     ``Some of us left, the others stayed. I was concerned about \n     our safety, but we considered voting our duty.''\n       Insurgents set off a series of five blasts in the Shomali \n     plain, just north of Kabul city,\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\n     in the village of Qarabagh. ``After the explosions, the \n     polling stations reopened and people rushed to vote,'' said \n     Mohasmmad Sangar, 32, a used-car salesman there. ``It was a \n     great day today.''\n       Nicholas Haysom, the United Nations' top election official \n     here, said: ``We know that the Taliban have made a very \n     explicit and express threat to disrupt it. The failure to \n     disrupt the elections will mean that they will have egg on \n     their face after the elections.''\n       While there were reports of disrupted voting in troubled \n     places like Logar Province and neighboring Wardak, in Helmand \n     Province in the south and Nangarhar Province in the east, at \n     the same time voters were showing up in unexpectedly high \n     numbers in other places, like Zabul, Uruzgan and Kandahar \n     Provinces in the south, and Kunar Province in the northeast, \n     despite strong insurgent presences in those areas.\n       In Uruzgan, election authorities had to open additional \n     polling places to accommodate unexpected numbers, while in \n     Daikundi they ran out of ballots in some remote districts and \n     election authorities had to race new ones out to them. In \n     northern Mazar-i-Sharif, voters were still lined up after \n     dark.\n       Underwritten by $100 million from the United Nations and \n     foreign donors, the election was a huge enterprise, \n     stretching across extremely forbidding terrain. Some 3,200 \n     donkeys were pressed into service to deliver ballots to \n     remote mountain villages, along with battalions of trucks and \n     minibuses to 6,500 polling places in all. The American \n     military pitched in with air transport of ballots to four \n     regional distribution centers, and to two difficult-to-reach \n     provinces.\n       Though many international observers left Afghanistan in the \n     wake of attacks on foreigners, or found themselves confined \n     to quarters in Kabul, years of expensive preparations and \n     training of an army of some 70,000 Afghan election observers \n     were expected to compensate, according to Western diplomats \n     and Afghan election officials. ``We have so many controls \n     now, it's going to be much safer this time,'' said Noor Ahmad \n     Noor, the spokesman for the Independent Election Commission.\n       The American ambassador, James B. Cunningham, called the \n     elections a ``really historic opportunity for the people of \n     Afghanistan to move forward with something we've been trying \n     to create together with them for several years now.''\n       Still up in the air is the question of whether an American \n     troop force will remain in Afghanistan after 2014. Mr. \n     Karzai's refusal to sign a long-term security deal to allow \n     that presence was a major point of tension between the \n     American and Afghan governments. Each of the leading \n     candidates has agreed to sign the deal once in office, though \n     inauguration day may not take place until well into the year.\n       The election on Saturday was notable also for how many \n     Afghan women were taking part. More female candidates than \n     ever before are on provincial ballots, and two are running \n     for vice president, the first time a woman was ever put up \n     for national office here, which has generated a great deal of \n     enthusiasm, especially in urban areas.\n       At the women's polling station in the Nadaria High School, \n     in Kabul's Qala-e-Fatullah neighborhood, among those lining \n     up to vote was a young mother, Parwash Naseri, 21. Although \n     wearing the blue burqa that is traditional here, she was \n     still willing to speak out through the privacy mesh covering \n     her face.\n       She was voting, for the first time, for her children and \n     for women's rights, she said, speaking in a whisper. ``I \n     believe in the right of women to take part just as men do, to \n     get themselves educated and to work.''\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I wish to highlight two quotes. The first is from a 21-\nyear-old woman who is voting for the first time in this election:\n\n       She was voting, for the first time, for her children and \n     for women's rights, she said, speaking in a whisper. ``I \n     believe in the right of women to take part just as men do, to \n     get themselves educated and to work.''\n\n  A remarkable inspiration from a 21-year-old woman voting for the \nfirst time in Afghanistan.\n  The second quotation is from a 60-year-old farmer who was asked by a \nreporter what it was like to vote under the threats that were either \nproximate--meaning something happening in almost real time or in the \nrecent past--or just the overall threat posed by the Taliban and other \nextremists. This farmer said:\n\n       I left everything behind, my fears and my work, and came to \n     use my vote. I want a change and a good government . . .\n\n  He goes on from there to describe what he hopes will happen. But just \nimagine that. He said:\n\n       I left everything behind, my fears and my work, and came to \n     use my vote.\n\n  When I read that, I thought about something Thomas Jefferson said in \na letter to John Adams when he was an older man. He was describing the \nfear of old age--not the kind of fear of reprisal if you were voting \nbut the fear of growing old. He talked about how he dealt with the fear \nof growing old in nautical terms. He said: ``I steer my bark with hope \nin the head, leaving fear astern.'' That is all I thought about when I \nheard what the 60-year-old farmer said; that even though he had fears--\nthe fear of death, the fear of reprisal against him, his family or \npeople in his neighborhood--he was willing to say his right to vote was \nso important he was willing to leave those fears and his work behind so \nhe could vote.\n  What a tremendous inspiration on a subject--the conflict in \nAfghanistan and all which comes from it that often is not the subject \nof positive commentary or inspiration. For once and all too \ninfrequently, this is one of those occasions where we can be positive \nabout a result.\n  We have more work to do to make sure the bilateral security agreement \nis signed, but we should draw some measure of inspiration from what \nhappened in Afghanistan and the progress which has been made there.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/08/senate-section/article/S2292-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
