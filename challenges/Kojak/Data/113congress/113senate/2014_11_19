Mr. President, I am glad that for a few minutes the \nPresident pro tem is here in this body and presiding over the Senate.\n  For years I have heard from Senate Republicans that they simply \nwanted to do some legislating; they were tired of being shut out of the \nlegislative process; they were not able to debate legislation and \namendments. They have assured the American people they want to be \nwholly dedicated to open and robust debate on legislation on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Yesterday a bill that was bipartisan in nature and came out under the \nauspices of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, after actually \nyears of consternation, debate, and work by so many different people, \ncame to the floor. That was blocked yesterday, blocked from even having \na hearing here on the Senate floor. That is wrong. This is a very \nimportant piece of legislation. It protects Americans' rights to \nprivacy without sacrificing the U.S. intelligence community's ability \nto gather information.\n  I also say through the Chair to my friend the President pro tem of \nthe Senate that it does not matter if you agree with the statement I \njust made. Maybe some people disagree with this legislation. Certainly \nthere are people who disagree with it. But shouldn't we at least be \nable to debate the issue here\n\n[[Page S6108]]\n\non the floor? Doesn't legislation of this magnitude merit the Senate's \nconsideration? Yet yesterday we were shut down once again--this has \nbeen going on for years--before we even got started. They would not \neven let the Senate debate this very important piece of legislation. We \nwere ready to legislate in good faith. We have been ready to legislate \nfor the last 4 years. We have been prevented numerous times from doing \nthat.\n  The Republican leader and his caucus will have to do more than just \npay lipservice to an open, bipartisan legislative process. At some \npoint they must practice what they preach. Maybe that will be the case \ncome January.\n  Last night, just after the vote on Keystone, I heard the Republican \nleader say he will bring this same legislation to the Senate floor \nearly next year. So we look forward to coming to the floor early next \nyear. I would hope we can have an open amendment process and ample \ndebate on that legislation that the Republican leader for months on \nrecord has wholeheartedly endorsed.\n  I feel very bad that the chairman of our Judiciary Committee has \nworked so hard during the time--when we were in recess, we talked \nseveral times about the importance of this legislation and how we were \ngoing to try to move it forward. We determined yesterday we are not \ngoing to move forward even without a debate or a vote on anything. That \nis really too bad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6108-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words of the majority \nleader. He and I have been friends for decades. He worked with me and \nwas in touch with me throughout the recent effort on the NSA reform \nbill, the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014. He knew we had cosponsors, \nRepublicans and Democrats, from across the political spectrum. This was \nan effort to do what was best for America and do it at a time when we \nwould not be under urgent deadlines. Several of the authorities we were \ntrying to amend expire on June 1 of next year.\n  We had a piece of legislation that began in the House of \nRepresentatives by a Republican chairman. We added to the bill in the \nSenate. There was a very clear signal from the House of Representatives \nthat if we had passed the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014 here in the Senate, \nthey would have taken it up and passed it. We would be enacting \nlegislation that would improve not only the security of Americans, but \nalso the privacy and individual liberties of Americans. And we would \nnot do it under a deadline. So it was unfortunate last night that there \nwas a partisan effort to stop it. There was some of the worst fear-\nmongering I have heard on this floor in 40 years. But I say this as \nmore of a way to thank the distinguished majority leader for his \nsteadfast support.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the reason I feel--and I have made my \nremarks regarding the Senator from Vermont. There has been no one in \nmodern history who has done more to protect the civil liberties of \npeople than the senior Senator from Vermont. This legislation was \ndrafted toward that effect, to make sure we were able to do the \nnecessary work for this country as it relates to what was in this bill \nbut also to protect the liberties of Americans.\n  I have such admiration for my friend from Vermont, for his work on \nlandmines. At the time he started the conversation on landmines, he was \nit, but of course there are now people all over the world who are \nfollowing his lead on the maiming, people who have been killed, \nthousands of people. Thousands of people, as we speak, are still being \nkilled by landmines from wars past. So the fact that we were not able \nto get to this legislation does not in any way take away from the \nlegacy of this good man who has done so much to protect the individual \nliberties of the people in Vermont and across the country.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Gray\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to celebrate the \nlife and mourn the loss of a soldier from Kentucky who died while \nserving in uniform. PFC Joshua Gray of Van Lear, KY, lost his life on \nFebruary 10, 2014, at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, from a noncombat-\nrelated incident.\n  Private First Class Gray was 21 years old. For his service in \nuniform, Private First Class Gray received several medals, awards, and \ndecorations, including the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Good \nConduct Medal, the NATO Medal, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the Global \nWar on Terrorism Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, and the \nExpert Marksmanship Badge.\n  Josh's life may have been tragically cut short, but it was full of \npromise. He excelled as a student. He scored a 34 out of 36 on the ACT \nstandardized test in high school, putting his score in the 99th \npercentile. Friends and teachers from Johnson Central High School, \nwhere Josh graduated in 2011, remember how very bright he was.\n  ``Josh was a very high-end student. He was an amazing kid,'' says \nJohn Robinson, one of Josh's teachers. ``He was very super-smart. He \nwas always looking something up. He always had this thirst for \nknowledge--computers, math, science and technology. He was always more \nthan willing to do work. He often came to me with questions--or \nanswers.''\n  Josh's fascination with computers led him to salvage an old, massive \nIBM server that he brought to school to tinker with. John Robinson \nremembers the unit was so heavy it should have required two people to \ncarry it. John said:\n\n       He was carrying it around like it was nothing. He left it \n     here. I still have it.\n\n  Josh was known around school for carrying something else around--Mr. \nWaddles, his stuffed penguin and constant companion. Though Josh \ncarried the stuffed penguin at first for laughs, it soon became his \ntrademark. As Tim Adams, district director of operations for Johnson \nCounty Schools, said:\n\n       He took Mr. Waddles everywhere with him. It started out as \n     a joke, but then it just caught on. Mr. Waddles became part \n     of the class.\n\n  Joshua participated on the Johnson Central High School academic team \nand the SkillsUSA team. Popular with his classmates, he was also named \nprom king and voted ``Most Unforgettable'' by his senior class.\n  Lindsey Patrick, a classmate of Joshua's, stated:\n\n       He could have done anything with his life, he was one of \n     the most brilliant people I've ever met, and [service] is \n     what he chose to do and give his life. That is why he is so \n     unforgettable.\n\n  Josh was also musically gifted as well. Angie Carriere, his former \nmusic teacher, remembers Josh's musical talent:\n\n       He was in my violin/fiddle class. He never wanted to learn \n     to read music, instead he insisted on playing music `by ear.' \n     Actually, he never really needed the [sheet] music; he could \n     just listen to the song and play it.\n\n  Josh joined the Army in November of 2012. He completed training at \nFort Jackson, SC, and was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters \nBattalion, 10th Mountain Division, based out of Fort Drum, NY, as a \nsatellite communications system operator and maintainer. He deployed to \nAfghanistan in\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom in January of 2014.\n  Joshua's funeral was held at Johnson County Middle School. He was \nburied with full military honors at Highland Memorial Park in \nStaffordsville, Johnson County.\n  We are thinking of Josh's family as I recount his story for my Senate \ncolleagues, including his parents Seth William Gray and Robin Rena \nGray, his brother Dustin Mollett, his sister Delaney Mollett, his \nmaternal grandparents Andy and Kathleen Price, his paternal \ngrandmother, Irene Gray, and many other beloved family members and \nfriends.\n  PFC Joshua A. Gray was truly a talented and bright young man who \ncould have done many things. The fact that he chose to serve his \ncountry in the U.S. Army is a testament to his character and his \npatriotism. I hope the family of Private First Class Gray knows that we \nin the Senate honor his choice to serve and we are grateful for his \nsacrifice.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is good to be here.\n  I was disappointed yesterday to see that we weren't able to move \nforward on the Keystone Pipeline. It has become symbolic in many ways \nof whether we are willing to embrace the opportunities of more American \nenergy.\n  The American people clearly have a sense that it is to their \nadvantage for us to take advantage of those opportunities, for us to \ndeal with not only our own economy, with the energy we can produce but \neven with our next-door neighbors. Canada is our greatest trading \npartner, and Mexico continues to play a bigger and bigger role as a \ntrading partner--I think now No. 4 and No. 5 of all the countries in \nthe world we have economic exchanges with--but friendly neighbors in \nNorth America that can produce energy in ways that meet every logical \nstandard.\n  I heard some discussions about the pipeline, that once this is built, \neven though it may create tens of thousands of jobs in building the \npipeline, it will only take three dozen or so people to run the \npipeline. Of course that is right; it is a pipeline. It is an \nefficient, safe way to transport the energy we need. But I think it is \nimportant to understand that just the jobs to run the pipeline have \nnothing to do in many ways with the job potential that is created when \nwe embrace the energy potential we have. If we ask about that energy \npotential, the American people say yes. If we ask about lower utility \nbills or dependably payable utility bills, the American people say yes. \nIf we ask about price at the pump, the American people say yes.\n  But beyond that, if somebody is thinking about a manufacturing job or \nany other job as a job creator, if they have that utility bill they can \npay, if they have the delivery system they can rely on, the country is \nmuch more likely to make things again, the country is much more likely \nto compete, and the American people understand that.\n  Even if we ask specifically about this one small part of that \npuzzle--the Keystone Pipeline--the American people say yes. Six years \nis enough. The State Department has evaluated this over and over again \nunder two different Secretaries of State. Both times they have said \nthere is no problem moving forward with this. I was disappointed that \nwe didn't.\n  Even the White House suggesting they would veto that if it was sent \nto them seems to continue to indicate to me that nobody is listening to \nwhat the people we all work for are saying.\n  The President said he wasn't on the ballot but his policies were. If \nhis policies were on the ballot, as he said they were, those policies \nwere widely rejected--not just to change next year in the body we get \nto serve in here, but also two-thirds of the legislative Houses in the \ncountry are no longer run by the President's party, and 60 percent-plus \nof the Governors are no longer run by the President's party.\n  People are trying to send a message. It would be a good idea if the \nWhite House would get on the receive and begin to figure out what that \nmessage is and what is wrong with those policies that the American \npeople don't like. I don't think it is because they don't understand \nthem. I know there would be one sense probably most closely held at the \nWhite House: If they just understood what we were trying to do, they \nwould be for what we are trying to do.\n  I think it is not that way, even though the President might like to \nthink it would be. In fact, the clear message is that people are \nconcerned about costly energy policies, they are concerned about the \nPresident's recent overreach on a topic we wouldn't even think people \nwould have engaged on, but they have: net neutrality, where even the \nChairman of the FCC, nominated by the President and confirmed by this \nSenate--even the Chairman of the FCC said: I think the President is \nheaded in the wrong direction there, and we need to do something \ndifferent than that.\n  The SBA recently called on the EPA to withdraw one of their proposals \nand try again because it had too much negative impact on the economy.\n  I can't think of a similar situation ever, where an administration \nfinds itself so often in conflict even with itself, even having the \nadministration challenged. When the SBA thinks the EPA is off target, \nand that was empaneled sometime before a rule was laid down--a proposed \nregulation was laid down--we wonder, why not? Why wouldn't we be \nmanaging this discussion in a better way? Why wouldn't we be moving the \ncountry forward in a better way?\n  Ignoring the voters is an incredible tragedy in a democracy. Ignoring \nthe law is an even more incredible tragedy in a constitutional \ndemocracy.\n  According to reports, the President is considering two requirements \ndeciding on the 11 million people who are here without documents who \neither came illegally or stayed illegally and what to do about that. \nThe President is looking at the length of time as a qualifier. Nowhere \nin the law is that a qualifier. The President is looking at the ties \npeople might have to others in the country. These requirements, \ndepending on how broadly they are drawn, could wind up with the \nPresident's announcement as early as Friday, leaving another 5 million \npeople in the country in a status I don't quite understand and they \nwill not either.\n  When someone is here based on an Executive order, that is totally \ndependent on one thing: Who is the Executive?\n  When someone is here based on the law, that is very dependent on \neverything having to come together that changes the law before their \nstatus will change.\n  Why would we put people in that kind of jeopardy? Why would we send \nthat kind of mixed message?\n  After legislation overhauling the immigration process died in the \nCongress, the President said he is going to act on his own. I can't \nfind that part of the Constitution which allows that to happen. In \nfact, in statements made more than one time, he couldn't find it \neither--statements made more than one time where the President said: I \ncan't do this on my own. We are a nation of laws. That is his \nobservation about who we are, not my observation about who we are.\n\n  I know there will be people on this side of the Capitol Building who \nwill say: We sent something over there, I didn't vote for it, but it \ndoesn't mean I am not aware that it was sent to the House. But the \nHouse sent a bill over here too. Apparently both the House and the \nSenate are so far from where the other side is that neither is willing \nto take up the other bill.\n  But that is the Constitution. The Constitution is designed so that \nwhen we change law, we do that in a fairly cumbersome way, but that has \nserved our country pretty well for a long time, and it is not up to the \nPresident to decide that can be suspended on a topic he thinks is \nimportant and a topic he in fact has previously said he couldn't do on \nhis own.\n  As he was talking about this the last several months, not just \nRepublicans but Republicans and Democrats--and I\n\n[[Page S6110]]\n\nwill admit particularly Democrats in close races around the country--\nsaid the President was overstepping his authority; the President is \nputting people in jeopardy of not knowing whether they are here on some \nkind of basis that nobody has quite defined or quite understands even \nafter he acts.\n  Recently, a union representing thousands of Federal immigration \nofficers raised an alarm that the U.S. Government had ordered supplies \nto create millions of blank work permits and green cards. According to \nreports following that union report, the new Federal contract proposal \nfor Homeland Security would allow the government to buy enough supplies \nto make as many as 34 million immigrant work permits and residency \ncards over the next 5 years.\n  We issue immigrant work permits all the time but not at the level \nthat is being talked about here. Nobody has contended, by the way, that \nwe just got a particularly good opportunity to buy a lot of card stock. \nI haven't heard that given as the reason.\n  So these people who work with that every day are saying: What is \ngoing on here? The President of the National Citizenship and \nImmigration Services Council--the union representing 12,000 immigration \nservice agents--called reports about planned Executive action \ndangerous, people who deal with this every day--his words--said it \nwould increase exponentially the health risks, the threats to national \nsecurity, and expense to taxpayers that he said are on the rise because \nof lax enforcement of immigration laws already.\n  Article II, section 3 of the Constitution declares that the President \n``shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.''\n  Simply put, these constitutional requirements are just that. They are \nrequirements the President shall take care that the laws are faithfully \nexecuted, to execute the acts of the Congress, to enforce the law as \nwritten. Signed into law by some President and never changed by the \ncurrent President would indicate that is what the law is and the \nPresident is supposed to enforce the law.\n  Yet President Obama continues to refuse in this and other areas to \nshow a willingness to try to convince the Congress to change the law \nrather than assume: If the Congress doesn't do this, I will.\n  As I said earlier, and will say again, I am still trying to find that \nphrase in the Constitution that says: If the Congress doesn't do this, \nthe President can. Whether it is issuing waivers to States from the \nwork requirements contained in the bipartisan Welfare Reform Act of \n1996 or announcing another change in the President's health care law--\nand I have lost count of how many changes on his own the President has \nhad the administration do--they continue to look for ways to circumvent \nwhat the law says: a nation of laws, respect for the laws.\n  Americans are appropriately concerned the government is just too \nwilling to overreach and at the same time unbelievably dysfunctional, \nwhether it is kids at the border or a Secret Service that can't keep \npeople out of the White House or how we deal with Ebola.\n  We have a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and when we \nhave a disease control problem we have to put somebody else in charge. \nWhat is wrong with that?\n  That is why I introduced the ENFORCE the Law Act in March, a bill \nthat would allow Congress to authorize a legal case to be brought \nagainst a President if he fails to uphold the law as written.\n  This bill would restore the system of checks and balances reiterated \nin the Constitution. The ENFORCE the Law Act removes the procedural \nbarriers and then would allow the House or Senate or both together to \njointly adopt the resolution that just says we don't believe the law is \nbeing enforced.\n  There is a set of regulations out now on the Clean Water Act which \ndid authorize the Federal Government, the EPA, to monitor and have some \nauthority over the navigable waters of the United States. I don't have \nany doubt that in the 1970s when that happened, people thought \nnavigable waters meant the same thing they thought navigable waters \nmeant when it was first put into Federal law in the 1880s. Suddenly, \nnavigable waters in the new rule means any water anywhere that could \never become part of water that could become part of water that could \nbecome navigable. This is a case that can easily be litigated sooner \nrather than later, long before people try to comply with an area where \nthe Federal Government will turn out not to have control, as they did \nin a number of areas this year. So I hope we will look at that again. \nThe House has passed it in a bipartisan manner. The Congress should be \nconcerned about enforcing the law as written. As the Constitution says, \nboth the Members of the Congress and the President of the United States \nshould be concerned about enforcing the law as written.\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 75th \nbirthday of my friend and longtime colleague from our home State of \nIowa, Senator Tom Harkin.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, Senator Harkin will be retiring from \npublic office in a few weeks. At the end of the 113th Congress, Senator \nHarkin will then close a chapter on public service that spans more than \na half century, including four decades in Congress. He also served 27 \nyears in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Naval Reserves, 10 years in the House \nof Representatives, and 30 years here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Now, I think anybody looking at that would say that is a remarkable \nand distinguished record of public service. After 40 years of \nrepresenting Iowans in Congress, my friend Tom soon will leave behind \nthe Halls of the U.S. Capitol. He also will leave behind a legacy of \nfiery floor speeches, passionately delivered on behalf of individuals \nwith disabilities, also for Iowa farmers, also for the elderly, also \nfor child laborers, and for many causes that he championed such as \nearly childhood education, nutrition and wellness, conservation, \nrenewable energy and the environment, and probably lots of others. But \nthose are things everybody knows that he has worked hard on.\n  Throughout the years Tom and I have served side-by-side in Washington \nfor the good of our home State. For three terms we worked together in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. It was here in the Senate our shared \ncommitment to give rural America a voice at the policymaking table was \nsown, and for many years we worked together on the Senate agriculture \ncommittee, looking out for the millions of Americans who choose to work \nand earn a living in rural America. We worked together to advocate for \nrural infrastructure and investment, access to health care, housing, \ntechnology, and transportation.\n  For the last three decades we have served alongside one another in \nthis distinguished body, the U.S. Senate, an institution that both of \nus hold near and dear to our hearts. Although some of our silver-\ntongued critics over the years may have ascribed Tom's views as those \nof a bleeding-heart liberal or mine mischaracterized as that of a cold-\nhearted conservative, we both, Tom and I, know that our hearts have \nalways been in the right place.\n  Neither of us was born with a silver spoon in our mouth and we \nlearned early on to appreciate the work ethic of our parents and \ngrandparents. Each of us raised our families with the hopes that our \nchildren and grandchildren would achieve the promise of America's \nprosperity and grow up to enjoy the pursuits of happiness.\n  As Iowa's U.S. Senators, we have worked to keep alive the dream of \nhard-working Iowan families.\n  Now of course it is true that we have vastly different views on the \ngovernment's influence on America's ladder of opportunity. However, we \ndo wholeheartedly agree it is an honor and a privilege to serve the \npeople of our State. For some reason our respective reelections every 6 \nyears have actually confounded political observers. Many couldn't seem \nto square the notion that Iowans would continue to elect two U.S. \nSenators from opposite sides of the political spectrum for the last \nthree decades.\n  So to explain--or perhaps I don't have to because it is widely \nunderstood--Iowans are not casual political\n\n[[Page S6111]]\n\nobservers. Our electorate takes pride in retail politicking and it is \nfirst in the Nation's political caucuses. We certainly have given Iowan \nvoters a night-and-day choice between these two U.S. Senators. So while \nwe may not see eye-to-eye on politics and ideology, we do see eye-to-\neye when it comes to working for Iowa's best interests. Although our \nvoting records may reflect night-and-day positions on some public \npolicy, you wouldn't see the light of day between us when we worked \ntogether on matters that are of most importance to Iowans, including \nbut not limited to natural disasters such as the tremendous floods of \n1993 and 2008, Iowa farmers and agriculture, notably recovering from \nthe farm crisis. Renewable energy and rural infrastructure have been \nour mutual interest. We have also enjoyed welcoming economic \ndevelopment leaders and constituents to the Nation's Capital.\n  Between the famous Siouxland steak dinner in Washington and the \nHarkin steak fry in Indianola, there is no doubt Tom will miss staking \nout Iowans to discuss politics and policy. However, I have no doubt my \nhome State colleague will continue to champion the causes for which he \nhas devoted a lifetime of service. In fact, I have read in news media \nabout his retirement of what he intends to pursue, and so I have no \ndoubt he is going to pursue out of the Senate what he has pursued in \nthe Senate.\n  To his credit, my colleague's legacy reflects the priorities he set \nout to achieve decades ago, to make a difference for those on the \ndownside of advantage.\n  My wife Barbara and this Senator extend our warmest wishes to Tom and \nhis wife Ruth, and of course to the entire Harkin family, as he starts \nlife's next chapter. I see my colleague on the floor, so I can look at \nhim.\n  As you start life's next chapter, may you enjoy the blessings of \nhearth and home, health and happiness. Although Tom is retiring from \npublic office, I am confident he is not retiring from serving the \npublic interest. From one constituent to another, I thank you for your \nlifetime of public service and I wish you good luck and Godspeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6111-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6111-S6112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A GREAT ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first let me thank my friend and colleague \nfor his lifetime characteristic which is being very gracious and very \ngenerous in his remarks.\n  Chuck Grassley and I have served together since 1974. I like to tell \npeople that in 1974, that was a big wave of Democrats who came in. They \ncalled us the Watergate babies. We came in a big wave, won a lot of \nelections. In fact in Iowa that year they elected a Democratic U.S. \nSenator and every House seat--I think there were six at that time--six \nHouse seats all went Democratic except one, and that was the seat that \nChuck Grassley won that year, bucking the trend--the tide--in 1974.\n  So it is kind of a funny thing, Chuck,--I speak to my friend across \nthe aisle here--that a lot of times people, this year, have said, ``All \nyou Watergate babies are gone now, you and Max Baucus, and Chris Dodd \nand on the House side George Miller and Henry Waxman. So this is the \nlast of the Watergate babies.''\n  I said, ``No, there is one left.''\n  ``Well, who is that,'' they say.\n  I say, ``It is a Republican.''\n  ``A Republican? Who is that?''\n  I say, ``My colleague from Iowa, Chuck Grassley, is sort of, shall I \nsay, the last man standing from that class of 1974.''\n  Again, it is a tribute to Senator Grassley that through all these \nyears he has won the hearts and minds of the people of Iowa, been \nelected and reelected. Of course he came to the Senate before I did. He \ncame in 1981 and I came in 1984. So I like to think we at least share \nin common bucking the trend a little bit--the tide--because in 1984 \nsomeone said, ``Harkin ought to run for the Senate in 1984 because \nthere will be a big Democratic landslide,'' and so I ran. The tide was \njust the opposite. There was a Reagan landslide here. But I was \nfortunate enough to win the election. So I think the two of us share \nthe bucking of the tide, so to speak, getting into office when we ran. \nBut it has been a great association all these years.\n  As I stand here today on my 75th birthday, I guess when you are this \nage, I think I have two kinds of emotions. One, I wonder where the heck \ndid all the years go and how did they go by so fast. And sometimes I \nsay, gosh, sometimes I wish I could turn the clock back and do it all \nagain. The other emotion is sort of my Irish side of me. The Irish have \na saying that any time you are on this side of the grass is a good day. \nSo I am sure happy that I made it this far.\n  I again want to say that since the time we took our oath of office on \nJanuary 4, 1975, we have served together both in the House and in the \nSenate. A lot of the time we were on the same committee, the \nagriculture committee, working on a lot of different agriculture bills. \nI remember back in the 1980s working on the credit bill at that time \nwhen so many farmers were underwater. As the Senator said, it has been \na great honor and a privilege to represent the people of Iowa.\n  As he mentioned, we belong to different parties, we have different \nphilosophies of approach in government, but I like to think we share a \ncommonsense Iowa way of looking at the world. We are not monolithic out \nin Iowa. We are not all one philosophy or all the other philosophy. \nSometimes I find very conservative friends of mine and I may have a \nliberal view of one thing and I find liberals and I may have a more \nconservative view of something else. So the people of Iowa, as my \nfriend has said, think a lot about these things, and they take these \nthings into consideration.\n  My friend has said, well, a lot of people say how can Iowans elect \nsomeone who is conservative and someone who is liberal. I think that is \nbecause there are common strains of that wave itself to the people of \nIowa in so many ways where there is a cross of conflicts of maybe a \nconservative approach and a liberal approach.\n  I say to my friend, I value his friendship and his counsel through \nall these years, even though, again, as my friend said, we approach \nthings maybe from a different philosophical standpoint. That is fine. \nThat is okay. But we have never let a disagreement on philosophy ever \nbe the last word between us or the final word or anything like that. It \nis always, well, that is that. What is next? And the one thing I really \nappreciate that my friend said is that when it comes to Iowa, you don't \nfind any daylight when it comes to a disaster on what we can do for \nIowa and Iowans. We have had a wonderful relationship through all these \nyears and it is one that I have cherished very much.\n  I heard my friend, in making some notes, say that sometimes they say \nhe is a cold-hearted conservative and I am a bleeding-heart liberal. I \nam going to set the record straight. He is not a cold-hearted \nconservative, he is a caring conservative. He cares deeply about \npeople. He cares deeply about the people of Iowa, too. And I hope I am \nnot a bleeding-heart liberal. I hope I am a liberal who believes in \nindividual responsibility--individual responsibility.\n  My friend has been a very caring conservative through all these \nyears. I think together we have achieved important things for our \nState: economic development, rural development, agriculture, energy, \nall these things we worked together on for Iowa. I am proud of the fact \nthat in Iowa right now with regard to energy production, 25 percent of \nour energy comes from wind energy in Iowa. We produce the blades and \nturbines and everything in Iowa and all the jobs there. That is \nsomething we have worked together on through all these years.\n  Again, people have asked me why I am leaving the Senate. Well, it was \nmy decision. At the time--almost 2 years ago--I said, you will never \nhear me ever say bad things about the Senate or denounce the Senate or \nsay terrible things. I love the Senate. This is a wonderful \ninstitution. Yes, we hit a few bumps in the road once in a while, but \nthat is to be expected in a legislative process that represents 300 \nmillion people in this country. But working together you form \nfriendships and alliances.\n  I have often said that as a progressive, I want to go this far this \nfast and the conservatives want to go this far this slow, but by \nworking together, you\n\n[[Page S6112]]\n\ncan make progress. You can make progress, and that is what I think both \nSenator Grassley and I have worked on together. We try to make \nprogress, especially for the people of Iowa.\n  I thank the Senator for his kind words. I know we are not supposed to \nsay this on the Senate floor; we are always supposed to speak in the \nthird person. But I never wanted to follow all of the rules anyway. So \nI wish to speak directly and say: Thank you very much, Chuck Grassley, \nfor your friendship, your counsel, and for working together through all \nthese years. I will miss that relationship--working on the Senate \nfloor.\n  I will be in Iowa. I will be working with the Harkin Institute at \nDrake University. I will be spending a lot of time on the disability \npolicies and advancing the cause of people with disabilities in some \nway, shape or form. I don't know how but in some way. It is a \nnonpartisan institute, and we have a great board of directors. The \nformer chair of the Iowa Republican Party is on the board of the Harkin \nInstitute, and I want to keep it nonpartisan.\n  I ask that my friend come and speak--and perhaps lead a discussion at \nsome time--at the institute at Drake University. I would be honored if \nmy friend would do that sometime down the road. I don't know when, but \nsometime when we can work it out. I know my friend will be well \nreceived, and I think the young people at Drake need to hear the \nconservative side of the story as well as the liberal side of the \nstory. They need to have that kind of input. I hope we can work it out.\n  I say again that I know in the future my friend and his wonderful \nwife Barbara, a great and wonderful person, and Ruth and I will \nmaintain friendships and our connections as we move into the future. If \nthere is any way we can work together for the benefit of Iowans, just \nlet me know, and I will be glad to be the Senator's lieutenant in the \nfield out there in Iowa sometime.\n  Again, I thank my friend so much for so many years of counsel and \nfriendship and working together. Thank you, Chuck.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank my colleague for his kind remarks and for being \nhere and for serving the people of Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I wish to take 4 more minutes to speak on another \nsubject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6112-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on Saturday, many children and families \naround the country will celebrate National Adoption Day. It's a day \nthat many adoptions are finalized and youth find their forever \nfamilies.\n  It's very comforting and fitting that this day helps kick off the \nholiday season. Families will be formed and strengthened. This \nThanksgiving, many children will celebrate with their new families and \nnot have to worry about their next placement or their next meal. And \nthis month, we give thanks to the men and women who make their dreams \ncome true.\n  Since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, nearly 50,000 children \nhave joined ``forever families'' during National Adoption Day. In 2013 \nalone, adoptions for 4,500 children were finalized through 400 National \nAdoption Day events across the country.\n  These are impressive numbers--numbers that make us proud of the work \nbeing done to help children in foster care find loving families. But \nthere is always more work to be done.\n  Today, there are over 102,000 children in the foster care system. \nIowa alone has over 6,200 children in foster care, many of whom are \nwaiting for a loving family to adopt them.\n  There are so many issues facing foster youth--in addition to being \ntorn apart from their families. They face serious trauma. They are \nlikely to be treated differently and don't get to do the same \nactivities as other kids. They transition from home to home and school \nto school. They don't know normalcy, and they may never know \npermanency. And, after years of challenges, some are forced to \ntransition to adulthood on their own. Unfortunately, each year over \n23,000 youth age out of care in the U.S.\n  Too many older children in foster care, especially those with special \nneeds, are often the ones who wait the longest to leave foster care. \nFoster youth simply desire to have what so many of us were blessed to \nhave--a home with caring, loving parents and siblings. These kids are \nless likely than younger children to find ``forever homes.''\n  That is why I helped form the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth. I wanted \nto draw attention to the challenges that older foster youth face. The \ncaucus has allowed congressional leaders to become more aware of the \nissues faced by young people and families who are involved in the \nfoster care system.\n  The caucus cannot function without the input and insight from foster \nyouth. These children are the experts on the foster care system. They \ntell us what works or what needs to change. They share their \nexperiences and provide us with real world stories about how our \npolicies truly affect them.\n  The caucus and the youth who share their experiences remind us that \nno child is unadoptable. No child should be without a mom and dad, and \nwe must remember that foster care should be a layover, not a \ndestination.\n  November is National Adoption Month, a time to raise national \nawareness of adoption and celebrate families, advocates, and volunteers \ninvolved in adoption. It's also a time to devote more attention to \npolicies and practices that protect the safety and well-being for all \nchildren.\n  I am hopeful that Congress will continue to look for ways to improve \nthe foster care system and promote adoptions. I am glad Congress worked \nto enact a bill this year to renew the adoption incentives program and \nto do more to screen and help foster youth who may be trafficked. We \nmust continually examine how the system is treating youth and whether \nthe policies in place are strengthening families.\n  There are many youth who will celebrate this holiday season without a \npermanent family. Hopefully, our celebration of National Adoption Month \nwill raise awareness of the issues they face and the need to find them \na mom and a dad. We need to keep working together to break down the \nbarriers to adoption.\n  So today, I thank all those who have adopted or who have fostered \nchildren who needed it, and I thank the many individuals and \norganizations that work to make permanency possible for children. I \nknow many dreams will come true this Saturday, and I wish the very best \nto the youth as they begin their journey with their new families.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in recognition of National \nAdoption Month, and I know our great colleague Senator Landrieu will be \nhere to also address this important month. She has been such a great \nleader in fighting for this cause. She has literally gone to Guatemala \nto make sure that children who are awaiting loving homes in our country \nget to come to those homes. She literally knows the names of those kids \nand is hands-on every step of the way and has been the leader in \nCongress.\n  She established the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, which has \nbrought together Senators and Members of Congress on behalf of children \nwho need loving homes and families who want to welcome them home. We \nare very pleased with her leadership.\n  Senator Landrieu is joining us right now, and I will be able to flip \nit over to my friend at any time it is appropriate. But I do wish to \nspeak about National Adoption Month. It is especially important in my \nhome State of Minnesota.\n  Many people don't know this, but Minnesota actually has the highest \nrate of international adoptions in the country. Minnesota families have \nopened their homes and their hearts to children from all over the \nworld--from\n\n[[Page S6113]]\n\nVietnam to Guatemala to Nepal to Haiti.\n  I have had the opportunity to witness the power of adoption \nfirsthand. Before being elected to the Senate, I spent 8 years as \nHennepin County attorney, the largest county in Minnesota. We had \njurisdiction over foster care and adoption. I actually worked to speed \nup those adoptions. I remember saying we need to eliminate this delay \nand reduce the time it takes for a child who has been going from foster \ncare home to foster care home in half, and we were able to do that \nbecause people understood the need for children to have a permanent \nhome.\n  I know Senator Landrieu is here right now and has a busy schedule, \nand I will turn it over to her as soon as I finish.\n  In the United States, nearly 400,000 children are living without \npermanent families in the foster care system. Over 100,000 of these \nchildren are eligible for adoption, but too many of them will wait for \nyears and years to be adopted. Some will not be adopted at all.\n  Last night I attended an event called Kidsave. It is about children \nwho are older and in other countries. This group has actually set up an \nincredible system where the kids come to our country for a few weeks \nand many of them end up being adopted. As the kids get older, it \nbecomes harder and harder for them to become adopted.\n  Senator Landrieu and I are aware that as some of these countries, \nsuch as Russia, completely close their doors to adoption, there will \nactually be more and more children who are older that will need to be \nadopted. We hope the system changes and they do eventually open up \ntheir doors.\n  Around the world it is estimated that nearly 18 million orphans who \nhave lost parents are living in orphanages or are on the streets and \nlack the care and attention required for healthy development. As a \nnation, we must open our arms to these children. Just last night at \nthis event, I had the opportunity to hear the story of Jennifer \nBaumann, a 17-year-old girl from Colombia. She spent years in a broken \nhome and then in a broken foster care system in that country. She was \nexposed to violence. She would go to bed hungry.\n  At age 14, she was still in foster care and had lost hope for her \nfuture. She was considered too old to be adopted. As she said in her \nown words, she ``cried for a year.''\n  But then, miraculously, she had the chance to visit a family here in \nAmerica as part of the program that Kidsave organized. The family fell \nin love with her, she fell in love with them, and in 2011 she was \nadopted into a loving home. We have seen this time and time again in my \nState, and that is why I got involved in legislation with my mentor, \nMary Landrieu.\n\n  One of the things we found out is--we had a family called the \nMakorises, and they were adopting nine children from the Philippines \nwho had first lost their father, and their mother kept them together, \nand then their mother died, and it was the two oldest children who held \nthose kids together. When they turned 16 and 17, they couldn't be \nadopted. The Makorises of Cambridge, MN, had to make a decision: Were \nthey going to strand those two kids who held the family together, leave \nthem in the Philippines, and take the other children? It was like \nSophie's choice. That was their choice.\n  They decided there was a better way. They came to Congress. I led the \nbill in the Senate with the help of Senator Landrieu, Senator Sessions, \nSenator Inhofe, as well as House Members, and we were able to pass a \nbill that allowed kids who had reached an age where they were not \nlegally allowed to be adopted, to be adopted if a younger sibling had \nbeen adopted. That means that retroactively, thanks to the work of \nSenator Landrieu, 10 million children all across the world were allowed \nto be adopted into loving families. And how fun was it to be in the \nMakorises' living room and see all nine children, like some Minnesota \nversion of ``The Sound of Music,'' with a place for all of their winter \nboots and their coats. They came from the Philippines in the middle of \nthe winter to Minnesota; yet they were still as happy and as warm as \ncan be because now they have parents who love them.\n  The Senator from Maine understands how important adoption is because \nit has touched his own family. This has touched every Member of the \nSenate.\n  As we focus on National Adoption Month, we have to continue to look \nat policies and changes we can make to our laws to make them better. We \npassed that law to allow those older siblings to be adopted. We passed \na law to allow vaccinations to be allowed in our country to make sure \nthey are safe and that they are actually done. But there is more work \nto do with these intercountry adoptions, and I can think of no one \nbetter to lead that charge than the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu.\n  So I am here to acknowledge the work we have done with the adoption \ntax credit, which we have gotten into law, and the work we have done to \nmake sure it is easier for these international adoptions. Every single \nfamily out there knows there are problems right now with international \nadoptions. A lot of them stem from people such as Vladimir Putin. By \nthe way, the reason Senator Landrieu was banned from going to Russia is \nbecause of the work she is doing for kids, being willing to take Putin \non because of the fact that he was closing the doors to kids and using \nthem as pawns for political gain. That is an amazing story, and that \nshows a fighter.\n  (Mr. KING assumed the Chair.)\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his work with adoption and his \npersonal story, as well as all the Members on both sides of the aisle \nwho have devoted themselves to looking out for these kids who have no \none else to look out for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, yesterday we had a very different \ntopic--the Keystone XL Pipeline--on the floor of the Senate. That fight \nis over for now, but the fight for adoption, foster care children, and \nall children in the world who are in desperate need of parents to love \nthem and to nurture them goes on.\n  I could not be surrounded with a better team than Senator Grassley, \nwho has been fighting for this in the Senate since before I arrived--\nand 18 years ago when I got here, I quickly joined with him to continue \nthe fight--and then Amy Klobuchar joined us a few years ago and has \nbecome an extraordinary, effective, and willing soldier to go to the \nfrontlines of this battle. I can't thank the Senator from Minnesota \nenough. She brings tremendous experience as a former prosecutor, which \nI didn't have and I don't think Senator Grassley had, and she really \nunderstands the inner workings of the court systems in a way that has \nbrought a lot of value to our coalition.\n  In addition, as she said, we are so proud of Minnesota as the State \nin our Union that has the highest per capita rate of international \nadoptions. So the leaders in Minnesota of all political parties and \nstripes as well as the faith-based community really understand this \nissue and have stood up time and time again. I wish to recognize \nMinnesota's leadership and particularly Senator Klobuchar.\n  This month is November. It is a great month. It is Thanksgiving \nmonth. We give thanks for so many things in our country. It is a \nwonderful celebration--I think in some ways even better than Christmas \nbecause we are not so much focused on gifts; we are focused on really \nunderstanding the blessings we have received. One of those great \nblessings is a family.\n  I am so fortunate to have been born into one of the most remarkable \nfamilies--not rich when I was born into my family and still not rich, \nand when I was born into my family we were not at all famous either, \nbut we have two extraordinary parents, and to this day they continue to \nteach all 9 of us, 37 grandchildren, and now 5 great-grandchildren the \nvalue of family.\n\n  I have said many times, and Senator Klobuchar has shared this with \nme, governments do a lot of things well, but raising children isn't one \nof them. I will repeat that. Governments do a lot of things well, but \nraising children isn't one of them. Actually, we were created and wired \nfor one human to raise another. It just doesn't happen any other way. \nOur faith tells us that.\n  But now, interestingly, some really extraordinary science is being \ndone by some of the most brilliant scientists in the world and \nsociologists, and one of\n\n[[Page S6114]]\n\nthem is from my State, Dr. Charlie Zeanah. I want to give him a shout-\nout. When the terrible tragedy happened in Romania and Ceausescu fell--\nthat crazy man who starved his country and put millions of children in \norphanages--Charlie was one of the Americans who got on the plane with \nme and went to Romania, and he has never left. He stayed--not \nphysically the whole time, but his colleagues stayed and did the most \nextraordinary science on the planet of what happens to a child who is \ndetached from their birth parent or from a loving caregiver--just \ndetached.\n  They also did the leading study in the world on institutionalization. \nThe findings are remarkable in such a way that if they can't make us \nchange the way we think--group homes are not sufficient. No matter how \nwell run, they are not sufficient. No institution, no matter how \nbeautifully it is run, no orphanage in the world, no matter how \nmagnificently it is run, how clean and brightly painted--nothing can \nsubstitute for what an infant and a toddler and a young child and a \nteenager and an adult, amazingly, but particularly an infant need when \nthey are born. They actually need it before they are born, and that is \na whole other story. But when they are born, it says that the brain \nliterally reacts physically to the fact that there is no caregiver who \nis consistent, and that is what happens when a child is abandoned. They \ngo through what they are calling now this toxic stress.\n  The way I like to describe it--and I know maybe I only have 10 \nminutes, but it is worth talking about. Every adult in this world \nwithin the listening of my voice knows what stress is to an adult. We \ncan literally feel it. Some people go out for a run. Some people have a \ncouple of glasses of wine. Some people have long talks with their \nfriends. We can feel that we have to do something. An infant feels that \nbut in multiples, and an infant can't go out for a run, and a toddler \ndoesn't know what to do. So that toxic stress goes right inside of them \nand they cannot release it. They don't know how. So it begins to affect \nthe development of their brain.\n  These scientists are saying that when a child doesn't have, from the \nmoment it is born, a constant, caring, confident touch and talk the way \nthat loving parents demonstrate--as we know, as we hold our infant \nchildren in our arms, we give them strength. I used to think they just \nneeded food and warmth, but that is not what the science says. The \nscience says it is so much beyond that. We should have known this by \nour faith, but sometimes we doubt. So now the science is stepping up \nand saying exactly what we know by faith, which is that it is \nimperative that children have a loving, safe place.\n  I have been to orphanages all over this world, and I will never \nforget some of the visions I have seen. This is the most common vision \nwe will see in an orphanage anywhere, particularly an orphanage where \nthey have infants who are in cribs who are let's say around 1 year old. \nWe walk into a room as big as this--sometimes smaller, but I have been \nin ones as large as this--with cribs everywhere, and the infants just \nsit there, those who can sit up, and they stare into space and they \njust rock themselves. The scientists say that is their last desperate \nattempt to console an inconsolable emptiness. So they just rock and \nthey stare. They don't cry. The reason they don't cry is because they \ncried incessantly for the first 30 or 60 days of their lives, and then \nwhen no one came they just stopped because little babies are really \nsmart. Contrary to popular belief, they are literally born with an \nexceedingly brilliant brain, but the more toxic, the more distorted it \ngets. So by the time a child is 3--not 13, not 30, but 3--their brain \nis like a muscle that kind of--it just doesn't function. It doesn't \nform correctly. And we can see this on this new imaging.\n  I know there are those who think this is a soft issue. People look at \nAmy and they look at me and they look at Chuck Grassley and think, why \ndo these people keep talking about this? It is like nothing. Well, it \nis a lot. It is not nothing. It is very serious science, and it is very \nserious community development, and it is very important for this world \nto get this and get it quickly.\n\n  We wonder why prisons are filled. We wonder why psychiatric wards are \nfilled. It is not because people are born bad because even though--I \nwon't even go into mortal sin and my Catholic background. Let's just \nsay forget that. Children are actually born beautifully made because \nGod made them, and it is what we do to them in the time of their birth \nand the few years after that really shapes what they are going to be.\n  So, in my view, as a leader, that is why I have spent a great deal of \nmy time on this subject. It is not a soft issue. It is as hard and as \nimportant as any Army or any trade policy, and I am never going to stop \ntalking about it because it is so clearly the truth that I just can't \nstop talking about it.\n  So, again, this is National Adoption Month. We have put a resolution \non the floor. We always get a remarkable amount of support from our \nMembers.\n  I want to also give a special shout-out to Senator Blunt, who has a \nchild and who is very engaged in this issue, and he has really stepped \nup. He has a child who was adopted, as do I and as do other Members who \nhave adopted children or grandchildren. Rosa DeLauro has been a \nremarkable leader in the House. Her grandchild was adopted from \nGuatemala. She has become an extraordinary voice. Susan Bonamici, the \nCongresswoman from Oregon, has also been a great leader. And I just \ncan't say again how happy I am that Amy Klobuchar has been here to \nhelp.\n  I have some amazing photographs to share, and I thank the Huffington \nPost because that is where they came from. This is National Adoption \nMonth. The Huffington Post has a great picture--and my colleagues can \ngo online and see this--of many of the most remarkable adoption stories \non Adoption Day.\n  These are all children I am going to show you, and I am going to tell \nyou a little bit about them. This is a domestic adoption out of foster \ncare. This is the Michael family. The parents are Tiffanie and Adebayo \nMichael from New York. The couple fostered two siblings, a boy and a \ngirl who are pictured here. After 2 years and 4 months, the couple \nadopted these two children out of foster care on National Adoption Day. \nYou can see the smiles.\n  It is so amazing to see these stories that happen all over the \ncountry. On National Adoption Day, this Saturday, many of the judges--\nthis was started by a judge in California. I want to give him credit. \nHis name is Judge Nash.\n  Judge Nash started this 20 years ago because he was in his courtroom. \nHe was so frustrated--as Amy has been as a prosecutor--that no one was \nprocessing these adoption cases that he decided. This was how simple \nthis was. He said: You know what. I am tired of the backlog. I am going \nto come in on Saturday. That is what he did. He said: I am just tired \nof it. So staff, we are coming in on Saturday. We are going to process \n25 adoptions, 30 adoptions when we are not distracted and where we can \nget people in.\n  This is how National Adoption Day started. Judge Nash is my hero. \nNational Adoption Day was started 20 years ago by one judge in one \ncourtroom, and then lots of other organizations joined in. Now it is \nreally a big movement.\n  This is a happy picture. This is a picture of parents from Baltimore \nwho adopted an infant with a cleft palate from China in 2012. When this \nlittle infant was born--I know something about what happens in China \nand many countries. If an infant is born in almost any country in the \nnondeveloped world and they have anything wrong with them like a finger \nis missing or they have a cleft palate or, particularly, if they have \nsomething like spina bifida or a leg missing, in some countries they \nare literally put in rooms called dying rooms. They just leave them \nbecause they don't have the same understanding that we do in the United \nStates about A, the dignity of every life, which our faith in this \ncountry teaches us; and B, in some countries they actually think it is \na curse by God if a child is born with a defect, so they just sort of \ntake it as if God never meant for this child to have a life.\n  I don't know what would have happened to this little boy. Trust me; \nit would not have been happy. The only little problem with him is he \nhad a cleft palate.\n  This couple traveled a long distance. Under the law now, they would \nprobably have to go back two or three\n\n[[Page S6115]]\n\ntimes because we have made it harder, not easier, for these parents. I \ndon't know how many times they traveled, but they probably took their \nown money, borrowed money--unless they are super rich--from their \nrelatives and went twice to get this little boy and finally brought him \nhome.\n  The next picture is the Haden family. This is my favorite picture. \nThey have two adopted children. Crew is a 1-year-old. He was adopted \nfrom Niger in 2013. Shepherd was 2 years old and was adopted from the \nDRC in 2012.\n  The most amazing thing is the biological children, which you can see, \nwere the ones who received the children when they came. I have hardly \nseen a more beautiful picture than this that represents what the future \ncould be if we would do our jobs.\n  The fourth picture is the Williams family. Jeff and Kelley Williams \nare from Nashville, Tennessee. Their faith called them to adopt in \n2012. They brought daughter Haley home to Nashville from an orphanage \nin Ethiopia. This is how many relatives gathered to meet her. The most \namazing thing about this picture is how tightly her father is holding \nher.\n  The fifth is a picture of the Hardbarger family. They are angels this \nyear. They are from Shreveport. They are an amazing family from \nLouisiana. Chad is a pastor of a church. He is the senior pastor at \nEmmanuel Baptist Church in Shreveport. They formed an adoption ministry \nbecause they became so moved by their own experience in adopting.\n  They adopted all of these children. Monique is 19, Chris is 14, Bryce \nis 11, Jordan is 9, Bailey is 8, and Gavin is 7. He is a pastor of a \nreally wonderful church. They have now taken this as a ministry and are \ndeveloping--I see the leader on the floor.\n  I will wrap up in 2 minutes.\n  They are developing a wonderful ministry in Shreveport, and many of \nour churches in Louisiana are really stepping up to do this.\n  You may not believe this because this is a very famous family. They \nare admired--or otherwise--depending on what circles, so I have a lot \nof respect for the ``Duck Dynasty'' family in this area of what they \nhave done. Willie and Korie Robinson have five children, three \nbiological, one adopted, and one fostered. The couple adopted Willie, \noften called little Will, through a private adoption agency when he was \nborn. They have a foster daughter from Taiwan named Rebecca. Since \nbecoming rich and famous, which they weren't always--just a little \nsimple family making duck calls, but now they are one of the most \nfamous families in the world. They were our national angel 2 years ago, \nand they have continued to promote adoption, both domestic and \ninternational.\n  I wanted to just show a few of the most extraordinary families, both \nfamous and not so famous, who are doing this great work.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this resolution, calling \non us all in every elective office--Governors, Presidents, Members of \nCongress, and then at home in our districts, our courts, our judges, \nour prosecutors--to do everything we can to help.\n  I want to show you the last picture because this is our challenge. \nDomestic adoption--I am very proud to have moved this line. I want to \ngive Secretary Hillary Clinton a shout-out--Senator Clinton--who helped \nto move this line. She really did remarkable work since 1999--basically \n2000 to 2014. We now have more children being adopted domestically than \never before at all ages--infants, teenagers, et cetera.\n\n  Our challenge is international adoptions have dropped precipitously. \nI am going to come back to the floor and give a speech about why this \nis happening and what we have tried to do--a few of us--to turn it \naround, but our voices are hitting the wall and bouncing off because \nthe State Department is not listening. We will continue the fight. This \nnumber is going down dramatically.\n  There are children such as that little boy in China with a cleft \npalate who will rot for the rest of their lives. If you want to wonder \nwhere terrorists come from, I will tell you where they come from. They \ncome from families that are dysfunctional, and they come from places \nwhere there is no hope, no love, and no faith. That is where terrorists \ncome from. If you want to stop it, I would suggest we start turning \nthis line the other way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, a lot of these adoptions wouldn't \nhave happened without Senator Landrieu. When we go anywhere in this \ncountry on the adoption issue and mention her name, we see nodding of \nheads of so many parents because they actually know what she has done \nto fight for domestic adoptions and foster kids and also on the \ninternational level. There is so much more work to be done.\n  Thank you so much. I will be there when you give your speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me add my voice in this chorus \nbecause it is true. Senator Landrieu, more than any Member of the \nCongress, has made adoption her cause. We are reminded by Senator \nLandrieu what a difference it makes in the lives of children and their \nfamilies and the world. I want to commend her. Senator Landrieu is the \nbest.\n  As the grandfather of an adopted child, I know the difference, the \njoy, the importance of that moment in our family life. I thank her for \ncontinuing this battle to make certain that we understand the \nimportance of adoption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6115-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6115-S6117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. There was a moment in the Civil War when President \nAbraham Lincoln sent a message to General McClellan. General McClellan \nwas in charge of the Union troops, but he wouldn't use them. He sat \nencamped, intense, preparing for battle, and never going forward.\n  Lincoln, in his frustration, understood as he waited that the \nConfederate forces were getting stronger and the opportunities were \nslipping away. Lincoln sent a message to General McClellan. His message \nwas this: If you are not going to use your Army, would you send it my \nway so I can use it?\n  I am reminded of that story when I address this issue on the floor of \nthe Senate this morning because the issue I am going to address is the \nissue of immigration.\n  I come to this issue with personal and family experience, as so many \nMembers of Congress do when it comes to an issue. In this circumstance, \nmy mother was an immigrant to this country, and she was brought here at \nthe age of 2 from Lithuania. Somehow my grandmother, with my aunt and \nuncle, made it across the ocean to Baltimore, landing in 1911, and then \ncatching a train heading for the land of opportunity--East St. Louis, \nIL, which is where many Lithuanian families gathered and where my \ngrandfather was waiting.\n  That was the city of my birth. My mother grew up there speaking \nLithuanian and English--an immigrant family who worked hard and \nstruggled. From family stories, I know they had little or nothing in \ntheir lives but the hope that the next generation, their children, \nwould have a better life.\n  That is my story. That is my family's story, but that is America's \nstory, too.\n  If we chart immigration as an issue in the course of America, we will \nfind something very interesting. Political parties that become anti-\nimmigrant parties eventually wither and disappear. Why? Because they \nare denying the fundamentals of America. They are saying that we are \ngoing to close the doors and pull up the ladder, and we don't need any \nmore of those people.\n  We do need more of those people because the immigrant families who \ncome to this country bring more than just determination and strength \nand a work ethic. They bring a level of courage that many families \ncan't muster. These are families in different parts of the world who \nsay at some point we are going to America. We may not speak the \nlanguage, we may not even know what will happen to us once we arrive, \nbut we are going to America--and they do. The vast majority of them who \ncome to this country stay and make a difference. They sacrifice. They \nwork night and day, but their moment comes when they become part of \nAmerica. They are proud of where they came from but even more proud of \nthe fact that they are part of the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S6116]]\n\n  When any political party in history has decided to make anti-\nimmigration their standard and their value, they have withered and \ndisappeared as they should. They are ignoring and turning their back on \nwho we are--what America is all about.\n  I was part of a group 2 years ago. We sat down--four Democratic \nSenators and four Republican Senators--and we worked for months to \nwrite a comprehensive immigration reform bill. I will tell you the \nnames of the Senators so you know there was no secret deal here. John \nMcCain led the Republicans, the former Republican candidate for \nPresident of the United States. By his side was Lindsey Graham, \nRepublican from South Carolina--it was not exactly viewed as a liberal \nState but a very conservative one--and Marco Rubio of Florida, whose \nfather and mother were immigrants to this country, refugees from Cuba; \nand Jeff Flake of Arizona, a conservative Republican by every measure. \nThat was the team on the Republican side of the table.\n  On our side of the table we were led by Chuck Schumer, from the State \nof New York, chairman of the immigration subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I joined him as a member of the Judiciary Committee and \nsomeone that has been involved in some of these issues for a long time. \nThere was Bob Menendez, the head of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus, \nwhich is a caucus of one at this point, by himself, the son of Cuban \nrefugees who came to the United States; and Michael Bennet of Colorado. \nThe eight of us sat down for months, literally for months, hours at a \ntime, sometimes angry and ready to walk out of the room.\n  We wrote a bill, a 200-page bill to rewrite the immigration laws in \nAmerica, to fix the broken immigration system. Then we took it to \ncommittee, and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick \nLeahy, had open hearings and allowed any amendment to be offered that \nanyone wished.\n  Then we brought it to the floor after it was reported from the \ncommittee. We again gave an opportunity for amendments to be offered. \nSignificant amendments were offered. Senator Corker of Tennessee \noffered an amendment to even strengthen what was a very strong border \nsecurity section of this bill. The net result of that of course was we \nbrought it to a vote.\n  I will tell you, it was an incredible day, because on June 27 of 2013 \nwe passed, on the floor of the Senate, comprehensive immigration reform \nby a vote of 68 to 32. Fourteen Republicans joined the Democrats in a \nbipartisan effort to fix our broken immigration system. It was a proud \nmoment. We had the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. We had the \nsupport of organized labor. We had every major religious group in \nAmerica supporting our efforts. We had the ultraconservative Grover \nNorquist supporting this and liberals as well came together and said: \nFinally, we are going to do something about our broken immigration \nsystem.\n  But under the law of the land, passing in the Senate is not enough. \nThe measure was then sent over to the House of Representatives on June \n27, 2013. Today, November 19, 2014, the Republican-led House of \nRepresentatives has not only failed to have a hearing on this bill, it \nhas refused to bring this bill to the floor, it has refused to bring \nany immigration bill to the floor. They refuse to address the obvious. \nWe have a broken immigration system. We need to come up with a fair \nsolution to it.\n  They refuse to act. It is within their power to call that bill today, \nas it has been every day since June 27, 2013, but for a year and a half \nthe House Republican leadership has refused to act. Oh, they tempted \nus. They teased us time and again: We are thinking about it. We are \ngoing to put out a list of principles that we Republicans believe in, \nin the House of Representatives. We are going to tell you that maybe we \nwould support something like the DREAM Act--maybe. We are going to tell \nyou we want strong border enforcement, which of course the bill already \nhas.\n  They have said all of those things and have done nothing. I am \nreminded of President Lincoln saying to General McClellan: If you are \nnot going to use your Army, may I borrow it? The House Republicans have \nrefused to address the immigration issue almost entirely, with one \nexception. They did call one immigration matter to the floor. It was \none of the most hateful pieces of legislation which I have seen.\n  Here is what it said. Before they adjourned in August, the \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives passed a measure with only \nfour of their Members refusing to vote for it. Here is what it said. We \nhave created an opportunity for about 2 million children brought to \nthis country who have lived good lives, finished school, have no \nproblems with the law and want to become part of America. The President \nhas created an Executive order giving these children a chance to come \nforward, register with the government, pay their filing fee, and not be \ndeported.\n  Madam President, 600,000 of them have taken advantage of that. This \nis called DACA. The President's Executive order gives them a chance to \nlive in America, to go to school in America, to get a job in America, \nto make this a better nation. So 600,000 have done it. We believe 1.4 \nmillion more are eligible. They have not signed up yet.\n  So the Republican House of Representatives, in August, before they \nadjourned, passed a measure which said: The remaining 1.6 million who \nmay be eligible for this protection cannot be allowed to be part of the \nDACA Program. Those 1.6 million young people should be subject to \ndeportation--deportation.\n  Think about that for a moment; brought here at the age of 2 or 3 as \ninfants, living in the United States their entire lives, standing in \nclassrooms across America every morning pledging allegiance to the only \nflag they have ever known, and the Republicans voted, with an \noverwhelming majority, to deport them--to deport them.\n  That is not bad enough. That overwhelming vote that they cast, that \nhateful vote that they cast--they were so proud of themselves, that \nafter voting they stood and applauded themselves. What a great moment \nin their minds for the House of Representatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What a terrible moment in the history of this Nation. The \nPresident of the United States, having waited for a year and a half, \nhaving heard all of the promises of the House Republicans, that they \nwould move forward and finally call this bill, having been promised \nprivately and even publicly by many of those Republicans that they were \ngoing to do something, now the President has said: I am going to use my \nauthority, my authority under the law, to try to fix at least some part \nof this broken immigration system.\n\n  We are expecting, any day now, for the President to announce his \nExecutive order. He will not be the first President to do this. Past \nadministrations, Democratic and Republican, have stopped the \ndeportation of low-priority cases in our country. Every President of \nthe United States--every President of the United States since Dwight \nDavid Eisenhower has used his Executive authority to improve our \nimmigration system by Executive order, every single one of them.\n  President George H.W. Bush issued a family fairness policy allowing \n1.5 million people in America to apply for deferred action and work \npermits. It is clear that Presidents have the authority to do this. Yet \nthe Republicans in the Senate and House have threatened this President \nthat if he uses his Executive authority, as every President since \nPresident Eisenhower has done: We are going to hold it against you and \nyou are going to pay a price, President Obama.\n  I hope the President pays little or no attention to that kind of \nthreat. What is at stake is the future of millions of family members \nwho are now subject to deportation. What is at stake is whether the \nRepublican Party will come into the 21st century in this land of \nimmigrants and join us in a bipartisan effort to fix this broken \nimmigration system.\n  What is at stake are literally the futures of millions of families \nwho just want a chance. That is all they are asking for, to earn their \nway into legal status in America. It is almost 13 years\n\n[[Page S6117]]\n\nnow since I introduced the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act--I described it \nearlier--gives young people brought to the United States at an early \nage, who had no voice in what their families were going to do, to come \nto this country and eventually find their way to legal status.\n  At one point even the House Republicans said they supported this so-\ncalled DREAM Act. Time and again we have faced filibusters stopping the \nDREAM Act from passing in the Senate, but it was part of comprehensive \nimmigration reform. This DREAM Act all started with this young lady, \nTereza Lee, Korean, brought to the United States at the age of 2, grew \nup in a poor family in Chicago, had an amazing musical talent and was \naccepted to the Manhattan Conservatory of Music and the Julliard School \nof Music. Because she was undocumented she had no place to go.\n  Her mother called our office. Her mother, who incidentally worked \nnight and day in a dry cleaning establishment in Chicago said: What can \nwe do? The law had no real answer, other than to say to this then-18-\nyear-old girl: Go back to where you came from for 10 years and try to \ncome here legally.\n  That was the law. I introduced the DREAM Act. Since then we have seen \na growth in support for this because it is only fair. We cannot, should \nnot, hold children responsible for the decisions and wrongdoing of \ntheir parents. These kids deserve a chance. That is what the \nPresident's Executive action is about. That is why the action by the \nHouse Republicans was so reprehensible.\n  Tereza Lee, incidentally made it. She went to the Manhattan \nConservatory of Music. She ended up not only getting a bachelor's \ndegree, she did not receive any government assistance. She had friends \nand sponsors who stepped in to pay for it. She played at Carnegie Hall. \nShe is now working on her Ph.D. in music.\n  She is now an American citizen, by virtue of the fact that she \nmarried this young American jazz musician. They are living in New York \nand recently had a baby.\n  I could not be prouder of Tereza Lee and what she has done with her \nlife. There is a picture with her mom and dad. Her dad passed away. He \nhad a serious medical illness that could not be treated adequately \nbecause he does not qualify for any kind of government health \ninsurance. They did not have the money to provide him the care he \nneeded.\n  But Tereza Lee's story is one that inspires me every day to come to \nthis floor and remind my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, these \nare real human beings we are talking about. These are not political \npawns. These are young people who deserve a chance to become part of \nthe future of America. Sometime soon, I hope very soon, maybe even this \nFriday, the President of the United States is going to announce his \nExecutive order.\n  He is going to say that, as he did with DACA, the Deferred Action \nProgram, he is going to give more undocumented people in this country a \nchance. It will be a narrow category, not as broad as we would like \nit--at least some of us would like it--but it will be consistent with \nwhat every President of the United States has done since President \nEisenhower.\n  It is fair. It is just. It recognizes our birthright as Americans, as \na nation of immigrants. It says we are willing to stand and fight for \nfairness. I would hope--I would just hope that a few Republicans will \nstand and acknowledge this. I hope a few of them will join us in a \nbipartisan recognition that our broken immigration system cannot be \nfixed if the Congress of the United States--particularly the Republican \nHouse--refuses to even call the bill for a year and a half.\n  Instead, the President is using his authority and doing the best he \ncan to make this Nation of immigrants proud again that we are welcoming \na new generation of people who will make us even stronger in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6117-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I am glad I got to the floor to listen \nto my friend, the Senator from Illinois, the majority whip, make his \nremarks. It reminds me of his great passion and commitment to the \nDREAMers and to the cause of repairing our broken immigration system.\n  While he and I differ on the details, and the feasibility of passing \ncomprehensive immigration reform, we have been trying to do this for--\nlaboring with this for at least the 10 or 11 years that I have been \nhere. We have been unsuccessful. What does that tell us? It tells us we \nneed to try something different. We need to break this down into \nsmaller pieces. In the House, Speaker Boehner I know has made this \npledge to the President and others. I know Senator McConnell, the new \nincoming majority leader, believes immigration reform is important and \nwe ought to use our best efforts to make progress.\n  But unfortunately the message the President of the United States has \nsent is he is giving up. To listen to my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle who support this unprecedented Executive action by the \nPresident that is going to be announced on Friday, they have given up. \nThey have given up.\n  What the Senator from Illinois did not say is even the President's \ndeferred action order involving these young people--by the way, I \nsupport providing them an opportunity to become American citizens and \nproductive members of society. I think we are all better off--these \nyoung people who are not culpable, they did not commit any offense or \ncrime, they came with their parents, and we are much better off. They \nare much better off. Their families are much better off.\n  Our country is better off if we find a solution--which I am confident \nwe could do. But the message the President has given and our Democratic \nfriends have given is: We give up. We are not going to do our job as \nlegislators.\n  We are going to let the President, with the stroke of a pen, provide \nan Executive amnesty to millions of people and create an awful lot of \nharm in the process.\n  The tragedy is we are a nation of immigrants and proud of it. Our \nrich, diverse heritage would not have been the same without the \ncontribution of immigrants who have come from around the world, \ncontributions that have become part of the very fabric of our lives and \nour society.\n  Millions of foreign-born immigrants who have come to the United \nStates legally have become successful, patriotic citizens of the United \nStates. We have been the beneficiary because of the opportunities that \nour Nation provides that nowhere else on Earth provides, and that is \nthe opportunity to pursue the American dream.\n  But part of what makes the American dream possible is the rule of \nlaw. It is our Constitution. It is not Presidents getting frustrated \nwith Congress, issuing an Executive order, defying the Constitution, \nand ignoring his oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States. That undermines the American Dream.\n  So I listened to my colleague and friend from Illinois saying that \nthis is a question about: Are immigrants good for America or not?\n  I stipulate they are good for America. As a matter of fact, my \nancestors weren't born in the United States. We all came from somewhere \nelse.\n  This is really, at bottom, whether the President, when he put his \nhand on the Bible and he took a sacred oath to uphold and defend the \nConstitution and the laws of the United States, whether he really meant \nit or whether he had his fingers crossed behind his back.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have had the privilege of participating \nin naturalization ceremonies all across my State, where I have seen \nindividuals from Vietnam, India, Mexico, and\n\n[[Page S6118]]\n\nfrom countries all around the world take the oath of allegiance to the \nUnited States of America. It is an inspiring and heartwarming occasion \nand, of course, many of them have taken that oath while wearing the \nuniform of the U.S. military, where they have served with honor and \ndignity as they await approval of their citizenship.\n  One of the first bills I passed when I came to the Senate was with \nTed Kennedy of Massachusetts, the liberal lion of the Senate. What we \ndid is we passed a simple piece of legislation that expedited the \nprocess whereby immigrants who serve in the military can become \nAmerican citizens. That was one of the first bills I was a part of that \npassed when I came to the Senate.\n  Of course, these naturalization ceremonies represent a proud day, not \nonly for these new Americans but for all Americans and for our Nation \nas a whole, where we welcome new citizens with open arms to this \ncountry to find a better life for themselves, for their family and, in \nthe process, for all of us.\n  But the President has now threatened--and he is the one who has made \nthe threat: If you don't do it on my timetable, according to the terms \nI prefer, I am going to do it myself.\n  He said that time and time again. There is no President who has \nabused the authority to issue Executive orders more than the current \noccupant of the White House. All Presidents have issued Executive \norders since President George Washington, but no one has held Congress \nand the Constitution in such contempt that they feel as if Congress is \nirrelevant--except when I need them to appropriate money or to help \nthem serve my purposes.\n  But the President is going to take steps in the coming days that \nwould send men and women--such as those I have mentioned--who came, \nplaying by the rules, pursuing legal immigration to the United States. \nHe is going to basically tell those folks: Get to the back of the line.\n  We are the most generous country in the world when it comes to \nnaturalization--almost 1 million people a year. But the President is \ngoing to tell the people who have been waiting patiently in line, \nplaying by the rules: Get in the back of the line. I am going to put \nmillions of people ahead of you in front of the line who have not \nplayed by the rules.\n  Well, it is a sure way to send a message to the rest of the world \nthat our country does not enforce its own laws, which is an essential \npart of who we are, and where everybody, from the humblest to the most \nexalted in our country, are all bound by the same laws, whether you are \nPresident of the United States or whether you are one of these new \nAmericans who takes an oath to uphold and defend the laws and the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  I have to say, because I come from a big State that sees \ndisproportionate negative consequences of illegal immigration, this is \na sure way to continue to reward the criminal organizations that get \nrich on the status quo. The 60,000 unaccompanied children that came \nfrom Central America that were part of this humanitarian crisis we had \nlast summer continue to come, and the criminal organizations that \ncontinue to profit from this money-making operation are continuing to \nget rich. It encourages children to take a perilous journey, for many \nof whom it ends in kidnapping, sexual assault or death to get to the \nU.S. border.\n  The worst part is we just had a national election, as we do every 2 \nyears. I have been in Congress when my side of the aisle wins \nelections, and we have had a pretty good election. I have been here \nwhen we lost, as we did in 2008. But that doesn't mean we can give up \non our job, which is to legislate.\n  One of the saddest parts about what the President is going to do is \nhe will poison the well and make it much harder, if not impossible, for \nus to do the sorts of things for which a bipartisan, bicameral \ncommitment exists to do, which is to make serious progress on our \nbroken immigration system. I am not sure whether we will be able to do \nas much as I would like to do or the Senator from Illinois would like \nto do, but we all know the status quo is unacceptable.\n  The President seems intent on provoking a constitutional crisis by \nadopting policies that he previously said were illegal. He said he \ndidn't have the authority to do it time and time again. Now he has \ntotally done a flip-flop of 180 degrees saying: I have discovered I now \ndo have the authority. I was wrong when I said I didn't have the \nauthority to do it. He seems intent on exacerbating partisan \npolarization and weakening democratic accountability.\n  We are the ones who are responsible for making these decisions, and \nwe are accountable to our electorate, our voters. Unfortunately, it is \ngoing to make it much harder for us to make necessary progress on a \nnumber of different matters next year.\n  The President says we haven't acted on his timetable in a way that he \nprefers, so he is going to go it alone. But just think for a moment \nabout the larger implications of that argument.\n  Every President in history has clashed with Congress. That is part of \nwhat we do. That is what the separation of powers is all about. It \nforces us to build consensus as opposed to pursuing our own agendas, \nand that is important. That is essential. But failing to get your way \nin Congress doesn't mean the President can simply override Congress \nwith the stroke of his pen.\n  There is broad support for passing a series of commonsense \nimmigration reform bills. I know the Speaker has said that publicly. \nThe majority leader in the House, Congressman McCarthy, I believe, \nbelieves that, and I certainly do. The incoming majority leader, \nSenator McConnell, has told me he does as well. But what there is no \nsupport for, other than purely partisan support, is what the President \nis proposing to do.\n  So in other words, if the President were willing to negotiate in good \nfaith--and, yes, when your proposal is that I want everything I want or \nI want nothing, you frequently get nothing. You always get nothing \nbecause nobody gets everything they want, and it requires genuine \ncompromise and it requires hard work. Nothing sustainable or meaningful \nwill ever be done in this place without bipartisan support. We have \nlearned that lesson time and time again.\n  But the President seems absolutely allergic--allergic--to good-faith \nnegotiating and genuine compromise. In fact, I am not even sure he \nlikes the job he ran so hard to get elected to, because that is part of \nhis job--to work with Congress in a bipartisan way to achieve genuine \nconsensus and compromise where possible.\n  He is claiming now, apparently, on Friday in Las Vegas, a right that \nno other President has claimed and, in fact, that he said he did not \nhave, time and time again.\n  I know the White House Counsel's office is preparing a convoluted \nlegal case to justify the President's actions. Most Americans will \ncorrectly view this as an abuse of power.\n  Earlier, I asked the President to think about the human costs of \nencouraging another massive wave of illegal immigration. My State is \ndisproportionately affected, given our 1,200-mile common border with \nMexico. It is not only people coming from Mexico; it is from Central \nAmerica and around the world. But I urged him to think about all the \nmen, women, and children from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador who \nhave suffered terrible violence and, indeed, some have died during \ntheir long journey through Mexico from Central America.\n  I urged him to think again about whether what he is doing \ninadvertently rewards and helps fund the criminal organizations that \nare creating such havoc in Mexico and in parts of Central America.\n  I can only hope the President will reconsider. I certainly am not \noptimistic because now the White House is leaking press reports about \nthis announcement on Friday. But I believe his unilateral action, which \nis unconstitutional and illegal, will deeply harm our prospects for \nimmigration reform. It will be deeply harmful to our Nation's tradition \nof the rule of law and deeply harmful to the future of our democracy.\n  Many Democrats believe, as I do, that this is a mistake. The \nPresident should heed their advice, stop making threats, and respect \nthe Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n[[Page S6119]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6119-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             NET NEUTRALITY\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today to call the Senate's \nattention to one of the most important economic issues before us, and \nthat is the issue of Net neutrality.\n  We face a pivotal moment in the fight to preserve an open and fair \nInternet. Last week, the President called on the FCC to protect the \nbedrock principle of Net neutrality.\n  A strong, open Internet is one of the best ways to protect the \ninnovation that supports millions of American jobs. It is one of the \nbest ways to protect the competitiveness of the digital economy.\n  Now the FCC is working on formulating ways to protect a robust \nInternet. We know that the FCC received over 4 million comments on the \nissue of Net neutrality, and it registered many concerns by the public \nin making sure that we protect what has been a great resource for them.\n  They have spoken. They want to protect innovation, and they want to \nprotect a free Internet.\n  Consumers should know for a fact that their Internet service is being \nheld to the same standards as everywhere else. But we know now there \nare concerns about the concentration of players in the cable and large \ntelephone market as it continues to develop. Maybe two providers will \nprovide as much as 85 percent of the provider market, which raises \nconcerns to many consumers.\n  Today I am calling on the FCC to take forceful action that adopts the \nstrongest rule possible to provide maximum protection for consumers--\nmaximum flexibility to promote the Internet economy.\n  I encourage the FCC to adopt robust and durable rules to prevent \nlocking, throttling, fast lanes, and to safeguard transparency for \nconsumers. These rules should apply both to the wired and wireless \nbroadband networks so that your Web browser, your personal computer, \nyour apps on your phone, all are treated in the same way.\n\n  This important policy would provide certainty to startup and business \ncommunities the same way as it will to support the Fortune 500 \ncompanies. In other words, we will treat an entrepreneur who started \ntheir company in their garage the same way we treat a big multinational \ncorporation.\n  We need to send a clear message: We do not want artificial toll lanes \non the innovation economy of the future. It is my hope the FEC arrives \nat a conclusion next year and issues these rules. The Internet has been \nan engine for unprecedented economic growth for our country. Today, the \ntext-up sector represents 3.9 millions jobs, according to Pew Research, \nand it is continuing to grow. It really does represent the American \nentrepreneurial spirit.\n  YouTube was created in a garage in San Mateo; Facebook launched in a \ndorm room in Cambridge, MA; Amazon--when Jeff Bezos came to Bellevue, \nWA--has now become a juggernaut in downtown Seattle for new growth and \ndevelopment. These companies might have started in a garage, but they \nare supporting thousands of jobs across our country.\n  So today we want to make sure the Internet is not under attack by \nthose who would prefer a pay-for-play system. The biggest telecom \ncompanies are trying to write the rules of the road that would crowd \nout some of these opportunities for unique entrepreneurs to continue to \ngrow the application economy of the future. That is why we can't allow \nInternet service providers to set up fast lanes for those who can pay \nand slow lanes for those who can't. Our innovation economy depends on \nequal access for ideas.\n  Between 2007 and 2012, development of applications for smart phones \nand tablets created over 466,000 high-tech jobs and generated more than \n$20 billion in annual revenue. A tiered Internet system would put all \nof that at risk. It would allow Internet service providers to cut back \nfrom the deals to determine what information America can access on \nline.\n  We live in an economy based on speed, and a tiered Internet system \nwould give the power to set speed limits to those few Internet service \nproviders and what they wanted to do. This has a major ripple effect. \nImagine your doctor examining a patient via telemedicine or a student \ntrying to access a report through a university server, all of this put \nat challenge by whether they have fast access.\n  As an editorial in the Seattle Times said: America's democracy is in \ntrouble when information is throttled or controlled by a few. The FEC \nmust reverse this shameful trend.\n  What they are really trying to say is that creating additional \nbarriers is tantamount, in my mind, to creating a tax on the Internet. \nA tiered Internet provider would have the range of control, and it \nmeans that individual users could be challenged. Strong Net neutrality \nrules will help maintain the same Internet we have today, and that is \nwhy the FEC should act.\n  Across the country, innovators, entrepreneurs, are experimenting with \ndifferent app designs and different content creation and they rely on \nthis open Internet to pursue those new business models. Nearly every \nstartup relies on understanding that their product can reach any user \nconnected to the Internet. So allowing Internet service providers to \nerect toll lanes would threaten the fundamental nature of the Internet \nand every business plan of every startup that relies on the consumer's \nability for equal access to content.\n  We must do better than what has been done so far, and I encourage \nthis body to make sure we too are going to stand up and protect the \nAmerican spirit of entrepreneurship by making sure that Net neutrality \nis the law of the land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin).

Madam President, agriculture is the lifeblood of my home \nState of Kansas. It drives our economy, but more importantly, it offers \nour citizens a way of life that is unique in today's world.\n  Within that industry I often encounter thoughtful, committed men and \nwomen who work every day to raise their families, run their businesses, \nserve their neighbors, and provide a better future for the next \ngeneration. Those qualities are found in Steve Baccus, who for the past \n17 years has served on the Kansas Farm Bureau Board of Directors and \nfor the last 12 served as its president.\n  Kansas Farm Bureau is our State's largest general farm organization, \nwith nearly 105,000 members. Under Steve's leadership, the organization \nhas influenced policy and politics, promoted rural values, and worked \nto show an increasingly urban population how food is produced and why \ntechnology is indispensable to feeding a hungry world.\n  Steve is a native Kansan, a veteran, a husband, a father of five, and \na grandfather. His fourth-generation family farm in Ottawa County \nproduces wheat, corn, soybeans, and occasionally a sunflower or a bit \nof sorghum.\n  I met Steve now many years ago when he was on his local farm bureau \nboard, and we grew to be friends over the years. He was always someone \nI could count on to give trustworthy advice and counsel.\n  As agricultural issues repeatedly come to the forefront of debate in \nWashington, DC--from trade and energy, to the economy, overregulation, \nand the farm bill--Steve has worked to make certain the voices of \nKansas farmers and ranchers are heard in the Nation's Capital.\n  Steve's passion for improving the lives of Kansans and advocating for \nthe future of our rural State has always impressed me. His service on \nthe Kansas Farm Bureau board was inspired by Steve's deeply held belief \nthat there is a better future ahead for Kansas agriculture and for our \nState. He has always been selfless in his service, often\n\n[[Page S6120]]\n\ntaking time to drive across all 105 Kansas counties over the years to \nupdate members of the farm bureau on issues that impact their lives and \nthe lives of their family members in rural Kansas and across our State. \nKFB members always knew where to find Steve and felt comfortable \nseeking his help.\n  In addition to his service as president of the Kansas Farm Bureau, \nSteve has led multiple boards and organizations, including the Board of \nthe American Farm Bureau Federation and the Farm Bureau Mutual \nInsurance Company, whose board he currently chairs. He has led trade \nmissions, presented testimony before Congress and State legislative \ncommittees, and has championed the cause of agriculture for much of his \nadult life.\n  Steve embodies many traits we can all admire, including a deep love \nfor the great State of Kansas and gratitude for the many hard-working \nfamilies who provide food, fuel, and fiber on which Americans and the \nworld rely. These traits have earned Steve the respect of his peers \nacross the country. Steve has been a true public servant to \nagriculture, and he did it for all the right reasons. Not often do you \nfind someone who has such good and clear intentions of service. Kansas \nfarmers and ranchers found that in Steve Baccus in spades. He is a \ntremendous role model for all of us who want to make a difference in \nthe lives of others.\n  Steve, we congratulate you for your service and wish you and your \nwife Patricia well in the next chapter of your life as you retire as \npresident of Kansas Farm Bureau.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6120-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING ROSS AND MARIANNA BEACH\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, last Sunday I was at a funeral service in \nManhattan, KS, because Kansas lost one of its greatest philanthropists \nand education advocates when Marianna Kistler Beach passed away on \nNovember 1, 2014.\n  Marianna and her late husband Ross Beach--who passed away in 2010--\nwere residents of my hometown of Hay, KS, for more than 60 years before \nmoving to Lawrence. This devoted couple was well known and well loved \nfor their acts of service and kindness to others. Because of Marianna \nand Ross Beach, numerous Kansans have been inspired through the arts, \nand individuals with disabilities and their families have lived \nhealthier, more productive lives.\n  Marianna was born on November 24, 1919, in Lincoln, KS, and Marianna \nlearned the importance of empowerment through education at a young age \nfrom her parents. Elmer and Myrtle Kistler moved their family from \nLincoln--including their 15-year-old daughter Marianna--to Manhattan, \nKS, in 1934 in order to give their children the opportunity for a \ncollege education during the Great Depression. Marianna graduated from \nManhattan High School and Kansas State University, where she was a \nmember of Pi Beta Phi, Sigma Phi Journalism Honorary, and Mortar Board.\n  Marianna married Ross--whom she always called Rossie--in 1941, and \nthey were devoted to each other for 69 years until his death in 2010.\n  Ross Beach was a pioneer in banking, radio and television, and oil \nand gas, and Marianna was a support system behind all that success. \nRoss was the president of Kansas National Gas Company and chairman of \nthe board of the Douglas County Bank, and with Marianna by his side \nRoss created economic opportunities for many Kansans. But the Beaches' \nbusiness success was overshadowed by Ross and Marianna's generosity.\n  Marianna Beach worked hard to make certain education and the arts \nwould be a priority of Kansans. She and her husband assisted with the \nformation of the Beach-Schmidt Performing Arts Center and the Sternberg \nMuseum of Natural History at Fort Hays State University. Marianna was a \nmember of the Mid-America Arts Alliance, president of the Hays Arts \nCouncil, and wrote a column on art and city beautification for the Hays \nDaily News for more than 20 years.\n  For the Beaches' 50th wedding anniversary, Marianna convinced her \nhusband to establish the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art on the \ncampus of Kansas State University to ensure that art is accessible to \nall Kansans. My wife Robba and I have had the honor to serve on the \nboard of visitors of this museum that bears their name. We are able to \nwitness firsthand the positive consequences of the passion and \ncommitment Ross and Marianna had for culture and for the arts in our \nState.\n  Marianna's priorities were guided by a belief in the value of each \nindividual, which was illustrated by her lifelong commitment to \nsupporting and uplifting individuals with special needs. Supported by \nher husband, Marianna worked tirelessly to maximize the potential of \nhandicapped individuals, serving on the President's Committee on Mental \nRetardation from 1969 to 1975. She was also actively involved at the \nlocal level. She did everything personally. In fact, the Beach Center \non Disability at the University of Kansas is named in her honor. The \nresearch done there focuses on disability policy, employment, family \nsupport, and early childhood services.\n  The Beaches' level of generosity will truly live on for generations \nto come.\n  Despite their stature in our community and State, Marianna and Ross \nBeach always treated every person they encountered with respect and \ndignity. As a young newlywed couple starting a new life in Hays, the \nfirst invitation Robba and I received was to come to Ross and \nMarianna's home for dinner. There was never a more gracious, caring \ncouple than the Beaches, who wanted to make sure everyone was included.\n  For a large portion of my life, I joined Ross and other businessmen \nand professionals for lunch at The Roundtable. While there was a lot of \ntalk about sports and politics, I learned a lot about life by listening \nto Mr. Beach. My friendship with Ross Beach certainly opened doors for \nme in business and politics, but more importantly, it gave me the \nconfidence to realize that this smalltown Kansas kid could one day be \nable to serve here with my colleagues in the Senate.\n  While my family and I are saddened by the death of Marianna Beach, we \ntake comfort knowing that the legacy of the Beach family will endure \nfar beyond our generation. While Marianna and Ross Beach donated their \ntalents and treasure, it is their character and generous souls that I \nand many others will miss the most.\n  Marianna was loved by all who knew her but especially by her family. \nI extend my heartfelt sympathies to her daughters Mary, Terry, and \nJane, as well as her brother Lee, sister Janet, and eight grandchildren \nand six great-grandchildren.

Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  There is a lot of talk here in Washington and across our country \nright now about how to fix a very broken immigration system. The \nmessage the American people sent us earlier this month was very clear. \nI don't think anybody should miss it. They want us to work together, \nand they want us to get things done for the country and move things \nforward. They know we can still do big things when we put aside \npartisan politics and sit down together and work in the best interests \nof the country.\n  I know that firsthand because of the farm bill. It was not easy. It \nwas complicated. There were regional differences. There were partisan \ndifferences. There were differences between the House and the Senate. \nBut we wanted to get it done. We stuck with it, we worked hard, and in \nthe end, a lot of people working together made that happen. So we know \nhow to do that.\n  We know how to do that in the Senate on immigration as well because a\n\n[[Page S6121]]\n\nwhole different group of people across the aisle sat down with very \ndifferent ideas. How do we strengthen the border? How do we have a \nsystem that works for agriculture and business? How do we create a \npathway of earning their citizenship in this country? People worked in \na very complicated situation, they worked together, and ultimately, \nafter a lot of amendments and slogging it through on the floor, just as \nwe did on the farm bill, we achieved that. We achieved that. We \nachieved that 510 days ago.\n  So 510 days ago we passed overwhelmingly--I believe it was 68 votes--\na comprehensive immigration reform bill and sent it to the House of \nRepresentatives--510 days ago. What has the Republican House of \nRepresentatives done with that comprehensive, bipartisan bill that was \nsent to them 510 days ago? Nothing. A great big zero. They have done \nnothing. They refused to even have a vote on it. They refused to \nsuggest changes to the bill and work on the opportunity to bring their \nideas to the table. They refused to even debate the bill. Why? \nAmazingly--amazingly--it is because the Speaker and the Republicans and \nthe House know it would pass if they brought it up. And the public \nlooks at that and says: What? Are you crazy? You don't want to bring up \na bill because you know it would actually pass on a bipartisan vote?\n  But that is exactly what is happening. In fact, that is how it is \nsupposed to work. There was a tremendous amount of effort by this body \nand by leaders on both sides of the aisle, who should feel very proud \nof the work that was done. It was sent to the House of Representatives \n510 days ago, and nothing has been done. Zero has been done.\n  So I have a very simple message for Speaker Boehner: Let the House \nvote. Let the House vote. The time is now. The time is now to solve \nthis problem, and it can be solved today if people want to do that.\n  House Republicans still have an opportunity to show the American \npeople that they can be trusted to do the work that people sent them to \ndo--sent all of us to do. They can do it today. They can do it \ntomorrow. They can get this done before Thanksgiving. Everyone knows \nthat the bipartisan Senate immigration bill would pass right now with \nboth Democrats and Republicans supporting it if Speaker Boehner would \nsimply let the House vote.\n  As we in the Senate showed over a year ago, people on both sides of \nthe aisle want to fix this broken system that hurts families, workers, \nbusinesses, and farmers. I could tell you story after story of crops \nbeing left in the field because of a broken immigration system. This is \nan urgent problem, and the time to act is now.\n  If our Republican colleagues in the House don't want President Obama \nto use his authority to help fix the broken immigration system--just as \nevery President, by the way, since President Eisenhower, including \nPresidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, has done--all they have to do \nis simply vote. Just have a vote. Then we don't have to have this back-\nand-forth about how do we work together on appropriations or how do we \nget all the work done that desperately needs to be done. Just vote. It \nis in their hands.\n  We cannot afford to wait another 510 days to begin to address this \nurgent problem, which is why if the House will not act the President \nhas no choice but to act. But the good news is that we don't have to \nwait.\n  Americans didn't send us here to talk about impeachment or shutting \ndown the government again. They sent us here to get things done. They \nsent us here to create opportunities for them to work hard and get in \nthe middle class and stay in the middle class, which is harder and \nharder to do every day.\n  So I would say to Speaker Boehner: Let the House vote. Let's get the \nbipartisan immigration bill on the President's desk today. This isn't \nabout the President waving a red flag in front of a bull, by the way--\nwhich is, frankly, a lot of bull--this is about waving the bill in \nfront of the House of Representatives.\n  Yoo-hoo, Mr. Speaker, you have a bill. You have a bill. It passed \nwith 68 votes in the Senate. It will pass in the House of \nRepresentatives. It will avoid what you say is going to be a big fight \nand legal challenges. Just vote. It is that simple.\n  Let's show the American people that we can put aside our differences, \nthat we can work together and do what is best for the country. It is as \nsimple as having a vote.\n  Thank you, Madam President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6121-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6121-S6122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO ABDUL-RAHMAN ``PETER'' KASSIG\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Madam President, this is a speech I hoped to never give \nand one I give with an incredibly heavy heart. I wish to speak about a \nyoung man from my home State of Indiana, Abdul-Rahman Kassig, known to \nmany who loved him as Peter or Pete. He was a Hoosier, a son of \nIndiana, and we could not feel more proud of him or lucky about the \nfact that he was one of us.\n  Abdul-Rahman was a son of the United States of America who served our \ncountry and also served the world. He was a man of peace and healing \nand caring. Abdul-Rahman was with us for 26 years, and what he gave us \nduring his life is so much greater and so much more important than how \nhe died. The intensity and focus and desire to make a difference was \nthe hallmark of Peter's life, and it stands in stark contrast to the \ncruelty and disdain for human life of the ISIL terrorists who took \nPeter from us.\n\n  Every one of us is heartbroken for his parents Paula and Ed, who have \nlost their son in the most nightmarish of circumstances and have been \nthe most extraordinary people during this whole situation. The world \nmourns the loss of Abdul-Rahman along with us. His life is one to be \nadmired.\n  As one of his teachers wrote to his parents: ``Peter's life is \nevidence that he's been right all along; one person can make a \ndifference.''\n  While we mourn the loss of our fellow Hoosier in America, we are \nrightfully angry about his murder and we hunger for justice, but we are \nchallenged to face the fact that there are others still being held by \nthese terrorists, and we must work and pray for those who continue to \nbe held against their will.\n  Today I want to talk about Abdul-Rahman--Peter. I know his wonderful \nparents Paula and Ed. They are extraordinary people. I was not lucky \nenough to meet Peter before he headed over to Syria to help provide \nemergency medical care there. However, through his folks and these many \nmonths, I feel as though I have gotten to know his spirit through his \nwords, his actions, and the many stories from those who loved him. Some \nstories can be told, some stories can't be told, but he is an \nextraordinary young man in every way.\n  This was a selfless, courageous young man with a big heart who saw \nsuffering and wanted to help, and ultimately he laid down his life in \nservice to others. If you look at these pictures, this is Peter at the \nambulance that he worked on as an emergency medical technician, and all \nhe did was try to make other people's lives better by helping them when \nthey were injured and wounded. You will hear that when his organization \nran out of money, he took his own money out of his own pocket to buy \nbandages, equipment, and gas for the van. That is the kind of guy he \nwas.\n  He was a son of Indiana, growing up near Broad Ripple as the only \nchild of Paula and Ed. He graduated from Indianapolis North Central \nHigh School, spending his high school days as many kids in Wisconsin \ndo--the home State of the Presiding Officer--running cross country and \ntrack and playing his guitar. He then served in the U.S. Army with a \nbrief time in Iraq before being honorably discharged and enrolling in \nHanover College back home in Indiana.\n  Abdul-Rahman was described as an intense young man who was always \nready to help his friends in need. One classmate from Hanover said, \n``From the moment you meet Abdul-Rahman, you know that he is a man that \nis destined for great things.''\n  Abdul-Rahman left Hanover in 2009 for training and then certification \nas an emergency medical technician, followed by attending Butler \nUniversity. It was during his time as a student at Butler that Pete \ntraveled over to Beirut during spring break in 2012. While other kids \nwere heading to Florida and\n\n[[Page S6122]]\n\nTexas and the Bahamas over spring break, Pete went to Beirut to try to \nhelp people.\n  He saw the refugee crisis stemming from the Syrian civil war \nfirsthand and decided to stay there.\n  I wish to read some of what he wrote to his family and friends at \nthat time about the decision he made. These are Peter's words:\n\n       I do not know much, every day that I am here I have more \n     questions and less answers, but what I do know is that I have \n     a chance to do something here, to take a stand. To make a \n     difference. Yesterday my life was laid out on a table in \n     front of me. With only hours left before my scheduled flight \n     back home to the United States, I watched people dying right \n     in front of me. I had seen it before and I had walked away \n     before . . .\n       I am staying in the region indefinitely. I am formally \n     requesting that I be withdrawn from my courses for the \n     remainder of the semester. I have had the conversation with \n     my parents and it was the easiest one we ever had. They knew \n     simply from the sound of my voice. I have never been freer, \n     more alive, happier, or better received than in this place.\n       There is too much work to be done here. Too many people in \n     need of immediate help . . .\n       This decision isn't one that everyone would make, most \n     people wouldn't I guess, but those of you that really know me \n     understand that this is what I was made to do. My whole life \n     has led me to this point in time.\n\n  In May of 2012, Abdul-Rahman moved to Lebanon to work as a volunteer \nemergency medical technician, serving in a hospital in the region \nthere.\n  By September 2012, Abdul-Rahman, still in his young twenties, formed \nhis own nongovernmental organization to even better help those in need \naround him. It was called the Special Emergency Relief and Assistance, \nor SERA.\n  In the summer of 2013, Abdul-Rahman moved SERA's headquarters to \nGaziantep, Turkey, where the organization provided first response \nassistance to refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war.\n  SERA provided food and medical supplies to the refugee camps on both \nsides of the border. SERA also provided primary trauma care and first-\naid training to civilians in Syria so others could also provide that \nsame care.\n  When fundraising was not going as well as needed, Abdul-Rahman \ndonated his own money, giving not only his time and his talent, but \neverything he had financially to keep it going and assist those \nsuffering around him. He was working on a project for SERA when he was \ndetained on October 1, 2013.\n  When he was detained, he was traveling in the back of an ambulance on \nhis way to Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria to help provide medical care. \nHe was in the back of an ambulance when he was taken.\n\n  Peter showed incredible strength while in captivity--demonstrating \nhis love for his parents while reflecting on the possibility that he \nmight not make it home.\n  In a letter written while he was in captivity, and received by his \nparents in early 2014, Abdul-Rahman wrote:\n\n       It is still really hard to believe all of this is happening \n     . . . as I am sure you know by now, things have been getting \n     pretty intense. We have been held together, us foreigners . . \n     . and now about half the people have gone home . . .\n       I hope that this all has a happy ending but it may very \n     well be coming down to the wire here, if in fact that is the \n     case then I figured it was time to say a few things that need \n     saying before I have to go.\n       The first thing I want to say is thank you. Both to you and \n     mom for everything you have both done for me as parents; for \n     everything you have taught me, shown me, and experienced with \n     me.\n       I cannot imagine the strength and commitment it has taken \n     to raise a son like me but your love and patience are things \n     I am so deeply grateful for.\n       Secondly, I want you to know about things here and what \n     I've been through straight from me so you don't have to \n     wonder, guess, or imagine (often this is worse than the \n     reality). All in all I am alright. Physically I am pretty \n     underweight but I'm not starved, & I have no physical \n     injuries, I'm a tough kid and still young so that helps.\n       Mentally I am pretty sure this is the hardest thing a \n     person can go through, the stress and fear are incredible but \n     I am coping as best I can. I am not alone. I have friends, we \n     laugh, we play chess, we play trivia to stay sharp, and we \n     share stories and dreams of home and loved ones. I can be \n     hard to deal with, you know me. My mind is quick and my \n     patience thinner than most.\n       But all in all I am holding my own. I cried a lot in the \n     first few months, but a little less now. I worry a lot about \n     you and mom and my friends.\n       They tell us you have abandoned us and/or don't care but of \n     course we know you are doing everything you can and more. \n     Don't worry Dad, if I do go down, I won't go thinking \n     anything but what I know to be true. That you and mom love me \n     more than the moon & the stars.\n       I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is \n     not knowing, wondering, hoping and wondering if I should even \n     hope at all. I am very sad that all this has happened and for \n     what all of you back home are going through.\n       If I do die, I figure at least you and I can seek refuge \n     and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying \n     to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.\n       In terms of my faith, I pray everyday and I am not angry \n     about my situation in that sense. I am in a dogmatically \n     complicated situation here, but I am at peace with my belief.\n       I wish this paper would go on forever and never run out and \n     I could just keep talking to you. Just know I'm with you. \n     Every stream, every lake, every field and river. In the woods \n     and hills, in all the places you showed me. I love you.\n\n  If you look at the pictures, you can see Peter and his mom in this \npicture and Peter and his dad off fishing in Indiana. This is the story \nof Abdul-Rahman Kassig. Nothing you have seen on TV over the past 3 or \n4 days is the story of Abdul-Rahman Kassig. This is the story. Those \nare his parents and this is what he did--he devoted his life to others.\n  He was a young man who was taken from us in the most barbaric way, \nyet whose life stands for all that is good in our world.\n  Abdul-Rahman, we will miss you catching more fish than your dad Ed \nwhen you went out fishing together and then laughing with him and \nrubbing it in that you caught more than he did. Best friends right \nthere.\n  We will miss you giving your mom Paula a big hug and telling your \nparents how much you love them. Folks around the world and every \nAmerican will miss you terribly, but we will never forget how kind you \nwere to the sick and injured people you cared for and the sick and \ninjured people you made well, and everyone whose hearts you filled with \nlove and passion and laughter.\n  This was a man all Hoosiers and everyone else was so proud of, who \ntouched more people and helped more folks in his 26 years than most of \nus do in a lifetime.\n  I will close with something that Paula Kassig said on Monday:\n\n       Our hearts are battered, but they will mend. The world is \n     broken, but it will be healed in the end. And good will \n     prevail . . .\n\n  Abdul-Rahman spent the last years of this life working for good, \nserving those in the greatest need in the most dangerous of situations \nbecause his fellow citizens of the world needed him. He truly believed \ngood would prevail.\n  Let us keep the Kassigs and those who are still currently being held \nagainst their will and their families in our prayers and thoughts.\n  Abdul-Rahman, we have been humbled by your generosity and your love. \nMay God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.\n  I yield back and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today is our first full week back in \nsession since the election 2 weeks ago. While we haven't had the change \nof control yet in the Chamber--it doesn't happen until next year--\nRepublicans are setting out our priorities for the new Congress and \nlooking forward to getting to work.\n  Two weeks ago the American people spoke. They sent a clear message to \nWashington that they are tired of the status quo, tired of gridlock, \ntired of obstruction. They are tired of Washington wasting their money. \nThey want change, and on election day, they asked Republicans to make \nthat happen.\n  Republicans are humbled by the trust the American people have placed \nin us, and we are not going to let them down. We look forward to \nsetting a positive and a constructive agenda and getting the Senate \nworking again for the American people.\n\n[[Page S6123]]\n\n  Over the past several years, the Senate Democratic leadership has \nstifled debate, ignored the regular order of business, and wasted the \nSenate's time on partisan pieces of business that Democratic leaders \nknew would not pass. That means that very little time has been spent on \nAmerican families' priorities.\n  Even many Democrats have grown frustrated with the highly partisan \ndirection the Senate has taken under Democratic leadership. Republicans \nintend to chart a different course.\n  Starting in January, we will ensure that the Senate returns to the \ncommittee process and that the Senate floor once again becomes a forum \nfor debate and amendments and votes. I am encouraged that this week a \nnumber of rank-and-file Democrats abandoned their leadership and joined \nRepublicans to support legislation to approve the Keystone Pipeline and \nthe more than 42,000 jobs it will create. Republicans hope we can \ncontinue to have that kind of collaboration in the new Congress.\n  Americans have had a rough time over the past several years, \nincluding a weak economy, few jobs, high prices on everything from \nhealth care to electricity, and the list goes on and on. Our first \npriority in the 114th Congress will be enacting policies that will help \ncreate jobs and increase economic opportunity for American families. A \ngood place to start is the dozens of House-passed jobs bills that have \nbeen gathering dust on the Senate Democratic leader's desk. Many of \nthese bills passed the House with bipartisan support, and it is high \ntime they get a vote in the Senate so they can get on the President's \ndesk.\n  We hope the President will work with us on priorities such as \nexpanding trade to open new markets for American agriculture and \nmanufacturing overseas.\n  I have to say I am a little concerned that the President has \nindicated his intention of continuing to operate on his own. The \nAmerican people made it clear on election day that they have rejected \nhis policies, and I hope the President will take that message to heart \nand rethink his plans to go it alone on important issues such as \nimmigration.\n  Finally, Republicans will get to work on some of the big-ticket items \nthat need to get done in Washington, including issues such as reforming \nour Tax Code to make it simpler and fairer and to make us more \ncompetitive in the global marketplace, eliminating the hundreds of \ninefficient regulations that are driving up prices for American \nfamilies and killing jobs, and issues such as conducting oversight of \nthe executive branch to ensure that the cycle of abuses such as the IRS \nscandal and the Veterans Affairs scandal stops now.\n  Republicans understand the opportunity we have been given and we \ndon't intend to waste it. We are going to make Washington work again, \nwe are going to make government more efficient and effective and stop \nthe waste of taxpayer dollars, and we are going to get our economy \ngoing again to put our Nation on a path to growth and shared \nprosperity.\n  Divided government has been historically a time when great things \nhave been accomplished. We can go back to Social Security reform in \n1983 when we had a Republican President working with a Democratic House \nor tax reform in 1986 when we had a Republican President working with a \nDemocratic House or 1996 when we had a Democratic President working \nwith a Republican Congress on welfare reform. There are lots of \nexamples throughout our history where divided government has led to big \naccomplishments and big results for the American people.\n  I submit that we can do that again. The American people are counting \non us. Republicans are ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work, \nand we invite Democrats and the President to join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this past Saturday the open enrollment \nperiod for the Obama health care law opened in terms of the health care \nexchange. People who bought health insurance through healthcare.gov or \nthrough their State's exchange are finally allowed to see how much \ntheir insurance is going to cost next year. Things were pushed back \nbeyond the election so people wouldn't be able to find out before the \nelection what it was going to cost. So the Obama administration had all \nof this information for awhile, but they intentionally kept it secret \nuntil after election day. Now people get to see the prices, and many \npeople across the country are absolutely in shock at the increased \ncosts of the health care law.\n  Millions of Americans are learning their health insurance is going to \ncost them a lot more. As a matter of fact, when the exchanges opened \nNovember 15, on the front page of the New York Times: ``Cost of \nCoverage Under Care Act Set to Increase.'' The article says:\n\n       The Obama administration on Friday unveiled data showing \n     that many Americans with health insurance bought under the \n     Affordable Care Act could face substantial price increases \n     next year--in some cases as much as 20 percent.\n\n  Substantial price increases, 20 percent.\n  For some people it is going to be even higher than that.\n  The Wall Street Journal took a look at it and they had a large story \nwith a picture on Friday and the headline is: ``Consumers Still \nConfused Ahead of Insurance Sign-ups.''\n  The article describes a man named Bob Sorey, who is a real estate \nsalesperson in Mount Juliet, TN. He had a plan through Blue Cross Blue \nShield, and he says his premiums are going up nearly 25 percent next \nyear. He told the newspaper, ``I just can't absorb that.''\n  President Obama promised the American people they would save $2,500 \nper year per family under his health care law. Nancy Pelosi, the former \nSpeaker of the House, went on ``Meet the Press'' at one point and said \neveryone's rates would go down--everyone, she said. What does the \nPresident have to say now? What will he tell those people whose rates \nhave continued to go up? What does he say to this real estate broker in \nTennessee who can't absorb a 20-percent increase?\n  In Anchorage, AK, a typical plan is going to cost 28 percent more \nnext year. That is for the second cheapest silver plan, what they call \nthe benchmark plan.\n  In Minneapolis rates are going up almost 19 percent, and that is just \nfor the premiums. For many people their copays are going up and their \ndeductibles are going up as well. In some parts of Georgia 70 percent \nof the plans sold on the exchange have deductibles of at least $2,500. \nIs that affordable for people? Millions of Americans will be paying \nmore in premiums as well as more out of their pocket--millions of \npeople such as Bob Sorey, the real estate broker in Tennessee, who, as \nhe said, just can't absorb the cost.\n  These skyrocketing premiums may explain why the President's health \ncare law is more unpopular right now than ever before.\n  According to the latest Gallup poll, only 37 percent of Americans \napprove of the law. It was supposed to get more popular. That is what \nthe Democrats on this floor told people across the country and told us. \nInstead, the opposite has happened. People see how much their costs \nhave increased because of the law, and many people are learning that \nhaving coverage under the law is not the same as having care. There is \na difference between coverage and care.\n  That is what USA Today found out. They had a front-page article last \nFriday with the headline: ``Rural Hospitals in Critical Condition.''\n  So not just the cost of coverage under the care act set to increase, \nbut rural hospitals are in critical condition.\n  Obama critics say the law is speeding up the demise of rural \nfacilities, of rural hospitals. That is the problem.\n  The article talks about a small hospital in Georgia that had to close \nin the spring of last year because of all the new burdens of the health \ncare law. People in that town now have to travel many miles to get to \nanother hospital in another town. One of those people was Bill Jones. \nHe was a peanut and cotton farmer who lived about 9 miles away from the \nold hospital. Bill suffered a heart attack 1 month after the hospital \nhad to close. The ambulance had to take him to another hospital in\n\n[[Page S6124]]\n\na town further away. I can tell my colleagues, as a doctor who \npracticed medicine for 25 years, when someone has a heart attack, every \nminute counts. Bill Jones didn't survive his heart attack. Maybe he \nwouldn't have survived a trip to a closer hospital; we won't know that. \nBut the hospital is gone now and it is gone because of the President's \nhealth care law. For people living in rural States such as Georgia and \nmy own State of Wyoming, this is a terrifying prospect.\n  The article says that since January of 2010, more than 40 rural \nhospitals have closed across the country. There is a map of the country \nof all the places where hospitals have closed. Ezekiel Emanuel, who \nworked on the health care law, says that 40 hospitals is not enough. He \nis one of the architects of course of the President's health care law. \nHe says that over the next 6 years, more than 1,000 hospitals will \nclose. In more than 1,000 American communities, people will be further \naway from medical care. That is precious lost time for people who have \nheart attacks or for women with high-risk pregnancies who are further \nfrom the help they need to deliver a healthy baby. They may have \ncoverage under the President's health care law, but that is not the \nsame as getting the care they need.\n  We are also seeing that for people whom the law has pushed into \nMedicaid--because Medicaid, of course--the President's goal was to push \nmore and more people into Medicaid--that pays less for services than \ntraditional insurance companies pay. A lot of doctors and other \nproviders can't afford to take new Medicaid patients.\n  There was a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal last Friday \nthat says as more join Medicaid, health care systems feel strained.\n  As more join Medicaid--the President's goal--health systems feel the \nstrain. The article says that about one-third of all primary care \nphysicians aren't taking new Medicaid patients. One of them is Dr. \nHolly Abernathy. She is a family physician in Farmington, NM, and she \nsays she just can't afford to take any new patients under the program. \nShe says: ``I would love to see every Medicaid patient that comes \nthrough my door.'' She also says: ``If you give people coverage, they \nshould be able to utilize it.''\n  Premiums are going up, out-of-pocket costs are going up. Hospitals \nare closing. Doctors are having to turn away patients--all because of \nthe President's health care law.\n  ObamaCare was too long, too complicated, too expensive, and it took \naway too much from the people who like the care and the coverage they \nhad before the law was passed. That is why Republicans are going to \nvote to repeal the entire health care law.\n  Meanwhile, we will also vote to strip away the worst and most \ndestructive parts of the law--parts such as the employer mandate, the \narbitrary 30-hour workweek, that has been devastating to part-time \nworkers across the country and others such as the unfair medical device \ntax that sends American jobs overseas and threatens lifesaving \ninnovation.\n  Republicans are going to keep fighting for Americans who have been \nharmed by the President's health care law. We are going to keep \noffering the real solutions that people wanted all along--access to the \ncare they need from a doctor they choose at lower cost. That is what \nthe American people are demanding, and that is what they deserve. It is \nwhat Republicans are going to give them.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6124-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6124-S6126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                INNOVATION AGENDA FOR THE 114TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to emphasize the importance \nof keeping our technology industry in the forefront of our global \neconomy. America has made extraordinary strides in innovation. For \ndecades we have been the world's leader in developing new technologies \nand advancing the Internet age, but we are not the only nation in this \nhunt.\n  Across the globe, and particularly in China and other parts of Asia, \nour international competitors are working furiously to catch up. If the \nUnited States is to enjoy continued success in the technology arena, \nthe policymakers must ensure that we have a legal and regulatory \nlandscape that will enable our innovators to thrive.\n  As chairman of the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, I have \nbeen working with colleagues and stakeholders to develop an innovation \nagenda for the coming Congress. Today I would like to highlight several \nbipartisan initiatives that we should prioritize early next year to \nhelp ensure the continued success of our high-tech economy.\n  First, Congress must act to protect America's innovation and \ninventiveness. An essential part of fostering innovation is protecting \nlegitimate intellectual property rights. In particular, we must enact \nlegislation to combat abusive patent litigation.\n  Patent trolls--which are often shell companies that do not make or \nsell anything--are crippling innovation and growth across all sectors \nof our economy. It is estimated that abuse of patent litigation costs \nour economy over $60 billion every year. With so much on the line, how \ncan we afford not to act? Yet the current Senate did exactly that and \nignored the very real opportunity we had, to follow the House of \nRepresentatives and pass bipartisan legislation that would be supported \nby the White House.\n  Why would anyone walk away from the opportunity to enact pro-\ninnovation policies that would do so much good for our economy?\n  It is no secret that trial lawyers and others told the current \nmajority leader not to bring patent troll reform up for a vote. We all \nknow when the trial lawyers say ``jump,'' the only answer for some of \nmy Democratic colleagues is ``how high.''\n  While I am disappointed the Senate failed to act during this \nCongress, I intend to help ensure we pass legislation next year. \nFortunately, combating patent trolls is a priority for incoming Senate \nJudiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and House Judiciary \nCommittee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.\n  I look forward to working with them and others who are committed to \nmaking long overdue reforms to our patent laws--including mandatory fee \nshifting, heightened pleading and discovery standards, demand letter \nreforms, and a mechanism to enable recovery of fees against shell \ncompanies or those who are behind them.\n  In addition, we must improve the quality of patents issued by the \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Low-quality patents are essential to \na patent troll's business model. I am optimistic we can reach agreement \non how best to improve our patent process.\n  We also need a high-functioning and well-funded USPTO. A fully funded \npatent office would, at the very least, mean more and better trained \npatent examiners, more complete libraries of prior art, and greater \naccess to modern information technologies to address the Agency's \ngrowing needs. All of these improvements would lead to higher quality \npatents that are granted more quickly. The good news is we can make \nthese changes at no cost to taxpayers since the USPTO is a fee-\ngenerating agency.\n  Now, there are some who argue here that patent troll legislation is \nnot necessary in light of the Supreme Court's decisions in the Octane \nFitness and Highmark cases. Ms. Charlene Morrow and Mr. Brian Lahti, \nhowever, writing in the BNA's Patent, Trademark & Copyright Journal \nconfirm that ``nothing in these cases addresses the proposed reforms to \nmake the real parties in interest who are managing patent assertion \nentities responsible for fees and costs.'' This is something I worked \non for quite a few months. As these experienced practitioners \nacknowledge such legislation is essential to address fee-collection \nconcerns faced by defendants in present patent litigation. One of the \nlegislative approaches Ms. Morrow and Mr. Lahti proposed is to make \nbonding more readily available at an early stage of litigation. I could \nnot agree more.\n  We must ensure that those who defend against abusive patent \nlitigation\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n\nand are awarded fees will actually get paid. Even when a patent troll \nstructured as a shell company has no assets, there are other parties \nwith an interest in the litigation. These parties are often \nintentionally beyond the jurisdiction of the courts. They stand to \nbenefit if their plaintiff shell company forces a settlement and are \nprotected from any liability if they lose.\n  It is a win-win situation for them and a lose-lose situation for \nAmerica's innovators. Since we cannot force parties outside of a \ncourt's jurisdiction to join in a case, we must incentivize those \ninterested parties to do the right thing.\n  That is the whole purpose behind my recovery-of-award provision. \nUnder this provision, those who are deemed interested parties may \neither voluntarily submit to the court's jurisdiction and become liable \nfor any unsatisfied fees awarded in the case or they may opt out by \nrenouncing any meaningful interest in the litigation. If interested \nparties stand aside and do nothing, the original plaintiff must post a \nbond to ensure that any shifted fees are paid.\n  Bottom line: Without such bonding measures, all defendants have is a \ntoothless joinder provision that can be easily circumvented by bad \nactors with no intention of paying the court-awarded fees for their \nabusive lawsuits.\n  I have said this before but it bears repeating. Fee shifting without \nsuch a recovery provision is like writing a check on an empty account. \nYou are purporting to convey something that isn't there. Only fee \nshifting coupled with this recovery provision will stop patent trolls \nfrom litigating-and-dashing.\n  The House has already demonstrated that Members from both sides of \nthe aisle can come together to craft and pass commonsense legislation \nto combat abusive patent lawsuits. President Obama supports such \nefforts. It is past time the Senate does its part. We ought to get rid \nof this phony attitude of obeisance to the personal injury lawyers and \ntrial lawyers in this country.\n  I am determined to make such patent reform a priority early next year \nand to make sure we send the President a bill that he can sign into law \nfor the good of all American innovation.\n\n  In addition to patent troll legislation, there is strong bipartisan, \nbicameral support for creating a harmonized, uniform Federal standard \nfor protecting trade secrets.\n  Here in the Senate, Senator Chris Coons and I introduced the Defend \nTrade Secret Act on April 29, 2014. In the House of Representatives, \nRepresentative George Holding introduced the Trade Secrets Protection \nAct on July 29, 2014. Through our collective efforts we have shed light \non an often overlooked form of intellectual property.\n  Trade secrets, such as customer lists, formulas, and manufacturing \nprocesses are an essential form of intellectual property. Yet trade \nsecrets are the only form of U.S. intellectual property where misuse \ndoes not provide its owner with a Federal private right of action. \nCurrently trade secret owners must rely on State courts or Federal \nprosecutors to protect their rights.\n  The multi-State procedural and jurisdictional issues that arise in \nsuch cases are costly and complicated, and the Department of Justice \nlacks the resources to prosecute many such cases. These systemic issues \nput companies at a great disadvantage, since the victims of trade \nsecret theft need to recover information quickly before it crosses \nState lines or leaves the country.\n  Unfortunately, in today's global information age, there are endless \nexamples of how easy and rewarding it can be to steal trade secrets. \nWhile the maximum penalty for trade secrets theft is 10 years in prison \nand a $250,000 fine, few of these thefts actually result in Federal \nprosecutions. While $250,000 may sound like a steep penalty, most \nstolen trade secrets amount to tens or even hundreds of millions of \ndollars in lost profits and sales. Even when thefts are prosecuted, \nvictim companies rarely recover the full extent of their losses.\n  We have made some progress in moving forward trade secret \nlegislation. Earlier this year, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nCrime and Terrorism held a hearing on the importance of creating a \nprivate right of action for trade secret theft. The House Judiciary \nCommittee reported its bill--by voice vote--on September 17. Although \nwe did not get the bill across the finish line this Congress, we are \nwell positioned to move the trade secret legislation early next year.\n  It is past time to enable U.S. companies to protect their trade \nsecrets in Federal court.\n  Another bipartisan initiative ready for congressional action relates \nto our privacy laws. I speak about the need to update the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act or ECPA to require a warrant for all email \ncontent within the United States and to safeguard data stored abroad \nfrom improper government access.\n  Enacted in 1986, ECPA prohibits communication service providers from \nintercepting or disclosing email, telephone conversations or data \nstored electronically, unless such disclosure is authorized. Virtually \neveryone agrees that Americans should enjoy the same privacy \nprotections in their online communications that they do in their \noffline communications.\n  But Congress has not adequately updated the law since its enactment, \nand technological developments have resulted in disparate treatment. As \ncurrently written, ECPA requires law enforcement to obtain a warrant \nfor emails that are less than 6 months old but only a subpoena to \naccess older electronic communications.\n  Think about your own email account. You may have hundreds of emails \nthat you have received over many years. Additionally, ECPA has allowed \nlaw enforcement to access emails that have been opened with just a \nsubpoena, even though a search warrant would be required for a printout \nof the same communication sitting on your desk.\n  Those conflicting standards should cause great concern to everyone \nwho values personal privacy. Now to make matters more complicated, ECPA \nis silent on the privacy standard for accessing data stored abroad. \nStoring digital information around the world, a practice that did not \nexist when ECPA became law, is now routine. Moreover, the Federal \nGovernment has taken advantage of this statutory silence to apply its \nown standard, requiring access to data abroad if the company storing it \nhas a presence in the United States.\n  For that reason alone, Congress should amend the law. That is why, \ntogether with Senators Chris Coons and Dean Heller, I introduced the \nLaw Enforcement Access to Data Stored Abroad Act. The LEADS Act would \nrequire a warrant when the government demands customer communications \nfrom third-party service providers. Such a warrant would only apply to \ndata stored in the United States, unless the data is owned by a U.S. \ncorporation, citizen or lawful permanent resident.\n  To provide additional protections, the bill requires courts to modify \nor vacate such warrants if they would require the service provider to \nviolate the laws of a foreign country. The practice of extending \nwarrants extraterritorially presents unique challenges for a number of \nindustries which increasingly face a conflict between American law and \nthe laws of the countries where the electronic data is stored.\n  Additionally, if the United States expects to extend its warrants \nextraterritorially, we should not be surprised if other countries, \nincluding China and Russia, seek to do the same for the emails of \nAmericans and others stored in this country.\n  Congress must ensure that law enforcement has the tools to execute \nsearch warrants where necessary so long as officials comply with the \nlaws of the foreign country where the electronic data is stored.\n  The LEADS Act also provides needed improvements to the mutual legal \nassistance treaty process, which are formal agreements for sharing \nevidence between the United States and foreign countries in \ninternational investigations. Currently, the MLAT process is slow and \nunreliable, sometimes taking several months to access data held by \nforeign jurisdictions.\n  The Department of Justice not only needs additional funds to hire \nmore people to handle MLAT requests, but reforms to the underlying \nprogram are needed to improve transparency and efficiency. The \nlegislation recognizes, through a sense of Congress, that data\n\n[[Page S6126]]\n\nproviders should not be subject to data localization requirements. Such \nrequirements are incompatible with the borderless nature of the \nInternet----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to finish my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Such requirements are incompatible with the borderless \nnature of the Internet. They are an impediment to online innovation and \nthey are unnecessary to meet the needs of law enforcement. It is time \nto act to update our electronic communications privacy laws.\n  Finally, there is widespread consensus and real opportunity for \nbipartisan bicameral reform of our outdated visa system for \neconomically essential high-skilled immigrants. For too long our \ncountry has been unable to meet the ever-increasing demand for workers \ntrained in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics or \nSTEM fields.\n\n  As a result, some of our Nation's top technology markets are in \ndesperate need for qualified STEM workers. We face a high-skilled \nworker shortage that has become a national crisis. In April, for the \nsecond year in a row, the Federal Government reached its current H-1B \nquota just 5 days after it began accepting applications.\n  Employers submitted 172,500 petitions for just 85,000 available \nvisas, meaning American companies were unable to hire nearly 90,000 \nhigh-skilled workers essential to help grow their domestic businesses, \ndevelop innovative technologies at home rather than abroad, and compete \ninternationally. This is one of the principal reasons why I, together \nwith Senators Amy Klobuchar, Marco Rubio, and Chris Coons, introduced \nthe bipartisan Immigration Innovation or I-Squared Act.\n  To date the legislation has 26 bipartisan cosponsors. Among other \nthings, the I-Squared Act provides a thoughtful, lasting legislative \nframework that would increase the number of H-1 visas based on annual \nmarket demand to attract highly skilled workers and innovators. The \nbill also reforms fees on H-1B visas and employment-based green cards \nfor funding a grant-based State program to promote STEM education and \nworker retraining.\n  The I-Squared Act addresses the immediate short-term needs to provide \nAmerican employees with greater access to high-skilled workers, while \nalso addressing long-term needs to invest in America's STEM education. \nI am confident this two-step approach will enable our country to thrive \nand help us compete in today's global economy. No doubt, a concrete \nlegislative victory, when there is already considerable consensus, \nwould help build trust and good will among those who disagree sharply \nover other areas of immigration policy. It would mark a critical first \nstep along the path to broader reform.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues in introducing I-\nSquared early next year. As Senators can see, there is a lot we can \nagree on and much we can and must accomplish. Looking ahead to the next \nCongress, I intend to do everything in my power to enact protechnology, \npro-innovation policies that will ensure the continued success of our \nhigh-tech economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6126-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6126-S6130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MARKETPLACE FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to voice my continued support for \nthe enactment of the Marketplace Fairness Act this year. There have \nbeen a number of editorials and letters and emails and other messages \nlately that have left out part of the story and have some of the other \nparts of the story wrong. I am not sure the people behind these \nmessages have read the bill.\n  Last year the Senate passed this bill with a strong bipartisan vote \nof 69 Members. I believe that now is the time to get this issue done. I \nhave been working on this sales tax fairness issue since joining the \nSenate in 1997, because as a former State legislator, mayor and small \nbusiness owner, I believe it is important to level the playing field \nfor all retailers--in-store, catalog, and online--so an outdated rule \nfor sales tax collection does not adversely impact small business and \nMain Street retailers.\n  In the last century, the Supreme Court challenged us to solve this \nproblem. We have been working on it. Thanks to a suggestion by Senator \nAlexander, we made this bill a States rights bill. The States passed \nlaws a long time ago that required the collection of sales tax. And \nthose laws say that if the tax is not collected by the retailer out of \nState, it has to be paid directly by the purchaser in state. Most \npeople do not even know about that requirement, but I do understand in \nWyoming we collect about $1.5 million from people voluntarily realizing \nthe law and complying with it.\n  But that is a minority of people. Right now, thousands of local \nbusinesses are forced to do business at a competitive disadvantage \nbecause they have to collect sales and use taxes and remote sellers do \nnot, which in some States can mean that 5 to 10 percent advantage.\n  I recently talked with a fellow who had a camera store. A person came \nin. He was interested in this $2,000 camera and accessories. So of \ncourse the store owner helped him to figure it all out and gave him \ninstructions on the camera. Then the guy pulled out his smart phone and \nclicks on the bar code of the camera and said he could get it cheaper. \nOf course the owner of the store wondered how much cheaper. It happened \nto be exactly the amount of sales tax. The small business owner lost \nthe sale.\n  I am willing to bet that if the person has a problem with the camera, \nhe is going to come back to that store and ask for help with it. Those \npeople who have those small businesses hire locally. It is actually \npeople from the community who are earning money they spend in the same \ncommunity. They are paying property tax. I would be willing to bet that \nnone of the online companies, unless they are local, are participating \nin the community the way those businesses are.\n  Of course, additionally, sales taxes go directly to State and local \ngovernments, which brings in the needed revenue for maintaining our \nschools, fixing our roads, supporting local law enforcement, fire \ndepartments, and emergency management crews. An interesting part of \nthat is the smaller the town, the more important that is.\n  In Wyoming the smaller towns rely on their sales tax to provide \npolice protection and fire protection. People in small towns in Wyoming \nare sometimes surprised to find out that sales taxes support these \nservices, but realize then that they ought to be paying this sales tax. \nThe smaller the town, the bigger the impact.\n  If Congress fails to let States collect taxes on remote sales this \nyear, we are implicitly blessing a situation where States will be \nforced to maybe raise other taxes, such as income or property taxes, to \noffset the growing loss of sales tax revenue. Do we want this to \nhappen?\n  There is another side to this too; that is, that some of the people, \nsome of the Governors and legislatures have said: If that passes, we \nwill reduce another tax because sales tax is a more constant flow of \ndollars that we can rely on more than virtually anything else we do.\n  So now is the time for Congress to complete action on this issue by \nenacting the Marketplace Fairness Act this year. Today I want to spend \na few minutes debunking some of the myths and allegations that have \nbeen raised against the bill. First, some opponents argue the bill is \nunfairly burdensome to online retailers by forcing them to comply with \nthe various sales tax rates across the country.\n  In response, I would first note that the Marketplace Fairness Act \nincludes a small seller exemption. It is set at $1 million in remote \nsales each year. Until they pass that $1 million mark in a given year, \nstates cannot make them comply with sales tax laws. If they do pass the \nmillion-dollar mark, then the Marketplace Fairness Act requires that \nthe State provide the sellers with software, free of charge, that can \ncalculate the sales and use tax due on each transaction at the time the \ntransaction is completed. It would also file the sales and use tax \nreturns and be updated to reflect any rate changes.\n  So all they have to know, to be able to do is, is the purchaser's ZIP \nCode. They are going to have to know the ZIP Code if they are sending \nsomething\n\n[[Page S6127]]\n\nsomewhere. So it is not that complicated a process. Incidentally, some \nof the online companies opposing this bill sell the very same program. \nThey make it available to a number of providers. So it is already being \nused by retailers across the country to accurately collect and remit \nState and local sales and use taxes.\n  In addition, opponents of the Marketplace Fairness Act argue that our \nbill violates States rights by setting tax rates. In fact, our bill \ndoes not change State law. It does not require States to do anything. \nThe bill does not create new taxes or increase existing taxes. It \nsimply gives the States the ability to collect the taxes owed, to \nenforce their own sales and use tax laws.\n  Our bill is a States rights bill, which is why the National Governors \nAssociation, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the National League of Cities \nsupport the bill. Wyoming passed a law in 1934. It says: If someone \nbuys something out of State and they do not pay sales tax on it, by the \nend of the month they have to fill out a form which they have and \nsubmit the money. Our bill makes it easier for Wyomingites to comply \nwith this law. Most people don't realize this, but it is much easier if \nthe person who collects the sales tax is the one who sells the item.\n\n  Opponents of the Marketplace Fairness Act also suggest it benefits \nbig business at the expense of small online retailers. Remember I \nmentioned that $1 million exemption if a business sells less than $1 \nmillion online? They are not subject to this bill. That is to give \nsmall businesses a chance to grow into big businesses--and we do hope \nthey do pass that $1 million threshold. In fact a $2 million threshold \nwould be fine with me.\n  But the exemption already protects small businesses. Last year a \nSmall Business Administration study determined that the small seller \nexemption included in the Marketplace Fairness Act would exempt 99.96 \npercent of all sellers from the bill's requirements. So it is just the \nbig ones that fall into this bill.\n  Opponents of marketplace fairness suggest it creates a massive new \ntax requirement. The truth is the bill that passed the Senate with an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote of more than two-thirds of the Senate last \nyear does not create any new taxes.\n  Consumers already owe the sales and use taxes on the goods they \npurchase if they reside in a State that has a sales tax--whether those \npurchases are made over the phone, by mail or by the Internet. \nUnfortunately, as I mentioned, most consumers are unaware that they are \nrequired to pay the tax when the retailer does not collect it at the \ntime of the purchase.\n  Marketplace fairness provides States the authority to reduce the \nburden of self-reporting from consumers and allow States to enforce the \nexisting State and local sales and use tax laws, and it eliminates the \ncompetitive disadvantage for the small retailers in the State. It is an \nadvantage that is currently enjoyed by the remote retailers at the \nexpense of those small businesses.\n  Additionally, the Marketplace Fairness Act does not tax Internet use. \nI repeat that it does not tax Internet use. It doesn't even tax \nInternet services. For many years I have worked with all the interested \nparties to find a mutually agreeable legislative package to enact this \nbill.\n  This Congress, I've worked with Senator Durbin, Senator Alexander, \nwho as I mentioned inserted the States rights approach to this issue \nthat reduced the bill from about 35 pages down to about 9 pages, and \nSenator Heitkamp, who has been involved in the court case as all of \nthese e-fairness challenges have progressed.\n  When the Supreme Court heard this challenge and realized there are \nsome other things coming along that could greatly distress States if \nthey don't take some action because of what the courts could do, I \nworked together with the three colleagues I mentioned and 26 of our \nSenate colleagues to produce a bipartisan bill that helps sellers, \nStates, and local governments to simplify sales and use tax collection \nand administration.\n  We are working with our House supporters, including House of \nRepresentative Members Steve Womack, Jackie Speier, Peter Welch, and \nJohn Conyers, and have found common ground on this important issue that \nis supported by more than 200 groups. I publicly commend all of my \nSenate and House colleagues in taking a leadership role in working on \nthis important policy issue.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the goals of States \nrights and a level playing field for all businesses--making sure the \nrevenue that is owed particularly for small towns makes it to the small \ntowns--by pushing for the enactment of the Marketplace Fairness Act \nthis year.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague, Senator Alexander, who has done \nan outstanding job on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Enzi has been a leading proponent of the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. I congratulate him for his persistence in \nrecognizing its importance.\n  I will make three points in support of what he said: No. 1, why \nconservatives support it; No. 2, why it is easy to do; that is, to \ncomply with it; and No. 3 is to ask the basic question, which is: Do \nyou trust Washington or do you trust your Governor and your State \nlegislature to decide what your State taxes ought to be? Do you trust \nWashington or do you trust people closer to home?\n  I will begin with why conservatives support it. If I were to ask the \nquestion, what do the following people have in common, and the \nfollowing people would be Al Cardenas, the most recent chairman of the \nAmerican Conservative Union; the late William F. Buckley; Art Laffer, \nwho is President Reagan's favorite economist; Governor Mike Pence, the \nconservative Governor of Indiana; Governor Gary Herbert; Governor \nRobert Bentley; former Governor Mitch Daniels; and former Governor Jeb \nBush, you might say: What do they have in common?\n  Well, they are Republicans; that is right. They are conservatives; \nthat is true. But the other thing we could say is they all support the \nMarketplace Fairness Act or the principles that underlie it.\n  Why is that? Because the Marketplace Fairness Act is a 12-page bill \nabout two words, which are States' rights. If I am the Governor of \nTennessee--which I once was--and I am sitting down there thinking: \nWell, we have a State sales tax in Tennessee such as almost every State \nhas, and the way we collect it is this--let's say I am in my home town \nof Marysville, TN, and I want to buy a television set. I can go \ndowntown to buy it from one of my local stores. They collect the State \nsales tax, which in our State, including State and local taxes, is \nnearly 10 percent. They send it to the State.\n  If I go online or into a catalog and order the same television set, \nthe seller does not collect it. This bill is about allowing the State \nof Tennessee to decide whether it wants to require the out-of-state \nsellers to do the same thing that instate sellers do, whether it wants \nto prefer some distant seller over the local man and woman on Main \nStreet, the mom-and-pop stores. That is the decision.\n  Whatever decision they would make, the question is this. Do you think \nwe should be deciding that for Tennessee? Our Governor doesn't think \nso, our Lieutenant Governor doesn't think so, our legislature doesn't \nthink so. They don't trust Washington to make the decision. They trust \nthemselves to make that decision.\n  Ohio doesn't think so. Ohio has already taken a look at this subject \nand said: We would prefer to collect our sales tax from everybody who \nowes it. Rather than have everybody in Ohio fill out a form every time \nthey go online to order from a catalog, Ohio wants to require the out-\nof-State sellers do the same thing in-State sellers do, and that is to \ncollect the tax when they sell it. Ohio has said if they do that, they \nwill lower taxes.\n  Ohio has already passed a law and says if Congress passes the \nMarketplace Fairness Act taxes in Ohio will go down.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord following my remarks a list of conservatives and Republican \nGovernors who support e-fairness and why they do so.\n  The other point is how complicated is this for somebody who might \nsell online? Well, as Senator Enzi said, it exempts 99 percent of all \nout-of-state\n\n[[Page S6128]]\n\nsellers. So if you are selling on eBay today and you are worried about \nthis bill, the chances are 99 out of 100 it is not you this bill \naffects because it has a $1 million exemption.\n  But even if it did affect you, how hard would it be to comply with \nthe requirements. It must not be too hard because you could also go on \neBay, I am assured, and you can purchase software from eBay that costs \n$15 or $20 and it will do the work for you. In other words, if you are \nselling something online and you are selling it to Maryville, TN, they \nwill put the zip code in and tell you the tax. You can collect it and \nremit it to the State government. It is about as easy as what I do \nevery morning.\n\n  I go to my computer, I type in ``Google,'' put my zip code in, and I \nput ``weather.'' I want to know it is 24 degrees in Washington, DC, \nthis morning. It tells me in an instant.\n  If you are selling online--unless you are selling more than $1 \nmillion in out of state sales it doesn't affect you at all. If you need \nsome help to figure that out, you can get software that figures out the \ntax for you.\n  But remember, all we are asking--we are not even saying that we think \nif you sell online or if you sell by catalog that you ought to be made \nto collect the tax when you sell. We are just saying we think States \nshould make the decision about their own tax policy which is consistent \nwith the 10th Amendment to our Constitution.\n  That leads me to my last point. The real issue here is two words. You \ncan make a lot of good conservative reasons why this bill attracted \nhalf the support of Republicans and passed with 69 votes when it was \nconsidered by the Senate, and why it has so much support from Governors \nand mayors of all political persuasions across the country. But the \nbottom line is all we proposed to do is to let States make decisions \nabout their own tax policy.\n  The Supreme Court more than 20 years ago said it was too complicated \nto require businesses to collect, but they invited Congress to create a \nway that was simple enough to do that. Twenty years has gone by, \nsoftware is already available, the Internet is advanced, and so today \nit is very easy to do.\n  There is no reason in the world for Senators to say: You know, I just \nflew from Nashville today. It took me an hour. That makes me a lot \nsmarter than the Governor of Tennessee, so I am going to decide for \nTennessee whether it can collect all the taxes that are already owed. I \nam going to say I am going to let the Governor of Tennessee make that \ndecision. If I were the Governor of Tennessee, I would collect it, and \nI might lower the taxes for everybody. I don't think it is fair to say \nto shopkeepers in Maryville, TN, that you have to collect the tax and \nsend it to the State, but to say to some seller in Illinois or some \ncatalog seller in North Dakota that you don't have to collect the tax, \nbecause that means our local businesses are being dealt with in an \nunfair way.\n  I also don't think Tennesseans appreciate what will happen if we \ndon't act, because do you know what is going to happen? The Governor is \ngoing to collect the sales tax. How is he going to do it? Well, he is \ngoing to have to start auditing everybody.\n  If you buy online--which everybody almost does today; just think of \nthe Christmas season coming up--you would have to write down every \nsingle thing you bought. You would have to put the tax down, and you \nwould have to send it in--that is the law. That is a very difficult \nthing to do and most people don't do it.\n  So the easy way to do this and the right way to do this is for \nCongress to pass the Marketplace Fairness Act, which is a 12-page bill \nabout two words--States rights--and say to Tennessee, Wisconsin or \nWyoming, of course you should make your own decision about how to \ncollect your taxes. Let them decide, as Ohio decided. They will collect \nthe State sales tax which is already owed from everybody who owes it. \nThe collectors of the tax will be anyone who sells into Ohio or \nTennessee or Wisconsin or Wyoming.\n  That is the fair thing to do. That is the right thing to do. That is \nwhat respects our constitutional federalism and the 10th Amendment to \nthe Constitution. It shows that we in Washington, DC, aren't so \narrogant to think that we should make those state tax decisions.\n  I conclude by saying I just had the pleasure of going through a \nreelection campaign. A lot of Members, about one-third of the body, \nwere in an election this year. I was trying to remember this morning if \none single person came up to me in the past 2 years and said: I just \nwish you would give Washington more control over how Tennessee collects \nits taxes.\n  I don't think one single person said that to me. But I will guarantee \nthat about every other person said to me: I wish you would stop \nWashington from telling us to do things or decide things that we should \nbe deciding for ourselves.\n  That is what this bill is about. This bill empowers every State to \nmake its own decision about how to collect its taxes--to do what Ohio \ndid, to do what other Governors have said. We are going to collect it \nfrom everybody who already owes it and, when we do, we are going to \nlower everyone's taxes. That would be a very happy result.\n  We have 2 or 3 weeks left in the session. This Senate has fully \nconsidered this. The bill is in the House of Representatives. I very \nmuch hope that the Speaker and the Members of the House will decide \nthat it is time to pass the Marketplace Fairness Act and recognize the \nprinciple of States rights in the spirit of the 10th Amendment of our \nConstitution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Conservatives & Republican Governors Support E-Fairness\n\n       William F. Buckley, Editor At Large, National Review: ``The \n     mattress maker in Connecticut is willing to compete with the \n     company in Massachusetts, but does not like it if out-of-\n     state businesses are, in practical terms, subsidized; that's \n     what the non-tax amounts to. Local concerns are complaining \n     about traffic in mattresses and books and records and \n     computer equipment which, ordered through the Internet, come \n     in, so to speak, duty free.'' (William F. Buckley, ``Get That \n     Internet Tax Right,'' National Review Online, 10/19/01)\n       Arthur B. Laffer, Wall Street Journal: ``In-state retailers \n     collect sales taxes at the time of purchase. When residents \n     purchase from retailers out of state (including over the \n     Internet) they are supposed to report these purchases and pay \n     the sales taxes owed--which are typically referred to as a \n     ``use tax.'' As you can imagine, few people do. The result is \n     to narrow a state's sales-tax base. It also leads to several \n     inefficiencies that, on net, diminish potential job and \n     economic growth. Exempting Internet purchases from the sales \n     tax naturally encourages consumers to buy goods over the Web; \n     worse, the exemption incentivizes consumers to use in-state \n     retailers as a showroom before they do so. This increases in-\n     state retailers' overall costs and reduces their overall \n     productivity.'' (Arthur B. Laffer, ``Tax Internet Sales, \n     Stimulate Growth,'' The Wall Street Journal, 4/17/13)\n       Al Cardenas, former Chairman of the American Conservative \n     Union (ACU): ``When it comes to sales tax, it is time to \n     address the area where prejudice is most egregious--our \n     policy towards Internet sales. At issue is the federal \n     government exempting some Internet transactions from sales \n     taxes while requiring the remittance of sales taxes for \n     identical sales made at brick and mortar locations. It is an \n     outdated set of policies in today's super information age, \n     when families every day make decisions to purchase goods and \n     services online or in person. Moreover, it's unfair, punitive \n     to some small businesses and corporations and a boon for \n     others.'' (Al Cardenas, ``The Chief Threat To American \n     Competitiveness: Our Tax Code,'' National Review Online, 11/\n     8/11)\n       Charles Krauthammer: ``The real issue here is the fairness \n     argument--that if you're an old fashioned store, you have to \n     have your customers and you pay the sales tax and online you \n     don't. Which, I mean, you're already at a disadvantage if \n     you're an old fashioned store: you have to have, you have to \n     cover rent, you have to cover insurance and all that. So I \n     think you want to have something that will level the playing \n     field. You can do it one of two ways. You abolish all sales \n     taxes for real stores and nobody pays. Or you get the \n     Internet people to pay the sales tax as well. I think the \n     second one is the only way to do it, obviously.''

Madam President, today marks the 510th day as so well \nrepresented on the poster the Senator from California had on display. \nThat is how long it has been since we passed an immigration reform \nbill--comprehensive immigration reform. The House of Representatives \nsimply has refused to address this issue. They have refused to address \nthe fact that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be \nfixed. All the Speaker would have to do is bring this up for a vote and \nit would pass. The bill that passed here 510 days ago would pass the \nHouse overwhelmingly. But he refuses to bring it up.\n  In this bill we passed 73 weeks ago, we were able to pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform because Senate Democrats and \nRepublicans recognized that our immigration laws are failing the \nAmerican people. We sent that same bipartisan bill to the House 17 \nmonths ago. For the last 17 months, the House Republicans, led by a \nsmall, vocal, really radical group, has forced the Speaker, I assume, \nnot to do anything. They have neglected to tackle the real issues \naffecting our immigration system.\n  We have talked about 510 days, we have talked about 73 weeks, and we \nhave talked about 17 months. That is enough time for them to consider \nthe bill the Senate considered and passed in just a few weeks, but they \nstill refuse to do anything, even as families across the country have \nbeen ripped apart.\n  I have been present at meetings, meetings--I remember one of the last \nat the White House--where the Republican leaders of the House and \nSenate have said: Give us some time, give us some time. We have given \nthem time--510 days, to be exact. And they are always saying: Let's do \nsomething. Well, something is not enough, they need to do comprehensive \nimmigration reform, and they refuse to do that.\n  So in light of the fact that families are being ripped apart--and \nthere is no question they are. The first time I saw this, where I \nreally felt it in my heart, Bill Richardson, with whom I served in the \nHouse--he was Secretary of Energy and Ambassador to the United \nNations--he came to Las Vegas, and he said: Let's go out to the Rafael \nRivera Center. It was, at the time, a new place, named after the first \nnon-Indian to see the Las Vegas valley--Rafael Rivera. I have a \npainting in my office that reflects that. So we went to that center, \nand I can remember so clearly these mostly women crying over the fact \nthat their husbands had lost their jobs, they were being deported, and \nthey had little American boys and girls there with them. These were \nboys and girls who had been born in the United States. I thought, gee, \nthat is terrible. I mean the suffering and the sadness. I have never \nforgotten that, and that is one of the main reasons I have worked so \nhard on immigration reform.\n  In light of the Republicans' inaction, and our action and our \nadvocacy of this issue, it seems to me what the President said at his \nState of the Union Address is really applicable here. Here is what he \nsaid: If the Republicans continue to do nothing, I am going to be \nforced as the President of the United States to do something by \nExecutive order. And I am glad. I am glad he is going, in the next \ncouple of days for sure, to use his constitutionally established \nauthority to fix as much of our broken immigration system as is \npossible. He told everybody he was going to do it in his State of the \nUnion and he has waited and waited and nothing has happened.\n  Some Republicans are threatening to shut down the government. They \nhave done it once before, so I guess we should take their threat \nseriously. They want to shut down the government because of what the \nPresident said he is going to do and what he is going to do. But this \nisn't about the Republicans and President Obama, this is about where \nthe Republicans stand with the immigrant community.\n  My father-in-law, my wife's dad, was an immigrant. He was born in \nRussia. He came to the United States to escape the oppression in \nRussia. So this whole issue is about how Republicans stand with the \nimmigrant community.\n  The immigrant community is what has made this country what it is. \nThose who will come forward under this Executive action the President \nis going to take are, with rare exception, hard-working immigrant dads \nand moms who are supporting their families. They came to America for \nthe same reasons early immigrants came to America, just like my father-\nin-law, Earl Gould, did. By the way, he changed his name when he came \nto the United States. He came here as Israel Goldfarb, and he changed \nhis name, as many immigrants have done.\n  As my father-in-law did, the people who are going to come here under \nthis Executive order can build a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies. They have deep ties in America. They work hard. As I have \nindicated, they have spouses and children. Under our broken immigration \nsystem, there is no line for these people to get into, no process for \nthem to sign up for, and no way to remedy this situation. They are in \nlimbo. They are in the shadows. They are in darkness.\n\n  President Obama, fortunately, is going to do something to give them \njust that, a line to come forward, a line that he recognizes must be \ndone to get the system started.\n  We can't give these people their green cards and put them on the path \nto citizenship immediately. Only Congress can and must finish the job \nin overhauling and rewriting these laws. I want to be clear that \nExecutive action is important, but it is not a substitute for \nlegislation, and the Speaker should understand that.\n  Yes, we passed a bill. The President will be happy to sign such a \nbill. But because Republicans have refused to legislate, President \nObama is taking what steps he can to keep these families together and \nenforce the laws. The President is acting within his legal authority to \nuse his Executive power to improve the immigration system.\n  Did he just dream this up one night meeting with his staff? Did \nsomeone suddenly come to him and say, I have a great idea. Why don't we \ntry to do something different? He is going to do something that has \nbeen tried 39 times since Dwight Eisenhower was President. Virtually \nevery President since Eisenhower was President has done Executive \nactions as relates to immigration.\n  I would also say to my Republican friends who are always talking \nabout, boy, we have to do something important financially for the good \nof this country, why not pass this bill? It would benefit our country \nto the tune of $1 trillion.\n  I strongly support the steps the President is going to take. I \nsupport him, and I hope he does it as soon as possible, because his \nExecutive action will help keep families together and focus law \nenforcement resources on real criminals.\n  We have waited a long time for House Republicans. Since they won't \nact, the President will, and he should act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to remind my colleagues that \nit has been over 500 days since the Senate passed a strong bipartisan \nbill to fix our broken immigration system.\n  There is a lot of hand-wringing going on on the other side of the \naisle about the President taking Executive action, as he has now \nannounced he intends to do. Republicans are saying that anything and \neverything is on the table to stop the President from taking Executive \naction. Well, if the bounds are anything and everything, I have a \nsuggestion. Pass our bill. It is a very simple suggestion.\n  If the House votes on our bipartisan bill, the discussion about \nExecutive action would be made moot. It is the other body of Congress \nthat has led us to the point where we are today. The only reason the \nadministration has to take Executive action is because the\n\n[[Page S6131]]\n\nHouse has failed to address our broken immigration system. I think \neveryone on our side agrees it would be far preferable to pass the \nbipartisan bill that passed the Senate 68 to 32 than any Executive \naction.\n  Let me say a few things. The bill is a bipartisan bill with support \nfrom every corner of the political map--business, labor, evangelicals, \nCatholics--and it has been sitting on the shelf gathering dust for 500 \ndays. So it is the absolute height of hypocrisy for House leadership to \nsay that now Congress should be in the driver's seat on immigration \nreform when they refused to take the wheel.\n  And let me say this, Mr. President. I don't think anyone has any \nfaith that if they were given another 3 months or 6 months or 9 months \nthat they would come to any kind of real bill. They can't. They have \nthe tea party. Such a high percentage of their primary voters strongly \nargue against doing a bill. In fact, many of those tea party types are \nsaying shut down the government.\n  The dithering and dawdling on the House side is particularly \nperplexing because our bill would achieve so many goals the Republicans \nclaim are part of their agenda. It would secure the border, create \njobs, add economic growth, and cut the deficit.\n  The bipartisan bill that passed the Senate provides more than $40 \nbillion to secure our border. This would mean more than doubling the \nBorder Patrol presence on our Southwest border, completing the border \nfence, setting up much more surveillance technology--sensors, drones, \nmany of which are so good they can detect--these are the drones that \nsurveil, not shoot--they can detect the difference when a deer or a \nperson crosses the border. They are not on the border now.\n  Yes, the border needs help. Blocking our bill, not passing our bill, \nkeeps the status quo, which nobody likes. Passing our bill solves the \nproblem. With a Republican amendment authored by the Senator from \nTennessee, Senator Corker, and the Senator from North Dakota, Senator \nHoeven, that tightens up the border tougher than it has ever been.\n  The bipartisan bill also strengthens interior enforcement of our \nimmigration laws. So many of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle keep saying E-Verify, E-Verify, E-Verify. Well, it is in the bill \nto crack down on unscrupulous employers requiring an entry-exit \ntracking system at our airports and seaports to catch people who \noverstay their visas, and reforming and clarifying the list of violent \ncrimes that make an immigrant deportable so law enforcement officials \nhave the tools they need to keep us safe.\n  For America to remain competitive, we must have a legal immigration \nsystem that works. Right now we have it backwards. We turn away people \nwho would create jobs. Our bipartisan bill will change all that for \nfarm workers, tech firms, entrepreneurs, and so many more, while \nleveling the playing field for American workers. Because of internal \nenforcement, when someone crosses the border and doesn't have a real \njob available and has no family connection, they can't stay. They won't \nget a job.\n  Many of our labor friends are for this bill. The construction trades, \nwhich probably suffer more from illegal immigration than any other, are \nstrongly for our bill. The bill clears the employment and visa backlogs \nso American businesses can have access to the workers they need and \ntheir families will be united, decreases family wait times at our \nbridges and ports of entry. It is great for the tourism industry, \nmaking it easier for foreign travelers to spend their dollars here \ninstead of somewhere else and, finally, a tough but fair pathway to \ncitizenship.\n  The other side says it is amnesty. They are listening to Rush \nLimbaugh--amnesty, amnesty, amnesty. Amnesty means you get away with it \nwithout paying a price. Here is the price someone has to pay if they \ncross the border illegally: No. 1, they have to pay all their back \ntaxes; No. 2, they have to keep working; No. 3, they have to admit \nwrongdoing; No. 4, they have to pay a fine; No. 5, they have to learn \nEnglish; No. 6, they have to go to the back of the line, which is what \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle have always asked for.\n  This system was set up by none other than Marco Rubio in our Gang of \n8, and it says: If somebody crossed the border illegally in 2008, but \nsomeone else has waited patiently at the Embassy since 2007, the 2007 \nperson gets to come into this country before the 2008 person.\n  Because of all this, here is what the bill does:\n  First, it would grow the economy by 3.3 percent over the next 10 \nyears and 5.5 percent over 20. No Republican tax cut, no Democratic \nspending program would have that effect--and without any cost to the \ndeficit. In fact, at the same time we are growing our economy with this \nproposal--this is CBO, not Chuck Schumer--we reduce the deficit by $150 \nbillion in the next 10 years and $900 billion over the next 20 years. \nSo $1 trillion in savings, as we benefit America.\n  The bill has unprecedented support: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nguardian of business interests; the AFL-CIO, the protector of American \nworkers; the faith community, evangelicals, Protestants, Mormons. The \nliberal and conservative religious sectors in America are for our bill, \nAmerica's farmers, growers, and American farmworkers, law enforcement, \nthe immigrant rights community.\n  So the historic coalition came together because again this bill \nstrengthens our borders and national security, provides an enormous \nboost for the American economy, fairly and conclusively addresses the \nstatus of people here illegally, and prevents future waves of illegal \nimmigrants.\n  When we got this bill passed we were almost certain the House would \npass it. It is a conservative bill, and try and try and try as they \nmight, they couldn't. So now we are up to the last hours of this \nCongress and there is one more chance. Just put the bill on the floor, \nSpeaker Boehner. You don't have to twist a single arm. It has the votes \nto pass. It will do America so much good.\n  I love America. I want to see us stay No. 1 in every way and \neconomically above all. This bill will do it more than anything else we \ncould do.\n  I would say to my colleagues, don't be afraid of the Tea Party. They \nare afraid of the word ``amnesty,'' even though the bill is not amnesty \nat all as I mentioned. But Rush Limbaugh says ``amnesty'' incessantly, \nand I know my Republican colleagues--I am a political guy in some \nways--they are afraid primary voters that skew far right believe it is \namnesty. The Tea Party may be a sliver of the American public, but they \nare a huge percentage of primary voters in too many Republican \ndistricts and that is what they are afraid of. Talk about courage. Talk \nabout loving the country. Talk about doing the right thing. We have to \npass the bill.\n  The real Republican Party position on immigration is pretend to be \npro-immigration reform rhetorically but never allow immigration reform \nto come to a vote. That is the bad news.\n  The good news is there is still time to fix it. So I urge my \ncolleagues, avoid this conundrum, avoid your dilemma that you will \ncreate. Pass the bill, and we will not even have to debate Executive \naction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about \none of the most important issues facing our Nation as we have been \nhearing for the past 15 minutes; that is, our longstanding, desperate \nneed to finally fix our Nation's broken immigration system.\n  Too often in the debate about immigration it is difficult for some \npeople to understand that the millions of undocumented families in our \ncountry are already an important part of our communities. Immigrants \nwork hard and they pay their taxes, they send their children to \nAmerican schools, and they make up a critical part of the fabric of our \nsociety. They are Americans in all but name.\n  So when we talk about immigration reform, we are not talking about \nsome vague philosophical issue. This is an issue that impacts families, \nit impacts our businesses, it impacts our national security, and it \nimpacts what we stand for as Americans.\n  It is not a new issue either. It is something we have been debating \nand arguing about for more than a decade, but it is something we have \nnever been able to tackle, and that is not for the lack of trying.\n\n[[Page S6132]]\n\n  As everyone here remembers, more than 500 days ago now the Senate did \nsomething remarkable. Members from different backgrounds and different \nStates and different parties came together to reach an agreement, and \nin the Senate we passed a real bipartisan coalition of 68 Republicans \nand Democrats, a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would \nfinally start to fix our broken immigration system.\n  As we heard from the Senator from New York, it would improve our \nsecurity, provide businesses with the certainty they need, and provide \na real path to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants \nwho are forced to live in the shadows.\n  Not only was this bill a step toward fixing our broken immigration \nsystem, it was good for our economy. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimated that the Senate bill would reduce the deficit by nearly $1 \ntrillion over the next two decades.\n  So we sent the bill to the House of Representatives knowing the path \nforward there might not be easy, but we heard from Members of the House \non both sides of the aisle that they also knew immigration reform had \nto happen this Congress.\n  Back then, in June of 2013, we knew we had time on our side. Speaker \nBoehner had a full year and a half to do one simple thing, bring the \nbipartisan Senate bill up for a vote. We knew then what we still know \ntoday; that if the Speaker brought that bill up for a vote, it would \npass with bipartisan support and become law.\n  But instead of doing that, the Speaker sided with the Tea Party and \nrefused to move our country forward. He has made it very clear that the \nHouse will refuse to act this Congress and ignore the historic \nopportunity we have.\n  For years and years millions of immigrant families who have played by \nthe rules--paid their taxes, raised their children in the United \nStates--have waited and waited for action. They have organized, they \nhave hoped and they have prayed and they have trusted the system would \neventually work. The system has failed. So now it is time to act.\n  President Obama has made it clear that because the House refuses to \nact--because the House refuses to act--he will take administrative \naction before the end of the year to improve our immigration system, \nand I support his decision to do that.\n  The President's authority to take action is well established. In \nfact, every President since Eisenhower, including Presidents Reagan and \nGeorge H.W. Bush, has used his authority to improve the administration \nof our immigration system and to focus enforcement resources on serious \ncriminals rather than on hard-working immigrants with deep roots in our \ncommunities.\n  When the President does act, I have encouraged him to do several \nthings: expand the already successful implementation of deferred action \nfor DREAMers to include people with strong ties to the United States \nwho have not committed serious crimes; to change implementation of our \nlaws to make immigration and border enforcement humane, \nnondiscriminatory, and respectful of due process; and, finally, I have \nasked the President to improve the legal immigration system to keep \nimmigrant families together, to protect our workers, and to provide \nemployers--from agricultural producers to high-tech firms--certainty in \na system that has often left them without answers.\n  But I also want to be very clear that administrative action is not a \nlong-term solution. Plain and simple, the only way for us to \npermanently and effectively fix our broken immigration laws is through \ncomprehensive immigration reform legislation. Administrative action is \na bandaid, but it is better than nothing, and nothing is what the House \nRepublicans are offering.\n  So I also wish to say it has been deeply disappointing to hear that \nsome of my Republican colleagues are now threatening to shut down the \ngovernment just to keep families from getting some initial relief from \nthe pain our broken immigration system is causing. That is the latest \nexample of extreme Republicans creating uncertainty and threatening to \nhurt our economy if they don't get their way, and it is the exact \nopposite of the approach Congress needs to take going forward.\n  We all know what happens when Tea Party Republicans go down this \nroad. We saw it just last year when we had a 16-day government shutdown \nthat brought the day-to-day workings of the government and businesses \nacross the country to a screeching halt. That shutdown, we all know, \nwas bad for our economy. It hit workers' paychecks, it made families \nacross our country question whether their elected officials could get \nanything done at all. It was all because of a failed Tea Party \npolitical effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act for the umpteenth \ntime.\n  Look. Even children understand that flipping the table over doesn't \nhelp win the game. It just means someone has to pick up the mess they \njust made. When it comes to Tea Party political tactics, we have seen \nmore than enough of that in this Congress.\n  As we all remember, the budget deal I reached with Chairman Ryan \nwasn't perfect--I know Chairman Ryan would say the same thing--but it \nwas an important step away from brinkmanship and toward bipartisanship \non the budget.\n  In the next week Republican leaders are going to have an important \nchoice to make. They can choose bipartisanship and continue to push the \nTea Party aside and work with Democrats on issues such as the budget \nand fixing our broken immigration system or they can go back to Tea \nParty-style governing by crisis, which hurts families and communities \nand our economy and will make it much more difficult to put in place \nthe lasting comprehensive immigration reform we need.\n  I urge them to take the bipartisan path. I am ready and willing to \nwork with them if they do, and I know my Democratic colleagues are as \nwell. I know our country will be stronger for it now and for decades to \ncome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington for \nher strong statement. It makes so much sense.\n  We have this poster here, ``510 Days.'' That is how long ago the \nSenate passed the bipartisan immigration bill that Senator Murray \ntalked about and Senator Schumer talked about. That is 17 months; 510 \ndays is 17 months.\n  So here is the deal. The Republicans in the House refuse to take up \nthe Senate bill, which strengthens the border while giving a pathway of \nlegality to hard-working immigrants here who are undocumented.\n  It is pretty simple but comprehensive--common sense. Here is the \nthing: They will not take up the bill. So then we say: What is your \nidea? Where is your bill? They don't have one.\n  So then President Obama, knowing we have 11 million undocumented \nimmigrants living in America, realizes he can't let this matter go on. \nHe has waited 100 days, 200 days, 300 days, 400 days, 500 days. The \ncountry has waited for 17 months.\n  So the President is going to do what Presidents are supposed to do, \nwhich is look at a problem that is hurting the country and do his best \nto fix it. The President has said to the House he would be thrilled to \nsign the bipartisan immigration bill the Senate passed. Take it up and \npass it.\n  Oh, no. Do you know what their answer is? To verbally threaten the \nPresident and, frankly, the American people by such comments as--this \nis one that I heard the Republican leader Mitch McConnell say: If he \ndoes this, if he takes this action, if he takes action on immigration, \nit would be like waving a red flag in front of a bull.\n  No, it wouldn't be. It would be a President who understands that \naction is needed. Guess what. Eleven other Presidents, Republican and \nDemocrat, have taken Executive action on immigration. I never in all my \nyears ever heard one Republican take to task any of those other \nPresidents, and I will give you the list of who they are: Presidents \nEisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, George Bush, \nSr., Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and President Obama used his \nauthority for the DREAMers.\n  The charts are being held up to show you how many actions have been \ntaken. We have these two charts here that show a lot of Executive \nactions by Presidents on immigration.\n  What is wrong with my Republican friends? Do they not know history or\n\n[[Page S6133]]\n\nare they just blindly attacking this President because they are annoyed \nthat he got reelected?\n  Step up to the plate, smell the roses, look at the reality. The \nreality is all these other Presidents have taken action. Look what the \nimmigration council says, the American Immigration Council said:\n\n       Past Republican presidents have not been shy to use the \n     White House's power to retool immigration policy. In fact, \n     Obama could learn a lot from Presidents Ronald Reagan's and \n     George H.W. Bush's Executive actions to preserve the unity of \n     immigrant families and move past congressional refusal to \n     enact immigration reform.\n\n  So, Earth to the Republicans: You refuse to take up the bipartisan \nSenate bill which strengthens our border while giving a legal path to \ncitizenship or legality to our undocumented, making sure that those who \ncommit crimes are deported. We look at what is happening in our ag \ncommunity and fix that. They won't do it.\n  So they are stamping their foot and saying what President Obama wants \nto do is unconstitutional. Excuse me, unconstitutional? Presidents \nReagan, Bush, Clinton, Eisenhower--I read the list. They never said \nthat before. They never said that before. Carter, Kennedy, Johnson, \nNixon, Ford, Clinton, Bush, Sr., Reagan, George W., and Obama. Now they \nsay to the President--and I don't have the exact quote. We heard a \ncomment from the Republican leader. What they are basically saying to \nthe President is, If you do your job, we are going to be mad. And what \nthe President has said to them is, Please do your job. If you do your \njob, I won't have to take Executive action. I would prefer to have this \nin legislation. And as Senator Murray has said, that is the preferable \nroad. But they either won't do it or they don't want to do it or they \nwant another confrontation with the President.\n  I think it was John Boehner, the Republican Speaker, who said if the \nPresident takes this Executive action, which as I have shown you many \nother Presidents have done, he will ``poison the well.'' He is telling \nthe President that if the President does his job--my words--as 11 \nPresidents have done, it will ``poison the well.''\n  And what are they going to do about it? Who knows. Are they going to \ntry to impeach the President or sue the President? I guess they have to \nimpeach 10 others.\n  And by the way, I wrote the President a letter and asked him to take \nExecutive action. In my view, it is absolutely necessary, because if \nyou follow the law, 11 million people could be deported--our neighbors, \nour friends, families would be split up.\n  I thought Republicans were the party of family values. Family \nvalues--I have been lectured on family values. Somehow if one supports \na woman's right to choose and to get health care, it is not following \nfamily values, but one can break up families and have parents and \nchildren separated, and that, I guess, doesn't fall under the \ndefinition.\n  It has been 17 months since we passed our bill and either they are \ntoo lazy to take it up or they don't want to take it up. They would \nrather threaten this President. I just have to tell them, we have a \nCongress, we have a court system, and we have a President. We don't \nhave President McConnell, we don't have President Boehner, we don't \nhave President Reid, we don't have President Boxer. We have President \nObama, and he has to do his job. If you don't like it, that is fine. \nLord knows I have served with five Presidents. I didn't agree with them \nhalf the time, but I didn't threaten to shut down the government or \nimpeach them or sue them.\n\n  Now here is the deal: Why can't they find time to take up our bill? \nThey have voted 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act--50 times--\nbut they cannot find time to debate or pass a bill to reform our \nNation's immigration laws.\n  I served in the House for 10 years. The rules in the House are easy. \nIt is nothing like the Senate where you need unanimous consent to do \nanything, to even open up the Senate. In the House, if the majority, \nwho are now the Republicans, wants to introduce a bill, all they have \nto do is introduce a bill.\n  They won't do it. It has been 17 months. Then the President says, oh, \nmy God, we have got an issue here. Everyone agrees we have 11 million \nundocumented immigrants here. We have issues at the border. We have \nissues at detention facilities. We have issues in the ag industry. We \nhave issues of families being torn apart. The President is going to do \nwhat he can do, just as 10 other Presidents have done previously. So \nwhat does he get in response from our Republican friends? Nothing that \nwould allay our concerns. They don't say, Mr. President, we understand \nyour frustration. Don't worry, we will get a bill done. It may not be \nthe same as the Senate. We have other ideas. They do nothing. They are \ndo-nothing and they want our President to be do-nothing when it comes \nto immigration.\n  Frankly, if our President did not take action, it would be a terrible \nmistake. I have already established that he is within his \nconstitutional rights. He would be joining 10 other Presidents who, by \nthe way, acted on 40 occasions over the last 60 years. So here is a \ngroup of Republicans threatening to impeach the President, sue the \nPresident, shut down the government over something that 11 Presidents \nhave done over the past 60 years on 40 occasions. I never ever, ever \nheard one Republican or Democrat threaten to shut down the government \nwhen a President took action over immigration.\n  The Republicans won't act. So what do they think is going to happen, \nstatus quo? The status quo doesn't work. It is not working at the \nborder. It is not working for our families. It is not working at the \nworkplace. It is not working in our communities.\n  I was in the House when President Reagan signed into law a major \nimmigration bill legalizing 3 million immigrants in 1986, and then the \nCongress didn't do the next step. They didn't take the next step. So he \ntook Executive action to stop deportations that would interfere with \nfamily reunification. President Reagan--I didn't hear one Republican \nthreaten to impeach the President, sue the President, take action, shut \ndown the government, make life miserable for the American people. No. \nBut they are doing it now.\n  In 1990, President George Herbert Walker Bush directed his Attorney \nGeneral to halt deportations of an estimated 190,000 Salvadorans who \nwere fleeing the civil war there, and he used his power to halt the \ndeportation of up to 1.5 million spouses and children. I did not hear \none Republican--not one--threaten to sue the President, threaten to \ntake him to court, threaten to impeach him, threaten to shut down the \ngovernment and make life miserable for the American people.\n  President Bush's family fairness policy Executive action was \nsweeping. It affected more than 40 percent of the undocumented \npopulation in the United States at the time. He thought big--George \nBush, Sr.--he thought big, and this President should think big.\n  I will tell you why. If you ask economic experts what are the best \nmeasures we can do for our economy, they are clear about it. They say \none measure we should implement is to raise the minimum wage. We \nDemocrats are trying to do that and we will never give up trying to do \nthat. Reforming immigration is another measure that is one of the best \nways to stimulate our economy and create jobs, and it is all laid out \nin a USC study which shows that immigration reform with a path to \ncitizenship would inject $8 billion into my State's economy--my State \nof California--each year--$8 billion each year. Nationwide it would \nincrease our gross domestic product by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, \nincrease wages for workers, and lead to between 750,000 to 900,000 new \njobs. That is almost a million new jobs created, according to the \nCenter for American Progress.\n  So help me out here, Republicans. What is your problem? You never \ncomplained when Republican Presidents took Executive action to fix a \nbroken immigration system. You say you are for jobs and the economy and \nbusiness, and if you look at the support for immigration reform, it \nruns right through our society from the Chambers of Commerce to labor \nand everybody in between. And if we don't act, the dire situation of \nundocumented immigrants will only get worse. Families will continue to \nbe torn apart. People will continue to live in the shadows. The reason \nour economy will be thriving once people get out of the shadows is they \nare not afraid to come out. They are not afraid to buy a house. They \nare not afraid to spend money. They are not afraid to start new \nbusinesses. They\n\n[[Page S6134]]\n\nare not afraid to hire workers. It is a no-brainer. This is one of the \nmost important things we can do for our economy, for jobs, for \nprosperity, for our communities.\n  In closing, because I see my friend from Connecticut is here, and I \nwant to yield the floor, there are two priorities that are at stake: a \nhealthy economy--and I have laid that out--and family values. The \nAmerican people, including the people of California, support bold and \ncompassionate action on immigration reform. We have already established \nthat the President has the legal authority to act just as other \nPresidents of both parties have in the past.\n\n  I say to the President today, as I have said to him in writing, if \nyou act you will have my strong support and you will have the support \nof so many people across this country. You will keep our families \ntogether, you will strengthen our economy, and you will make our \ncountry stronger.\n  I say to the House again, while you are still here in Washington, if \nyou don't want the President to fill the void for your lack of action, \nthen take up and pass the Senate immigration bill. Get to work. If you \ndon't like that bill, then make another bill, but take care of this \nproblem because if you continue to be a do-nothing House when it comes \nto immigration, I can assure you this President will not follow your \nlead and be a do-nothing President when it comes to immigration. That \nwould be terribly wrong. It would be wrong not only for our immigrant \ncommunity but for every single one of us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have two articles printed \nin the Record, along with an article in the National Journal that \ndetails the number of times Presidents have used their authority to act \non immigration.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From huffingtonpost.com, Nov. 15, 2014]\n\n  Reagan, Bush Also Acted Without Congress To Shield Immigrants From \n                              Deportation\n\n                           (By Andrew Taylor)\n\n       Washington (AP).--Two presidents have acted unilaterally on \n     immigration--and both were Republican. Ronald Reagan and his \n     successor George H.W. Bush extended amnesty to family members \n     who were not covered by the last major overhaul of \n     immigration law in 1986.\n       Neither faced the political uproar widely anticipated if \n     and when President Barack Obama uses his executive authority \n     to protect millions of immigrants from deportation.\n       Reagan's and Bush's actions were conducted in the wake of a \n     sweeping, bipartisan immigration overhaul and at a time when \n     ``amnesty'' was not a dirty word. Their actions were less \n     controversial because there was a consensus in Washington \n     that the 1986 law needed a few fixes and Congress was poised \n     to act on them. Obama is acting as the country--and \n     Washington--are bitterly divided over a broken immigration \n     system and what to do about 11 million people living in the \n     U.S. illegally.\n       Obama wants to extend protection from deportation to \n     millions of immigrant parents and spouses of U.S. citizens \n     and permanent residents, and expand his 2-year-old program \n     that shields immigrants brought illegally to this country as \n     children.\n       A tea party-influenced GOP is poised to erupt, if and when \n     Obama follows through on his promise.\n       ``The audacity of this president to think he can completely \n     destroy the rule of law with the stroke of a pen is \n     unfathomable to me,'' said GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa, an \n     outspoken opponent of relaxing U.S. immigration law. ``It is \n     unconstitutional, it is cynical, and it violates the will of \n     the American people.''\n       Some Republicans have even raised the possibility of \n     impeachment.\n       Here's a timeline of then and now:\n       1986. Congress and Reagan enacted a sweeping overhaul that \n     gave legal status to up to 3 million immigrants without \n     authorization to be in the country, if they had come to the \n     U.S. before 1982. Spouses and children who could not meet \n     that test did not qualify, which incited protests that the \n     new law was breaking up families.\n       1987. Early efforts in Congress to amend the law to cover \n     family members failed. Reagan's Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service commissioner announced that minor \n     children of parents granted amnesty by the law would get \n     protection from deportation. Spouses and children of couples \n     in which one parent qualified for amnesty but the other did \n     not remained subject to deportation, leading to efforts to \n     amend the 1986 law.\n       1989. By a sweeping 81-17 vote, the Senate in July voted to \n     prohibit deportations of family members of immigrants covered \n     by the 1986 law. The House failed to act.\n       1990. In February, President George H.W. Bush, acting \n     through the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \n     established a ``family fairness'' in which family members \n     living with a legalizing immigrant and who were in the U.S. \n     before passage of the 1986 law were granted protection from \n     deportation and authorized to seek employment. The \n     administration estimated up to 1.5 million people would be \n     covered by the policy. Congress in October passed a broader \n     immigration law that made the protections permanent.\n       2012. In July, the Obama administration announces a new \n     policy curbing deportations for certain immigrants brought \n     illegally to the country as kids. The policy, Deferred Action \n     for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), applies to people younger than \n     30 who were brought to the U.S. before they turned 16 and \n     meet other criteria such as graduating high school. It has \n     now granted two-year deportation reprieves and work permits \n     to nearly 600,000 people.\n       2013-2014 (Congress). After months of work, the Senate in \n     June 2013 passes, 68-32, a huge immigration overhaul bill \n     that includes a path to citizenship for immigrants who meet \n     strict criteria. The House fails to act. In a televised \n     interview with Telemundo, Obama says expanding the DACA \n     program to cover the parents of children allowed to remain in \n     the country under the program ``would be ignoring the law in \n     a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. \n     So that's not an option.''\n       2014 Frustrated by Congress' inability to act on \n     immigration, Obama announces in June that he'll use executive \n     powers to address other elements of the flawed immigration \n     system. Like Bush, Obama is expected to extend deportation \n     protections to families of U.S. citizens or permanent \n     residents. Obama's anticipated action would not award legal \n     status, but it would offer temporary protection from \n     deportation to up to 5 million people, as well as the \n     possibility of obtaining a work permit. He delayed action \n     until after Election Day. On Monday, Democratic leaders sent \n     a letter to Obama saying they strongly support his plans to \n     take executive action on immigration.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the hill.com, Oct. 2, 2014]\n\n   When Reagan and GHW Bush Took Bold Executive Action on Immigration\n\n                            (By Mark Noferi)\n\n       Congressional Republicans are outraged that President Obama \n     may take executive action on immigration reform after the \n     mid-term elections--perhaps by deferring deportations and \n     providing work authorization to millions of unauthorized \n     immigrants with strong family ties to the United States. \n     However, past Republican presidents have not been shy to use \n     the White House's power to retool immigration policy. In \n     fact, Obama could learn a lot from presidents Ronald Reagan's \n     and George H. W. Bush's executive actions to preserve the \n     unity of immigrant families, and move past Congressional \n     refusal to enact immigration reform.\n       The story begins on November 6, 1986, when Reagan signed \n     the last comprehensive legalization bill to pass Congress. \n     The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) gave up to 3 \n     million unauthorized immigrants a path to legalization if \n     they had been ``continuously'' present in the U.S. since \n     January 1, 1982. But the new law excluded their spouses and \n     children who didn't qualify. As the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee stated at the time, ``the families of legalized \n     aliens . . . will be required to ``wait in line'.\n       Immediately, these split-eligibility families became the \n     most polarizing national immigration issue. U.S. Catholic \n     bishops criticized the government's ``separation of \n     families,'' especially given Reagan's other pro-family \n     stances. In early 1987, members of Congress introduced \n     legislation to legalize family members, but without success.\n       Shortly after Congress' failure, Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service (INS) commissioner Alan Nelson \n     announced he was ``exercising the Attorney General's \n     discretion'' to assure that children would ``be covered'' by \n     legalization. The administration granted a blanket deferral \n     of deportation (logistically similar to today's Deferred \n     Action for Childhood Arrivals program) for children under 18 \n     who were living in a two-parent household with both parents \n     legalizing, or with a single parent who was legalizing.\n       Lawmakers and advocates, however, urged Reagan to go \n     further. Spouses and some children who had one parent able to \n     legalize but not the other remained unprotected. A California \n     immigrants' rights group called this ``contrary to the \n     American tradition of keeping families together.'' And as \n     Rep. Howard Berman (D-Calif.) told the INS, ``If you have the \n     discretion to protect children, why not a family?''\n       In July 1989, the Senate moved to protect a bigger group--\n     all spouses and children of those who legalized under IRCA. \n     The Senate passed legislation 81-17 that prohibited the \n     administration from deporting family members of immigrants in \n     the process of legalizing and directed officials to grant \n     them work authorization. The House failed to act on the \n     Senate's bill.\n       George Bush Sr. then responded in February 1990 by \n     administratively implementing the Senate bill's provisions \n     himself. As Bush's INS Commissioner, Gene McNary, stated: \n     ``It is vital that we enforce the law against illegal entry. \n     However, we can enforce the law humanely. To split families \n     encourages further violations of the law as they reunite.'' \n     Under Bush's ``family fairness'' policy, applicants had to \n     meet certain criteria, and reapply to the INS every year for \n     extensions.\n\n[[Page S6135]]\n\n       The Bush administration anticipated its family fairness \n     program could help enormous numbers of immigrants--up to 1.5 \n     million family members, which amounted to over 40 percent of \n     the 3.5 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. at the \n     time.\n       After the Bush administration moved, the House followed. In \n     March 1990, 33 House members introduced legislation with \n     similar provisions to stay deportation of family members. In \n     October, Congress then passed a combined Immigration Act of \n     1990, with a permanent ``Family Unity'' provision. The Act \n     broadened Bush's family fairness policy to include children \n     under 21 and increased family immigration visas, ultimately \n     providing more families a path to citizenship.\n       If voters thought Bush overstepped his authority, the \n     midterm elections didn't show it. In 1990, the Republicans \n     lost a scant nine House seats and one Senate seat (out of 33 \n     up for election)--far lower than average midterm losses by a \n     president's party. Bush then signed the Act in November, \n     hailing it as continuing ``support for the family as the \n     essential unit of society'' and ``our tradition of family \n     reunification.'' (Bush did issue a signing statement \n     reserving the ``authority of the executive branch to exercise \n     prosecutorial discretion in suitable immigration cases.'')\n       The success of the Reagan-Bush family fairness policy \n     serves as a strikingly similar historical precedent for \n     Obama. Bush Sr. ``went big'' to treat families fairly--\n     deferring deportations for over 40 percent of unauthorized \n     immigrants. Reportedly, Obama's actions could be similarly \n     broad and help up to 5 million immigrants--over 40 percent of \n     today's unauthorized population. Bush Sr.'s actions gave \n     immigrants a safe haven and spurred the House to act without \n     negative impacts in the subsequent midterms. And the Reagan-\n     Bush fairness policy deferred deportations to protect \n     families, compared to previous uses of presidential authority \n     to protect war refugees or immigrants stranded by a foreign \n     policy crisis.\n       We don't know what executive action Obama will take. But we \n     can say with certainty that presidents Ronald Reagan and \n     George H. W. Bush led the way.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Critics Say Executive Action on Immigration Would Be Unprecedented. \n                       They Forget Their History\n\n\n  Presidents have almost always acted first to permit immigration or \n  prevent deportation--with Congress ratifying those actions later on.\n\n                         (By Charles Kamasaki)\n\n       The president's announcement that he would soon take \n     executive action to ``to do what he could'' to fix a broken \n     immigration system in the absence of legislation has prompted \n     critics to assert that this would be unprecedented unless \n     first authorized by Congress. In fact, the record \n     demonstrates the opposite. For at least the last 70 years, \n     presidents have routinely acted first to permit the entry of \n     people outside normal channels or to protect large numbers of \n     people from deportation, with legislation ratifying the \n     executive action coming later.\n       During World War II, the Roosevelt administration \n     negotiated a temporary worker arrangement with the Mexican \n     government, later known as the Bracero program, an action \n     Congress ratified a year later. When the authorization \n     expired in 1947, the Truman administration continued the \n     program until it was reauthorized in 1951. Before it ended in \n     1964, millions of workers entered the United States under the \n     auspices of the Bracero program, hundreds of thousands under \n     executive--not legislative--authority. The program was \n     rightly criticized for numerous labor and human-rights \n     violations, but few questioned the executive authority it \n     operated under.\n       After the war ended, President Truman used his executive \n     authority to permit 250,000 people from Europe to enter or \n     stay in the U.S. outside normal immigration channels. It was \n     only three years after this exercise of discretion that \n     Congress passed the Displaced Persons Act, permitting some \n     400,000 additional entries.\n       In April 1975, at the end of the Vietnam War, President \n     Ford used parole authority to authorize the evacuation of \n     200,000 South Vietnamese to this country; it was not until a \n     month later that the Indochina Migration and Refugee Act of \n     1975 was enacted, providing resettlement funding for 130,000 \n     of those parolees. Full legislative authorization to resettle \n     those fleeing Indochina did not come until 1980, when \n     Congress passed the Refugee Act, resulting in permanent \n     resettlement of 1.4 million Indochinese in the U.S.. Although \n     most entered as bona fide refugees, hundreds of thousands \n     were paroled into the country when statutorily authorized \n     numbers proved inadequate.\n       But these broad exercises of discretion were limited to \n     refugees fleeing wars a long time ago, right? Wrong. \n     Presidents have exercised their discretion more than 20 times \n     since the mid-1970s to permit people already in the U.S. from \n     being deported. Some sought to avoid return to a Soviet bloc \n     country. Iranians in the 1980s sought protection from the \n     regime that overthrew the shah and occupied the American \n     Embassy there. Afghans in the U.S. in the 1980s and 1990s \n     were protected first from the Soviet puppet state and later \n     from the Taliban. Others would have been returned to face \n     civil war or natural disasters abroad. Not until 2003, \n     several decades after the practice of country-specific relief \n     from deportation was first deployed, did Congress codify the \n     practice known as ``temporary protected status.''\n       The record also shows that Congress made many executive \n     orders of temporary relief permanent, often years after the \n     fact. As Fidel Castro took power in Cuba in 1959, more than \n     900,000 Cubans fled to the United States, the vast majority \n     paroled into the country by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, \n     and Johnson. Not until 1966, some seven years after the \n     influx began, was the Cuban Adjustment Act passed.\n       In 1980, 130,000 Mariel Cubans and nearly 40,000 Haitians \n     arrived in South Florida. Most, but not all, of the Cubans \n     were paroled into the U.S. by President Carter. Haitians \n     initially were protected from deportation by litigation \n     challenging the denials of their asylum claims; most of these \n     Haitians, and some Cubans whose entry had been challenged, \n     eventually received discretionary ``Cuban-Haitian entrant \n     status'' in the Reagan administration. Six years later, the \n     Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 provided lawful \n     permanent resident status for Cuban-Haitian entrants.\n       In 1987, Reagan administration Attorney General Edwin Meese \n     directed the Immigration and Naturalization Service not to \n     deport an estimated 200,000 Nicaraguans in the United States \n     without authorization, including those whose asylum claims \n     had been denied. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush \n     instructed his attorney general to provide ``deferred \n     enforced departure'' status to an estimated 190,000 \n     Salvadorans fleeing civil war. In 1997, a decade after \n     Meese's initial action, Congress passed legislation \n     permitting these groups' adjustment to permanent residence.\n       In 1989, the Bush administration provided DED status to \n     80,000 Chinese students in the U.S. who feared returning to \n     the strife that eventually led to the Tiananmen Square \n     massacre and later issued an executive order extending their \n     status. Congress then passed the Chinese Student Protection \n     Act in 1992, three years following the initial executive \n     action, making the students eligible for green cards.\n       OK, but major exercises of prosecutorial discretion have \n     been used only for foreign policy reasons, right? Wrong \n     again. Executive actions have been used by every modern \n     administration on more than a dozen occasions to further \n     purely domestic policy objectives. After domestic \n     emergencies--the San Francisco earthquake, the 9/11 attack, \n     Hurricanes Katrina and Ike, and others--immigration officials \n     relaxed enforcement efforts to advance public health and \n     safety. Beginning with President Carter in 1980, every \n     administration has instructed immigration officials to reduce \n     enforcement efforts during the census.\n       Other exercises of discretion went beyond specific \n     emergencies or events. In 1977, Carter administration \n     Attorney General Griffin Bell suspended deportation of about \n     250,000 people unfairly denied visas by a quirk in the \n     allocation process. It was not until nearly a decade later, \n     via IRCA in 1986, that all of these cases were resolved.\n       In 1990, INS Commissioner Gene McNary issued a ``Family \n     Fairness'' policy deferring the deportation of 1.5 million \n     immediate family members of people receiving legalization \n     under IRCA, building on a more-limited exercise of discretion \n     in 1987 by Edwin Meese. Three years after Meese's original \n     executive action, Congress codified the action in the \n     Immigration Act of 1990.\n       In 1997, President Clinton provided DED status to some \n     40,000 Haitians previously paroled into the U.S. At the end \n     of the 105th Congress a year later, legislation passed \n     allowing these Haitians to permanently adjust their status.\n       The record is clear: Presidents of both parties have used \n     discretionary powers on multiple occasions to protect various \n     groups from deportation for an enormously wide variety of \n     reasons. Except for temporary conditions, Congress acted \n     later--often years later--to ratify the president's \n     decisions.\n       Looking back now, would we reverse any of these executive \n     actions? Should we have returned Eastern Europeans to behind \n     the Iron Curtain, Cambodians to the killing fields, \n     Ethiopians to a brutal civil war, Iranians to the arms of the \n     ayatollah, or Chinese students to face the tanks in Tiananmen \n     Square? Would we be better off without the Cubans and \n     Haitians who revitalized South Florida over the past 40 \n     years? Were we wrong to prevent the separation of 1.5 million \n     people from family members getting right with the law under \n     IRCA's legalization?\n       Many of these actions were controversial when first \n     announced. But Congress later affirmed virtually all of \n     them--without explicitly reversing any of them--suggesting \n     that eventually they were widely accepted. Decades from now, \n     people looking back on President Obama's imminent \n     announcement of broad-scale executive action will see that he \n     prevented the separation of families, began fixing a badly \n     broken immigration system, and improved wages, housing, and \n     education for those receiving legal status, thus immeasurably \n     enriching the economy. They'll likely see that Congress later \n     ratified his actions, as happened so often before.\n       And, they'll wonder: what was all the fuss about?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my colleagues who have come to the floor this \nafternoon and are still to come to the floor, thank you.\n  Republicans have threatened to close down this government. They are \nhaving a temper tantrum and refuse to act\n\n[[Page S6136]]\n\non immigration and want to paralyze the Presidency.\n  It is time to get behind this President. It is time to get behind the \nAmerican people. It is time to take a stand for this economy and for \nfamily values.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am grateful for the strong and \neloquent words that were said by my colleague Senator Boxer. I am \ngrateful to so many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle for \nsupporting the President as he considers Executive action that would \nessentially enforce the law on immigration more rationally and \neffectively, which is what prosecutorial discretion means.\n  As a former U.S. attorney as well as the State attorney general in my \nown State for 20 years, I know about prosecutorial discretion. I know \nthat in exercising his discretion, the President is aware that there is \nsimply no way every undocumented person in the United States of America \ncan be deported tomorrow, let alone this year--probably ever.\n  There are 11.5 million undocumented people who live in the shadows, \nand the question is, How do we use the resources of the Federal \nGovernment most rationally and effectively to serve the public interest \nand uphold the rule of law?\n  The question is, essentially, How should law enforcement use its \nresources? That question arises every day in the United States when \nthere is a Federal or State prosecution. It arises every day on our \nborders when the agents of our Federal administrative law enforcement \napparatus make decisions about law enforcement. As I have learned from \nmy experience in law enforcement, it best serves citizens when it uses \nthose resources efficiently, effectively, and humanely in a concerted \neffort to address a direct threat to public safety. Law enforcement has \na job to do, and it can't do everything all the time everywhere.\n  Decisions are necessary in the real world in practical circumstances \nto preserve public order and protect public safety, and that is what \nthe President is doing by issuing an Executive order which, in effect, \ndirects Federal resources to deport undocumented immigrants who \nrepresent a threat to this country by virtue of their criminal activity \nor criminal background or other circumstances that justify that \nrational and selective approach to law enforcement.\n  This approach is hardly novel, and it is highly unoriginal. In fact, \nPresident Obama's authority to direct how Federal immigration resources \nwill be marshaled in the service of protecting public safety is very \nmuch in the tradition and history of this office. Every President since \nDwight Eisenhower, whether Democratic or Republican, has done exactly \nwhat President Obama is doing in this Executive order.\n  In 1990 President George H.W. Bush took Executive action to defer \nremoval and grant work permits to roughly 1.5 million undocumented \nindividuals--nearly half the undocumented population at the time. Think \nabout that for a moment. Out of 3 million people, President Bush \ndecided that 1.5 million of them should, in effect, not be prosecuted. \nHe set law enforcement priorities. That was his job, and that is \nPresident Obama's job.\n  Many of us--and I am very much in this camp--would prefer to address \nthis situation through legislation. I worked hard, along with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Members on both \nsides of the aisle of the Judiciary Committee and of this body, to \napprove legislation. It was resolved and written up after several days \nof detailed and painstaking markup. I was told that is the way \nlegislation used to be routinely done in this body--Members trading \nideas, exchanging views and perspectives, drilling down on facts, and \narriving at a bipartisan solution that eventually was approved by 68 \nMembers of this body from both sides of the aisle. That is a matter of \nhistory.\n  My hope was and still is that we have legislation along the lines of \nwhat was approved by the Senate. That legislation was far from perfect. \nIn my view, it was way short of the ideal immigration reform I would \nfavor, but the good cannot be the enemy of the perfect and the perfect \ncannot be the enemy of the good. What we need now is a practical \napproach to this problem through legislation. The House refused to take \nup the Senate bill. It didn't even consider it and never voted on it.\n\n  The President has a responsibility, and his job is to take actions \nthat are within his legal authority to address a system that is broken \nand takes a toll on human lives that is intolerable. It threatens to \ndivide families, to put people out of work--not just undocumented \nimmigrants out of work but citizens of this country because they work \nfor businesses that are owned and operated by those immigrants who \nmight be deported. I have seen that firsthand in Connecticut, and I \nknow it is true around the country.\n  This measure is not only good for human lives, it is good for our \neconomy. It is essential to make sure our immigration system--a broken, \nfailed system--is at least prepared in the short term while we work \ntoward legislation that is absolutely necessary to comprehensively \nrevise and reform that system.\n  Every day that the Federal Government fails to act on immigration \nreform, people in this country are forced to live in fear and the \nanxiety and apprehension that children suffer when they are afraid they \nwill lose their parents and siblings. Connecticut citizens live in fear \nof losing their neighbors and their employers, their congregates in \nchurch, and members of their immediate and extended families. Millions \nof immigrants who have lived in this country for years--5 or 10 years \nor longer--and are working hard, paying taxes, abiding by the law, and \ncontributing and giving back to their communities are forced to live in \nfear that they will have to leave everything they have worked so hard \nto build and everything that means so much to them--their families, \ntheir homes, and the country they have come to love. They appreciate \nthe freedoms of this country and the opportunities it offers in ways we \nroutinely take for granted. For them, this country is a beacon of hope \nand opportunity which they appreciate so deeply and fervently that they \nare willing to lay down their lives for it and, in fact, sometimes do \nas members of our armed services.\n  The lack of action on immigration reform hurts everyone. When \nbusinesses employ workers under the table, our economy and our Nation \nare deprived of their taxes. They are often ducking regulations and \ntaxes, which in turn drives down wages for every working American.\n  Immigrants should be able to come out of the shadows not just for \ntheir sake but for the Nation's sake. They are a resource that can be \nused so much more fully to the benefit of our Nation. When they come \nout of the shadows, they should be forced to undergo background checks, \nobtain work permits and proof that they are abiding by the law. That is \nnecessary to show they are not a threat to public safety.\n  When immigrants live in fear, law enforcement can't know who lives in \nthe communities they police. Immigrants who live in fear are simply not \ngoing to be as willing to report individuals living near them and \nrepresent a real threat to public safety because they feel \nuncomfortable reporting crimes and cooperating with authority when they \nfeel they may then be the object of enforcement. Getting more people \nwho are already living in this country into the system will allow law \nenforcement to go after the truly bad actors--serious criminals, \nserious national security threats, and people who seriously should not \nbe in this country.\n  As the American people wait for legislative action and wait for the \nHouse to act on the Senate bill and perhaps wait on the Senate to act \nagain, President Obama has both the authority and the moral \nresponsibility to institute these reforms. These reforms are crucial. \nHe has the authority under law to exercise his discretion. He has the \nmoral responsibility to fix this broken system as long and as well as \nhe can using that responsibility.\n  I am encouraged to hear that the President intends to focus his \nauthority on serious criminals, not law-abiding individuals. At a \nminimum, my hope is that he will ease the minds of children and put to \nrest the anxiety children feel when they fear they may lose their \nparents. Whether they are DREAMers or U.S. citizens, they should be \nspared that apprehension and\n\n[[Page S6137]]\n\nanxiety that interferes with everything they do in school or work.\n  My hope is that he will exercise that authority on behalf of the \nparents of those children--U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and \nDREAMers.\n  My hope is that he will ease some of the arbitrary restrictions that \nprevent the DOCA program from achieving its full purpose--restrictions \nlike the cutoff age.\n  As he acts to exercise his prosecutorial discretion with respect to \ndeportation, he should also consider his administration's policies with \nrespect to detention. As I wrote to the President earlier this year, \nalong with my colleague and friend Chairman Leahy, I believe the \nadministration's decision to dramatically expand the detention of whole \nfamilies, many of whom have shown a credible fear of being returned to \ndangerous situations in their home countries, is counterproductive and \nharmful. Migrants must be given an adequate opportunity to show they \nhave a valid claim as refugees.\n\n  The policy of indiscriminately holding families in enormous, \nprivately run facilities leads to inhumane living conditions. Violence \nagainst women and children and simply inefficient use of resources are \nmore the rule than the exception. Warehousing young children in \ncomplexes that are little more than jails is deeply incompatible with \nour national values and it serves none of the goals of an effective \nimmigration system.\n  Tomorrow marks the 25th anniversary of the U.N. Convention on the \nRights of the Child. Faith leaders and community members from around \nthe country will be doing vigils and telling the stories of children \nand mothers who are spending this holiday season behind bars. Yes, in \nthe greatest country in the history of the world, children and their \nmoms will be spending Thanksgiving behind bars.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. These families are not flight risks and they are not \ndangerous. We owe it to them to do better. I am proud of standing with \nmy colleagues on calling on the President to keep families together, \ntarget resources effectively, and run an immigration system that \nreflects America's values and builds a stronger future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6137-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about this nomination. This \nis the nomination of Wendy Beetlestone to be U.S. district court judge \nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. She has great qualifications. \nShe is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, an \nhonors graduate in her undergraduate institution. She has worked now \nfor 19 years at the law firm of Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & \nSchiller, has 19 years of experience in litigation in a wide variety of \nmatters. She worked in education law and has broad experience there. \nShe worked as a journalist as well before she was a lawyer and, during \nher time working in Philadelphia as a lawyer, as a great advocate for \npeople who don't have a voice and also someone who brings a wide \nexperience to the Federal bench.\n  I am honored to be working with Senator Toomey on this nomination, \nworking together to get these nominations through, and I am so grateful \nfor the work of the Judiciary Committee and especially Chairman Leahy \nmoving these nominations through.\n  I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to say briefly that I thank Senator \nCasey for the terrific cooperative working relationship he and I have. \nWhen Wendy Beetlestone is confirmed, that will make the 11th Federal \njudge who has been confirmed as a result of the work we have done \ntogether.\n  Wendy is an outstanding candidate, and I think she will make a great \nFederal judge.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend \nof mine and a great friend to the Bluegrass State and the University of \nKentucky, Mr. Bill Schweri. Bill recently retired from the University \nof Kentucky after dedicating over 40 years to working at the \nuniversity, the last two decades of which were spent as the director of \nFederal relations.\n  It has been Bill's job to serve as a liaison between the university \nand its faculty and the executive and legislative branches of State and \nFederal Government. I am a proud graduate of UK's College of Law, and \nBill has represented my alma mater exceedingly well over the years.\n  Bill has been a staunch advocate for new research initiatives at the \nuniversity in fields as varied as agriculture, biotechnology, clean \ncoal technology, energy, engineering, and transportation. He has helped \ntransform UK into one of the most prominent economic drivers in the \nState.\n  He has been instrumental in bringing about such UK achievements as \nthe Marty Driesler Cancer Project, the expansion of a teaching space in \nthe College of Nursing, the creation of a bioinformatics core in the \nuniversity's medical center, and Fedtrak, a project with the \nTransportation Security Administration to track sensitive material \nshipments.\n  Bill also played a key role in UK's Markey Cancer Center being \nawarded a National Cancer Institute designation. With NCI designation, \nUK is better positioned to recruit researchers, receive grants, and to \ndevelop new breakthrough treatments to lead the fight against cancer. \nThis means that fewer Kentuckians will have to travel out of State to \nfind the most advanced care and clinical trials, and instead will be \nable to find it within the Commonwealth, which is critical as Kentucky \nsuffers from the highest combined cancer mortality rate in the country.\n  Bill has worked actively to help maintain congressional support for \nstudent financial aid, which is so important to many Kentucky students. \nHe has worked tirelessly to ensure his school's visibility here in \nWashington, DC and to fight for legislation that is important to UK. \nAnd he is fiercely loyal to the University of Kentucky.\n  Bill is not just an employee of UK, he's also an alumnus. Bill earned \nhis bachelor's degree in anthropology from the University of Kentucky \nin 1969 and his master's degree, also in anthropology, from UK in 1978.\n  In his youth he served in the Peace Corps in Guatemala, and he also \nserved as the past president of the Society of Research Administrators, \nInternational from 1997 to 1998. Bill previously served as UK's \ndirector of sponsored program development in the 1980s and '90s before \nbecoming the director of Federal relations in July of 1994.\n  Bill has been a leader in the Science Coalition, a nonprofit, \nnonpartisan organization of more than 50 of the Nation's leading \nresearch universities dedicated to sustaining the Federal Government's \ninvestment in scientific research. He has also been actively involved \nin the Council on Governmental Affairs of the Association of Public and \nLand Grant Universities.\n  Bill is well known and highly respected among his colleagues in \nFederal relations at other research universities, just as he is \nthroughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I wish to personally thank \nBill for his service to the University of Kentucky and to our State. \nAlthough his retirement is well earned, he will certainly be missed, by \nme, by my staff, and by the many people across Kentucky who have \nbenefited from his efforts. I ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me \nin bidding a fond farewell to Mr. Bill Schweri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6141-5", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6141-S6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LETTERS IN RELATION TO RESIGNATION\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, Illinois lost its longest-serving Member of \nthe House of Representatives and this country lost one of the great \nleaders of the conservative movement last week when Philip Crane passed \naway at the age of 84.\n  For 35 years Phil Crane represented Chicago's northwest suburbs, a \nregion I know well. He was first elected to Congress in 1969, winning a \nspecial election, and ultimately became the longest-serving House \nRepublican when he was finally defeated in 2004. While I served with \nCongressman Phil Crane in the House of only 4 years, our districts were \nadjacent to each other and together we fought for many issues important \nto suburban Chicago and Illinois.\n  Before conservative principles were fashionable, Phil was leading the \nway for conservatism, working for Barry Goldwater in 1964 in Illinois. \nWhen some said Phil's politics of small government and low taxes were \nbackward looking, he responded with gusto, arguing in support of free \nmarkets and trade, prudent economics policies, a strong national \ndefense, and traditional values.\n  Phil was courageous and had foresight. In 1976 he was the first \nsitting Congressman to publicly support Reagan in his effort to defeat \nPresident Gerald Ford. He also founded the Republican Study Committee, \nwhich still exists today in the House of Representatives. He also was \ndeeply involved in the early days of two of the most influential \nconservative think tanks, the Heritage Foundation and the American \nConservative Union.\n  In 1980 Phil took a run for President, ultimately falling to Ronald \nReagan. As a young House staffer, I noted that numerous Congressmen \nrespected Phil for his early advocacy of conservative principles and \nhis ties to the early days of the modern conservative movement. If you \nwant to get a feel of Phil, then read his 1976 book ``The Sum of Good \nGovernment.''\n  Phil Crane fought tirelessly as a senior member of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee for his conservative principles, including for lower \ntaxes and increasing trade. One of his greatest legislative \nachievements was the North American Free Trade Agreement, which created \nthe world's largest free trade zone, linking up billions of dollars \nannually.\n  With the passing of Phil Crane, Illinois and Washington have lost one \nof its greats. Thank you, Phil Crane, for your service to the State of \nIllinois and to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6142-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONGRATULATING JOHN COX\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and congratulate \nJohn Cox the Director of the Wyoming Department of Transportation. On \nNovember 24, 2014, Director Cox will be elected as president of the \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, \nAASHTO. John is currently serving as the association's vice-president \nand has worked his way to the top through various positions in AASHTO.\n  Since 2005, he has continually served Wyoming as the WYDOT director. \nThe respect for John is deep and widespread. He was appointed by \nDemocrat Governor Dave Freudenthal and reappointed by our current \nRepublican Governor Matt Mead.\n  John Cox is not your traditional State Department of Transportation \ndirector. Director Cox has a 28-year background in law enforcement. As \na young patrolman, John patrolled thousands of miles on the rural roads \nof Wyoming. Director Cox's law enforcement background provided him with \na unique perspective on the needs of rural States like Wyoming. John \nunderstands rural transportation. He also understands that our \ntransportation system must be whole. I believe his experience and \nleadership will be key to the success of AASHTO and its members over \nthe next year.\n  Director Cox and I have worked closely together for over a decade. \nWhen I was in the Wyoming Legislature, I chaired the Senate \nTransportation and Military Affairs Committee. In the Wyoming \nLegislature, we worked to improve our State's highways. In the U.S. \nSenate, we worked on the 2012 highway reauthorization bill. In 2014, \nDirector Cox and I focused on improving the current law by cutting \nWashington redtape and providing flexibility and equity for rural \nStates like Wyoming.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Director Cox as all of \nAmerica can now benefit from his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6142-3", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JOHN R. BALLENTINE\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor John R. \nBallentine, who will retire as the Alma City Mayor after more than two \ndecades of public service to the citizens of Arkansas in this elected \nposition.\n  As Alma City Mayor, John was a constant advocate for services, \nprograms and improvements for Alma residents. After leading the city \nout of debt, John oversaw the construction and financing of the city's \nfirst waterpark. In 2000, John opened the Alma Aquatic Center, which \nhas become a centerpiece of the city bringing in more than 50,000 \npeople annually. What started as an idea dreamed up while baling hay \nbecame a significant contributor to the City of Alma's economy.\n  John fought hard to enhance existing public facilities and finance \nthe new construction of amenities including area parks, a $4 million \nwater treatment plant, an annual Independence Day fireworks show, and \nthe annual Alma flying disk golf tournament which brings in over 100 \nparticipants every November.\n  John's passion for public service extends beyond his most recent \nposition as Alma's longest standing mayor since 1872. In addition, John \nserved on the Alma City Council for 4 years, as a member of the \nCrawford County Quorum Court for 10 years, and in the U.S. Army \nReserves for 21 years.\n  I congratulate John for his commitment to public service. We are all \ngrateful for his years of service and leadership to Alma, Crawford \nCounty and Arkansas. John is truly a public servant. I wish him \ncontinued success in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6142-4", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6142-S6143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONGRATULATING THE STAMFORD JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER\n\n Mr. MURPHY.

Each year the National Council of \nYouth Sports, NCYS, recognizes five finalist organizations that most \nmeet the ``kids first'' approach, evidenced by their implementation of \nbest practices and policies that protect kids and promote safety. Those \nfive finalist organizations are then put on the NCYS website for voting \nby the public. The award, sponsored by AIG, is presented to \norganizations that exhibit heartfelt passion and show a committed \nspirit to helping kids succeed in sports, while maintaining a \ncommitment to safety procedures.\n  Since opening its doors in 1916, the Stamford JCC has become a \nvaluable community resource, especially well-known for its continuum of \nsafe, supportive, and inclusive health and fitness programs for \nchildren and youth\n\n[[Page S6143]]\n\nof all abilities, backgrounds, and financial circumstances. This year, \nmore than 1,500 kids, ages 3 to 16, have taken part in their ``kids-\nfirst'' recreational activities, created to promote such attributes as \nteamwork, community engagement, and sportsmanship.\n  NCYS is the largest known organization in America representing the \nyouth sports industry, and this award is an important recognition that \nthe Stamford JCC is excelling at helping kids in our community. \nComprised of the who's who in the youth sports industry, NCYS was \nfounded in 1979, and its membership represents more than 200 \norganizations/corporations serving 60,000,000 registered participants \nin organized youth sports programs.

A bill to provide for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse \ngas emission fees; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here now for the, I guess, 80th \ntime in my weekly series of speeches about carbon pollution to ask the \nSenate and Congress to wake up to the growing threat from climate \nchange, and today I am also announcing the introduction of the American \nOpportunity Carbon Fee Act.\n  Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is changing the atmosphere \nand the oceans. We see it everywhere. We see it in storm-damaged homes \nand flooded cities. We see it in drought-stricken farms and raging \nwildfires. We see it in fish disappearing from warming and acidifying \nwaters. We see it in shifting habitats and migrating contagions.\n  All of these things we see carry costs--real economic dollars-and-\ncents costs--to homeowners, to business owners, and to taxpayers. That \ncost is described as the social cost of carbon. It is the damage that \npeople and communities suffer from carbon pollution and climate change. \nNone of those costs from carbon pollution are factored into the price \nof the coal or the oil or the natural gas that releases this carbon. \nThe fossil fuel companies that sell and burn those products have taken \nthose costs and offloaded them onto society--onto the rest of us.\n  That is not fair. If you rake your lawn, you don't get to dump all \nthe leaves over your neighbor's fence and leave him or her the problem \nof cleaning up your leaves. If you are located on a river, you don't \nget to dump your garbage in the river and leave it to the downstream \nproperty owners to clean up your mess. Yet the big carbon polluters \ntransfer the costs--all those costs of climate change--onto everyone \nelse--all the rest of us.\n  The U.S. Government has done some estimating about what that social \ncost of carbon pollution is and their estimate is that it is around $40 \nper ton of carbon dioxide emitted, and that that amount rises over time \nas carbon pollution creates more and more harm and havoc. So a climbing \n$40 per ton is the cost, but the current effective price on carbon \npollution is zero.\n  By making their carbon pollution free, we subsidize fossil fuel \ncompanies to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars annually. By \nmaking their carbon pollution free, we actually rig the game, giving \npolluters an unfair advantage over newer and cleaner technologies. It \nis a racket. It is a form of cheating. And corporate polluters love it \nbecause it gives them advantage, and they fight tooth and nail to \nprotect it in this body. But it is wrong.\n  As University of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone \nrecently explained, this concept--that offloading social costs is wrong \nand that there should be a proper price on carbon--is very widely \naccepted. Here is what he said:\n\n       The media always reports that there's near consensus among \n     scientists about the fact that human activity impacts climate \n     change. What does not receive as much attention is that \n     there's even greater consensus among economists, starting \n     from Milton Friedman and moving into the most left-wing \n     economists that you could find, that the obvious correct \n     public policy solution to this is to put a price on carbon. \n     It's not controversial.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nat the conclusion of my remarks, an article from The Economist \nmagazine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The economics editor of The Economist magazine--which \nis certainly no hotbed of left wing sentiment--Ryan Avent, has posted a \ncomment on climate policy and his question is: ``Do economists all \nfavour a carbon tax?'' He says:\n\n       The economic solution is to tax the externality--\n\n  That is the offloaded cost.\n\n       --so that the social cost of carbon is reflected in the \n     individual consumer's decision. The carbon tax is an elegant \n     solution to a complicated problem.\n\n  So today I am introducing this bill to put a price on carbon \nemissions. It is simple. It will require the polluters to pay a per-ton \nfee for their pollution and all of the revenue generated by those \npayments will go back to the American people.\n  I want to thank Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii for cosponsoring this \nmeasure. He has been a great colleague on environmental issues and on \nour discussion regarding climate change. The bill that we introduce \ntoday establishes an economy-wide fee on carbon\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\ndioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, tracking that social cost \nof carbon, starting at $42 per ton and going up by 2 percent per year, \nplus inflation.\n  We know how much carbon dioxide each unit of coal, oil, and natural \ngas produces, so we assess the fee on fossil fuel producers, \nprocessors, and importers. That makes it simple to administer. The \nwhole bill is only 29 pages long.\n  For other varieties of greenhouse gases and nonfossil fuel sources of \nCO2, we assess our fees only on the very largest emitters--\nthose emitting more than 25,000 tons a year. This is the same universe \nof companies that we already require to monitor and report on their \ncarbon emissions.\n  A significant greenhouse gas concern is the methane that escapes \nthroughout production and distribution. To address this, we require \nannual reports on methane leakage and direct the Treasury Secretary to \nadjust the fees on fossil fuels to account for that leakage. This fee \nwill promote innovation and help further reduce carbon emissions.\n  Fossil fuel companies that capture and sequester or use carbon \ndioxide or innovate new ways to encapsulate it in materials or products \nwill get credits to offset the carbon fee.\n  We also take care to ensure that American manufacturers are not put \nat a competitive disadvantage globally. Imports from nations that don't \nprice emissions will face a tariff that the Treasury Secretary is \nauthorized to impose at the border. Likewise, the Secretary is \nauthorized to rebate American producers on their exports.\n  I would note one thing. Since regulation is usually a response to \nmarket failure, a well-designed carbon fee would also properly open a \nconversation about which and, indeed, whether carbon regulations are \nstill needed. A carbon fee by itself is much more efficient and \npredictable than complex regulations, and I am open to that \nconversation.\n  That is it. It is that simple. Make the polluters pay the full costs \nof their products; end the cheating; level the playing field for other \nforms of energy, such as wind and solar, to compete fairly; keep the \nfee mechanism simple; and maintain a border adjustment that keeps \nAmerican goods competitive. Twenty-nine pages.\n  On the flip side, the carbon fee will generate significant new \nFederal revenue. The technicians are still working on the official \nrevenue estimate for the bill, but it should be at least $1.5 trillion \nand perhaps more than $2 trillion over the 10-year budget periods we \nwork with in Congress and on the Budget Committee.\n  Whatever the exact number is, all of it should be returned to the \nAmerican people. So the bill establishes an American opportunity trust \nfund to hold the revenue and return it to the American people. This \ncould include through tax cuts, through student loan debt relief, \nthrough increased Social Security benefits for seniors, through \ntransition assistance to workers in fossil fuel industries, or even \njust a direct dividend back to the American family. I am looking \nforward to deciding with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle what \nis the best way to return this revenue, but I do believe every dollar \nshould go back to the American people in some form. To use economic \njargon, this should be revenue neutral.\n  This is one example to consider, just a hypothetical: What could we \ndo? We could cut the corporate tax rate in America from 35 percent to \n30 percent. That has been a bipartisan goal for a long time. It was \npart of Romney's Presidential campaign. We could accomplish it with \nthis measure.\n  We would have enough money left to go to the payroll tax and for \nevery worker rebate the first $500 they paid in payroll tax. So every \nAmerican worker who paid more than $500 in payroll tax would get a $500 \ncheck to spend on whatever they wanted. The first tax reduction at the \ncorporate level uses about $600 billion to offset. This uses about $700 \nbillion to offset.\n  Third, we could add to that a boost to the EITC--the earned income \ntax credit--which supports many American families at the very low end \nof the economic spectrum. We could do that by literally hundreds of \ndollars a year for millions of lower income families. Again, there has \nbeen bipartisan support for expanding the earned income tax credit.\n  Three important goals, all reducing taxes or adding to a tax credit--\nall should have strong bipartisan support.\n  The American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act has revenue that could make \nour companies more competitive, could give every single worker a tax \nrebate, and could boost benefits for struggling low-income families.\n  Last month the Des Moines Register ran a column titled `` `Carbon \ntax' would help Iowa, planet.'' The column said this:\n\n       The United States could take the lead by acting on its own, \n     watch its economy grow, and let the rest of the world catch \n     up.\n       In the process, the United States would gain mastery of the \n     sustainable-energy technology that will drive economic growth \n     in the future.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my statement.\n  George W. Bush's Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson gave the same \nmessage earlier this year, saying:\n\n       A tax on carbon emissions will unleash a wave of innovation \n     to develop technologies, lower the costs of clean energy and \n     create jobs as we and other nations develop new energy \n     products and infrastructure.\n\n  Emphasizing that, coincidentally, is an article in today's New York \nTimes headed ``A Carbon Tax Could Bolster Green Energy.'' As we all \nknow, green energy jobs are exploding in this country, and we need more \nof them.\n  Treasury Secretary Paulson continued:\n\n       Republicans must not shrink from this issue. Risk \n     management is a conservative principle.\n\n  Secretary Paulson is not alone. Conservative figures such as George \nShultz, who was Secretary of State under President Reagan, emphatically \nsupport a carbon fee as the best way to address carbon pollution.\n  Art Laffer, one of the architects of President Reagan's economic \nplan, had this to say about a carbon tax and related payroll tax cut:\n\n       I think that would be very good for the economy and as an \n     adjunct, it would reduce also carbon emissions into the \n     environment.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a 2013 New York Times op-ed be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. In this New York Times op-ed, Bill Ruckelshaus, \nChristine Todd Whitman, Lee Thomas, and William Reilly wrote:\n\n       A market-based approach, like a carbon tax, would be the \n     best path to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\n  I know the big carbon polluters want this issue ignored. I know that. \nThey want to squeeze one more quarter, one more year of public subsidy \nfor their product from the rest of us. From their point of view, lunch \nis good when someone else is picking up the tab. But notwithstanding \nthe power of the big carbon polluters, I still believe this is a \nproblem we can solve.\n  Not long ago this would have been a bipartisan bill. Not long ago \nleading voices on the Republican side agreed with Democrats that the \ndangers of climate change were real. Not long ago leading Republican \nvoices agreed that carbon emissions were the culprit. And it was not \nlong ago that leading Republican voices agreed that Congress had a \nresponsibility to act. One Republican Senator won his party's \nnomination for President on a solid climate change platform. Other \nRepublican colleagues in the Senate introduced, cosponsored, or voted \nfor meaningful climate legislation in the past. Some of the proposals \nwere market-based, revenue-neutral solutions aligned with Republican \nfree market values, just like my bill today.\n  The junior Senator from Arizona--a Republican--was an original \ncosponsor of a carbon fee bill when he served in the House of \nRepresentatives. That proposal, introduced with former Republican \nCongressman Bob Inglis, would have placed a $15-per-ton fee on carbon \npollution in 2010, more than $20 in 2015, and $100 in 2040. At the \ntime, our colleague from Arizona had this to say:\n\n       If there's one economic axiom, it's that if you want less \n     of something, you tax it. Clearly, it's in our interest to \n     move away from carbon.\n\n  We simply need conscientious Republicans and Democrats to work \ntogether in good faith on a platform of fact and common sense. We know \nthis can be done because it is being done.\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\n  At the end of a speech about the American Revolution, the historian \nDavid McCullough was asked by someone in the audience why it was that \nour Founding Fathers had the courage to pledge their lives, their \nfortunes, and their sacred honor to the cause of independence when \nsigning the Declaration was signing their own death warrant. He had a \nvery simple answer. He said: It was a courageous time.\n  Well, clearly in courageous times Americans have done far more than \nsimply stand up to polluters to serve the interests of this great \nRepublic. It only takes courage to make this a courageous time too.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From The Register, Oct. 4, 2014]\n\n                  `Carbon Tax' Would Help Iowa, Planet\n\n                           (By Richard Doak)\n\n       Six years ago, the Canadian province of British Columbia \n     decided to go it alone in fighting climate change. It imposed \n     a tax on fossil fuels--coal gasoline, diesel fuel, propane \n     and natural gas.\n       By most accounts, the ``carbon tax'' has been a success. It \n     made fossil fuels more expensive, so British Columbians began \n     to conserve them and use them more efficiently. Revenue from \n     the carbon tax allows other taxes to be reduced, so the \n     province enjoys the lowest personal income tax rates in \n     Canada and some of the lowest corporate taxes in the \n     developed world.\n       Contrary to fears, the carbon tax did not cause the economy \n     of the province to collapse. Economic growth is slightly \n     better than in the rest of Canada, and the forward-looking \n     energy policy gives British Columbia a reputation as a world \n     leader in green entrepreneurship.\n       Why can't Iowa be like that?\n       Indeed, Iowa should be like that, and circumstances might \n     be right for Iowa to become the first American state to \n     employ a full-fledged carbon tax.\n       Iowa and other states already have partial carbon taxes. We \n     pay them at the pump when we buy gasoline or diesel fuel.\n       In Iowa, all gasoline and diesel fuel tax revenue is \n     earmarked for highway construction, maintenance and \n     administration. Paying the gas tax is how motorists pay for \n     the bridges and highways.\n       After the November election, when candidates are no longer \n     afraid to talk about taxes, a consensus will probably develop \n     to raise Iowa's motor fuel taxes. The current gasoline tax of \n     21 cents per gallon (19 cents for ethanol blend) and diesel \n     tax of 22.5 cents bring in about $450 million but leave the \n     state an estimated $215 million short of what's needed for \n     highways every year.\n       Closing that gap would require raising motor fuel taxes by \n     about 10 cents per gallon.\n       Instead, why not abolish motor fuel taxes and replace them \n     with a carbon tax?\n       A carbon tax would apply to all fossil fuels, not just \n     gasoline and diesel fuel. The tax on each fuel would be based \n     on its carbon content. Carbon-dense coal would be taxed more \n     heavily than relatively carbon-light natural gas.\n       The carbon tax on gasoline and diesel fuel could be \n     calibrated to bring in about the same amount of revenue as \n     the existing motor fuel tax. Additional revenue to close the \n     highway-funding gap could come from the carbon tax paid on \n     coal and natural gas used to generate electricity. This would \n     be a way for electric car owners to begin paying their share \n     of highway maintenance.\n       Electric cars contribute less for highway maintenance than \n     gasoline- or diesel-burning vehicles. (Electric cars don't \n     pay gasoline tax, but they do pay license fees and use \n     taxes.) In the future, if electric vehicles become \n     ubiquitous, it will be essential to have some source of \n     highway money beyond the gasoline tax. Having a carbon tax \n     would put Iowa ahead of the game of paying for roads in an \n     electric-car future.\n       Additional revenue from a carbon tax, beyond that needed \n     for roads, could be used to lower other taxes, as in British \n     Columbia. Since the biggest burden of a carbon tax would fall \n     on low-income people, reductions or credits for low-income \n     people should be the first priority. Lowering for abolishing \n     the corporation tax, as an incentive for businesses to locate \n     in Iowa, might be the second choice.\n       The idea of a carbon tax is to use market forces to reduce \n     the amount of carbon dioxide spewed into the atmosphere when \n     fossil fuels are burned. Economists use the term carbon \n     pricing. When the price of something goes up, people use less \n     of it. A carbon tax is intended to raise the price of fossil \n     fuels enough to discourage consumption as well as to create \n     an incentive to find alternatives.\n       As leader in biofuels and wind turbines, Iowa should be for \n     anything that incentivizes the switch to alternatives.\n       Perhaps Iowans should even be cheering for a carbon tax to \n     be imposed nationally, because, among the states, Iowa may be \n     one of the best positioned to benefit from it.\n       Of course, a national carbon tax is off the table as long \n     as Congress is full of climate-change deniers who are \n     beholden to the fossil-fuel industries. But, outside of \n     Congress, the carbon tax and other carbon-dioxide-reducing \n     strategies appear to be gaining credibility.\n       A number of major corporations, banks and institutions have \n     begun to question the conventional thinking that the economy \n     would suffer if carbon dioxide emissions were curbed. Most \n     recently, the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, a \n     group of heavyweight international leaders and economists, \n     issued a report showing that reducing carbon emissions would \n     cost the economy very little and might actually stimulate \n     economic growth. Other research published by the \n     International Monetary Fund suggests that carbon taxes, \n     rather than being a drag on an economy, can be a benefit.\n       It also appears that cutting carbon emissions can help a \n     country's economy even if other countries don't go along. \n     British Columbia has shown that a state can go it alone \n     without other states.\n       Nationally, the United States is waiting around for some \n     big international agreement that will require all countries \n     to reduce their emissions in unison. That shouldn't be \n     necessary. The United States could take the lead by acting on \n     its own, watch its economy grow, and let the rest of the \n     world catch up.\n       In the process, the United States would gain mastery of the \n     sustainable-energy technology that will drive economic growth \n     in the future.\n       Sadly, the odds of the president and Congress acting that \n     boldly on climate change are roughly nil. But maybe the \n     little state of Iowa, out here in the heart of America, could \n     nudge the nation in the right direction by setting an example \n     on its own.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, August 1, 2013]\n\n                  A Republican Case for Climate Action\n\n   (By William D. Ruckelshaus, Lee M. Thomas, William K. Reilly and \n                        Christine Todd Whitman)\n\n       Each of us took turns over the past 43 years running the \n     Environmental Protection Agency. We served Republican \n     presidents, but we have a message that transcends political \n     affiliation: the United States must move now on substantive \n     steps to curb climate change, at home and internationally.\n       There is no longer any credible scientific debate about the \n     basic facts: our world continues to warm, with the last \n     decade the hottest in modern records, and the deep ocean \n     warming faster than the earth's atmosphere. Sea level is \n     rising. Arctic Sea ice is melting years faster than \n     projected.\n       The costs of inaction are undeniable. The lines of \n     scientific evidence grow only stronger and more numerous. And \n     the window of time remaining to act is growing smaller: delay \n     could mean that warming becomes ``locked in.''\n       A market-based approach, like a carbon tax, would be the \n     best path to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, but that is \n     unachievable in the current political gridlock in Washington. \n     Dealing with this political reality, President Obama's June \n     climate action plan lays out achievable actions that would \n     deliver real progress. He will use his executive powers to \n     require reductions in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by \n     the nation's power plants and spur increased investment in \n     clean energy technology, which is inarguably the path we must \n     follow to ensure a strong economy along with a livable \n     climate.\n       The president also plans to use his regulatory power to \n     limit the powerful warming chemicals known as \n     hydrofluorocarbons and encourage the United States to join \n     with other nations to amend the Montreal Protocol to phase \n     out these chemicals. The landmark international treaty, which \n     took effect in 1989, already has been hugely successful in \n     solving the ozone problem.\n       Rather than argue against his proposals, our leaders in \n     Congress should endorse them and start the overdue debate \n     about what bigger steps are needed and how to achieve them--\n     domestically and internationally.\n       As administrators of the E.P.A. under Presidents Richard M. \n     Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, we held \n     fast to common-sense conservative principles--protecting the \n     health of the American people, working with the best \n     technology available and trusting in the innovation of \n     American business and in the market to find the best \n     solutions for the least cost.\n       That approach helped us tackle major environmental \n     challenges to our nation and the world: the pollution of our \n     rivers, dramatized when the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland \n     caught fire in 1969; the hole in the ozone layer; and the \n     devastation wrought by acid rain.\n       The solutions we supported worked, although more must be \n     done. Our rivers no longer burn, and their health continues \n     to improve. The United States led the world when nations came \n     together to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals. Acid rain \n     diminishes each year, thanks to a pioneering, market-based \n     emissions-trading system adopted under the first President \n     Bush in 1990. And despite critics' warnings, our economy has \n     continued to grow.\n       Climate change puts all our progress and our successes at \n     risk. If we could articulate one framework for successful \n     governance, perhaps it should be this: When confronted by a \n     problem, deal with it. Look at the facts,\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\n     cut through the extraneous, devise a workable solution and \n     get it done.\n       We can have both a strong economy and a livable climate. \n     All parties know that we need both. The rest of the \n     discussion is either detail, which we can resolve, or \n     purposeful delay, which we should not tolerate.\n       Mr. Obama's plan is just a start. More will be required. \n     But we must continue efforts to reduce the climate-altering \n     pollutants that threaten our planet. The only uncertainty \n     about our warming world is how bad the changes will get, and \n     how soon. What is most clear is that there is no time to \n     waste.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Economist, Sept. 19, 2011]\n\n                 Do Economists All Favour A Carbon Tax?\n\n                          (By R.A. Washington)\n\n       Last week, a Twitter conversation broke out among a few \n     economists concerning whether any serious economists opposed \n     a carbon tax. No, concluded the tweeters, but Tyler Cowen \n     begged to differ. Mr. Cowen writes that he personally favours \n     a carbon tax but can imagine a number of principled reasons \n     other economists might not.\n       Why would we expect economists to support a carbon tax? Its \n     very close to the economic ideal. Global warming is a \n     phenomenon associated with emissions of greenhouse gases over \n     and above natural cycles--largely those resulting from the \n     burning of carbon fuels humans have dug up out of the ground. \n     We expect normal economic activity to maximise social good \n     because each individual balances costs and benefits when \n     making economic decisions. Carbon emissions represent a \n     negative externality. When an individual takes an economic \n     action with some fossil-fuel energy content--whether running \n     a petrol-powered lawnmower, turning on a light, or buying a \n     bunch of grapes--that person balances their personal benefits \n     against the costs of the action. The cost to them of the \n     climate change resulting from the carbon content of that \n     decisions, however, is effectively zero and is rationally \n     ignored. The decision to ignore carbon content, when \n     aggregated over the whole of humanity, generates huge carbon \n     dioxide emissions and rising global temperatures.\n       The economic solution is to tax the externality so that the \n     social cost of carbon is reflected in the individual \n     consumers decision. The carbon tax is an elegant solution to \n     a complicated problem, which allows the everyday business of \n     consumer decision making to do the work of emission \n     reduction. It's by no means the only economically sensible \n     policy response to the threat of climate change, but it is \n     the one we'd expect economists to embrace.\n       Mr. Cowen argues for caution on this point for several \n     reasons. A carbon tax will be less effective if it's not \n     universally applied, potentially leading to carbon leakage to \n     countries with looser environmental rules. He worries that \n     where carbon fees have been applied innovation has not been \n     quick to respond. He fears that good substitutes for carbon \n     fuels don't exist, especially in the transport sector, and \n     worries that higher fuel prices might harm the economy. He \n     suggests that a ``green-energy subsidies first'' policy might \n     make more sense, and he talks about distributional and rent-\n     seeking costs of the policy.\n       I think the weakness of these arguments is telling, and \n     it's not surprising that Mr. Cowen continues to support a \n     carbon tax. What if a carbon price doesn't immediately drive \n     emission reductions? Then the tax will be an effective \n     revenue raiser, much more efficient than a tax on income. \n     Either way you win. The worry about carbon leakage is a real \n     one, but this dynamic also implies that each new country that \n     prices carbon increases the benefit of existing carbon-price \n     policies in other countries.\n       Substitution in the transport sector is somewhat \n     problematic, but a viable carbon price would not have much \n     effect on petrol costs at the outset. A carbon tax of $30 per \n     tonne of CO2 would only increase petrol costs by about 9 \n     cents per gallon. This is dwarfed by moves in the market \n     price of petrol. The vulnerability of the American economy to \n     oil shocks argues for an increased tax on petrol, but that's \n     a different policy debate. Mr. Cowen seems to ignore the fact \n     that oil is just one small part of the American economy's \n     fossil-fuel use.\n       A carbon tax would attract rent-seeking, but arguably less \n     than alternative policies, like subsidies or a cap-and-trade \n     system. Importantly, money spent on adaptation or post hoc \n     climate-disaster relief is also subject to rent-seeking and \n     corruption issues. Given that many poor countries with weak \n     institutions are likely to feel the brunt of the impact of \n     global warming first and are likely to be poor spenders of \n     the aid money that will invariably flow, a carbon tax looks \n     like one of the policy solutions best suited to the \n     minimisation of these ills.\n       Mr. Cowen doesn't mention what I see as one of the most \n     important roles of a carbon tax: as a check on other ill-\n     advised programmes. A carbon tax would have quickly made the \n     net dirtiness of corn-based ethanol obvious (by helping to \n     offset subsidies and making corn-based ethanol more \n     expensive). It would be more difficult to roll out and \n     sustain such misguided programmes with a carbon tax, and the \n     ones that went ahead anyway would do less damage. A carbon \n     tax is also the easiest way to capture whatever low-hanging \n     emission-reduction fruit is out there. Right now, consumers \n     are generally indifferent between similarly-priced goods with \n     wildly different carbon profiles. A carbon tax encourages \n     consumers to realise the easy carbon gains available from \n     switching to good low-carbon substitutes wherever they exist.\n       The biggest problem with a carbon tax is that America's \n     government seems unable to deliver one. Attitudes may change, \n     however, and near-uniform economist support for the policy \n     (probably) doesn't hurt its odds of eventual passage.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 18, 2014]\n\n                A Carbon Tax Could Bolster Green Energy\n\n                          (By Eduardo Porter)\n\n\n                             ECONOMIC SCENE\n\n       A couple of years ago, the smart money was on wind. In \n     2012, 13 gigawatts worth of wind-powered electricity \n     generation capacity was installed in the United States, \n     enough to meet the needs of roughly three million homes. That \n     was some 40 percent of all the capacity added to the nation's \n     power grid that year, up from seven gigawatts added in 2011 \n     and just over five in 2010.\n       But then a federal subsidy ended. Only one gigawatt worth \n     of wind power capacity was installed in 2013. In the first \n     half of 2014, additions totaled 0.835 gigawatts. Facing a \n     Congress controlled by Republicans with little interest in \n     renewable energy, wind power's future suddenly appears much \n     more uncertain.\n       ``Wind is competitive in more and more markets,'' said \n     Letha Tawney at the World Resources Institute. ``But any time \n     there is uncertainty about the production tax credit, it all \n     stops.''\n       Wobbles on the road to a low-carbon future are hardly \n     unique to the United States. In its latest Energy Technology \n     Perspectives report, the International Energy Agency noted \n     that the deployment of photovoltaic solar- and wind-powered \n     electricity was meeting goals established to help prevent \n     temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 \n     degrees Fahrenheit) above the average in the preindustrial \n     era, the limit agreed to by the world's leaders to avoid \n     truly disruptive climatic upheaval.\n       In the same report, however, the organization noted that \n     other technologies--bioenergy, geothermal and offshore wind--\n     were lagging. And it pointed out that worldwide investment in \n     renewable power was slowing, falling to $211 billion in 2013, \n     22 percent less than in 2011.\n       These wobbles underscore both the good news and the bad \n     news about the world's halting progress toward reducing the \n     greenhouse gas emissions that are capturing heat in the \n     atmosphere and changing the world's climate.\n       The good news is that humanity is developing promising \n     technologies that could put civilization on a low carbon path \n     that might prevent climate disruption.\n       These technologies allowed the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to pass new rules aimed at achieving a 30 percent \n     reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from American power \n     plants by 2030, compared with 2005.\n       They allowed President Obama last week to promise that the \n     United States would curb total greenhouse gas emissions by 26 \n     to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025--a big step that, \n     White House officials say, can be achieved without further \n     action from Congress. And they allowed China to commit to \n     start cutting emissions after 2030.\n       The bad news is that civilization is mostly not yet on such \n     a low carbon path. While promising technologies to get there \n     have been developed, it is unclear whether nations will \n     muster the political will and mobilize the needed investments \n     to deploy them.\n       New energy technologies have become decidedly more \n     competitive. The United States' Energy Information \n     Administration projects that the levelized cost of onshore \n     wind energy coming on stream in 2019--a measure that includes \n     everything from capital costs to operational outlays--could \n     be as little as $71 per megawatt-hour measured in 2012 \n     dollars, even without subsidies. This is $16 less than the \n     lower cost projection four years ago for wind energy coming \n     online in 2015.\n       Similarly, projections for the levelized cost of energy \n     from photovoltaic solar cells have tumbled by more than 40 \n     percent, much faster than the cost projections of energy from \n     coal or natural gas.\n       Challenges remain to relying on intermittent energy sources \n     like the sun or the wind for power. Still, experts believe \n     that hitching solar and wind plants to gas-fired generators, \n     and using new load management technologies to align demand \n     for power with the variable supply, offer a promising path \n     for aggressively reducing the amount of carbon the power \n     industry pumps into the atmosphere, which accounts for nearly \n     40 percent of the nation's total carbon dioxide emissions.\n       And new Energy Information Administration projections to \n     2040 show prices for renewables falling even lower. By then, \n     electricity from photovoltaic solar plants could be generated \n     for as little as $86.50 per megawatt-hour, without subsidies. \n     In some areas wind-based plants could produce it for as \n     little as $63.40.\n       Nuclear energy is also becoming more competitive. Without \n     any subsidies, new-generation nuclear power coming on stream \n     in 2040 could cost as little as $80 per megawatt-hour, all \n     costs considered. This is only marginally more expensive than \n     electricity produced with coal or natural gas, even without \n     the added cost of capturing the carbon dioxide.\n\n[[Page S6153]]\n\n       And there are much more optimistic cost assessments out \n     there than the Energy Information Administration's.\n       But for all the optimism generated by cheaper renewable \n     fuels, they do not, on their own, put the world on the low-\n     carbon path necessary to keep climate change in check.\n       Progress is faltering on several fronts. The precipitous \n     fall in the prices of photovoltaic cells from 2008 to 2012 \n     pretty much stopped in 2013, after rapid consolidation of the \n     industry.\n       The International Energy Agency now projects that installed \n     global nuclear capacity in 2025 will fall 5 percent, to 24 \n     percent below what will be needed to stay on the safe side of \n     climate change. And carbon capture technologies, which will \n     be essential if the world is to keep consuming any form of \n     fossil fuel, remain hampered by high costs, meager investment \n     and scant political commitment.\n       ``The unrelenting rise in coal use without deployment of \n     carbon capture and storage is fundamentally incompatible with \n     climate change objectives,'' noted the International Energy \n     Agency in its Technology Perspectives report.\n       Despite the falling costs of renewable energy in the United \n     States, the Energy Information Administration's baseline \n     assumptions project that in 2040 only 16.5 percent of \n     electricity generation will come from renewable energy \n     sources, up from some 13 percent today. More than two-thirds \n     will come from coal and gas. Without some carbon capture and \n     storage technology, drastic climate change is almost \n     certainly unavoidable.\n       What is necessary to get us on a safer path?\n       White House officials trust that the administration has the \n     tools, including fuel economy and appliance efficiency \n     standards, the Environmental Protection Agency's new limits \n     on power plant emissions and regulations to limit other \n     greenhouse gases.\n       Yet the Energy Information Administration's projections \n     suggest how hard the task will be. Though they were developed \n     before the Environmental Protection Agency issued its new \n     rules, they included hypothetical outlines that could mimic \n     some of its effects. In one, coal power plants were \n     decommissioned more quickly; in another, subsidies to \n     renewable energy were kept until 2040. In another, the price \n     of renewables fell faster than expected. None of them did \n     much to move the carbon dial.\n       There is one tool available to trim carbon emissions on a \n     relevant scale: a carbon tax. That solution, however, remains \n     off the table.\n       If a carbon tax were to be imposed next year, starting at \n     $25 and rising by 5 percent a year, the Energy Information \n     Administration estimates, carbon dioxide emissions from \n     American power plants would fall to only 419 million tons by \n     2040, about one-fifth of where they are today. Total carbon \n     dioxide emissions from energy in the United States would fall \n     to 3.6 billion tons--1.8 billion tons less than today. By \n     providing a monetary incentive, economists say, such a tax \n     would offer by far the most effective way to encourage \n     business and individuals to reduce their use of fossil fuels \n     and invest in alternatives.\n       Is this enough? No. This proposal still leaves the United \n     States short of the 8o percent cut in greenhouse gas \n     emissions that the White House is aiming for and that experts \n     consider necessary by 2050 to prevent climatic havoc. But at \n     least it's in the same order of magnitude.\n       Most important, perhaps, the Energy Information \n     Administration's estimates make clear that the real \n     constraint lies not in our ability to develop the necessary \n     technologies but in our political will to deploy them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Portman):\n  S. 2941. A bill to combat human trafficking; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with \nSenator Portman, the Combat Human Trafficking Act of 2014.\n  Human trafficking is estimated to be a $32 billion criminal \nenterprise, making it the second largest criminal industry in the \nworld, behind the drug trade. Many steps need to be taken to combat \nthis problem. But we cannot escape this simple truth: without demand \nfor the services performed by trafficking victims, the problem would \nnot exist.\n  The bill we are introducing today would reduce the demand for human \ntrafficking, particularly the commercial sexual exploitation of \nchildren, by holding buyers accountable and making it easier for law \nenforcement to investigate and prosecute all persons who participate in \nsex trafficking.\n  Sex trafficking is not a victimless crime. In the United States, the \naverage age that a person is first trafficked is between 12 and 14. \nMany of these children continue to be exploited into adulthood. A study \nof women and girls involved in street prostitution in my hometown of \nSan Francisco found that 82 percent had been physically assaulted, 83 \npercent were threatened with a weapon, and 68 percent were raped. The \noverwhelming majority of sex trafficking victims are American \ncitizens--83 percent by one estimate from the Department of Justice.\n  I am encouraged that Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nagencies are taking steps to combat human trafficking. Between January \nand June of this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered \n168 trafficking victims and arrested 281 sex traffickers in ``Operation \nCross Country.''\n  I commend these efforts, but more needs to be done to target the \nperpetrators who are fueling demand for trafficking crimes--the buyers \nof sex acts from trafficking victims. Many buyers of sex are \n``hobbyists'' who purchase sex repeatedly. Because buyers are rarely \narrested, much less prosecuted, the demand for commercial sex continues \nunabated.\n  Without buyers, sex trafficking would cease to exist. As Luis \nCdeBaca, the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for the Office to Monitor and \nCombat Trafficking in Persons, noted, ``[n]o girl or woman would be a \nvictim of sex trafficking if there were no profits to be made from \ntheir exploitation.''\n  The Combat Human Trafficking Act of 2014 would address this problem, \nby incentivizing federal and state law enforcement officers to target \nbuyers and providing new authorities to prosecute all who engage in the \ncrime of sex trafficking.\n  First, the bill would clarify that buyers of sex acts from \ntrafficking victims can be prosecuted under the federal commercial sex \ntrafficking statute. This provision would codify the Eighth Circuit's \ndecision in United States v. Jungers, which held that this statute \nencompasses buyers, in addition to sellers. Despite this favorable \nruling, there is no guarantee that other courts will follow this \nprecedent.\n  Second, the bill would hold buyers and sellers of child sex acts \naccountable for their actions, even if they claim they were unaware of \nthe age of a minor victim. At times, it can be difficult for a \nprosecutor to prove that a buyer was aware of the victim's age. \nSuccessful cases can require the child victim to testify to this fact, \nsubjecting the victim to re-traumatization. The bill would draw a clear \nline: if you purchase sex from an underage child, you can be \nprosecuted. Period.\n  Third, the bill would grant judges greater flexibility to impose an \nappropriate term of supervised release on sex traffickers. Current law \ncontains an anomaly: a person convicted of violating the commercial sex \ntrafficking statute or attempting to violate the statute may be subject \nto a longer term of supervised release than a person who is convicted \nof conspiring to violate the statute. Conspiring to traffic underage \nchildren is as serious as attempting to commit this crime and should be \npunished the same.\n  Fourth, the bill would require the Bureau of Justice Statistics to \nprepare annual reports on the number of arrests, prosecutions, and \nconvictions of sex traffickers and buyers of sex from trafficked \nvictims in the state court system. Very little data is available on the \nprosecutions made under anti-trafficking laws. This provision would \nprovide additional data and encourage state and local governments to \nincrease enforcement against sellers and buyers of sex from trafficked \nvictims.\n  Fifth, the Combat Human Trafficking Act would ensure that training \nprograms for federal and state law enforcement officers include \ncomponents on effective methods to target and prosecute the buyers of \nsex acts from trafficked victims. This would equip prosecutors with the \ntools they need to target buyers, encouraging prosecution of these \nperpetrators.\n  Sixth, the bill would authorize federal and state officials to seek a \nwiretap to investigate and prosecute any human trafficking-related \noffense. Under current law, a federal law enforcement officer may seek \na wiretap in an investigation under the commercial sex trafficking \nstatute, but not under a number of other statutes that address human \ntrafficking-related offenses, such as forced labor and involuntary \nservitude. Similarly, a state law enforcement officer may seek a \nwiretap to investigate a kidnapping offense, but not an offense for \nhuman trafficking, child sexual exploitation,\n\n[[Page S6154]]\n\nor child pornography production. Our bill would fix those omissions.\n  Finally, this legislation would strengthen the rights of crime \nvictims. The bill would amend the Crime Victims' Rights Act to provide \nvictims with the right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea \nagreement or deferred prosecution agreement. The exclusion of victims \nin these early stages of a criminal case profoundly impairs victims' \nrights because, by the nature of these events, there often is no later \nproceeding in which victims can exercise their rights.\n  The bill would also ensure that crime victims have access to \nappellate review when their rights are denied in the lower court. \nRegrettably, five appellate courts have mis-applied the Crime Victims' \nRights Act by imposing an especially high standard for reviewing \nappeals by victims, requiring them to show ``clear and indisputable \nerror''. Four other circuits have applied the correct standard: the \nordinary appellate standard of legal error or abuse of discretion. This \nbill resolves the issue, setting a uniform standard for victims in all \ncircuits by codifying the more victim-protecting rule, that the \nappellate court ``shall apply ordinary standards of appellate review.''\n  I am pleased that this bill has the support of numerous law \nenforcement and anti-trafficking organizations: the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Association, Shared Hope International, ECPAT-USA, \nCoalition Against Trafficking in Women, CATW, Human Rights Project for \nGirls, Survivors for Solutions, Sanctuary For Families, World Hope \nInternational, Prostitution Research & Education, MISSSEY, and Breaking \nFree. These groups are on the forefront in the fight against sex \ntrafficking, and I am proud to have their support.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Portman in supporting \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2941\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, in his State of the Union Address last \nJanuary, President Obama announced what he called a year of action. \nArmed with pen and phone, he promised to take action where Congress \nwouldn't. At the time, I warned that these threats were a gathering \ndanger to the separation of powers established in our Constitution.\n  The President is now threatening to implement a mass amnesty from our \nimmigration laws by Executive fiat. He plans to act without the support \nof Congress or the American people. In fact, he has conveniently waited \nuntil after the recent elections to do so in order to avoid being \npunished at the ballot box. This Executive order will be the \nculmination of his self-proclaimed year of action.\n  The President may think of this Executive action as a political \nvictory in a year filled with so many failures and defeats for him and \nhis party, but history will surely view it as a serious blow to the \nsystems of checks and balances established by the Framers. In reality, \nthis was a year in which the President's abuse of Executive power came \ninto clear focus.\n  Today I would like to review President Obama's pattern of \nunconstitutional Executive action this year. I would like to explain \nwhy the mass amnesty he has been threatening is merely the latest in a \nlong list of abuses of his Executive authority. And I would like to \noffer a few thoughts about what the Senate can do about these kinds of \nabuses.\n  After the President's State of the Union Address, I wrote to the \nAttorney General on January 31. I wrote that I was ``gravely concerned \nthat the system of checks and balances enshrined in the Constitution \n[was] threatened by the President's determination to take unilateral \naction.'' In short, I made clear that ``while the President has a pen \nand phone, we have a Constitution that places limits on his use of them \nto issue Executive Orders.'' Indeed, my concern about the President's \nthreat to take action on his own was ``heightened by the \nadministration's record of failing to discharge his constitutional \nduties to `take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' ''\n\n  By then, President Obama had already failed to execute the laws in \nmany areas. For example, the administration was rewriting ObamaCare's \ndeadlines at will and was making little effort to enforce the \nControlled Substances Act in some States. These abuses rang like alarm \nbells--alarm bells in the night--even before the so-called year of \naction began.\n  Indeed, in December of 2013 a liberal law professor testified before \nthe House Judiciary Committee that ``despite the fact that I once voted \nfor President Obama, personal admiration is no substitute for the \nconstitutional principles at stake in this controversy.''\n  The professor went on:\n\n       When a President claims the inherent power of both \n     legislation and enforcement, he becomes a virtual government \n     unto himself. He is not simply posing a danger to the \n     constitutional system; he becomes the very danger that the \n     Constitution was designed to avoid.\n\n  Against this backdrop, I asked the President to defend the legal \nbasis for the actions he was threatening. In my letter I asked the \nAttorney General to direct the Justice Department's Office of Legal \nCounsel to publicly disclose its opinions concerning the lawfulness of \nthe Executive orders proposed by the President. That is what the Office \nof Legal Counsel does--it reviews all Executive orders to determine \nwhether they are constitutional and lawful. Many of its opinions have \nbeen made public in the past. I hoped this transparency would allow \nCongress and then the American people to better understand the alleged \nlegal basis for these orders and challenge them, if necessary.\n  Providing Congress and the American people with the legal opinions \nsupporting his unilateral actions seemed like a reasonable request of a \nPresident who had claimed to support ``an unprecedented level of \nopenness'' and transparency in government. But February passed, March \nas well, April came and went, winter turned into spring, and summer was \naround the corner. Finally, on May 20 I received a response from the \nJustice Department. In summary, the Department told me no, they \nwouldn't disclose these opinions to the public. However, the Department \nassured me that if I had questions about particular Office of Legal \nCounsel advice documents, it would assist me in understanding them--in \ntheir words--to the fullest extent possible. In short, the \nadministration stonewalled legitimate questions from Congress, as it \noften does, and stymied this Congress from carrying out its \nconstitutional responsibility of oversight.\n  As it turned out, within a few weeks I and many others in Congress \nhad very serious questions about a specific Executive action and its \neffect on our national security, and we had questions about the advice \nprovided by the Office of Legal Counsel. The American people had the \nsame questions as well.\n  In early June the President decided to release five Taliban detainees \nheld at Guantanamo Bay in exchange for SGT Bowe Bergdahl, a U.S. \nsoldier who had been captured in 2009. The detainees were reportedly \nsenior-level Taliban commanders. Some had direct links to Al Qaeda, and \nall were reportedly determined to be a high risk to the United States \nand were recommended for continued detention. Nonetheless, President \nObama decided to free these prisoners from Guantanamo.\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\n  There was one problem, however: The National Defense Authorization \nAct required the administration to notify Congress 30 days before any \ndetainee could be transferred from Guantanamo. Under this statute, the \nnotification was required to include lots of detailed information about \nthe basis for the transfer--why it was in our national security \ninterests and any actions taken to prevent detainees from returning to \nthe battlefield. In fact, none of this information was provided to the \nCongress before these detainees were released, as the very law \nrequires. And perhaps not coincidentally, this was information that \nMembers of Congress and the American people were very interested in \nlearning. There were and still are serious questions about whether \nreleasing these detainees from Guantanamo was a good idea.\n  So the President decided to act alone, without regard to Congress's \nrole in our system of checks and balances and directly contrary to a \nlaw the President had recently signed.\n  Then the administration began changing its story about why it broke \nthe law. First, they said it was Sergeant Bergdahl's health that \nrequired his release--his release without notifying Congress. Then they \nsaid it was operational security surrounding the release itself. Then \nthey said it was the nature of the negotiations with the Taliban.\n  But there was one point administration officials were clear about--\nthe Department of Justice had provided legal advice that justified \ntransferring these detainees from Guantanamo without informing Congress \nas the law required. This was difficult to square with the limited \npowers of the Executive established in the Constitution.\n  In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer, otherwise known as the \nsteel seizure case, the Supreme Court set a clear precedent \nestablishing what a President can and cannot do. In that case the \nSupreme Court held that President Truman's Executive order seizing \nsteel mills to avoid a strike during the Korean war was \nunconstitutional. In doing so, the Court emphasized that the Executive \nisn't above the law as written by Congress.\n\n       The Founders of this Nation entrusted the lawmaking powers \n     to the Congress alone in both good and bad times. It would do \n     no good to recall the historical events, the fears of power \n     and the hopes for freedom that lay behind their choice. Such \n     a review would but confirm our holding that this seizure \n     order cannot stand.\n\n  Moreover, Justice Jackson emphasized that point here:\n\n       When the President takes measures incompatible with the \n     expressed or implied will of Congress, the authority of the \n     President is at its lowest [ebb].\n\n  Just as the Supreme Court held that President Truman had unlawfully \nseized the steel mills, President Obama's release of the Taliban \ndetainees without a required notification effectively rewrote the law \ncontrary to the will of Congress.\n  In short, there didn't seem to be a lawful basis for what the \nPresident had done. In fact, it seemed plainly illegal.\n  So I took the Department up on its offer. In a letter to the Attorney \nGeneral dated June 5, I requested that he direct the Office of Legal \nCounsel to make public ``its opinions, analyses, and conclusions \nconcerning the lawfulness'' of the transfer without compliance with the \nstatute that required congressional notification. I went on to say:\n\n       It is obviously too late for Congress to express its \n     concerns about these transfers in time to prevent them. \n     However, this measure of transparency will at least allow the \n     American people to better understand the Administration's \n     purported basis for ignoring the legal requirement that \n     Congress be notified in advance, and shed additional light on \n     this controversial decision.\n\n  It is now 6 months later, and the Attorney General hasn't given me \nthe courtesy of a response to my letter. We still don't know how the \nDepartment justified the release of these detainees. We don't know the \nlegal basis or the underlying facts that were relied upon. That should \nnot be acceptable to anyone, but sadly it has become commonplace with \nthe Obama administration.\n  It turns out that to this Justice Department, assisting me ``to the \nfullest extent possible'' is actually indistinguishable from ignoring \nmy request completely.\n  Shortly thereafter, in August, the Government Accountability Office \nconcluded that the administration acted illegally when it released \nthese senior-level Taliban commanders from Guantanamo without notifying \nCongress, as the law recently signed by the President demanded.\n  Let's be clear. That wasn't a Member of Congress reaching that \nconclusion. It wasn't a political operative or a talking head on \ntelevision. It was an independent, nonpartisan government agency. So \nthe GAO effectively said: President Obama, you broke the law.\n  So perhaps it makes sense that the Department of Justice couldn't \nrespond to my letter. Maybe even the very smart lawyers in the Office \nof Legal Counsel couldn't come up with a justification for what \nhappened that could pass the laugh test.\n  But that wasn't the only rebuke the President suffered this year \nafter trampling on Congress's role under the Constitution. The Supreme \nCourt was forced to rein in President Obama as well in a dispute over \nhis powers to make recess appointments.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution provides for only two ways \nin which Presidents may appoint certain officers. First, it provides \nthat the President nominates and, with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, appoints various officers. Second, it permits the President to \nmake temporary appointments when a vacancy in one of those offices \nhappens when the Senate is in recess.\n  Back in 2012, President Obama made four appointments to various \nexecutive branch positions. They were purportedly based on the recess \nappointments clause. But he took this action even though they weren't \nmade, in the words of the Constitution, ``during the recess of the \nSenate'' because the Senate was still in session.\n  No President in history had ever tried to make recess appointments \nwhen the Senate said it was in session, but this President once again \ndecided to go around Congress.\n  In June of this year, the Supreme Court struck down these \nappointments as unconstitutional. It wasn't a split decision. It wasn't \n5 to 4 along party lines. It was unanimous. Every Justice agreed--those \nappointed by both Republicans and Democrats. That included two Justices \nappointed by President Obama himself. It was the Supreme Court's \nbiggest rebuke to any President since 1974, when it ordered President \nNixon to produce the Watergate tapes.\n\n  This was a case where the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion didn't \npass the laugh test again. So the Supreme Court unanimously said: \nPresident Obama, you broke the law.\n  So this purported year of action has brought into focus a President \nwith little respect for the roles of the coequal branches of \ngovernment, unwilling to explain the legal basis for his actions, and \nrebuked by the courts and independent agencies for overstepping his \nbounds--quite out of character with somebody who proudly says he is a \nprofessor of constitutional law.\n  Now, again, the President is threatening to act unilaterally on \nimmigration. If we thought this year's events so far would have given \nthe President pause about his ``go it alone'' approach, apparently we \nwould be wrong.\n  Of course one of the reasons I oppose mass amnesty is because it is \nbad policy. Immigration reform should begin with securing our borders. \nBorder security is among the most basic responsibilities of any country \nand somewhat the definition of what sovereignty is all about.\n  But this administration hasn't done that. To the contrary, according \nto recent news reports it has freed alleged kidnappers, rapists, and \nmurderers into communities in the United States rather than deport \nthem. It has sacrificed public safety in order to provide relief for \npeople who are here illegally.\n  But the President's unilateral action on immigration isn't just bad \npolicy, it is contrary to the rule of law. It is unconstitutional for \nthe executive branch to nullify or even unilaterally rewrite the \nimmigration laws that the people of the United States through their \nelected representatives have chosen to enact.\n  We have been hearing about the possibility of an Executive action on \nimmigration for many months. It will apparently involve steps to allow \nmillions of people illegally present in the United States to live, \nwork, and collect benefits here.\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\n  The Democratic leadership wants to compare what is being threatened \nhere to the Executive actions of past Presidents on immigration, but \nthe actions of Presidents Reagan and Bush were merely tying up loose \nends, carrying out a law Congress at that time had just passed. They \nestablished policies that were later put in the statute in 1990. \nPresident Obama is threatening to act directly against the wishes of \nCongress and on a far greater scope and scale. That is why I and 21 \nother Senators wrote to the President on April 24 to express our grave \nconcerns about the lawfulness of what was reportedly under \nconsideration, and apparently our warnings were not heeded.\n  Now, if the President acts after repeated calls by congressional \nleaders not to do so, it will severely damage his relationship with the \nnew Congress elected by the American people.\n  But the core issue is this: Under our Constitution, the Congress \nmakes the law. Under article II, section 3, the President is charged \nwith taking care that these laws are faithfully executed. But if \nPresident Obama effectively legalizes people who are here unlawfully, \nno one will be able to reasonably argue that he is faithfully executing \nour laws. Once again, that doesn't pass the laugh test.\n  So, like the Government Accountability Office and the Supreme Court \nearlier this year, I say: President Obama, if you take this Executive \naction on immigration, you will be breaking the law, and even more than \nthat, you will be violating the Constitution.\n  And the President knows this. Just a few years ago he conceded:\n\n       This notion that somehow I can just change the laws \n     unilaterally is just not true. The fact of the matter is \n     there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. And I \n     think there's been a great disservice done to the cause of \n     getting . . . comprehensive [immigration] legislation passed \n     by perpetrating the notion that somehow, by myself, I can go \n     and do these things. It's just not true. We live in a \n     democracy. We have to pass bills through the legislature, and \n     then I can sign it.\n\n  That is the end of a quote of the President that speaks to exactly \nwhat the responsibilities of a President happen to be and how they \nshould be viewed and how he ought to be acting now. The President was \nright then, even if he doesn't want to live by his own words now. There \nare no shortcuts to following the Constitution.\n  Now what we are likely to hear from the administration is that this \nExecutive action is simply a lawful exercise of enforcement discretion. \nIt is not. It is simply not an exercise of enforcement discretion. \nLawful enforcement discretion is exercised on an individual case-by-\ncase basis. So whether enforcement action takes place is informed by a \ncareful evaluation of the facts in a particular case as each case \npresents itself. Lawful enforcement discretion isn't selecting entire \ncategories of individuals and telling them that going forward the law \nwon't be applied to them. That is what President Obama is threatening \nto do.\n  This shouldn't only concern constitutional scholars and lawyers. It \nis no exaggeration to say that the freedom of the American people is at \nstake. That is what the Framers believed. Listen to Federalist Paper \n51. James Madison wrote that ``separate and distinct exercise of \ndifferent powers of government'' is ``essential to the preservation of \nliberty.''\n  Moreover, in the Steel Seizure case I quoted, Justice Frankfurter \nwarned that ``the accretion of dangerous power does not come in a day. \nIt does come, however slowly, from the generative force of unchecked \ndisregard of the restrictions that fence in even the most disinterested \nassertion of authority.''\n  President Obama's actions this year wreak of unchecked disregard for \nthe restrictions of his authority. In his remarks after the recent \nelections, President Obama repeatedly emphasized that his Executive \nactions would be lawful, but, as this year has shown, he has repeatedly \nacted illegally even though the Department of Justice evidently had \nassured him otherwise. The Office of Legal Counsel doesn't appear to be \nproviding independent legal advice to the President; it is simply \nrubberstamping whatever he wants to do. So it is cold comfort for the \nPresident to assure us that anything he will do is legal.\n  Let's go back to the bedrock principles of our country's Founders. \nThe Framers of the Constitution knew an abusive Executive when they saw \none. They sent the Declaration of Independence to a King who had \nignored and abused their legislatures and laws. The Framers would also \nhave recognized the specific kinds of Executive abuses as reflected in \nPresident Obama's mass amnesty. They would have referred to them as the \nroyal suspending and dispensing powers. But George III didn't even try \nto abuse colonists with these powers. Why? Because Parliament had \ndenied them to the King 100 years before the American Revolution.\n  You see, the Kings of England had traditionally asserted the power to \nsuspend the operation of certain laws or to grant dispensations \nprospectively excusing particular individuals from compliance. But as \ndeference to the King's authorities eroded, these powers became more \ncontroversial.\n  As part of the Glorious Revolution in the late 17th century, these \nroyal powers were terminated. The first two articles in the English \nBill of Rights of 1689 made it illegal for the King to exercise the \n``pretended power of suspending the laws and dispensing with the \nlaws.'' This happened a century before our own Constitutional \nConvention. So when the Framers met in Philadelphia, these were abuses \nlong since remedied in England. Instead, the Framers charged the \nPresident with the constitutional duty to take care that the laws are \nfaithfully executed.\n  With his talk now of mass amnesty, President Obama is threatening to \nabandon his constitutional duty. He is threatening to reassert royal \npowers that even the Framers thought were long abolished. He is \nthreatening to take our country backward a century before the American \nRevolution.\n  When talking about immigration policy, the President has acknowledged \nthat he isn't a King, so common sense tells me he shouldn't act like \none.\n  During the President's remaining 2 years in office, how should the \nSenate respond to his illegal Executive action on immigration or any \nother Executive abuses? In some cases we can use the power of the purse \nto defund them. In other cases we may use our congressional oversight \ntools to expose them. In still other cases, we may be able to pass \nlegislation to do away with them completely. These tools have been \navailable to the Senate since President Obama was elected. It should \ncome as no surprise that the Democrats in the majority didn't use them \nto confront his abuses of power. So in the 114th Congress, we \nRepublicans intend to use that.\n\n  The best course of action for the President is this: Learn from \nPresident Clinton. He lost control of the Congress 2 years after he \nbecame President. He decided to show leadership and work with the \nCongress of the United States. Great things happened with a Republican \nCongress and a Democratic President. We had welfare reform. We had 40 \npercent of the people leave the welfare rolls. We had tax reform. We \nhad budgets that were balanced and paid down $568 billion on the \nnational debt. There are things we can do together very early.\n  The President wants patent trolling and corporate tax reform. There \nare a lot of things we can work on together.\n  I have been led to believe that the President is very much a free \ntrade person, and I believe he is. We could pass trade promotion \nauthority. We could work together with the President in the early \nmonths of next year and we could gain credibility. Under his \nleadership, we could reform an immigration system that needs reform. \nBut, no, I think the President is going to take another route and \nretard the cooperation that is potentially available to him just as it \nwas when President Clinton was President.\n  I hope the President will rethink what he wants to do and show the \nsame leadership that President Clinton did so we can get off to a very \ngood start next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/19/senate-section/article/S6161-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6161-S6162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
