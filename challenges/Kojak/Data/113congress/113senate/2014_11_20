Mr. President, the famous poet Oliver Wendell Holmes said: \n``Put not your trust in money, but put your money in trust.'' That is \nwhat he said. Since 2005 the Senate has put its money--precious \ntaxpayer dollars--into the trusted hands of a man by the name of Chris \nDoby. He is the financial clerk of the Senate. He has proven himself to \nbe equal to the task. That is an understatement. Through budget cuts, \nsequestration, and even a government shutdown, Senators and staff knew \nthat Chris Doby and his team would make it work, no matter what took \nplace.\n  There is just one story I will share with the Senate. In the midst of \nthe government shutdown, Senate employees had no assurance of when \ntheir next paycheck would come. Staffers with families, mortgages, and \nstudent loan payments all hoped the shutdown would not be their \npersonal financial disaster. Missing a check or two can be very \ndifficult for most everyone.\n  After 16 days, Congress passed legislation funding the government, \nand the shutdown came to an end. That was October 16, 2013, just 2 days \nbefore payday for Senate staffers. It is important to understand that \nprocessing payroll for almost 7,000 employees normally takes about a \nweek. But anticipating what a missed paycheck would mean for his fellow \nSenate employees, Chris Doby calmly pushed them to make it work.\n\n  So in less than 48 hours, with a very depleted staff, Chris and the \nSenate Disbursing Office ensured that every Senate staffer received \ntheir paycheck on time. Because of their efforts, mortgage payments \nwere made, groceries were purchased, and working families breathed a \nsigh of relief.\n  I was trying to think what I could say today to indicate to this good \nman and his family and his friends and Senate staffers what a good \nperson he is and what a good professional he is. The comparison I \nthought I would make is this. When I was a boy, I used to love to \nlisten to the game of the day on radio, Mutual Radio Network in the \ntown I lived in, a little town in Nevada. We, of course, had no TV. But \nradio reception came in pretty good during the day. I do not remember \nthe station, but we could listen to the radio.\n  On the game of the day, I focused on some people who were so good and \nwho later became even better than I had imagined. One of those people \nwho is now in the Baseball Hall of Fame was a man by the name of Larry \nDoby. He was a center fielder for the Cleveland Indians. He was good. \nHe could run fast, jump high. He hit with power. He stole bases. He was \nvery good.\n  This Doby we have in the Senate, in my opinion, is somebody who, just \nlike Larry Doby, would make the All-Star\n\n[[Page S6164]]\n\nteam and should be in the Senate Hall of Fame for the good work he has \ndone over these many years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6164-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to say a few words this \nmorning about President Obama's proposed Executive action on \nimmigration. I will begin with a quote from the President himself. \n``Democracy is hard,'' he said during a commencement speech in Miami 3 \nyears ago. ``But it's right. [And] changing our laws means doing the \nhard work of changing minds and changing votes, one by one.''\n  As somebody who well understands just how difficult the work of \nchanging minds and votes can be, I could not agree more with the \nPresident's statement. Americans accept that democracy's blessings are \nonly made possible by the constraints it imposes--both its legal \ncontours and those imposed by popular elections.\n  We accept democracy's messiness. We accept that we may not always get \nall of what we want exactly when we want it. Based on more of what the \nPresident said in Miami, this is something he seemed to understand as \nwell. He was talking about immigration that day.\n  Here is something else he said on that topic. ``I know [that] some . \n. . wish that I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. \nBut that's not how democracy works.'' Indeed, it is not--all of which \nmakes the President's planned Executive action on immigration even more \njarring.\n  If the President truly follows through on this attempt to impose his \nwill unilaterally, he will have issued a rebuke to his own stated view \nof democracy. He will have contradicted his past statements on this \nvery issue. The instances of President Obama saying that he does not \nhave the power to do the kinds of things he now plans to do are almost \ntoo numerous to list.\n  He tried to suggest otherwise last weekend. But a prominent fact \nchecker panned the spin as ``Pinocchio-laden'' and clarified that the \nPresident has been asked specifically about the source of actions that \nhe is contemplating now. The President's previous answers seemed to be \nunequivocal: He lacked the legal authority to act, according to the \nPresident himself.\n  As one example, President Obama said last year that Executive action \nwas ``not an option,'' because ``[he] would be ignoring the law. \n``There is a path to get this done,'' he said, ``and that is through \nCongress.'' He is right. The action he has proposed would ignore the \nlaw, would reject the voice of the voters, and would impose new \nunfairness on law-abiding immigrants, all without solving the problem.\n  In fact, his action is more likely to make it even worse. We have \nalready seen the consequences of Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals, or DACA, his most recent action in this area. It was a factor \nin encouraging young people to risk their lives on a perilous journey \nsome would never have even contemplated and some would never complete.\n  The effect of this action could be just as tragic. Just as the \nAffordable Care Act had little to do with making health care more \naffordable, slapping the term ``immigration reform'' on something does \nnot make it actually immigration reform. Just as with ObamaCare, the \naction the President is proposing is not about solutions, it is not \nabout compassion, it seems to be about what a political party thinks \nwould make for good politics.\n  It seems to be about what the President thinks would be good for his \nlegacy. Those are not the motivations that should be driving such \nsweeping action, and I think the President will come to regret the \nchapter history writes if he does move forward because the plan he is \npresenting is more than just--as the President himself has \nacknowledged--an overreach, it is also unfair. What does the President \nhave to say to the countless aspiring immigrants who spent literally \nyears waiting patiently in line, to the people who played by all the \nrules? Where is his compassion for them? What does the President have \nto say to the millions of Americans who still can't find work in this \neconomy? The President can't reach across the aisle to secure a serious \njobs plan for them, but he is willing to put everything he has into one \nExecutive action? Where is the justice?\n  There is a larger point too. Some people seem to have forgotten this \nalready, but we just had an election. Before that election the \nPresident told us about his plan to act unilaterally on immigration. He \nreminded us that his policies were on the ballot. And then the people \nspoke. The President doesn't have to like the result, but he has a duty \nto respect it. The American people clearly sent a message. Nobody \nmissed it. They said they want to see us working together. They said \nthey want to see more serious ideas pass through Congress. What they \ndidn't say they wanted to see was the President sidestepping the very \nrepresentatives they just elected. That is why so many Kentuckians have \nbeen calling my office in opposition to this plan. I know phones have \ncontinued to ring off the hook all week in our offices across Capitol \nHill. Our constituents want to be heard. President Obama needs to \nlisten to their voices.\n  If nothing else, perhaps the President will at least consider the \nviews of Democratic Senators and Members of Congress who have urged him \nnot to do this. These Democrats understand the consequences of a \nPresident from a different political party citing this precedent in the \nfuture.\n  Either way, he needs to understand something: If President Obama acts \nin defiance of the people and imposes his will on the country, Congress \nwill act. We are considering a variety of options, but make no \nmistake--when the newly elected representatives of the people take \ntheir seats, they will act.\n  Look, as the President has said, democracy is hard. Imposing his will \nunilaterally may seem tempting. It may serve him politically in the \nshort term. But he knows it will make an already broken system even \nmore broken, and he knows this is not how democracy is supposed to work \nbecause he told us so himself.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I know I express the sentiments and \noutrage of every Member of this body about the tragic events in Israel \nthis past Tuesday where those in a synagogue were brutally slain. It \nwas a shock to all of us--in a synagogue, in a place of worship, people \nthere praying and studying, and their lives were brutally ended.\n  Let me just mention the victims. Rabbi Moshe Twersky, Rabbi Aryeh \nKupinsky, Rabbi Kalman Levine, Avraham Goldberg, and Zidan Saif, a \npolice officer.\n  I particularly want to mention Rabbi Kupinsky because there is a \nconnection\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\nhere to Maryland. Three of the victims had U.S. citizenship. Rabbi \nKupinsky is a cousin of a distinguished constituent, Judge Karen \nFriedman of Baltimore. So this affects all of us.\n  I know first and foremost our prayers are with the families and we \nexpress our deepest sympathy. I also express our resolve to eliminate \nsuch extremists and to work with the international community so there \nis no refuge anywhere in the world--anywhere in the civilized world--\nfor such extremists. Then I would hope we would all recognize and speak \nout for Israel's right, indeed its obligation, to defend its people \nfrom such brutal attacks.\n  The Baltimore Sun said this morning in its editorial there could be \nno excuse, no explanation, no reason or even plausible justification \nfor the horrific attack on a Jerusalem synagogue Tuesday that left four \nRabbis and an Israeli police officer dead.\n  I know we all believe in that statement. There is no justification \nfor such actions. Yet Hamas--and again I would quote from the Sun \npaper--``Hamas, the militant [extremist] group that controls Gaza, \nhailed the attack in the synagogue as a blow against Israel's \noccupation. . . . ''\n  This just points out the difference between Hamas and Israel. I have \nbeen on the floor many times talking about Israel's legitimate right to \ndefend itself and Hamas's desire to put innocent people in harm's way. \nIt is our responsibility to speak out. If this event would have \nhappened in the United States, I think we all know what the reaction \nwould have been. So our resolve goes out to the people of Israel that \nwe will stand by them and that we stand by their right to defend \nthemselves.\n  This is in the backdrop of a rise of anti-Semitism. We have seen \nthese violent attacks in Brussels and Toulouse earlier this year, a \nbrutal slaying in Antwerp, Jewish schools and community centers and \nsynagogues being targets of attacks, extremist parties gaining \npolitical support espousing anti-Semitism. We saw that in Hungary and \nother countries.\n  I want to mention once again the role this Congress plays in the \nHelsinki Commission. I have the honor of being the Chair of the \nHelsinki Commission during this Congress, and the Helsinki Commission \nimplements the commitments we made almost 40 years ago--the Helsinki \nFinal Act; the core principles of human rights and tolerance. Our \nbedrock principle is that in order to have a stable country you have to \nhave a commitment to basic human rights, and it is not just your \nobligation but every country that is part of Helsinki, including the \nUnited States, that has the right to challenge any other country in its \ncompliance with those basic human rights. We have made progress.\n  Ten years ago I was privileged to be part of the U.S. delegation in \nthe Berlin conference. The Berlin conference was established to deal \nwith the rise of anti-Semitism, and an action agenda came out of that \nconference 10 years ago. It put responsibility on us--political \nleaders--to speak out against anti-Semitic activities in our own \ncountry or anywhere in the world. It set up an action plan to deal with \neducating, and particularly dealing with Holocaust education, to deal \nwith the Holocaust deniers. It dealt with police training because we \nunderstand a lot of criminal activities are hate crimes and the police \nneed to be able to identify when hate crimes are taking place in their \nown community.\n  We decided to share best practices by providing technical help to \ncountries to do better, and we established a special representative to \ndeal with anti-Semitism. Rabbi Baker is currently that special \nrepresentative. But we went further than that, we expanded it to all \nforms of intolerance--not just anti-Semitism but xenophobia, anti-\nMuslim activities--because we recognized that the same people who are \nextremists and who deny individuals because of their anti-Semitic acts \nwould do the same against Muslims, would do the same against any people \nbecause of their race or ethnic background.\n  I was very pleased to see commemorated the 10th anniversary of the \nBerlin conference. There was a reconvening in Berlin--Berlin plus 10. \nAmbassador Powers, our Ambassador to the United Nations, led the U.S. \ndelegation. She did a great job. I want to acknowledge that Wade \nHenderson, representing the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human \nRights, also participated because there is unity here. It is not just \nthe anti-Semitic activities, it is the intolerance we have seen grow \ntoo much in our world community today.\n  The concluding document said we need to increase our political and \nfinancial support for civil societies, and I agree with that. \nTransparency and supporting the NGOs, supporting civil societies, is \ncritically important.\n  The bottom line is we must work together to root out all forms of \nanti-Semitism and all forms of intolerance. Let us work together to \nmake all our communities safer by embracing diversity and recognizing \nbasic human rights.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6165-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6165-S6167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RUSSIAN ENCROACHMENT INTO UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to call this body's \nattention to a crisis that grows more alarming every day, and that is \nthe continued Russian encroachment into Ukraine. It has been over 2 \nmonths since the Ukrainian Government entered into a ceasefire \nagreement with Russian-backed separatists in southeastern Ukraine. It \nis an agreement that the separatists have repeatedly violated, and \nsince it came into effect hundreds--hundreds--of Ukrainian soldiers \nhave died in battle against these same separatist forces.\n  The Ukrainian people want peace, but these insurgents and their \npatrons in Moscow are not interested. Every day they grow more \naggressive and bolder in their violations of the Ukrainian territory \nand their willingness to subvert the international order.\n  I know there are some in this body who would say this is not our \nproblem, it is thousands of miles away, and not our concern. Some \npeople may think it doesn't matter which flag flies over the territory. \nI have a different view. To me, what happens in Ukraine is very much in \nour interests. It is in the interests of all who value liberty and the \nright to choose one's own future. The stakes are very high, and the \nconsequences of inaction are devastating. To those who ask why is this \nimportant, let me bring up several points.\n  First, it is in America's interest to uphold our traditional \ncommitment to supporting democracy around the world and the right of a \npeople to choose their own destiny. When the Soviet Union fell and the \npeople of Eastern Europe took back the liberty that had been stolen \nfrom them decades before, the United States made a solemn promise: \nEmbrace democracy, freedom, transparency, and the rule of law, and we \nwill embrace you.\n  The Ukrainian people made their choice. They did so on the 24th of \nAugust, 1991, when an independent Ukraine ceased to be a dream and \nbecame a reality. They reaffirmed that commitment over a decade later \nwhen the Orange Revolution swept a corrupt government from office. And \nearlier this year in the face of Russian threats, intimidation, and \naggression, they did so again. I saw that commitment firsthand earlier \nthis year when I had the honor of leading a Congressional delegation \nwith my colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, to monitor the \nUkrainian Presidential election. Senator Cardin and I saw the spirit of \nthe Ukrainian people and their determination to honor the memory of \nbrave men and women who had given their lives in the fight for a free \nand independent Ukraine. That fight continues today.\n  But this fight is about more than just Ukraine. Failing to honor our \ncommitment to the Ukrainians will have real consequences that extend to \nother national security priorities for the United States of America. \nWhen Ukraine emerged as an independent nation after the Cold War, it \ninherited the world's third largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. As a \nnewly independent State\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\nlooking to ensure its sovereignty and territorial integrity, Ukraine \ncould have relied on its nuclear arsenal to ward off would-be \naggressors. They made a different decision. Instead of pursuing this \ndangerous path, they sought and received assurances from the \ninternational community that its borders would be respected if it gave \nup its nuclear weapons.\n  In 1994, the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Ukraine \nsigned the Budapest Memorandum in which all sides pledged to respect \nUkraine's territorial integrity, refrain from using military force or \neconomic pressure to limit Ukrainian sovereignty, and provide \nassistance to the Ukraine if it became the victim of aggression from \nanother nation.\n  Clearly Russia has broken its part of that agreement. Now the \nquestion is whether we are breaking ours. If we do break our word, what \nwill the impact be on American counter-proliferation efforts around the \nworld? How can any nation we seek to prevent from developing nuclear \nweapons ever trust U.S. security assurances if they see the carnage and \ndestruction in Ukraine, if they see this as being the result of trading \nnuclear weapons for American guarantees?\n  More than just the credibility of U.S. counter-proliferation efforts \nis at stake here. Events in the Ukraine are a direct challenge to the \nentire U.S.-led international order. U.S. economic and military power \nwas the glue that kept the Western alliance together through the \nchallenges of the Cold War and formed the foundation of an \ninternational order based on universal values and standards of conduct \nthat has led to unprecedented global prosperity and stability. This in \nturn has produced a period of U.S. economic growth and security \nunrivaled in our Nation's history. Confidence in America's willingness \nto use our unmatched capabilities to uphold this system deters \npotential challengers and incentivizes other countries to play by the \nrules, which prevents us from actually having to use them.\n  America's commitment to uphold this system is incredibly important. \nIf the credibility of this commitment is in doubt, then the stability \nand openness upon which U.S. economic prosperity and national security \ndepend is jeopardized and the chance for violence, instability, and \neconomic collapse increases.\n  By the way, the Russian Government knows all this. President Putin, \nwho famously declared the collapse of the Soviet Union to be ``the \ngreatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century,'' knows that his \ndream of building a new Russian empire out of the ashes of the Soviet \nUnion requires establishing Russian dominance over its newly \nindependent neighbors, many of whom--like Ukraine--want closer \nintegration with the West, not Russia. To accomplish this goal, Moscow \nmust shatter this political, economic, military, and ideological \ncredibility of the Western system. Russian aggression against Ukraine \ntoday or Georgia back in 2008 is as much about demonstrating the \nemptiness of U.S. and Western guarantees as it is about control of \nthese individual countries, in my view. The conflict in Ukraine is the \nlatest escalation of this trend, one that will continue until the \nUnited States and its allies say firmly, ``This shall not continue.''\n  The President keeps saying that ``there is no military solution to \nthis conflict.'' The President may think so, but Moscow certainly does \nnot. The direct Russian military involvement in Ukraine has been on \nfull display for the world to see for months. In previous times it may \nhave been easier to keep these movements out of sight, even as \nPresident Putin does his best to suppress a free press. But we are \nfortunate to have reporters willing to document what they see for all \nthe world to witness.\n  Here are a few examples in the media from recent days. This is a \npicture of a Russian-made T-90 main battle tank in the Luhansk Oblast \nof Ukraine recently. This T-90 tank, by the way, is a very \nsophisticated Russian tank.\n  Do you know who owns these T-90 tanks? Here are the countries: \nAlgeria, Azerbaijan, India, Turkmenistan, and Russia. I think it is \nsafe to say that these tanks didn't drive from South Asia or from North \nAfrica. They came from Russia, and they are in Ukraine.\n  Here is a picture of a Sukhoi-24 attack fighter reportedly taken in \nRussia. You will see painted on the tail the flag of the pro-Russian \nseparatists. Not many people are aware of reports that Russia is \nhelping to create a separatist air force, but we must wake up and \nrealize the extent to which Russia is determined to trample on Ukraine \nand the global order to achieve its ends. In the last couple of days \nthere have also seen reports of significant movement of Russian \naircraft to the Ukrainian border.\n  These are just a few examples of the Russian armored personnel \ncarriers, artillery, tanks, air defense systems, electronic warfare \nunits, and thousands of Russian troops that NATO reports say have moved \ninto Ukraine over the last several weeks. According to the Ukrainian \nanalysts, Russian and separatist forces have been organized into mobile \nstrike groups and have completed reconnaissance of Ukrainian positions \nin preparation for an all-out assault. Barely a day has gone by since \nthe signing of the so-called ceasefire in September where Ukrainian \ntroops haven't come under attack, as separatists probe Ukrainian \ndefenses looking for an opening. Since the beginning of the conflict, \nconservative estimates have put the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed \nor wounded at roughly 4,000.\n  By the way, at least another approximately 5,000 civilians have been \nkilled or wounded in the fighting.\n  We shouldn't be afraid to call this exactly what it is. This is part \nof a Russian invasion. We saw it in Crimea; we are now seeing it in \nother parts of Ukraine.\n  Two months ago the President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, spoke here \nbefore a joint session of Congress. We were all there. It was a \npoignant speech, a powerful speech, and one from the heart. There is a \nline in that speech that I think stood out. In speaking about the aid \nwe have sent to Ukraine and thanking us for that aid, President \nPoroshenko said, ``One cannot win the war with blankets. Even more, we \ncannot keep the peace with a blanket.''\n  And he was right. Blankets won't stop this tank we saw earlier. \nBlankets won't stop bullets. Blankets won't protect Ukrainian children \nfrom Russian artillery shells.\n  We don't know a whole lot about what the United States has provided \nto the Ukrainians, but I will get to that in a moment. We are having \ntrouble getting that information from the administration. But we know a \nfew things. We know we have given them blankets, sleeping mats, \nmilitary rations, medical kits, and body armor. This is the majority of \nwhat we have been providing, as far as we know, to the Ukrainian \nmilitary. I know the Ukrainians are grateful for these items. But when \nyou compare this to the Russian involvement, the differences are \nstartling. Here is what we provided to the Ukrainians. Here is the \nRussian support being provided to the separatists. I am proud of the \nhard-working Ohioans----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. While I am proud of the hard-working Ohioans in \nCincinnati and elsewhere who are making these rations, and the folks in \nHeath who produce these helmets, they know as well as I do that this \nequipment doesn't constitute deterrence, especially not when Ukrainians \nare facing advanced Russian equipment and troops.\n  May I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Thank you.\n  I don't mean to downplay the importance of the economic, political, \nand humanitarian aid we have provided. Indeed, there are many economic \nand political reforms the Ukrainians will need to make in order to \nsecure long-term peace and prosperity. But how can Ukrainians be \nexpected to make these difficult but necessary reforms if it cannot \ncontrol its own borders or maintain law and order? There is a military \ndimension to this crisis we simply cannot ignore any longer.\n  Moscow continues to believe that military force is a viable option to \nachieve its goals. Unless the United\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\nStates and its allies help the Ukrainians prove otherwise, we shouldn't \nexpect any change in its behavior. Ukraine needs anti-tank weapons to \ndefend against armored assaults; it needs modern air defense systems to \ndefend against Russian air superiority; it needs unmanned aircraft to \nmonitor its borders and to detect violations of its sovereignty and the \nceasefire. It needs secure communications gear to prevent Russia from \naccessing Ukrainian plans and troop locations. It needs advanced \ncounter-battery radar to target the artillery batteries responsible for \nso many of the casualties in the conflict. It needs elite rapid \nreaction forces capable of responding to Russian border provocations \nand the fast-moving asymmetric ``hybrid war'' tactics the Russians use \nto destabilize the country. Therefore, they also need training. The \nUkrainians have asked for this support, and we should provide it.\n\n  Most importantly, Ukraine needs a sustained commitment from the \nUnited States and our NATO allies to provide both the quality and the \nquantity of equipment necessary to preserve its independence. This is \nnot a partisan issue. Leading Democrats in the Senate, such as the \nChairmen of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, \nSenators Levin and Menendez, as well as Senator Cardin and others, have \njoined in calling for increased assistance, including defensive \nweapons. Yet the President and some of his top advisers continue to \nstand in the way of meaningful action for fear of provoking Russia, as \nif the tanks streaming into Ukraine or the daily clashes aren't \nevidence enough that American restraint has not had the desired effect \non Russian activity and policy.\n  It is well known by now that the President has refused to adopt \npolicies that actually provide Ukraine with the capabilities needed to \nchange the situation on the ground. What is less well known is whether \nthe administration is even fully committed to fulfilling the objectives \nof its own already limited policies.\n  For all the talk we have heard about the President and his steadfast \nsupport for Ukraine and the $116 million in security assistance the \nUnited States has promised to deliver, we know almost nothing about how \nthese policies are actually being implemented. This administration has \nbeen a black box when it comes to getting even the most basic \ninformation on our efforts to aid Ukraine. Despite multiple requests, \nincluding a letter to the President from Senator Cardin and me, we \nstill can't seem to get answers on fundamental questions: What \nequipment has been delivered to Ukraine? How long will it take to \ndeliver the equipment we have promised but not delivered? What is the \nprocess for determining what capabilities to provide? How does the \nequipment we have agreed to provide support the capabilities they have \nrequested? How do our assistance efforts fit into a comprehensive \nstrategy?\n  This complete lack of transparency on the day-to-day implementation \nof U.S. assistance raises questions about the underlying policy \nguidance driving it and whether the administration actually has far \nmore modest goals than the President's public rhetoric would suggest. \nFor example, a bipartisan assessment, conducted by GEN Wesley Clark, \nRetired, and former top Pentagon official Dr. Phillip Karber, and \nfeatured in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other major \nnewspapers, revealed that the Obama administration has issued extremely \nrestrictive instructions on the type of nonlethal aid the United States \ncould provide. The lack of this aid has created real problems for the \nUkrainians.\n  The fact is that no one in Congress knows how these regulations will \nbe applied. This is a huge problem and stands in the way of a coherent \nand effective policy.\n  Yesterday the President's Deputy National Security Adviser testified \nthat strengthening the Ukrainian forces is ``something we should be \nlooking at.'' While this is a welcome change of tone, we should be well \nbeyond the point of just looking at it, in my view, because every day \nwe delay, every day we dither, every day we match Russian action with \nhalf-measures and self-imposed limitations, Moscow is emboldened and \nthe danger grows.\n  I am convinced that a piecemeal, reactionary response to intimidation \nfrom Moscow is a recipe for failure. Instead, we must have a \ncomprehensive, proactive strategy that strengthens NATO, deters Russian \naggression, and gives Ukraine the political, economic, and military \nsupport it needs to maintain its independence. We need a strategy that \nseeks to shape outcomes, not be shaped by them.\n  Much of that leadership must come from the White House, but this body \nalso has a role to play. We should include funding for Ukrainian \nmilitary assistance in upcoming spending bills. We should pass the \nUkraine Freedom Support Act, which would authorize the assistance \nUkraine needs today. We should pass legislation that will reduce \nUkraine's--and all of Europe's--reliance on Russia for its energy \nresources. And we should pass legislation to ensure that the United \nStates never recognizes Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea.\n  The need for action could not be more clear. Through his aggression \nin Ukraine, President Putin and Moscow are sending a message to Ukraine \nand to the world that America and the West are indecisive and weak and \nthat their guarantees of support are meaningless. The Ukrainian people \nhave rejected that message, choosing instead the path of democracy and \nopenness--a path the United States has urged the Ukrainians and also \nthe world to follow. We and our NATO allies must now stand with them.\n  When America is strong, when we stand unequivocally for freedom and \njustice, when we don't back down in the face of threats and \nintimidation, that is when we see a world that is more stable, less \ndangerous, and more free. That is because we stand with our allies.\n  More wars, more conflicts, more threats to our security--these do not \narise from American strength; these arise from American weakness. Let's \nbe strong again. Let's lead again. Let's help Ukraine. The world is \nwatching.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

RUSSELL\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, on Saturday night of last week, Georgia, \nAtlanta, and America lost a great citizen.\n  Herman J. Russell was one of the greatest African-American business \nleaders and civil rights leaders the world has ever known. He passed \npeacefully in his home after a short illness, but his legacy and his \nlife will last forever--not just in the history books but indelibly on \nthe skyline of our city.\n  In 1952 Herman J. Russell started a small plastering company called \nH.J. Russell & Company. He had just graduated from Tuskegee Institute \nin Alabama, and he came to Georgia to make his fortune and his fame. He \nstarted out plastering walls and ceilings, and he finished his career \nbuilding the Georgia Dome and the Georgia Pacific Building, the 1996 \nOlympic Stadium, and buildings throughout the Atlanta skyline. While \ndoing so he made a lot of money which he reinvested back not into his \ninvestments but into his community.\n  In 1999 Herman Russell by himself gave $4 million to Morehouse \nCollege, Clark Atlanta University, and Georgia State University, and \nlast December gave $1 million to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta to \nrebuild and help renovate the facility in downtown Atlanta for a \nhospital for children.\n  He was always giving back more than he asked, but his greatest gift \nmay have been the fact that he enabled Martin Luther King in the civil \nrights movement in the 1960s. It is well known that Dr. King would go \nto Herman's house to take refuge, take a swim and relax between the \narduous times of the civil rights movement. Herman Russell would \nfinance the movement and finance the movement's efforts so they could \ncontinue to move forward to bring about equality in the South. That is \nan indelible mark he left in history, not just for our State but for \nour country.\n  Herman and his wife had three wonderful children. They are involved \nin\n\n[[Page S6168]]\n\nthe business today. Today the business is still flourishing, as it \nalways has. In fact, the new Atlanta Dome Stadium, which will house the \nFalcons, is a $1.3 billion stadium in which the company was integrally \ninvolved.\n  Our city has lost a great friend, a great African American, and a \ngreat entrepreneur--so great, he was recognized by the Atlanta Chamber \nas its first African-American member and its second African-American \npresident. He has been recognized by the Butler Street YMCA, the \nAtlanta and Georgia Business Council, and almost every entrepreneur \ngroup there is for his contributions to business and his contributions \nto investments in the State of Georgia.\n  It is with great sad tomorrow night that I will go to Ebenezer \nBaptist Church and be a part of the wake ceremony for Mr. Russell. But \nit is with great pride that I rise today on the Senate floor to make \nsure the Record indelibly recognizes the life, the times, and the \ncontributions of Herman J. Russell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6168-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING CARL SANDERS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, on Sunday night a great Georgian and a \npersonal friend of mine passed away from this life. At the age of 89, \nformer Governor Carl Sanders died in Atlanta, GA, at Piedmont Hospital.\n  Governor Sanders was Governor of Georgia from 1963 to 1967. I was at \nthe University of Georgia as a student from 1962 to 1966, so my college \nyears paralleled his gubernatorial years, where he made a remarkable \nchange in the politics and lives of the people of Georgia.\n  Everyone remembers what the 1960s were like in the South in terms of \nsegregation. Most of the Governors in the South--like Governor Wallace \nfrom Alabama--were segregationists. But Carl Sanders came forward as a \nGovernor who wanted to help bring people together, who wanted to help \nbring Georgia and the South through a turbulent time, to see to it that \nAfrican Americans rose to equality not just in the way they were \nrecognized but in the ways the laws were created. In fact, it was Carl \nSanders who came to Washington in 1964 to meet with Lyndon Johnson and \nhelp form the foundation for the civil rights laws that passed later in \nthe 1960s.\n  Carl Sanders was born in Augusta, GA. He went to the University of \nGeorgia on a scholarship and played football, and he left the \nuniversity to go fight in World War II and was a fighter pilot. He came \nback from World War II, graduated from the University of Georgia, and \nthen graduated from Georgia Law School. He practiced law and was \nelected to the State legislature and then to the State senate and then \nGovernor of the State of Georgia. He was Governor from 1963 to 1967.\n  Back then, Georgia Governors could not succeed one another, so he had \nto wait 4 years to run for a second term. He did wait 4 years and he \nran for a second term, and he lost ultimately to the President of the \nUnited States, Jimmy Carter. But he was never a loser; he was a winner. \nAnd in everything he did, whether it was government or business or \nfamily life, whatever it might be, Carl Sanders excelled.\n  He was such a wonderful man to share his wisdom and knowledge. About \nonce every 6 or 8 months he would have three or four of us over to his \noffice, at the age of 89, treating us to lunch and talking about the \ngood old days but also talking about the future. Carl Sanders was not \nabout the past, except for memories; he was about the future for its \nhope and its prosperity for people.\n  Carl Sanders will be remembered for a lot of things, but in Georgia, \nmost importantly, he will be remembered for what became at first a \njunior college system but is now a 4-year college system which has \nevery Georgia citizen within a 45-minute drive of a State university \nsystem facility. His passion as Governor was education. His legacy in \nGeorgia will be education. He contributed greatly to our State and \ngreatly to the future and the prosperity of the people of the State of \nGeorgia.\n  It is with a great sense of sadness but a great sense of pride that I \npay tribute today on the floor of the Senate to a great Governor of \nGeorgia, a great citizen of our country, and a great American--the \nHonorable Carl Sanders, former Governor of the State of Georgia.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6168-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6168-S6172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been 511 days since the Senate \npassed bipartisan legislation to reform our broken immigration system. \nFourteen Republicans joined the Democrats in supporting a measure which \ncovered what I believe are the major challenges facing America when it \ncomes to immigration in the 21st century.\n  There was an amendment adopted by Senator Corker, and I believe \nSenator Hoeven cosponsored it. Their amendment would have strengthened \nour border security to unprecedented levels.\n  At this moment in time, we have more Federal law enforcement \nofficials on the border between the United States and Mexico than the \ncombined population of all other Federal law enforcement agencies. It \nis a massive commitment which would have been enhanced even more by the \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill.\n  For those border State Senators, we would have reached the point \nwhere--from Galveston to San Diego--we would have literally had \navailable a law enforcement agent every half mile 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week. It is a massive investment, and it passed the Senate 511 \ndays ago.\n  That same bill addressed some serious issues about agriculture \nworkers in Illinois, California, Texas, and all across the Nation. \nGrowers are telling us they are having a difficult time bringing in the \nworkers who will do the backbreaking, hard, physical labor necessary \nfor agriculture. This bill addressed it. In fact, the bill was endorsed \nby both growers as well as those who do the work. It was an amazing \npolitical achievement.\n  It also addressed the issue of H-1Bs. Why in the world do we bring \nthe best and brightest from around the world to the United States for \nadvanced degrees, advanced education and then welcome them to leave? If \nthey stayed and worked to create jobs and new businesses and new \ninnovations in America, we could build our economy. The bill addressed \nit.\n  As important as all of those issues are, the bill addressed 11 \nmillion undocumented people in America--11 million, and that is just an \nestimate. The bill said those who were here undocumented--who had been \nhere for several years--could step up, register with the government, \npay their filing fee, submit themselves to a background check, pay \ntheir taxes, and then be reviewed annually for years to make sure they \nwere still complying with the laws of the United States.\n  They would not qualify for government benefits or programs during \nthis period of time, but they could work their way to legal status. \nThat bill passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis with 68 votes. The \nbill then went over to the House of Representatives where, sadly, it \nlanguished. Nothing happened.\n  The Speaker of the House refused to call the bill up for a vote. In \nfact, he refused to call any aspect of the bill up for a vote. He \nrefused to call it in committee for any consideration or debate, and \nthen he let it languish. There were times when the House Republican \nleadership tempted the White House and others by saying: Well, maybe \nnow we can call it up for a vote. They never, ever did. We have waited \n511 days, and here we are today.\n  This evening, President Obama is going to announce an Executive order \nto address immigration. He has waited patiently, and America has waited \npatiently for the Republicans in the House of Representatives to step \nforward and accept this responsibility, but they have refused. They \nhave refused to fix this broken immigration system, and you can bet as \nsoon as the President issues his Executive order, there will be a \nchorus of complaints that this President has gone too far by using his \nExecutive authority to address this issue.\n  You won't hear the facts from the critics. You won't hear from the \ncritics that every President since Dwight\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\nDavid Eisenhower--I believe 11 different Democrats and Republicans--\nhave issued Executive orders relating to immigration. President George \nHerbert Walker Bush basically said--by Executive order--that we are not \ngoing to prosecute 1.5 million undocumented immigrants in America. He \nused his prosecutorial discretion. That is the kind of thing which we \nhave come to expect from Presidents, and we expect Congress to complain \nabout it. That has continued.\n\n  Here is what we believe President Obama will announce today. The \ndetails are just starting to emerge in press reports. He is going to \nannounce that we are going to push for accountability in immigration. \nSenator Marco Rubio was on the bipartisan panel that put together the \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill. He said something that was very \npressing, and I wish to refer to it at this moment. He said for those \nwho criticize amnesty, doing nothing is amnesty for those who are here \nin the United States and undocumented. Doing nothing is amnesty.\n  What President Obama is going to suggest--instead of amnesty--is \naccountability. Here is what he will say. Those who have children who \nare American citizens and have been here at least 5 years will have a \nchance to step forward and register with the government, pay the filing \nfee for processing, submit themselves to a criminal background check, \nand pay their taxes.\n  The President says, if you will do that--under his order--it is my \nunderstanding it will say you can legally work in America. They will \nnot become a citizen nor will they have legal status beyond the work \npermit, but they don't have to fear deportation. They are down the list \nand are not considered a dangerous person who should be deported.\n  The highest priority for those who will be deported are those with \ncriminal records, and they should be deported. There is no room in the \nUnited States for anyone--let alone undocumented--who come here and \ncommit a crime.\n  Secondly, if you have repeat offenders and those who violated the \nlegal system, they will be in the second category.\n  The third category of those who meet the criteria I mentioned will be \ngiven their chance.\n  This is about accountability. This really says to those who wish to \nsay: If you will play by these rules, we will give you a chance to stay \nand work.\n  What is the reason? We want to deport felons; we don't want to deport \nfamilies. We want to deport criminals; we don't want to deport \nchildren. We will focus our efforts on the borders on those who are \ntrying to come across and those who are here and should leave. That \nmeans more resources would be put into enforcement, and it also means \nthat those who are here will be registered. We will know who they are, \nwhere they are, where they are working, and we will know that they are \npaying their taxes to stay in this country.\n  The alternative from the Republican point of view--for 511 days--is \nto do nothing. That is an unacceptable alternative.\n  There is a better alternative to an Executive order, and the \nPresident will be the first to say it, and that is that this Congress--\non a bipartisan basis--rolls up its sleeves and tackles this issue. We \nshould. That is why we were elected. To do nothing, as the House has \ndone for 511 days, is unacceptable. To stand by the sidelines and \ncriticize this President for using his Executive authority--the same \nExecutive authority used over and over again by Presidents of both \npolitical parties in the field of immigration--is not constructive.\n  There is one other thing that is even worse. Some Members of the \nother party are suggesting they are prepared to shut down the \nGovernment of the United States over this issue. If the President uses \nhis legal authority, they have threatened to shut down the Government \nof the United States.\n  We saw that last year when the junior Senator from Texas took the \nfloor and said he was going to close down the government over the issue \nof the Affordable Care Act. It was a terrible strategy. A lot of \ninnocent people were hurt. It cost our government and our economy \ndearly. It was a politically desperate act which I hope will not be \nrepeated ever again--certainly not when it comes to the issue of \nimmigration.\n  If there was ever a time for us to stand together--both political \nparties--and solve a problem, this is it. Standing on the sidelines and \ncomplaining--which is what we have heard over and over again from the \nHouse Republican leadership and continue to hear when it comes to the \nPresident's Executive order--is not the kind of constructive policy the \nAmerican people need.\n  I applaud the President. He is going to take a lot of grief for \nthis--for using his Executive power--but thank goodness he is stepping \nup and addressing the problem. Where others have walked away from it, \nignored it, and come up with every excuse on Earth, he is directly \naddressing the problem. And now it is time for us in the Congress to do \nthe same thing.\n  We are going to come back after Thanksgiving and will be here for at \nleast 10 days. Speaker Boehner, leader of the Republican House, has the \nauthority to instantly call to the floor of the House this bipartisan \nimmigration bill which passed the Senate. There is no excuse. If he is \ngoing to criticize the President for using his power to solve a \nproblem, then the Speaker should use his power to address that same \nproblem. Call the comprehensive immigration reform bill before we leave \nat the end of this year. Bring it up for a vote in the House. I think \nit will pass.\n  If it passes, and we do--by legislation--a much broader review and \nchange in the immigration reform bill, we will have done what we were \nelected to do. We will have served this Nation, and we will have set \nout to repair this broken immigration system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am glad I came to the floor and heard my \nfriend and colleague, the majority whip, from Illinois, and his \nexplanation for how it is clearly within the President's authority to \nissue this Executive order he plans on announcing tonight. The basic \nproblem is the President himself has said repeatedly he doesn't have \nthat authority. He said it repeatedly. We have all seen the clips on TV \nand online. He said he doesn't have the power to do it. He was right \nthen, and he is wrong now.\n  There is a right way and a wrong way to solve problems. The right way \nwould have been during the first 2 years, after President Obama won the \nelection in 2008 and his party commanded 60 votes in the Senate and a \nmajority in the House of Representatives. If this had been a priority \nfor him, he could have done it then.\n  Instead, on a party-line vote, he chose to jam through the Affordable \nCare Act--ObamaCare--and we see what a disaster that has been. It was \nnot just me. I was a skeptic. I didn't think it would work. While the \ngoals were laudable and worthy, I just didn't think the Federal \nGovernment had the competence or certainly the ability to reconfigure \none-sixth of our economy. But the President did it, his party passed \nit, and it enjoyed no bipartisan support.\n  That is one of the basic problems with what the President is doing \ntoday. The reason why it is so important to follow the Constitution--\nwhich requires passing legislation affecting 5 million people through \nboth Houses of Congress and forces us to negotiate and build \nconsensus--is because those are sustainable policies.\n  If you try to do things on a ``my way or the highway'' basis or on a \npurely partisan basis, those are not sustainable because we know that \nas time goes by, today's majority will be tomorrow's minority. Now a \nDemocrat occupies the White House. Perhaps next time a Republican will \noccupy the White House. Who knows. The point is that only objectives we \npursue through the legislative process according to the Constitution \nand the laws of the United States of America that are done on a \nbipartisan basis through that natural census-building that is required \nin order to reach our goals--those are truly sustainable policies. And \nwhen the President decides to do it through an Executive order, \nexercising powers that he himself said he does not have, what are \npeople supposed to think?\n\n[[Page S6170]]\n\n  I heard my friend from Illinois say, Well, it has been 511 days and \nRepublicans haven't swallowed the comprehensive immigration reform bill \nthat has come from the Senate. They are not required to swallow it. \nThey can pass legislation or not on their own timetable. The old joke \nis that the opposing party is our adversary, but the Senate is the \nenemy. That is the joke in House circles. So there is a natural rivalry \nbetween the House and the Senate. They are not expected nor required to \naccept what we pass, nor are they required to do it on our timetable. I \nbelieve Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader McCarthy are committed, as \nam I and the incoming majority leader come January, Senator McConnell, \nto making progress on an incremental basis in this important area. It \nhas to be thoughtful, and we have to have fulsome debate with everybody \nparticipating in the process.\n  There are important questions. What impact is the President's \nExecutive order going to have when the unemployment rate is still at \n5.8 percent nationally and when the percentage of people actually \nlooking for work is at a 30-year low because many people have given up \nbecause of the slow-growing economy? What is the impact of these 5 \nmillion--or however many additional work permits the President presumes \nto have the power to issue--what is the impact going to be on \ncompetition for jobs with the economy growing slowly and jobs in short \nsupply? What is the impact of the President's Executive order going to \nbe on household median income? We know wages have been stagnant for the \nmiddle class because of this slow-growing economy. What is the impact \nof millions of additional people competing for jobs in the economy \ngoing to be on wages?\n  I would like to have the answers to those questions.\n  I would also like to know if the President has the power--which he \nsaid he doesn't have but now apparently he has changed his mind--to \nissue this kind of Executive order affecting 5 million people? What \nabout the other 6 million people who are in the country who did not \ncome in in compliance with our immigration laws, who either overstayed \ntheir visas or came across the border illegally?\n  I come from a border State. We have 1,200 miles of common border with \nMexico. We encountered what was described as a humanitarian crisis \nbecause we had this magnet known as the impression that we would not \nenforce our laws that encouraged people to make that treacherous \njourney from Central America across Mexico. Many of these immigrants \nlost their lives, were sexually assaulted or kidnapped and held for \nransom--very dangerous circumstances in the hands of the criminal \norganizations that basically control this business. This is a business \nfor them. But if the President has the authority to do this for 5 \nmillion, why not the 11 million? How does he explain his action to the \n6 million people who will now see these 5 million getting preferential \ntreatment? And how in the world does he explain it to the people who \nhave waited patiently year after year trying to do it the right way? \nThe President has effectively bumped them out of the line and bumped 5 \nmillion people ahead of them.\n  I have every confidence that if we were able to do this in a \nthoughtful, deliberative sort of way, we could find a compassionate and \nsatisfactory outcome for the people who made the mistake of entering \nthe country illegally or who have overstayed. I believe in \nproportionality. We don't give the death penalty for speeding tickets. \nSo I think there is an appropriate way to address this, but it is not \nby an amnesty. I call it an amnesty because, basically, there is no \nreconciliation process. In other words, when a person makes a mistake--\nand we all make mistakes and we all understand the aspirations and \nhopes immigrants bring to the United States because they come here for \nthe same reason people have historically come here, and that is for the \nAmerican dream. We understand that. But we also understand that when \nsomebody has made a mistake, they need to own up to it and they need to \nreconcile themselves to lawful authority because, otherwise, the \nattitude is the law doesn't matter, and it is the law that protects all \nof us no matter who we are, where we come from, or how we pronounce our \nlast name. And when we have a lawless process, as we do now and which \nthis Executive order does nothing to fix, what that does is perpetuate \nlawlessness and chaos, and it also continues to enrich these criminal \norganizations that are more than happy to charge people $5,000, $6,000 \na head to make that treacherous journey.\n  Beyond all of the issues I just addressed, this is a terrible \nprecedent. Again, I understand now the President has decided--and some \nof our Democratic colleagues say, Well, this is the same thing George \nBush did and this is the same thing Dwight Eisenhower did. Well, it is \nnot, and the President knew that when he said he didn't have the \nauthority to do this previously. Now he has changed his mind. Now the \nargument is they issued Executive orders essentially implementing \nbipartisan legislation such as the 1986 amnesty that Ronald Reagan \nsigned. There were Executive orders taken in furtherance of that \nconsensus position based on the legislation. However, never has any \nPresident purported to have the authority to, out of whole cloth, do \nwhat this President says he is going to do.\n\n  Where does he get the authority to issue work permits? I understand \nhe can prioritize prosecution and deportation, and he has, but where \ndoes the President get the authority to issue work permits for millions \nof people?\n  This is rocking people's fundamental confidence in their government. \nWe elect Presidents to faithfully enforce the laws, including the \nConstitution of the United States. That is the oath the President takes \nwhen he is sworn in: ``I do solemnly swear.'' These laws, of course, \nare beyond the Constitution drafted by Congress. It is ``Schoolhouse \nRock.'' Bills start in the House, and in the Senate they have to be \nreconciled and then sent to the President. That is civics 101. Maybe we \nneed a new course called remedial civics 101 for those who have somehow \nforgotten how the Constitution is written and how it actually is \nimplemented in the form of the legislative process.\n  Of course, if the President objects to what Congress sends him, that \nis when the negotiations start. He can veto it. We can vote to override \nit if we have the votes. If we don't, we are back to square one and we \nhave to start that negotiation again.\n  I have never seen or even read of a President who seems so detached, \nso disinterested in actually engaging in this process set out by the \nConstitution. This President says if he doesn't get his way, I have a \npen. I have a phone. I am going to go it alone. Well, that is a \ndisaster waiting to occur, because it is a provocation to the other \nbranches of government which say, Well, we are not irrelevant in this \nprocess and we may have something to say about it. I think we will see \nsome of that in the very near future with regard to the way \nappropriations are made and what functions of government fund it.\n  I heard my friend from Illinois say, People are even threatening a \ngovernment shutdown. That is not true.\n  I take that back. The Democrats are saying that. No Republican has \nsaid that. It is just not going to happen. It shouldn't happen and it \nwon't happen.\n  I love it when our friends in the other party like to tell us about \nour own internal politics. I was at the White House with the President \nand bicameral, bipartisan leadership and our Democratic friends said \nthat the House of Representatives can't pass any immigration reform \nbill. Well, I don't know how they know that, unless they have some \ninsider wisdom that is not obvious to the people who actually work \nthere and have the responsibility to make it work.\n  What I know and what I believe is that there is a good-faith desire \nto try to solve this problem, but not by what I call the ``pig in the \npython'' approach. In other words, we tried that with the Affordable \nCare Act, a 2,700-page bill involving trillions of dollars of \nexpenditure done purely on a partisan basis and it didn't work. I think \nthere is an understandable aversion to trying to do things in a \ncomprehensive sort of way. So why not break it down into pieces and do \nwhat we can, because there are a lot of different pieces that enjoy \nbipartisan support.\n  I think the precedent the President is setting is very dangerous, \nbecause if he purports now to have this power which he previously said \non numerous occasions he didn't have, what about future\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\nPresidents? What about policies others may not like? Even if a person \nbelieves this is a pretty good idea--a person might say, The President \nis trying to act because obviously this is a controversial issue and \nthings aren't moving fast enough, so I like what the President is \ndoing. Suppose a person says that. Well, just think about the \npossibility that a few years from now when we have an election, we have \na new President, and what if that President says, Well, President Obama \npurported to exercise this massive Executive authority in defiance of \nthe Constitution and the laws, so I guess I can do it, too.\n  This is not the kind of political system we want. This is not good \nfor the American people. We do not want a system in which each party, \nwhen they happen to be in power, takes their turn abusing Executive \nauthority. We do not want that. I would have thought there are enough \npeople who love this institution known as the U.S. Senate and believe \nit has an indispensable role in our government who would say, Wait, Mr. \nPresident, don't do it, because we may like the policy, but this really \nis an end run around the Constitution and the role that is \nappropriately played by both Houses of Congress and the Executive.\n  But, apparently, there are few, if any, folks on the other side of \nthe aisle who believe that our tradition and our constitutional system \nof legislating is worth preserving--at least in this instance.\n  I have spoken at some length about the practical consequences of the \nPresident's amnesty, but those consequences also bear repeating since \nthe eyes of the country are now focused on what the President is going \nto announce tonight. We know from recent experience that the \nPresident's unilateral amnesty will be communicated to people in other \ncountries as a signal that they can all come in. That is what happened \nwith the unaccompanied children; 62,000 of them I think the number is, \nroughly, from Central America since last October. The reason there was \na flood and a humanitarian crisis, as described by the President and \nthe administration themselves, is because the signal was the green \nlight is on and people can come to the United States.\n\n  People need to come legally. As long as they get here, they can stay. \nThis is because it undermines one of the basic premises of effective \nlaw enforcement, and that is deterrence. In other words, we don't want \nto just try to stop people after they break the law. Actually, it is \ntoo late to stop them. What we like to do is deter people from even \nthinking about breaking the law and, in this instance, even making that \nperilous journey.\n  There is going to be a surge, an uptick, of some type of an illegal \nimmigration. People are going to see this as a further signal it is OK \nto come, and they don't need to comply with the law, they don't need to \nwait. They can just come. If they are one of the lucky ones, they get \nto stay because this President or somebody will issue a further pardon.\n  As I said earlier, this is also a major boom to the cartels and other \ngangs who control Mexico's smuggling networks. It will almost certainly \nlead to thousands of people who committed crimes in this country \ngaining legal status. It will also, as I said earlier, punish people \nwho played by the rules and waited patiently in line trying to \nimmigrate to the country legally. It will punish them by putting them \nin the back of the line.\n  Let me just repeat this because it is important to me. America is the \nmost generous country in the world when it comes to legal immigration. \nWe are the beneficiary of the brains, the ambition, the hard work of \npeople who come here from all over the globe. All of us weren't--or \nalmost all of us, our ancestors were not born in the United States. We \ncame from somewhere else. Mine came through Ellis Island from Ireland \nafter one of the potato crop famines in the 19th century. So we \nunderstand both the desire to pursue the American dream in this country \nand the benefits that accrue to our country as a result of legal \nimmigration. That is why we are such a generous country when it comes \nto legal immigration, but the current chaos associated with illegal \nimmigration has a number of very negative consequences.\n  I mentioned a moment ago my State has 1,200 miles of common border. \nIt gets attention every once in a while as it did when this \nhumanitarian crisis involving these unaccompanied minors occurred, but \nit happens day after day that people are detained coming across the \nsouthwestern border from all over the world.\n  I met a young man about 6 months ago when I was down on the border \nwho had emigrated from Bangladesh. I wondered how in the world did he \nget here from there. There were a number of other Senators and \nCongressmen with me. We asked the Border Patrol: Can we ask him? They \nsaid: Sure.\n  It turned out he spoke enough English. I asked: Well, how much did it \ncost you to get here?\n  He said: Six thousand dollars.\n  I said: How did you get here?\n  He said: I had to transit eight countries to get here.\n  That is a pretty complicated itinerary for anybody even under normal \ncircumstances, but what it demonstrates is there are networks not just \nin Central America and Mexico but around the world that feed people \ninto this network in order to immigrate to the United States illegally. \nWhat we are doing is nothing about that. Last year people were detained \nat the southwestern border from 140 different countries. If someone \ngoes down to the outside of Falfurrias, TX, down in South Texas, they \nhave rescue beacons the Border Patrol has put out. If someone made this \nlong trip from Central America through Mexico in the hot weather, let's \nsay, and they are dehydrated, they are worried about their life and \ntheir health, they can actually go hit this rescue beacon and the \nBorder Patrol will come pick them up which is maybe not their first \nchoice, but it is better than dying from exposure.\n  The languages of those rescue beacons, the ones I saw outside the \ncheckpoint at Falfurrias, TX--they are in English, Spanish--that \ndoesn't surprise anybody. The third language is Chinese. Chinese is not \na native language for most--for anybody, I bet, in Brooks County, TX. \nWhat it demonstrates is that there is a pipeline coming across the \nsouthwestern border from all over the world. It doesn't take a lot of \nimagination to see what a potential threat that is from a public safety \nstandpoint.\n  I know there are people who scoff at the idea of enhanced border \nsecurity. The Senator from Illinois said we have enough Border Patrol \nto have one every half mile, 24 hours a day. This would be a way to try \nto secure the border. It has to be a combination of technology. It has \nto involve boots on the ground, and in some places--this is \ncontroversial along the border--we need to have what they call tactical \ninfrastructure, fencing in some places, particularly in urban areas \nwhere it is easy to sprint across and be lost in a crowd before anybody \ndiscovers them.\n  Last year there were roughly 414,000 people detained coming across \nthe southwestern border--414,000 from more than 144 countries. Does \nthat sound as though we solved the problem of border security? No.\n  We are also sending mixed messages, as I said earlier, in terms of \ndeterrence because people keep coming because they think they have a \npretty good shot of making it in, and then the President issues an \nExecutive order.\n  I wish to mention one other issue that has a particular impact on \ncommunities in my State of Texas, because we are on the frontlines of \nthis issue, which is cost to the local taxpayer. I know the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer is a former mayor. The cost of health \ncare, law enforcement, and education fall not primarily on Federal \ntaxpayers, they end up falling on local taxpayers, including the taxes \nthey pay for their school district or their city or their county, the \nemergency health care provided to the local emergency room and of \ncourse law enforcement costs.\n\n  Believe me, people who come across the border are not all coming for \nthe right reason. There are people who exploit our poorest border with \ncriminal intent on their mind. They are dangerous, and so law \nenforcement has to take special precautions. That costs money. It costs \nthe local taxpayers.\n  The Federal Government has been abdicating its responsibility along \nthe border for a long time. I, for one, have to chuckle when my friends \nfrom nonborder States want to tell me and tell\n\n[[Page S6172]]\n\nmy constituents about our backyard because frankly, to put it in a nice \nway, they need more information because they don't know what they are \ntalking about.\n  Most of my friends in the--this is understandable. We all understand \nour States and our regions. We know them better than other parts of the \ncountry that perhaps we haven't been to, but most of my colleagues--I \nget the impression that their knowledge of the border is from movies \nthey have seen or novels they have read, not from the facts on the \nground or studying statistics issued by the Border Patrol or the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  There is a right way and a wrong way to do what the President is \npurporting to do. The right way to do it is in accordance with the \nConstitution which requires both Houses to pass legislation and try to \nreconcile those in a conference committee and then send them to the \nPresident.\n  There are regular negotiations taking place all along the way, but \nthere are enough areas of consensus that I believe we can make true \nprogress. We have not been able to do it through a comprehensive bill \nbecause I think there is enormous skepticism, not just about Washington \nbut about Congress as well as about comprehensive bills having \nunintended consequences.\n  Take the Affordable Care Act. The President said: If you like what \nyou have, you can keep it. Your prices will go down, not up. That ended \nup not being true. When that happens people are skeptical. What are \nthey trying to sell us next? The best way to deal with that, it seems \nto me, is to break it down into smaller, transparent pieces, and then \nmove the pieces across the floor in the House and the Senate, and let's \nget them to the President.\n  After we have done that one, two, three, four times, I think people \nwill then say: Well, you know what we have just done is immigration \nreform in an incremental sort of way. It is not going to satisfy \neverybody. Again, if your demand is I want everything I want or I am \nnot going to take anything, we know what happens when people lay down \nthose sort of ultimatums. You get nothing.\n  While there are areas on the immigration topic, which admittedly is \ncontroversial, it is challenging, but it is our responsibility to \naddress these challenges and these difficulties and do the very best \njob we can. The answer is not--and it can't be--a Presidential abuse of \npower.\n  As I pointed out earlier, when we try to do things on that basis, \njust like if we try to pass legislation on a purely partisan basis, it \ndoesn't work. It is not sustainable. It is a provocation to the people \nwho have been carved out of the process to try to do what they can to \ndefend their role in the process, and that is what I worry about.\n  I remember being at a conference not that long ago when James Baker \nIII and Joseph Calafato spoke. They talked about the importance of \nbipartisanship. Not that I am ever going to get the Presiding Officer \nto agree with me on everything I believe and he is not going to agree \nwith me on everything I believe, but they made the point when it comes \nto some of the most challenging topics, bipartisanship solutions are \nthe only ones that are actually sustainable.\n  What happens is after the next election, the party that was pushed \nout of the process and run over then says, OK, we are going to try to \nrepeal everything they did because we didn't vote for it and we don't \nsupport it. That commends itself to my way of thinking to a \nrecommitment of bipartisan accomplishment. I am committed to that.\n  I know from talking to colleagues across the aisle that after 4 years \nof being shut out of the process themselves in the Senate, they are \ngoing to enjoy the new Congress come January because they will be able \nto participate in the process. If people have a good idea, they can \ncome to the floor and talk about it. They can offer their idea and get \na vote.\n  Nobody is guaranteed to win every time, but people should have a \nright to get a vote and to raise the profile of the issues they care \nmost about and the people they work for care most about.\n  I wish the President wouldn't do this. It will not work. It is \nunconstitutional. It purports to exercise a power he himself said he \ndoes not have, but he seems determined to do it nonetheless.\n  I believe the American people will react negatively to this \nPresident's claim of authority to issue this amnesty, and I believe \nthen the next step is for Congress to do everything we can to stop it \nand then to do it the right way, not the wrong way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, the words of Cicero are powerfully relevant \n2,077 years later: When, President Obama, do you mean to cease abusing \nour patience? How long is that madness of yours still to mock us? When \nis there to be an end to that unbridled audacity of yours, swaggering \nabout as it does now? Do not the nightly guards placed on the border, \ndo not the watches posted throughout the city, does not the alarm of \nthe people and the union of all good men and women--does not the \nprecaution taken of assembling the Senate in this most defensible \nplace--do not the looks and countenances of this venerable body here \npresent, have any effect upon you? Do you not feel that your plans are \ndetected? Do you not see that your conspiracy is already arrested and \nrendered powerless by the knowledge that everyone here possesses of it? \nWhat is there that you did last night, what the night before--where is \nit that you were--who was there that you summoned to meet you--what \ndesign was there which was adopted by you, with which you think that \nany one of us is unacquainted?\n\n  Shame on the age and on its lost principles. The Senate is aware of \nthese things; the Senate sees them; and yet this man dictates by his \npen and his phone. Dictates. Aye, he will not even come into the \nSenate. He will not take part in the public deliberations; he ignores \nevery individual among us. We gallant men and women think that we are \ndoing our duty to the Republic if we keep out of the way of his \nfrenzied attacks.\n  You ought, President Obama, long ago to have been led to defeat by \nyour own disdain for the people. That destruction which you have been \nlong plotting ought to have already fallen. What shall we, who are the \nSenate, tolerate President Obama, openly desirous to destroy the \nConstitution and this Republic? For I passed over old instances, such \nas how the IRS plotted to silence American citizens.\n  There was once such virtue in this Republic that brave men and women \nwould repress mischievous citizens with severe chastisement than the \nmost bitter enemy. For we have a resolution of the Senate, a formidable \nand authoritative decree against you, Mr. President. The wisdom of the \nRepublic is not at fault, nor the dignity of this Senatorial body. We, \nwe alone--I say it openly--we, the Senate, are waiting in our duty to \nstop this lawless administration and its unconstitutional amnesty.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6172-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6172-S6174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL RURAL HEALTH DAY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to recognize National Rural \nHealth Day. I would like to take a moment to recognize our rural health \ncare providers and all they do for this country.\n  Approximately 62 million Americans live in rural areas and they \ndepend on an ever-shrinking number of health care providers. Rural \nproviders play a very important role in improving the health of their \ncommunities and supporting local economies.\n  I thank our rural providers--individuals, hospitals, and clinics--for \nall they do. Rural providers support a population that makes invaluable \ncontributions to this country through food production, manufacturing, \nand other vital industries.\n  Yet more people in rural areas are living below the poverty line than \ntheir urban counterparts. Rural hospitals are struggling to continue \nproviding care due to declining payments, many exacerbated by the \nAffordable Care\n\n[[Page S6173]]\n\nAct. The past few years have been marked by increasing rural hospital \nclosures, with 27 hospitals shutting their doors in the past 2 years.\n  The trend is concerning and deserves attention as many more \nfacilities and communities are at risk. Once a hospital is gone, the \ndevastating impact on the community cannot be undone. The economic \nimpact is unmistakable.\n  The typical, critical access hospital creates over 140 jobs in \nprimary employment and $6.8 million in local wages while serving a \npopulation of over 14,000. When facilities close, the consequences of \ntraveling great distances for medical care are much more than just mere \ninconvenience. The delays in obtaining care can mean the difference \nbetween life and death. According to the U.S. News & World Report, that \nwas the case for an infant in Texas who choked on a grape and died \nafter the only hospital in the county had closed just a few months \nbefore.\n  There are a number of similarly tragic stories, and they will \ncontinue to mount if we fail to take action.\n  In 1946, Congress recognized the importance of rural health care \nproviders and worked to build the rural health care infrastructure that \nexists today. It is called the Hill-Burton Act. The country has changed \ndramatically since 1946 and thoughtful action to improve the \ndistribution and capabilities of our rural health care system is \noverdue. We need to act now to support our rural providers and \nfacilitate a responsible transition to a modernized health care system.\n  Rural America is facing what I would call an arbitrary attrition of \nproviders. The hospital closures are a function of no specific design. \nIt is all about balance sheets strained to the breaking point of \ncontinual payment cuts. It is not about where providers need to be to \nserve populations. We need to take a thoughtful look then at what the \nfuture of rural health care needs to be.\n  We need to be willing to consider bold steps to ensure that rural \nAmerica has access to high-quality health care. Health care coverage, \nwhether through private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, without access \nto providers of that care is meaningless.\n\n  We need to put a stop to the arbitrary process now and work forward \nin designing a better, sustainable future for rural health care.\n  I close, once again, by thanking all of America's rural providers. I \nam committed to working with all stakeholders to transition to a better \nfuture and protect access to health care in America.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  I would like to speak about the tax extenders bill that is being \nworked on between the House and the Senate in an informal conference \nand to explain why I am concerned about the direction it might be \ntaking, particularly as it relates to alternative energy and as it \nrelates to wind energy tax production credit.\n  Here we are in another lameduck session of Congress, working to \nfinish the business we failed to complete the previous year or two.\n  One of those critical pieces of legislation that must be enacted is a \ntax extender bill. It seems as though nearly every year in recent \nmemory we have put off the extension of expired tax provisions until \nthe very last minute.\n  In 2012 revision provisions remained expired for an entire year \nbefore we finally extended them in January of 2013. Similarly, the \nprevious extension of prior provisions did not occur until the middle \nof December.\n  Now, once again, we find ourselves heading into the month of December \nwith tax extenders having been expired for nearly 11 months, and there \nis a lot of uncertainty that causes a slowdown to the economy when \npeople don't know what the tax provisions are.\n  This is no way to do business. Such late action by Congress results \nin complications during filing season for taxpayers. That is a big \nproblem for the IRS. We need to do something right now. It is almost \ntoo late to get tax preparers to know what to do for the next tax \nseason. Obviously, tax season is unpleasant enough without our adding \nto it by failing to do our job in a timely fashion.\n  Once again, we have created a lot of headaches and uncertainty for \nindividuals and businesses. This uncertainty harms investment and \nbusiness growth; in other words, slowing the economy, as I previously \nsaid. This is bad for economic growth and does nothing to create the \njobs that can come when we have more certainty for people who invest in \ncapital and want to provide jobs.\n  The lapse of renewable energy incentives has also created a lot of \nuncertainty and slowed growth in the renewable energy. This only serves \nto hamper the strides made toward a viable, self-sustainable renewal \nenergy sector.\n  It didn't have to be this way. The Senate Finance Committee, under \nthe leadership of Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Hatch, did its job. \nWe marked up an extenders package in early April. The Senate never took \nup that package because the majority leader refused to allow \nRepublicans to offer amendments. And it happens that even a couple of \namendments that were going to be adopted had wide bipartisan support. \nRather than consider and advance the Finance Committee bill, the \nmajority leader shelved the extenders bill because of fear that Members \nof his party might have to take tough votes.\n  With the election behind us, it is now time to get to work and get \nthe extenders bill done. I understand that negotiations are ongoing \nbetween the House and Senate on this issue. I am encouraged by reports \nof progress being made. However, I am concerned about rumors that some \nare working to leave out or shorten the extension of the wind energy \ntax credit.\n  I fought this issue in the Finance Committee when one of the Members \non my side of the aisle tried to strike that provision. But we had a \nbipartisan vote of 18 to 5 to defeat that amendment that would have \nstruck the wind production tax credit from the bill that is now before \nthe Senate.\n  It seems as though opponents of wind energy have tried at every turn \nto undermine this industry, and so I am not surprised that we are at it \nagain, even considering the 18-to-5 vote in the Finance Committee.\n  I agree the Tax Code has gotten too cluttered with too many special \ninterest provisions. That is the reason many of us have been clamoring \nfor tax reform for years now. But just because we haven't cleaned up \nthe Tax Code in a very comprehensive way doesn't mean we should pull \nthe rug out from under domestic renewable energy producers. Doing so \nwould cost jobs, harm our economy, the environment, and our national \nsecurity.\n  I am glad to defend the wind energy production tax credit and \ncontinue to defend it. In fact, I can tell you that 22 years ago, when \nI first got this passed through the Congress to become law, I didn't \nthink it would become the big thing it is. But there is a tremendous \namount of energy being generated today by wind energy. Wind energy \nsupports tens of thousands of American jobs. It has spurred billions in \nprivate investment in the United States, and it displaces more \nexpensive and more polluting sources of energy.\n  More than 70 percent of U.S. wind turbines value is now produced in \nthe United States, compared to just 25 percent prior to 2005.\n  Once again, opponents of the renewable energy provisions want to have \nthis debate in a vacuum. They disregard the many incentives and \nsubsidies that exist for other sources of energy and are permanent law. \nFor example, the 100-year-old oil and gas industry continues to benefit \nfrom tax preferences that aren't generally throughout the economy for \nall businesses but only benefit their industry.\n  These are not general business tax provisions--I want to say that \nagain--they are specific to oil and gas business. A few examples: \nExpensing for intangible drilling costs, deductions for tertiary \ninjectants, percentage depletion for oilwells, special amortization for \ngeological costs.\n  I am not going to find fault with that, but I will find fault with \npeople who justify that, yet take on wind energy. These are four tax \npreferences for a single energy resulting in the loss of more than $4 \nbillion annually in tax revenue.\n  Nuclear energy is another great example. The first nuclear powerplant \ncame online in the United States in 1958. That is 56 years ago. Nuclear \nreceives special tax treatment for interest from decommissioning trust \nfunds.\n  Congress created a production tax credit for this mature industry in \n2005,\n\n[[Page S6174]]\n\nwhich is going to be available until 2020. Nuclear also benefits from \nPrice-Anderson Federal liability insurance that Congress provided. That \nwas supposed to be a temporary measure in 1958, but this temporary \nmeasure has been renewed through 2025. Nuclear energy has also received \n$74 billion of Federal research and development dollars since 1950.\n  Are those crony capitalist handouts? Well, nobody seems to be \nattacking them. Is it time to end the market distortions for nuclear \npower? Well, nobody is talking about that. But they are talking about \nwind energy.\n  We had a Cato study about nuclear energy that said:\n\n       In truth, nuclear power has never made economic sense and \n     exists purely as a creature of government.\n\n  People are saying that about wind energy, but I don't hear the same \npeople saying it about nuclear power.\n  I don't understand the argument that repealing a subsidy for oil and \ngas or nuclear energy production is a tax increase like the accusation \nagainst wind, while repealing an incentive on alternative or renewable \nenergy is not a tax increase. So it is not intellectually honest.\n  As I said before, we have had wind incentives since 1992, and I am \nthe father of that. I suppose now, after 22 years, you might say I am \nthe grandfather of it. I know it won't go on forever. In fact, it was \nnever meant to go on forever. And people in the wind energy even admit \nthat today and talk about phaseouts.\n  I am happy to discuss a responsible multiyear phaseout of that wind \ntax credit. In 2012, the wind energy was the only industry to put \nforward such a phaseout plan. But any phaseout must be done in the \ncontext of comprehensive tax reform where all energy tax provisions are \non the table, not just wind solely. And it should be done responsibly, \nover a few years, to provide certainty and ensure a viable industry.\n  It is time to put an end to the annual kabuki dance that is tax \nextenders. Good tax policy requires certainty that can only come from \nlong-term predictable tax law. Businesses need the certainty in the Tax \nCode so they can plan and invest accordingly.\n\n  Moreover, taxpayers deserve to know that the Tax Code is not just \nbeing used as another way to dole out funds to politically favored \ngroups. However, the only sound way to reach this goal is through \ncomprehensive tax reform.\n  I agree there are provisions in extenders that ultimately should be \nleft on the cutting room floor. But it is in tax reform--comprehensive \ntax reform--where we should consider the relative merits of individual \nprovisions. Targeting certain provisions for elimination now makes \nlittle sense for those of us who want to reduce tax rates as much as \npossible.\n  Tax reform provides an opportunity to use realistic baselines that \nwill allow the revenue generated from cutting back provisions to be \nused to pay for reductions in individual and corporate tax rates.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future to enact \ntax reform and put an end to the headaches and uncertainty created by \nthe regular expiration of tax provisions. Right now our focus must be \non extending current expired or expiring provisions to give us room to \nwork towards that goal.\n  It is my hope that we can move quickly to reach a bipartisan, \nbicameral agreement that can quickly be enacted and that includes the \nwind energy tax provisions. Taxpayers have already waited too long.\n  What really gripes me about this whole argument is that people say \nthey are for all of the above. I am for all of the above, I can say. \nYou know, that means fossil fuels, that means all sorts of alternative \nenergy, it probably includes conservation, and it includes nuclear. But \nwhen I see the people fighting the wind energy tax credit coming from \npetroleum and natural gas and from coal, I think of these people who \nsay they are for all of the above, they are really for all of the below \nbut for none of the above. And that is wrong and inconsistent.\n  I want a consistent, uniform tax policy for all forms of energy being \nextended right now.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, it is my privilege to \nrecommend to the Senate the Honorable Pamela Pepper to be a U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Patty served with \ndistinction and is the current chief judge of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court \nfor the Eastern District of Wisconsin.\n  Although not native to our State, she has set down deep roots in \nWisconsin, first serving in the Office of the United States Attorney \nfor the Eastern District of Wisconsin, followed by private practice in \nMilwaukee and finally serving 9 years as a bankruptcy court judge.\n  Pam was born in the delta of Mississippi in a town called Leland. Her \nparents were both teachers and instilled in her an intellectual \ncuriosity which has been apparent throughout her career. She migrated \nnorth for college and attended Northwestern University in Chicago, \nwhere she received a degree in theater.\n  After helping a friend get through the LSAT review course, she \nrealized she might want to explore other careers and ended up taking \nthe LSAT herself. She obviously had prepared herself well because she \nperformed well on the LSAT and was accepted into the Cornell University \nSchool of Law.\n  After graduation, she clerked with distinction for Judge Frank \nJohnson on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and then moved on to \nbecome a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago.\n  She is widely respected within her profession, evidenced by having \nheld offices as the president of the Milwaukee Bar Association and the \nchairperson of the Board of Governors of the State Bar of Wisconsin. \nShe is an instructor of national stature and speaks frequently on trial \npractice and evidence. She is currently an instructor at the Federal \nJudicial Center.\n  I have had the opportunity to speak to practitioners who have \nappeared before her bankruptcy court. They have told me of her patience \nwith attorneys, which is a virtue of hers they all value.\n  Pam possesses a great sense of humor, which she often uses to put \nlitigants at ease. She displays compassion in making tough decisions by \nexplaining the rationale for those decisions clearly so her reasoning \nis understood by all. She has shown great dexterity in reacting to \ndifficult situations in court with calm reasoning.\n  Finally, Pam has been described as a practical judge who promptly \nresolves disputes while faithfully adhering to the rule of law.\n  Pam's intellectual curiosity, her demonstrated ability to learn new \nareas of the law and efficiently administer her office, has convinced \nme she will continue to excel in her new role as a Federal district \ncourt judge. Judge Pepper has my full support, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote yes on her confirmation.\n  I conclude my remarks by thanking the hard-working members of our \nbipartisan nomination commission for their dedication and efforts.\n\n[[Page S6175]]\n\n  I also thank Senator Baldwin for her continued support of this \nsuccessful nominating process that has once again resulted in the \nselection of a well-qualified jurist, Judge Pamela Pepper, who will \nserve the N and the Wisconsin Eastern District well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. I rise this afternoon to urge my colleagues to confirm \nJudge Pamela Pepper for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Wisconsin. I am delighted to once again join my colleague \nSenator Johnson on the floor to discuss this nomination.\n  The people of Wisconsin deserve to have experienced and highly \nqualified judges working for them, and I am proud to have worked with \nmy colleague Senator Johnson and our judicial nominating commission to \nput in place this process for filling the critical Federal judicial \nvacancies in our State. I was pleased to join Senator Johnson in May of \nthis year to support the confirmation of Jim Peterson, whom the Senate \nconfirmed to a seat for a Federal judgeship in the Western District of \nWisconsin. I am pleased to stand on the floor with my colleague today \nto speak in support of another terrific judicial nominee who will serve \nthe people of Wisconsin well.\n  Judge Pepper is an outstanding bankruptcy judge, and she will be an \noutstanding U.S. Federal district judge.\n  As President Obama noted in making the nomination, ``Judge Pepper has \na long and distinguished record of service, and . . . will serve on the \nfederal court with distinction.''\n  Pam Pepper has indeed dedicated her professional career to public \nservice. She has a distinguished career as a judge, Federal prosecutor, \npublic defender, and attorney in private practice. She has spent that \ncareer dedicated to serving her clients and the people of the United \nStates. I am confident she will continue her outstanding service on the \nbench, and the people of Wisconsin will benefit from having this \nexperienced and dedicated public servant as a U.S. district judge.\n  As we have heard, she has served as the chief bankruptcy judge in the \nEastern District of Wisconsin since 2010, having served as a bankruptcy \njudge in that district since 2005. She simultaneously served the people \nof the Southern District of Illinois as a bankruptcy judge during that \nsame period. Judge Pepper has contributed significantly to the field of \nbankruptcy law and the continuing education of bankruptcy judges and \npractitioners.\n  Prior to her time on the bench, Pamela Pepper worked both as a solo \npractitioner engaged in criminal defense work and as a Federal \nprosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Offices in Chicago and then \nMilwaukee.\n  Before becoming a bankruptcy judge, Pam Pepper also held numerous \nleadership positions within the legal community, including on the \nboards of the Federal Defenders Service of Wisconsin, the State Bar of \nWisconsin, the Eastern District of Wisconsin Bar Association, and the \nMilwaukee Bar Association, just to name a few.\n  Senator Johnson and I strongly support Judge Pepper's nomination to \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Our \njoint support of a judicial nominee should once again send a strong \nmessage to the entire Senate that she is the right choice for this \njudgeship.\n  I urge my colleagues to confirm judge Pamela Pepper so that she can \ncontinue her distinguished service to the people of Wisconsin and the \npeople of the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business until 2 p.m.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6175-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6175-S6176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as we know, tonight President Obama is \ngoing to speak to the American people about reforming our broken \nimmigration system. I had dinner with him last night, and we talked \nabout this. I think it is generally expected that he will announce what \nhe can do to address some of the problems that are tearing families \napart, dragging the U.S. economy down and risking our national \nsecurity. For 2 years the Republican Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives refused to even allow a vote on the Senate's bipartisan \nbill. Because of that, I understand and appreciate why the President is \ngoing to act.\n  There are currently 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the \nUnited States, but everybody knows we are not going to round up and \ndeport 11 million people. It just can't be done. Even if it could be \ndone, it would be totally un-American and against everything that we \nstand for. These are, after all, mothers and fathers, sisters and \nbrothers, sons and daughters. They are not a number. They are real \npeople. And the President's action will acknowledge that. It is a \nnecessary step in an effort to bring people out of the shadows, focus \nscarce enforcement resources on those who actually pose a threat, and \nbring some stability to those who are hardworking, law-abiding members \nof our community. I would much rather have people who are taxpayers and \nknow they are here legally, so we can concentrate on those who aren't. \nThat is what the President wants to do.\n  President Obama knows there is no substitute for legislation. \nPresident Reagan and President Bush used a similar type of Executive \norder. It is a temporary and incomplete solution because legislation \nhas to be passed. We have to step up and fix the broken immigration \nsystem once and for all, as we did in the Senate when Republicans and \nDemocrats came together last year. But to those who say we should wait \nfor Congress to act, I think we have waited long enough.\n  We have been waiting now for 511 days since the Senate passed \nimmigration reform. That is 511 days, during which time the Republican-\ncontrolled House of Representatives could have taken up our bill--\neither voted for it or voted against it. The least they could do is \nvote. Vote ``yes'' or vote ``no.'' I think about what my friend and the \nformer chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Edward \nKennedy, said in the summer of 2007. We had comprehensive immigration \nreform before the Senate. It was being blocked by the Republicans. He \nsaid:\n\n       A minority in the Senate rejected a stronger economy that \n     is fairer to our taxpayers and our workers. A minority in the \n     senate rejected America's own extraordinary immigrant history \n     and ignored our nation's most urgent needs. But we're in this \n     struggle for the long haul.\n\n  Senator Kennedy was right. That is why Democrats and Republicans came \ntogether to pass an immigration bill out of the Senate. I just ask why, \n511 days later, has the Republican-controlled House refused to either \nvote for it or vote against it? We held days of hearings and lengthy, \nextensive markup sessions. We worked late into the evenings debating \nthe bill. Many of us worked weekends. I remember, because I was there. \nWe considered hundreds of amendments. More than 300 amendments were \nfiled. We adopted 136 of them. All but three were adopted with both \nRepublican and Democratic votes. What was initially a proposal from the \nso-called Gang of 8 became, through the committee process, the product \nof 18 Members from both sides of the aisle. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee recommended this improved bipartisan bill to the full Senate. \nIt wasn't exactly the bill that I would have written, but it was a fair \nand reasonable compromise. It reflected the deliberative process at its \nbest, and I felt honored to bring the bill to the floor.\n  But look what happened. Sixty eight of us voted to pass it, and the \nRepublican Speaker of the House of Representatives will not even bring \nit up for a vote. To this day, the Republican leadership in the House \nis batting zero when it comes to truly addressing the broken \nimmigration system.\n  The President is not acting alone. The American people support \nimmigration reform. Remember that. The American people support \nimmigration reform. A bipartisan majority of the Senate has endorsed \naction. It is the House of Representatives that is out of step. Our \nsystem is not going to fix itself. We know this. It should be no \nsurprise that the President has decided to use his authority to make \nour country safer, stronger, and more humane. If Republicans really, \ntruly want congressional action on reform, they can\n\n[[Page S6176]]\n\ntake action today and allow a vote on the Senate-passed bill. I hope \nthat every Member of the Republican Party who says that what the \nPresident is doing is terrible will also ask when House Republicans are \ngoing to vote one way or the other on the Senate's bill. Our bill would \nmake everything the President is doing unnecessary. Remember that.\n  The President has the legal authority to take this action. Every \nPresident since Eisenhower has exercised this authority. Some, such as \nPresident George H.W. Bush, did so on a sweeping scale. We make laws in \nCongress. The President sets enforcement policies. He clearly has the \npower to take the scarce resources we have given him and identify and \ndeport those people who pose a danger to our communities, and he can \nlimit the deportation of those who are law-abiding, tax-paying members \nof the community.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Next week, millions of families in this country will \ngather around a table to give thanks for the many blessings they have \nreceived. I know my family and I and our children and our grandchildren \nwill. The President's actions will be counted among those blessings for \nthe millions of loved ones who worry that their mother, father or \ngrandparents could be deported at any moment. The security the \nPresident's action will give these families on Thanksgiving is powerful \nand indispensable.\n  For some, it is about something even more urgent. It is about seeking \nsafety. While I applaud the President's announcement today, I remain \ndeeply disappointed by his decision to build a large new detention \nfacility to hold vulnerable women and children fleeing violence in \nCentral America. Many of these individuals are asylum seekers, not \ncriminals, and their ongoing detention is unacceptable. I urge him to \nrevisit this policy.\n  The action the President will announce today is going to draw \ncriticism from those who sought to stop immigration reform at every \nturn. As a grandson of immigrants, I say that after years and years of \nobstruction, the President is right to take action. I am married to a \nwoman who is the daughter of immigrants. At the heart of it all, this \nis about keeping America's communities strong and vibrant. We benefit \nfrom immigration. That has been our history. Let it be our future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6176-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nominations of Pamela Pepper, of Wisconsin, \nto be United States District Judge for the Eastern District of \nWisconsin; Brenda K. Sannes, of New York, to be United States District \nJudge for the Northern District of New York; Madeline Cox Arleo, of New \nJersey, to be United States District Judge for the District of New \nJersey; Wendy Beetlestone, of Pennsylvania, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania; and Victor \nAllen Bolden, of Connecticut, to be United States District Judge for \nthe District of Connecticut.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will vote on five outstanding \njudicial nominees to our Federal district courts. I thank the majority \nleader for filing for cloture on these nominees so we can clear the \nbacklog that still remains on our executive calendar as we move toward \nthe end of the 113th Congress. After we vote on these nominees today, \nhowever, we will still have 21 judicial nominees pending on the \nexecutive calendar to serve on district courts, the U.S. Court of \nFederal Claims, and the U.S. Court of International Trade.\n  The five nominees the Senate will vote on today are all well-\nqualified lawyers and there should be no controversy about their \nconfirmation. Four of these nominees: Pamela Pepper to the Eastern \nDistrict of Wisconsin, Brenda Sannes to the Northern District of New \nYork, Madeline Arleo to the District of New Jersey, and Wendy \nBeetlestone to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania were reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote and have the support of \ntheir home State senators.\n  The fifth nominee, Victor Bolden, who has been nominated to the \nDistrict of Connecticut, also has the strong support of his home State \nSenators, Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Murphy. Mr. Bolden's credentials are \nimpeccable. Since 2009, he has served as corporation counsel for the \ncity of New Haven, CT. Prior to joining city government, Mr. Bolden \nserved as general counsel and assistant counsel for the NAACP Legal \nDefense & Educational Fund. He has also served in private practice as \nan associate and counsel at the law firm of Wiggin & Dana in New Haven, \nCT. After graduating from Harvard Law School, Mr. Bolden began his \nlegal career at the American Civil Liberties Union as a staff attorney \nand as the Marvin Karpatkin Fellow.\n  During the Judiciary Committee executive business meeting where Mr. \nBolden's nomination was considered, the ranking member commented that \nhe was troubled by the nominee's views on racial classifications and \nhis advocacy on affirmative action. The ranking member also noted that \nhe did not agree with the nominee's criticisms of the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Shelby County v. Holder. Finally, the ranking member \ncriticized Mr. Bolden because he argued the nominee ``took a narrow and \nlegally incorrect view of individual rights under the Second Amendment \nin an amicus brief in Heller.'' The committee voted to report Mr. \nBolden's nomination favorably on a 10-to-8 party-line vote.\n  Let me address each of the issues raised by Ranking Member Grassley. \nFirst, in cases where Mr. Bolden has advocated for a specific position \nin which a Senator may disagree, Mr. Bolden was representing a client \nand not expressing his own personal views. As chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have stated repeatedly that attorneys should not be \nequated with the position of their clients. Our legal system is \npredicated upon zealous advocacy for both sides of an issue or matter. \nWithout this, our justice system would not function. Victor Bolden \nunderstands the difference between the role of an advocate versus the \nrole of a judge. In response to a question for the record from Senator \nGrassley on applying Supreme Court and Circuit Court precedents, Mr. \nBolden testified: ``I am fully committed to following the precedents of \nhigher courts faithfully and giving them full force and effect, \nregardless of any personal feelings I might have.''\n  Second, not only has Mr. Bolden testified under oath about this \ndistinction, but he has shown that he would apply and implement orders \nfrom a higher court. In Ricci v. DeStefano, Mr. Bolden represented the \ncity of New Haven as corporation counsel. In that case, several White \nfirefighters and one\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\nHispanic firefighter sued the city of New Haven in 2003, alleging \nracial discrimination after the city threw out the results of an exam \nused for promotion of the city's firefighters. The test results had \nshown that White firefighters had outperformed minority applicants. The \nSupreme Court ultimately ruled against New Haven and held that the \ncity's abandonment of the test results constituted intentional \ndiscrimination against the White firefighters. Mr. Bolden subsequently \nhelped ensure that the city complied with the Court's order and \ndefended the decision against collateral attacks.\n  To his credit, Mr. Bolden did such an outstanding job of ensuring \ncompliance with the Supreme Court's decision that the named plaintiff--\nfirefighter Frank Ricci--wrote a letter strongly supporting Mr. \nBolden's nomination. Let me quote some of this letter:\n\n       It was apparent to me from our initial dealings whether as \n     a plaintiff or union representative that the Mayor had made a \n     great choice in the selection of the new Corporation Counsel. \n     Although Victor represented the City and therefore would be \n     naturally presumed an adversary it never felt that way. \n     Through the remainder of the litigation from the U.S. Supreme \n     Court decision to the final judgments Victor displayed and \n     has always displayed the attributes one could hope for in a \n     jurist. He's always conscious that there are real people \n     affected by decisions that are made but he is also very \n     deliberate in those decisions with an unwavering commitment \n     to the law. Victor is a consummate professional with \n     unquestionable integrity. These observations are not limited \n     to me but have been the topic of many discussions between me \n     and others, including those inside and outside the fire \n     service. I cannot think of anyone who would make a finer \n     addition to our federal judiciary than him. And I could not \n     have a greater honor than to write this correspondence \n     supporting that.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full letter \nof support.\n  Third, Mr. Bolden's criticisms of the Supreme Court's decision in \nShelby County v. Holder in a 2013 editorial were shared by a \nsubstantial number of legal scholars and Senators, including me. As I \nhave said, the Shelby County decision was a dreadful decision and \nwrongly decided. A narrow majority of the Court decided to substitute \nits own judgment over the exhaustive legislative findings of Congress \nshowing that racial discrimination in voting still occurs. Instead, the \nCourt chose to effectively strike down the heart of the Voting Rights \nAct by holding that the coverage formula for preclearance was outdated. \nI authored a bipartisan bill along with Congressmen Sensenbrenner and \nJohn Lewis on this, but to this date, not a single Senate Republican \nhas signed on. In short, I believe that Victor Bolden's views on voting \nrights are well within the mainstream. Nevertheless, Mr. Bolden has \nstated for the Record that he ``would faithfully apply Supreme Court \nand Second Circuit precedent'' on the issue.\n  Lastly, Mr. Bolden has been criticized for authoring an amicus brief \non behalf of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in District \nof Columbia v. Heller. At the time Mr. Bolden authored the amicus \nbrief, the controlling precedent in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence \nwas United States v. Miller, which did not hold that there was an \nindividual right to bear arms outside of the context of a ``well \nregulated Militia.'' Accordingly, the brief that Mr. Bolden filed \nactually cited to Supreme Court precedent that was controlling on the \nissue at the time. Now that the Supreme Court has decided Heller, Mr. \nBolden has testified under oath that he ``would faithfully apply the \nSupreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller and other \nSecond Amendment jurisprudence'' and all other areas of the law.\n  Senators should not vote against Mr. Bolden for advocating on behalf \nof a client using the applicable Supreme Court precedent at the time. I \nhave heard that some Senators have been continuing to distort Mr. \nBolden's record on the Senate floor during his cloture vote. I can only \nhope that these distortions and fabrications are dismissed as they \nrightly should be.\n  Mr. Bolden is an outstanding nominee and a substantial majority of \nthe ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has also rated him \n``well qualified.'' I wholeheartedly support this nominee and would \nstrongly urge my fellow Senators to do the same.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 25, 2014.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I write this correspondence with great \n     excitement and enthusiasm to support the nomination and \n     appointment of Attorney Victor Bolden to the U.S. District \n     Court of Connecticut.\n       I have known and worked with Attorney Bolden for more than \n     5 years. I first met him around the time that he was \n     appointed Corporation Counsel for the City of New Haven. Our \n     first interactions surrounded an ongoing legal matter that I \n     was the lead plaintiff, Ricci et al. v. DeStefano et al.\n       As a member, representative and current Secretary-Treasurer \n     of New Haven Fire Fighters IAFF Local 825, positions I've \n     held for over 16, these were challenging times. Emotions and \n     frustrations surrounding this issue were somewhat raw to say \n     the least. The relationship between the plaintiffs, union and \n     the City, especially the Corporation Counsel was completely \n     broken and seemed irreparable.\n       Luckily that was about to change. It was apparent to me \n     from our initial dealings whether as a plaintiff or union \n     representative that the Mayor had made a great choice in the \n     selection of the new Corporation Counsel. Although Victor \n     represented the City and therefore would be naturally \n     presumed an adversary it never felt that way. Through the \n     remainder of the litigation from the U.S. Supreme Court \n     decision to the final judgments Victor displayed and has \n     always displayed the attributes one could hope for in a \n     jurist. He's always conscious that there are real people \n     affected by decisions that are made but he is also very \n     deliberate in those decisions with an unwavering commitment \n     to the law. Victor is a consummate professional with \n     unquestionable integrity. These observations are not limited \n     to me but have been the topic of many discussions between me \n     and others, including those inside and outside the fire \n     service. I cannot think of anyone who would make a finer \n     addition to our federal judiciary than him. And I could not \n     have a greater honor than to write this correspondence \n     supporting that.\n       If you have any questions or there is something more that \n     you feel I could be helpful with please do not hesitate to \n     contact me.\n           Respectfully,\n     Lt. Frank Ricci.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6177-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6177-S6178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VOTE ON PEPPER NOMINATION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to say a few words of \ncongratulations to these nominees and particularly to Judge Paige \nMarvel, a great Marylander, on her reappointment to the Tax Court.\n  As we know, the Tax Court serves a crucial role in this country's tax \nsystem. It is a highly specialized court that provides an important \nforum in which taxpayers can dispute determinations by the IRS. Tax \nCourt judges have the difficult task of ably and fairly analyzing the \nhighly technical legal issues that arise under our complex tax code.\n  At the close of Judge Marvel's first term on the U.S. Tax Court, I \nwas a strong supporter of her reappointment, and I am an equally strong \nsupporter of her confirmation. Judge Marvel has served on the court \nwith distinction, and it is in the best interests of this country to \nkeep someone with her integrity and expertise on the Tax Court bench. \nThis integrity and expertise was also apparent prior to Judge Marvel's \nassumption of her current office. I worked extensively with her on a \nvariety of issues when I served in the Maryland General Assembly in \nAnnapolis.\n  My colleagues on the Finance Committee, including Chairman Wyden and \nRanking Member Hatch, have worked hard and in a bipartisan manner to \nbring these nominations forward, for which I am grateful. And, I am \nextremely proud that a fellow Marylander has been nominated to continue \nthe important work of fairly interpreting and applying our tax laws, \nwhich affect the lives of every American citizen and resident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6180-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to honor the service of a \ndedicated leader in my home State of Nebraska.\n  Governor Dave Heineman has guided our State during the past 10 years \nwith vision and with laser-like focus on efficient government, economic \nvibrancy, education, and protecting our families.\n  Under his leadership and careful management, our State held strong \nthrough the economic downturn. During that time, the national spotlight \nshown very brightly on Nebraska as one of the healthiest States, guided \nby Dave Heineman's very steady hand, to ensure we remain debt-free and \nfiscally sound. But the Governor did far more than hold the line on \nspending and balancing the books of our great State. He provided \nhistoric tax relief, bolstered education in our State, and he sent a \nsignal worldwide that Nebraska welcomes new business through enhanced \neconomic development incentives. It is not surprising that Nebraskans' \nenthusiastically elected and then reelected Dave Heineman to the post, \ngiving him the proud distinction of being our longest serving Governor \nin the history of our State.\n  I had the privilege of working side by side with Dave Heineman back \nin my days as Governor of Nebraska. I was so proud to have him as my \nLieutenant Governor in my second term, and I was always grateful for \nthe job he did directing the State's homeland security efforts.\n  We would have to flip the history books back to 1990, nearly 25 years \nago, to see when he was first elected to public office as a member of \nthe Fremont, NE, city council. Four years later, he was elected to his \nfirst statewide office to serve as our State treasurer. I was mayor of \nthe city of Lincoln at the time, and I enjoyed watching Dave step onto \nthe statewide stage with enthusiasm and determination. He wanted to get \nthings done.\n  Nebraskans would nod their head in agreement with the assertion that \nhe remains as determined today, in the last days of his time in office, \nas the very first day he walked in.\n  I should note he first served the public as a member of our Armed \nForces, having spent 5 years in the U.S. Army after graduating from the \nU.S. Military Academy at West Point. As anyone can tell you, it is easy \nto spot those West Point influences even today. All of those \nexperiences prepared him so well to serve as our Governor. I had \nabsolutely no doubt about his ability to step into the role when I was \nconfirmed as the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. I passed the baton to \nDave with immense confidence, and indeed he took the helm and never \nmissed a beat. It is difficult to believe that was 10 years ago. I \nthink both of us have a lot more gray hair to show for it, but we also \nhave something more valuable than gold: the honor of having been \nentrusted to lead and to serve the best State of the United States. I \nknow Governor Heineman has worked each day to prove worthy of that \ntrust, as I have also. His nearly 25 years of distinguished service \nrequired strength of character and fortitude.\n\n  Throughout that service and long before it began, Dave has had a \nwonderful partner in his life, Sally Ganem. Our First Lady is \nimpressive and accomplished. She is a woman in her own right, having \nserved as principal of an elementary school and now leading numerous \nvolunteer and literacy efforts. She has supported Dave every step of \nthe way on a public service journey that offers a shining example for \nothers to follow. Thus, it is fitting that we have never before had a \nGovernor whose service spans 10 years, and we may never have that \nagain.\n  On behalf of a grateful State and a grateful nation, I offer my \nsincerest gratitude for the dedicated leadership Governor Heineman has \nprovided to our great State of Nebraska.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6180-4", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6180-S6182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Tonight there will be a speech. I think everyone is aware \nof that. I think we all know pretty much what the President of the \nUnited States is going to say.\n  I would like to read the oath of office that any President of the \nUnited States has to take, and this President has taken this oath in an \naffirmative way for--I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Tonight we have the President's speech, and I would like \nto recite one more time what every President has to say and has to \naffirm before he becomes President.\n\n       I do solemnly swear or affirm that I will faithfully \n     execute the Office of the President of the United States, and \n     will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend \n     the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  I think people are overlooking this because they know what to expect \ntonight. They know what is going to happen. They know the President is \ngoing to do something that in the eyes of most people--and I have to \nsay that most of the people I talk to are from my State of Oklahoma. \nThey have a lot of common sense and ask the question: Is this illegal, \nwhat we are about to witness?\n  The President is bound by the Constitution to ensure the laws on the \nbooks are being carried out in a manner that is true to the law that is \nwritten and passed by Congress. It is his duty, his obligation. That \nwas envisioned by our Founding Fathers.\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\n  As any school-aged kid or any of my grandchildren would say, laws are \nmade in Congress and signed into law by the President. Once bills \nbecome law, the President's constitutional duty is triggered at that \npoint, no matter who holds the office or how that person feels about \nthe particular law. If a President finds a law problematic, then this \nis how he has to address that problem: He has to work with Congress to \nchange the law. He does not have the authority to unilaterally declare \nthat law not to apply to millions of Americans, which is what I think \nwe are going to witness tonight. That is exactly what the President is \ndoing.\n  He issued ultimatums to Congress: Pass what I want or else. We heard \nthat. We heard those words. When Congress and the American people push \nback against him, he charges forward with Executive orders that are \nwritten and executed behind closed doors. Let's remember that at the \ntime this President first took office, his big thing was transparency. \nHe wants people to know what is going on and not have any surprises. \nYet this is what is happening: These Executive orders are taking the \nplace of those laws that are passed by Members who are elected to the \nHouse and to the Senate.\n\n  He says the reason for this is he is tired of waiting on an \nimmigration system that is broken. Those are his words. He has taken \naction because Congress won't. That is not the way it works. A Congress \nthat has had--by the way, he had a Democratic majority the first 2 \nyears in the House and Senate and the White House. He can't say we are \nnot doing it. He is certainly not referring to Republicans. These are \nthe excuses for doing what he is doing.\n  Some claim he is not doing anything different from what President \nRonald Reagan or President George H.W. Bush did. I think it is very \nimportant, very briefly, to show you that is not true at all.\n  In 1986 Congress passed and President Reagan signed into law the \nImmigration Reform and Control Act, which gave amnesty to close to 3 \nmillion illegal immigrants. Amnesty was granted by statute, not by \nExecutive order. That was a law which was passed and which the \nPresident signed and agreed to.\n  Soon after, the people realized the children of these immigrants--who \nwere still eligible for deportation--were simply overlooked. The fact \nis, if there is a husband and a wife and they are able to go ahead and \nbecome naturalized citizens, their underaged children would have to be \nas well. Everyone agreed, no one disagreed, and so they went ahead and \ndid it. That was working with Congress. Congress made that decision \nwith the President of the United States.\n  In 1990 President Bush expanded President Reagan's grant of deferred \ndeportation to all minor children and to the spouses of those who were \ngranted amnesty in the 1986 law, and Congress codified the policy later \nthat year in the Immigration Act of 1990. So it wasn't George H.W. Bush \nwho did this; it was the Congress of 1990 that did this. We are not \ntalking about the same thing at all.\n  In the case of both Reagan and Bush, they worked with Congress and \ninterpreted a statute. That is not what is happening now. President \nObama is creating a law on his own as to how he wishes the law would \nbe. He has no authority to do it. We are going to see this tonight, and \nI think we need to have this in our background in what we are looking \nfor.\n  As we saw with his previous amnesty--that was 2012; we remember that, \nabout 2\\1/2\\ years ago--this new Executive amnesty will encourage more \npeople to come here and break the laws.\n  This year, thanks to President Obama's Executive order--called the \ndeferred action for childhood arrivals, DACA--Americans watched as \nunaccompanied alien children--that is, the UAC--poured over our \nsouthern border seeking the same amnesty others had been given. Who is \nto say the President won't give them that? It is reported that tonight \nhe will be changing the qualifications of the DACA to include even \nmore.\n  What happened then is really worse than what is happening now and \ngoing to be announced tonight because at least tonight they are talking \nabout 5 to 6 million people who are going to be granted amnesty, and \nwhat he did before in encouraging the young people to get here to the \nUnited States--we don't know where they are today or how many there \nare.\n  In my State of Oklahoma--Fort Sill in Lawton, OK--we have a base that \nwas given several hundred of these young children. They are under 18 \nyears of age. They were told they were to house these children until \nJanuary. It worked out pretty well because we were in the middle of \nbuilding some buildings down there, and so we had a place for them for \na temporary period of time. They were supposed to be released in \nJanuary. I went down there in October, and they were already gone. They \ndidn't really know where they were, but they were gone. Even to this \nday, if you call up and talk to the commander down there, they will \ntell you they don't know for sure where they are.\n  To go even further into this, I went to the Texas border, where I \nwent to a center called Los Fresnos. There are 18 IES facilities on the \nsouthern border. It is not just in Texas but all--I think 13 of those \nare in Texas. I went down there to see the process they used. I talked \nto the Border Patrol. The Border Patrol told me they are instructed \nto--and they did--send the kids as they came to the various facilities, \nthese 18 facilities. So I went to the one that I believe is the \nlargest. It is called Los Fresnos. It is on the southern border on the \neastern side of Texas. They weren't very happy about this. I went in \nand took a bunch of pictures to see what was going on there. I found \nout that they had a facility that had 200 beds. They had 200 beds. That \nis a very small number of people.\n  I asked the question: How many kids are coming through here?\n  They said: Thousands.\n  I said: How many in the last 6 months?\n  They said: Well, several thousand.\n  Let's keep in mind they can only bed down 200 people. Thousands have \ncome through.\n  We came back to trace where these thousands actually ended up. We \nwere not able to find out. You can find that they have a Web site \nsaying how many States received how many kids. We have no way of \nverifying if that is true. For all we know, there are hundreds of \nthousands of kids out there, and we don't know where they are.\n  Those people who are concerned about 5 to 6 million people tonight, \nkeep in mind that it is really much more than that. On that number, the \nissue we have is we don't know where the children eventually end \nup, and the administration does not have to notify the local \ngovernments of their presence. There are counties that are published as \nto how many are in a county. We don't know their names.\n\n  Interestingly, when I was at Los Fresnos on the border, I talked to a \nlot of the kids who were being brought into this country. Those kids--\neach one had a story, and you could tell it was a rehearsed story: I \nhave parents who live in California. I have a dad who lives in New \nYork. They all had a story down as if they are coming back.\n  Keep in mind--these are kids who came not from Mexico but through \nMexico. We heard only yesterday some of the atrocities, the things that \nhad happened to some of these kids--the raping, the killing, all of \nthat--as they were making the transition through Mexico.\n  They publish online what States they end up in, but we don't know the \nnumbers, whether these are verified numbers or if we are taking their \nword for it.\n  Something is going on, and even I, as a Member of the Senate, have \ngone down there two separate times to Los Fresnos and still don't know \nthe answer to the questions that I get from people in Oklahoma who are \nvery much concerned about this. Who monitors to ensure that they remain \nand show up for court? If they evade the law long enough,--and they \nknow now they can evade the law; if the President can do it, they can \ndo it--then amnesty will eventually be received by them.\n  We have immigration laws that are going to be ignored. What does this \nsay to the immigrants who are coming into America and applying for \ncitizenship in accordance with the law?\n  I have been honored several times to go and be the speaker at \nnaturalization ceremonies in my State of Oklahoma. I\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\nwill tell you, you cry when you look out there. You see a couple \nhundred people who have come to this country, gone through the system, \nstudied the history--and I would suggest those people up for \nnaturalization probably know the history much better than people who \nare born here in this country. They learn the language. They go through \nall these things, and finally they become citizens of the United \nStates. That is the legal way to do it. What are their thoughts right \nnow after all they have gone through and the doors are open for anyone \nto come through? Is that compassion for those people? I don't think so. \nCompassion is acknowledging and respecting the millions who adhere to \nour laws and achieve citizenship.\n  But here is the thing. When you stop being a nation based on the rule \nof law, you are at the mercy of one man and his whims. It sounds \nexactly like something our Founding Fathers were looking to avoid and \nescape. I think that is the problem we have. I have people asking me: \nWhy is the President breaking the law with regularity? Does he not have \nto obey the law the same as we do?\n  Well, as you know, there is a lawsuit that is being processed over on \nthe House side. But we also know this: Anyone who comes who has 2 years \nleft in his term knows if something is starting the process to \ndetermine whether action is legal, it would be probably 5 or 6 years \nbefore that case would be decided. By that time he is long gone.\n  I want to mention one thing that is specific. People say: Well, how \ncan you say the President is breaking the law? He does break the law. \nHe breaks it all the time. One of the things I have been concerned \nabout for a long period of time is keeping the installation named \nGuantanamo Bay--called Gitmo--keeping it open. It is the only place \nthat we can keep the type of terrorists we have down there. It is one, \nI think, that has worked out well. But somehow there is the obsession \nthat this President has--he wants to close Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay.\n  Knowing that, I put an amendment on the Defense authorization bill in \n2014. If anyone wants to look it up, it is section 1035(d) of the 2014 \nNational Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA. It specifically states--\nanticipating that the President would start releasing these people from \nGuantanamo Bay without authority, we put into law that the President \nshall notify Congress not later than 30 days before the transfer or \nrelease of any Guantanamo Bay detainee.\n  What did we find out? The President, without notifying anyone, \nreleased probably the five--in fact, not probably, certainly the five \nvery worst of the terrorists who were being kept down there. In fact, \none of their names was Mohammad Fazl. One of the Taliban commanders, \nwhose name is Mullah Salem Khan, made this statement--this is right \nafter the President released the five terrorists. We do not know where \nthey are, whether they are killing Americans, where they are right now.\n  He said, ``Mohammad Fazl, his returning is like pouring 10,000 \nTaliban fighters into the battle on the side of Jihad. Now the Taliban \nhas the right lion to lead them in the final moment before victory in \nAfghanistan.''\n  So that is another issue altogether. These people are released to \ncome back and kill Americans. But the point is, that law was aimed \nspecifically at the President that he cannot do that. He did it. So \nwhen I see these things happen, I think I have never seen this before.\n  I am not a real student of history, but certainly I have read an \nabundant amount of the history of this institution as well as the \nPresident and what is going and what should go on in Washington and \nwhat our Founding Fathers envisioned. Our Founding Fathers never \nenvisioned they would have a President who would blatantly break the \nlaw, specifically break the law.\n  That is what is happening now. That example is just one of many I \ncould give. So enjoy the speech tonight. I think you are going to see \nthat another one of our laws looks as though it is going to be broken. \nThat would be our immigration laws that are on the books now.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey).

Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about a \nstaffer I will be very sad to lose tomorrow. Denzel McGuire is one of \nthe most genuine people you will ever meet. She always has a smile on \nher face and a ready joke, and she is the only Senate staffer I know of \nwho can plan on--listen to this--a personal birthday song from Speaker \nBoehner every year. She also has a determination that is as strong as \nsteel. She is a master at negotiating. And all Members--even the \nSpeaker--have learned it is wise to stay in her good graces.\n  Denzel has worked for some of the most respected Members of this \nbody, including Jon Kyl and Judd Gregg. She has taken on some of the \nthorniest issues over her more than 20 years here in Congress.\n  In this job you get accustomed to hearing bad news, but what I tell \npeople is that if I have to hear bad news from someone, I would rather \nhave it come from Denzel. She always has a plan moving forward, and \nthere is usually a joke slipped in there as well.\n  Denzel is too modest to say so herself, but she has been in the \nmiddle of a lot of big legislative battles around here. She has been in \nthe mix on pretty much everything you could imagine that has to do with \nbudgets and government funding issues--in other words, pretty much \neverything. She has also worked a lot of late nights. She has plenty of \nwar stories, but she has never lost her optimism or her good humor. \nNow, that is no mean feat.\n  I am really going to miss Denzel, but she has more than earned a \nbreak, and I wish her nothing but the best as she moves on to the next \nchapter in her life. I am sure she will be a great success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6182-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CHRIS DOBY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would also like to say a quick word \nabout Chris Doby, the Senate financial clerk, who will be leaving us \nsoon after more than three decades of service.\n  Chris came to the Senate in 1983 after graduating from Radford \nUniversity. He was a junior auditor back in those days. Today he has a \nbroad range of duties. He has weathered a lot of storms. He is also one \nof the most popular guys in the Senate because he is responsible for \nmaking sure everybody gets paid. But Senators' staffs are not the only \nones who have nice things to say about Chris. His colleagues praise his \nsincerity, his steady hand, his confidence, and his friendliness.\n  Chris is the consummate family man. He has three daughters: Colleen, \nCaroline, and Courtney; a grandson he adores; and a wife of 31 years, \nCathy. I know he is looking forward to spending more time with all of \nthem. He is probably looking forward to the end of his daily commute \ntoo. It is a 2-hour trek from the District to his home in Virginia. \nThat is 2 hours each way, every day. I understand that Cathy has a to-\ndo list for Chris that is a mile long, so we know he will have a lot on \nhis plate when he leaves here.

Madam President, I wish to take a moment to pay tribute to \nmy former chief of staff, Michael Kennedy. In my 38 years as a Senator, \nI have\n\n[[Page S6183]]\n\nseen many talented staffers come and go, but few have left such a \nlasting impression as Michael. He is someone for whom I have a deep \nappreciation and much respect. That is why it was so difficult for me \nwhen I learned Michael would be leaving my office to pursue an \nopportunity in the private sector. I had come to rely so much on his \ncounsel, his leadership, and his savvy. It was very difficult and hard \nto let him go. I know I speak for everyone on my staff when I say \nMichael will be sorely missed.\n\n  Before Michael came to my office, he was living in Salt Lake City and \nworking at Utah State University as the vice president for Federal and \nState relations. Under his leadership, that university developed its \nfirst professional program, secured critical line-item funding, \nenhanced its footprint and resource portfolio, and became a key player \nin facilitating the merger of two Utah schools.\n  Michael was also the point man for all matters related to Capitol \nHill and the Utah State legislature. His reputation for hard work and \nintegrity helped him craft strong relationships throughout the State. \nHe knew the landscape, customs, and culture of Utah better than almost \nanyone. His experience and his reputation proved invaluable to me.\n  I know these tributes sound like eulogies with the way we talk about \npeople as if they had already passed on. Considering how hard Michael \nworked, I am surprised this isn't his eulogy. His energy and work ethic \nalways amazed me, as did his sense of style. Perhaps the only thing \nsharper than Michael's mind was his wardrobe. Few people can pull off a \nnavy suit with pink lining and silver cufflinks, but Michael did so \nwith ease. Of course, you might not know Michael was such a sharply \ndressed staffer because his boss usually stole the fashion spotlight, \nand after Washingtonian magazine named me the best-dressed man in \nCongress, I can only hope that some of my style rubbed off on him. \nHowever, if people knew how little I paid for my clothing, I think they \nmight want to take back that honor.\n  Michael took a pay cut when he joined my staff nearly 4 years ago, \nand he always joked that his next job would be as an unpaid summer \nintern. I like to think Michael's financial sacrifice was emblematic of \nhis desire to serve the State of Utah and improve this great country \nthrough the Senate. His willingness to serve was most evident in the \nway he always put the needs of constituents and staff above his own.\n  Michael's dedication to my staff was only surpassed by his dedication \nto his family, and I truly believe he owes his success to the constant \nsupport of his wife Natalie--an absolutely beautiful woman whom I have \nbeen blessed to know. Natalie and her family have been friends of mine \nsince she was young. Natalie grew up as a friend of my children, so \nnaturally I felt protective and wanted the best for her.\n  When she announced her engagement to Michael, Elaine and I were \ndelighted. Still, I was surprised that someone as impressive as Natalie \nwould agree to Michael's engagement proposal. I guess to his long list \nof talents and accomplishments, we could add marrying out of his \nleague.\n  I was very grateful that Natalie knew very well the rigors and \nintensity of serving on a Senate staff, having worked previously with \nSenator Bob Bennett. Not only was she an invaluable support to Michael, \nshe was also there to help me in any way she could. She was wonderful.\n  While Michael was serving as my chief of staff, Natalie gave birth to \ntheir daughter Emily--or as I like to call her ``Sweet Pea.'' Shortly \nafter her birth, Michael's family gathered in my Capitol office and \ngave Sweet Pea a father's blessing, as is the tradition in our faith. \nIt was a sacred experience for Elaine and me to join Michael and \nNatalie and both their families for that special occasion.\n  Michael's family wasn't the only one to grow in the time he was with \nme. During those few years, we had 12 new babies and 4 spouses added to \nthe families of our staff. Whenever there was a birth or marriage, \nMichael went out of his way to make sure they were taken care of. He \nfostered an atmosphere of camaraderie, friendship, and family \nfriendliness that was critical for my office's ability to serve the \npeople of Utah. People always knew he was genuinely concerned for them \nand their needs as they tried to adjust to the wonderful changes of a \ngrowing family.\n  Nevertheless, I know there were plenty of times when Michael would \nrather have been with Natalie than with me. One particular instance \ncomes to mind. During the end of the 112th Congress, Michael and I rang \nin the new year together during an extended voting session. Michael \nbought a bottle of blue Powerade from the downstairs vending machine \nhere at the Capitol, and we counted down the seconds on my Senate \nclock. I knew he wanted to be with his family, but I was grateful for \nhis sacrifice in staying with me.\n  This intense dedication was the norm for Michael Kennedy. Every night \nthat I left the Senate, Michael would be there to wish me a safe drive \nhome and continue his work for me late into the night. Whenever I \ntraveled, he was always by my side and ready to help. Together we spent \na lot of time on the road, visiting each of Utah's 29 counties. We \ndrove from meeting to meeting across beautiful western landscapes and \nhad many memorable conversations. Though road trips can often be long \nand tedious, Michael's sharp intellect and good humor made him one of \nthe greatest traveling companions I have ever had.\n\n  I have been extremely fortunate when it comes to my staff. I have had \nthe privilege of serving with some of the most gifted and devoted \npeople our Nation has to offer. Each of them has brought something \nunique and important to their service, but I have to say that even \namong the select fraternity of talented Senate staffers, Michael \nKennedy belongs in an elite class.\n  I have no doubt Michael will enjoy enormous success in his new \nposition. Success has been the defining characteristic of every \nendeavor he has undertaken. I have had many chiefs of staff over my 38 \nyears in the Senate, but none has ever been better than Michael.\n  While the selfish part of me wishes he could have stayed in the \nSenate just a bit longer, I have to say that I wish Michael, Natalie, \nand darling Sweet Pea the very best going forward.\n  I don't say these things haphazardly. This young man is truly one of \nthe finest people I have known in all of my experience in the Senate of \nthe United States. He was dedicated, he was consecrated to his work, \nand he did everything he possibly could to help my staff and me do a \nbetter job in the Senate.\n  Michael is a true friend, and he will always be somebody whose \nfriendship I revere. As I said, his wife is a wonderful friend as well, \nand Sweet Pea--I call her ``Pea'' now--is one of the cutest, most \ndarling young girls that I have ever seen.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this past Saturday, open enrollment \nbegan for the second round of State-based and Federal exchanges all \nacross the country.\n  We can think about where we were a year ago today: The government was \nin shutdown. The Federal Web page where people went to enroll was a \nblank screen for many. There was frustration all across the country, \nand a lot of our friends on the other side of the aisle were claiming \nthat this was proof the health care reform law could not work. They \nclaimed it was a failure from the beginning.\n  Well, a year makes a big difference. It is a year later, and we have \n7 million, 8 million people who have insurance on these exchanges \nacross the country. We have lowered the number of people without \ninsurance by 25 percent in a year's period of time. That is remarkable. \nIn my State of Connecticut, where we run the best exchange in the \nentire country, we have cut the number of uninsured in half in\n\n[[Page S6184]]\n\njust a year's period of time. That is an even more stunning number. \nHealth care rates of inflation are as low as they have been in most of \nour lifetimes. The State of Connecticut is actually spending less on \nMedicaid than it was a year or two ago, and quality is getting better. \nBy most all of the indices that we follow, the number of people who are \nreadmitted to a hospital after a surgery or the number of infections \npeople get while they are in the hospital are all lower than they were \nwhen the bill first went into effect.\n  While a lot of my Republican friends come to the floor with stories \nabout people who have bad insurance with the health care bill, the data \nclearly is on our side. The data tells only one story that the \nAffordable Care Act is working. But we have a lot of stories, too--\nmillions of them, as it turns out. I have never denied that there will \nbe people who have bad experiences with the health care system, with \nthe Affordable Care Act, and with the exchanges. But they are in the \nvast minority. The majority are people such as Christina who is a small \nbusiness owner from Stratford, CT. Several years ago, she left a job \nthat provided employer-based coverage to start her own business in \nBridgeport. It was her dream to start her own business. But as with a \nlot of Americans who have a dream to start their own business, she was \nreticent about doing it because she was worried about losing her health \ncare insurance. She stayed insured on COBRA until it expired, and then \nshe went on the individual market. She recalls having to fill out a 15-\npage questionnaire asking, as she says, ``anything that I had ever \nremotely discussed with my doctor.'' Unfortunately for her, she got a \nrejection notice from a carrier that basically just copied and pasted \nwhat she wrote in the application and said: Here is your preexisting \ncondition, and that is why you are uninsurable. Her only remaining \noption was to go into Connecticut's high-risk pool.\n  While she was shopping around for insurance, she decided to get her \nannual mammogram at age 40, and the hospital told her they found \nsomething suspicious on that mammogram.\n  Facing a potential cancer diagnosis without health care coverage \ncreated an enormous amount of anxiety for her. It was at that moment \nthat it struck her how important it was for people to have coverage. So \nshe went to Access Health, which is our State-based exchange, to look \nat plans, and she realized she had another option. She found a gold \nexchange plan. It asked her to pay $430 a month, which was a big \ndifference from the $1,200 per month that she was paying under the \nhigh-risk pool. By the way, a lot of the repeal-and-replace crowd say \nwe should replace the exchanges with high-risk pools. Well, for \nChristina, that was a big financial risk to her. She went from $2,500 a \nmonth down to $430. She says: I am thankful that there was a solution \nfor me to be able to keep my business and to have affordable health \ninsurance that can't be taken away.\n  Now, Christina hopefully is going to be what a lot of people call job \ncreators. She is hopefully going to hire a lot of people for her new \nbusiness. She is going to do it because she was able to start that new \nbusiness because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  On Saturday, the first day of enrollment, HHS said that 100,000 \npeople submitted applications for coverage, and more than 500,000 \npeople were able to log on to healthcare.gov. And more than a million, \njust since open enrollment has begun, have been window shopping for \ninsurance options. By and large, Web sites across the country are \nworking, and they are allowing people to come back and shop for plans. \nIt is really important that people do come back and shop for plans, \nbecause what we know is that the insurance industry likes this bill as \nwell. Now, a lot of people on our side of the aisle don't like the fact \nthat the insurance industry likes this bill so much, but they like it \nso much that there are about 25 percent more insurers that are offering \nplans on these exchanges. So if a person is on a plan for a year, they \nshould know there are likely more options out there for them. They \nshould go on the State exchange or Federal exchange and check it out. \nThere are going to be more options with potentially better fits for \npeople.\n\n  That is not to say that people haven't been really happy with the \ninsurance coverage they have. Here is some other news we have gotten in \nsince the last time I was on the floor. The Gallup poll surveyed \nAmericans who had bought insurance in the first year on these plans, \nand what they found is pretty remarkable. Seventy percent of the people \nwho bought insurance in the new marketplace last year rated it as good \nor excellent. Would that we had the same ratings for the Senate. \nSeventy percent of the people say the coverage they got was good or \nexcellent. Three in four of the newly insured say they are satisfied \nwith this aspect of their health care insurance. That is compared to 61 \npercent among the general population with insurance.\n  So people are actually more satisfied on the exchange-based plans \nthan they are on nonexchange-based plans. If people are satisfied now, \nthey may be able to get an even better deal because more insurers are \nnow signing up.\n  The other good news is that premiums are going to be, on average, \nlower. Now, that is an impossible thing to say in the current health \ncare environment. People are just not used to hearing that premiums \nfrom year to year are going to be lower, but that is the truth. A study \nfrom Kaiser and a study from the Wakely Consulting Group--Kaiser looked \nat the second lowest-cost silver plan in 49 cities around the country \nand found the premiums are going to be decreasing slightly from last \nyear. Wakely looked at the largest county in each of the 34 States with \nmarketplaces run by the Federal Government and found on average that \nthe rate decrease was going to be 1 percent. We, frankly, would be \nhappy if rate of increase was only 2 or 3 percent, because on average \nin 2008, the premium increase was 10 percent. In 2009 it was 10.8 \npercent, and in 2010 it was 11.7 percent. We are having an average \npremium decrease in the exchanges this year. That is more proof that as \nfolks get more coverage, as people get access to preventive care, they \nare driving down overall health care costs because less people get into \ncrisis, less people have to run to the emergency room, and they get \ncheaper cost care earlier on. That is better for them, better for the \ntaxpayers, and better for their bottom line.\n  Kara from Granby, CT, has this story. When Kara was born, the doctors \nimmediately told her parents that she was going to face a lifetime of \nobstacles because she was diagnosed with only one ailing kidney and a \nslight hearing impairment. Lucky for her, her parents found a great \ndoctor at Connecticut Children's Medical Center.\n  About the time she was 1 year old, her kidney had started to fail, \nand a kidney transplant was recommended. Her father gave her one of \nhis, and she was able to graduate from high school and college without \nhaving any major health problems. But she remembers always being warned \nby her parents about how difficult her life was going to be because of \nher health ailment but also because of the fact that her life decisions \nwere going to be dictated by whether she could get health care. So she \nwas so relieved when she found out she could stay on her parents' plan \nuntil she was 26, under the new health care law. That was critical to \nher because her health, after she graduated college, took a sudden \ndownward turn. She began having frequent headaches, and her voice \nbecame really hoarse. What she thought was a virus ended up to be \ndiagnosed as a brain tumor.\n  Because of the ACA and her parents' insurance, she was able to get \ngreat coverage. She went out to go look for a job but wasn't able to \nfind one that offered health care insurance, and she went on Medicaid \nbefore she could sign up for health care insurance herself. Her tumor \nreappeared, but even despite this latest setback, her doctors still \nbelieve they can extract the tumor, and her prognosis is good. But she \nhas health care, and she has had continuous health care because of the \nAffordable Care Act, because of Medicaid's being expanded throughout \nthe States.\n  Kara says that I know for sure that I wouldn't have made it this far \nin life without health care. It is incredibly essential to have it. You \nnever know what is going to happen to you. Don't take your health for \ngranted. Kara, from Granby, has health insurance continuously because \nof the Affordable Care Act. Differences are being made all over the \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S6185]]\n\n  I will tell just one more story. That is one from the middle section \nof the State from Ohio. Jim worked for 37 years for the same company. \nHe was typically putting in 50-hour workweeks that included travel and \nworking weekends. It started to take a toll on his health, and he knew \nhe had to retire. If he wanted to live longer, if he wanted to enjoy \nhis years in his sixties and seventies, he had to retire, but he \ncouldn't do it because he needed health care for him and his family. \nHis wife is a cancer survivor. She had been diagnosed with leukemia 15 \nyears ago. The only way she was going to be able to get insurance was \nthrough his employer. He had to keep working even though it was the \nwrong thing for his health because of his job lock caused by his \nnecessity to get health insurance from this job he was connected to.\n  The Affordable Care Act changed all of that. He retired in March of \nthis year. He went and did his home homework on healthcare.gov. The \nplan he chose would have cost him $1,200 per month to cover him and his \nwife, but with the subsidy he received, with the tax credit he \nreceived, their premium costs were $127 a month. Jim is shopping as we \nspeak for plans in 2015, but he knows he is going to live a longer \nlife, and he will be able to be there for his wife and for his family \nbecause of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Jim has a pretty interesting take on all of this. He says he got to \nleave his job and spend more time with his family and spend more time \nconcentrating on his health. He says: ``I am much healthier and happier \nthan I was before. Plus,'' he adds, ``I am helping the economy. When I \nleft my job, they had to hire someone else, so I am a job creator \ntoo.''\n  This is one of the great benefits of the Affordable Care Act. It \nreduces job lock. People who have to stay in jobs, people such as Jim \nbut also people such as the first woman we talked about, Christina, who \nwas able to start her own business because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Open enrollment is upon us. People have 25 percent more options. On \naverage, people have premiums that are lower than they were last year. \nPeople can sign up for something better than they had or they can join \nthe 8 million people who have signed up on the exchanges and \nparticipated in Medicare expansion all across the country. People can \nbe part of this pretty amazing story that is being told all across the \ncountry.\n  An Affordable Care Act that is insuring more people than ever before \nin this country, contributing to a stabilization of health care costs \nacross this country, that still leaves us with a lot of room to go. \nThere are still way too many people paying way too much for health \ncare, but it at least charts us in the right direction and is making \npeople healthier all at the same time, which is what this is all about. \nIt is not just about saving money. It is about allowing people a better \nquality of life, and it is doing that as well.\n  As we mark the coming second week of open enrollment, it is important \nagain to point out a very simple fact, which is the Affordable Care Act \nworks.\n  I yield back and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, with regard to the health care law, \nthe proof has come out today. The administration has been cooking the \nbooks. That is not just me saying it. It has come out all across the \npress. USA Today, just out: ``Obama administration gave bad health \nexchange numbers.'' Associated Press: ``Oops, administration erred on \nhealth law signups.''\n  Let's take a look at this. The Department of Health and Human \nServices said Thursday--this is reading from USA Today--it made a \nmistake in how it calculated enrollments under the Affordable Care Act, \nincluding 400,000 dental plans in its figures for medical plans. Those \ndental plans allow the Obama administration to claim more than 7 \nmillion enrollments and 7 million was long considered the magic number, \nthe magic number that would allow the new health insurance exchanges to \nbe sustainable. What does the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nsay? Today she said this mistake is unacceptable. I agree with the \nSecretary.\n  This mistake is unacceptable, but it is not a surprise to the \nAmerican people. We have questioned a long time what numbers the \nadministration was putting out. I think it is fascinating that the \nadministration has continued to lower and lower the numbers as more and \nmore information and research has been done, and they can hide it no \nlonger that they were cooking the books. Earlier today Bloomberg went \nup to the--with the story based on analysis from the House Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform. The committee found the Obama \nadministration has included people who purchased this stand-alone \ndental coverage and now HHS has admitted the duplicity. Let's take a \nlook at this. On May 1 Health and Human Services released exchange \nenrollment information for a period from October 1, 2013, through April \n19, 2014. At the time Health and Human Services said over 8 million \npeople had selected a plan through an exchange, either the State or \nFederal exchange.\n  In the report, HHS also disclosed 1.1 million selected to stand-alone \ndental plans through the Federal exchanges. A footnote in that report \nsaid totals for stand-alone dental plans do not include individuals who \nare enrolled in the marketplace plans that provide integrated medical \nand dental coverage. So then on May 21, and after previously touting \nthe 8.1 million exchange enrollees, Health and Human Services decided \nthey would stop issuing additional reports. No more monthly ObamaCare \nexchange enrollment information. September 18, in testimony before the \nHouse Oversight Committee, the CMS Administrator, Marilyn Tavenner, \ntestified that there were 7.3 million people enrolled in the health \ninsurance marketplace coverage as of August 15. Remember the magic \nnumber for saying this was a sustainable program was still 7 million.\n  When we take a look at the oversight committee's analysis it shows \nnearly 400,000 of these enrollees didn't purchase insurance through the \nexchange for health care, rather stand-alone dental coverage. That \ntakes the total number to under 7 million.\n  On November 10, earlier this month, Secretary Burwell said there were \n7.1 million exchange enrollees as of the end of October. However, she \nalso failed to break out the coverage of those stand-alone dental \ninsurance policies, indicating the true number as of last month, likely \ncloser to 6.7 million or 6.8 million individuals.\n  The nearly 20 percent drop in the exchange enrollees suggests that \nonce many people learn about the ObamaCare problems, extremely high \ndeductibles, narrow networks, they stop paying. They stop paying their \npremium in spite of the fact that there continues to be large \ngovernment subsidies they are receiving. This drop is likely the \ncentral reason HHS dramatically lowered its exchange estimates earlier \nthis month saying that by the end of the next year, instead of the 13 \nmillion people predicted by the Congressional Budget Office that there \nwould be about only 9.1 million people enrolled.\n  I have heard from my colleague from Connecticut who came and told an \nindividual story, but the health care law overall remains very \nunpopular. It is so unpopular that as of earlier this week and all of \nthe polling ever done about the health care law, it is more unpopular \nnow than ever before. Popularity is at an alltime low and unpopularity, \ndisapproval is at an alltime high. Why would that be? There are a \nnumber of reasons. One is the front page of the New York Times the \nother day. November 15, cost of coverage under the care act set to \nincrease. President Obama stood before the American people and said \nunder his plan the cost of insurance policies would go down $2,500 per \nfamily. They have not gone down. They headed in the other direction, \nand again this year the cost of coverage under the health care act is \nset to increase. It is no surprise people are concerned when the \nPresident tells them one thing and something else happens, they \nquestion the President.\n  There are a number of reasons it is not popular. That is just one. \nThe\n\n[[Page S6186]]\n\nPresident's solutions of putting many more people on Medicaid under the \nhealth care law, a program that has already failed and is failing and \ncontinues to be a problem--the front page of the Wall Street Journal, \nFriday, 14 of November, ``As More Join Medicaid, Health Systems Feel \nStrain''--stories about people who can't get care, people who are \nproviders who can't afford to provide the care for Medicaid patients \nbecause the reimbursement is so low. That is the President's solution--\nforce more people on to Medicaid because the President's focus during \nall of these discussions has been on coverage. As a doctor I will tell \nyou the focus should be on the word ``care.'' People want care, and \nthey know what they want. They know what they need in health care \nreform.\n  They want affordable care, quality care, and choice. That is what a \nRepublican plan will look like to replace and strip out the terrible \nparts of this health care law. Then for people living all across the \ncountry in rural communities--I know in the Presiding Officer's State \nand in mine, we know what impact the loss of a rural hospital has on \nthat community.\n  But yet, front page, USA Today, last weekend, November 14 to 16, \n``Rural Hospitals in Critical Condition.'' ObamaCare critics say the \nlaw is speeding up the demise of the facilities. There is a map of the \nUnited States, a list of 43 hospitals that have closed since January of \n2010 as a result of the health care law.\n  You say: Is it as a result of the health care law? I believe it is, \nbecause it was Ezekiel Emanuel, one of the architects of the health \ncare law, who said and recently wrote that between now and the year \n2020, up to 1,000 hospitals in the United States were likely to close. \nWe know what the impact of the cuts that happen to our seniors on \nMedicare as a result of the health care law will have to rural \nhospitals, where a disproportionate number of the patients are seniors \non Medicare. The hospitals cannot sustain themselves.\n  That was part of the original budget numbers as they looked at the \nhealth care law, as we debated it on this Senate floor and said: Please \ndo not pass this, Democrats--who one by one by one voted for the health \ncare law--because it is going to impact our rural hospitals.\n  Now we see 43 hospitals in rural communities all around the country \nand tell stories of people who could not get care, had to travel such a \nlong distance in that critical hour after a heart attack, were unable \nto survive. So the health care law continues to be very unpopular \nacross the country. Yes, it is possible for colleagues to come to the \nfloor and tell a story about one individual whose life may have been \nimproved as a result of the health care law. But across the country, \nthere are many people who are finding they cannot keep their doctor, \nthey cannot keep their child's pediatrician, they cannot go to the \nhospital in their local community because of the specific components of \nthe health care law which have caused so much damage and wreaked havoc \nin communities all around America.\n  I continue to hear from people in Wyoming who have lost the insurance \nthat worked for them and they liked. They had to buy other insurance, \nmuch more expensive, that covered things they did not need, did not \nwant, and cannot afford. Many now find themselves for the first time \nwithout insurance when they had it before. It worked for them and their \nfamilies.\n  So that is why all across the country, people are saying: This health \ncare law is not working for me. That is why the signups are down and \nthe belief is that fewer people are going to sign up because for them \nthey do not feel they are getting good value. They see what they are \ngoing to have to pay out of pocket for deductibles, what they have to \npay out of pocket for copays, what their premiums are. As a result, \nthey are saying: No, thank you.\n\n  Even with the subsidies, Health and Human Services has significantly \nlowered their predictions of how many people will sign up for the \nhealth care law this year. That is in spite of the fact that the fines \nare going up.\n  Then, on top of all of this, there is a health care MIT economist, \nProfessor Jonathan Gruber, who has made comments that are disparaging \nof American citizens. He has said not just once but time and time \nagain, as the videos continue to come out of this Gruber miniseries of \nTV videos, that this health care law was sold to the American people by \ntrying to confuse them. He has questioned their intelligence. It was \nNancy Pelosi who said: First you have to pass it before you get to find \nout what is in it.\n  American people are furious about the way this administration has \ntreated them, has behaved toward them, and has acted upon their \nwillingness to believe an administration and believe a Speaker of the \nHouse at a time people wanted health care reform in America. People did \nnot get what they wanted. They did not get what they were promised.\n  So, today, I come to the floor to say to my colleague who just spoke \nabout the health care law, that perhaps for the folks he mentioned it \nhas worked. We want health care to work for people all across the \ncountry so they can get the care they need, from a doctor they choose, \nat lower cost. That is what they want. So today, the proof comes out, \nthe administration has been cooking the books. As USA Today says, the \nObama administration gave bad health exchange numbers and the \nAssociated Press starts its story on this very same topic with one \nword, ``Oops!''\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nKentucky Communities Economic Opportunity Council, KCEOC, Community \nAction Partnership--an organization that for the past 50 years has been \ndedicated to the cause of destroying the roots of poverty in \nSoutheastern Kentucky.\n  KCEOC was one of the first community action agency organizations in \nthe country to be established to target the causes of poverty on the \nState and local level. Founded in 1964, it can now celebrate five \ndecades serving its community.\n  Based out of Knox County, KY, KCEOC helps over 7,000 Kentuckians \nachieve financial stability every year through a number of antipoverty \nprograms. This includes Head Start and Early Head Start, programs that \naim to build children's educational foundation from an early age. KCEOC \nis also involved in job training and career planning, providing \naffordable housing, and food and clothing drives.\n  The KCEOC Community Action Partnership recognizes that a ``hand up'' \nis more effective than a ``hand out.'' They are dedicated to providing \nKentuckians mired in poverty with the means and assistance necessary to \nbreak the chain of poverty that has afflicted too many Southeastern \nKentuckians for generations.\n  Although there are many more programs instituted by KCEOC that cover\n\n[[Page S6189]]\n\na diverse range of problems--including an IRS Volunteer Income Tax \nAssistance Program, a Summer Food Service Program, and a KCEOC Aquatic \nClub--at their core they are all designed to impact the people of the \ncommunity in a positive way. This is an objective that the organization \ncontinues to achieve, year after year.\n  When one Kentuckian who benefitted from KCEOC's services was asked \nwhat mattered to him the most, he replied:\n\n       Getting my education. I had never planned on getting my GED \n     or going to college. [The staff at KCEOC] really pushed me \n     and encouraged me.\n\n  I especially want to thank the leadership of KCEOC, including its \npresident/CEO, Mr. Paul D. Dole, who was honored in 2013 as one of the \nregion's top entrepreneurs in Southern and Eastern Kentucky at the 2013 \nExcellence in Entrepreneurship event, hosted by the Center for Rural \nDevelopment in Somerset.\n  For their 50 years of serving the community of Southeastern Kentucky, \nI ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring KCEOC. May their \nnext 50 years be as beneficial to the Commonwealth of Kentucky as their \nfirst.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6189-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGO CONFLICT MINERALS LAW UPDATE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is not very often that Congress can \nmake a policy change that has life-or-death consequences for millions \nof people, but in 2010 a law was enacted that is changing the money \nsupply for warlords in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n  Many may not realize that almost 5.5 million people have been killed \nduring the long-running conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, \nwhich has been the most deadly since World War II. Tragically, women \nand children have suffered the most, as we too often see in conflicts. \nMillions have been displaced from their homes, and the prevalence of \nrape and sexual violence as a weapon of war is almost beyond belief. \nThe U.N. reports that about 1,000 women are assaulted every day in \nCongo, which is roughly equivalent to 12 percent of all Congolese \nwomen.\n  One of the drivers and funders of this conflict is paradoxically that \nwhich fills the DRC with such potential--its natural resources. Instead \nof paying for the nation's peace, education, roads and public health \nprograms, the DRC's mineral wealth has been siphoned off to fund the \narmed groups that vie for local and regional control of vast areas far \nfrom Congo's capital, Kinshasa.\n  Tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold are found in everyday electronics, \njewelry, airplanes, and manufacturing equipment. But these minerals \nalso have provided weapons and salaries to fighters, including \nconscripted child soldiers, who then visit unspeakable horrors on \ninnocent civilians in return.\n  Over 4 years ago, I joined former Senators Brownback and Feingold and \nCongressman Jim McDermott in drafting a simple transparency reporting \nrequirement for U.S.-registered corporations that source these four \nminerals from the DRC or its neighbors. And in early June, after \nprotracted legal challenges, the first of those annual reports was \nfiled at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  The electronics industry, in general, has been out front on this push \nfor great transparency, but sadly, the jewelry industry has lagged far \nbehind on its due diligence and reporting. Some companies have made \nmore than a good-faith effort to determine the origins of the minerals \nthey and their suppliers use, and a few of those companies, I am proud \nto say, call Illinois home.\n  One of the leaders, across all industries, on this is Motorola \nSolutions, headquartered in Schaumbergn, IL. Motorola Solutions emerged \nearly as a company dedicated to cleaning up its supply chain, and to do \nso, it helped establish Solutions for Hope, dedicated to developing a \nclosed-pipe supply chain. Kester, a subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works, \nmakes electronic and automobile components and has been a leader in \ntransparency of the smelters it uses. John Deere, headquartered in \nMoline, IL, painstakingly described its due diligence processes and \neven detailed the sources of minerals that its suppliers used. Others, \nlike AAR Corporation, based out of Wood Dale, and Dover Corporation, \nheadquartered in Downers Grove, developed conflict-mineral specific \ncompliancy programs and provided detailed information on steps to \nidentify risks in their supply chains. Lake Forest's IDEX Corporation \nunderwent efforts to create a sourcing policy that in its first year of \nfiling covered 90 percent of suppliers.\n  I am sorry to say not all companies took this reporting requirement \nseriously, hiding behind the 2-year grace period that allows them to \navoid questions. My hope is that these Illinois companies serve as an \nexample for next year's filings nationwide. And here is why--this rule \nis yielding real, tangible, positive results already.\n  The Government Accountability Office issued a report in late June \nthat confirmed the opposite of claims made by those seeking to \ndismantle this reporting requirement. This rule has expanded the \noptions for clean minerals sourcing in Central Africa. In fact, the \nnumber of certified conflict-free smelters has more than tripled in the \npast year alone. Intel has created its first conflict-free computer \nchip, while using responsibly sourced minerals from Congo and took its \nreporting a step further by voluntarily submitting it to third-party \naudits. Under the Conflict-Free Smelter Program, the number of \ninternational smelters operating free from conflict minerals continues \nto grow. Almost 90 smelters (40 percent of the world's total smelters) \nare certified as conflict-free and more than 150 companies and industry \nassociations participate in the program.\n  After being refined the origins of the material become difficult to \ntrack. Smelters purchase materials from a variety of sources, so the \nsmelter or refiner is a critical point in the supply chain, where we \ncan look for assurances about whether the material has been purchased \nfrom conflict-free sources. Apple has confirmed that its entire \ntantalum supply chain is conflict free. Dutch smart phone manufacturer \nFairphone is making its products with conflict-free raw materials. \nFairphone has already sold 35,000 units and is hoping to expand \nproduction as more consumers embrace conflict-free electronics. \nFairphone and others are leading by example and proving that conflict-\nfree is not only possible but that it can be profitable too.\n  The Enough Project recently reported on the effect of this \nlegislation, and it is good news. Armed groups and the Congolese army \nare no longer present at 2/3 of tin, tantalum, and tungsten mines \nsurveyed in eastern Congo. It also appears that responsible sourcing \ninitiatives might be contagious--Congo-Brazzaville, the DRC's neighbor \nto the west, has begun its own program to determine clean sources of \nminerals as well. I am also happy to say that our counterparts in the \nEuropean Union are reviewing a bill based on our law to require \nEuropean companies to provide similar transparency in their own supply \nchains. China has instituted similar rules, and other nations are \nfollowing close behind.\n  The Congress has emerged as a world leader on conflict-minerals \nreporting, and the early results suggest that the people of the DRC \nshould not have to suffer unspeakable violence that can be traced back \nto our cell phones, wedding rings, and cars. The filings are far from \nperfect, but we have begun the process. I appreciate those industry \nplayers that are leading the way. I can only hope that by cutting off \nthis rich source of funding for the fighting in the Congo, we can help \nspare its citizens from the senseless violence that is tearing the \ncountry apart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6189-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6189-S6190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ANNIVERSARY OF THE WASHINGTON, IL TORNADOES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, people throughout Illinois have been \nreflecting this week on the 1-year anniversary of the day that rare \nNovember tornadoes tore through Illinois, causing widespread \ndevastation and eight deaths in our State. The outbreak, which happened \non November 17, 2013, destroyed hundreds of homes and rendered \nthousands uninhabitable.\n  This tornado event was the deadliest and costliest in the State of \nIllinois for the month of November--and it was the fourth largest \noutbreak for the State overall. Two of the tornadoes that day rated \nEF4. That means the winds were more than 166 miles per hour. In fact, \nthe National Weather Service clocked a peak wind of 190 miles per hour \non that day. Washington, Gifford,\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\nBrookport, East Peoria, Pekin, the list of cities touched by the \ntornadoes in the State goes on and on.\n  I visited Washington, IL, near Peoria, 5 days after the tornado--and \nGifford, IL, just a few days after that. What I saw was heartbreaking. \nIn the city of Washington, alone, 1,108 homes were damaged--most were \ndamaged very badly. Five hundred ninety-five of those homes were \ndestroyed. I saw bare foundations where families had lived just days \nbefore. Trees had been reduced to splinters. Street signs had been torn \nout of the ground making it nearly impossible to see where one block \nended and another began.\n  The loss of homes and property was really difficult to bear, but the \nreal tragedy lies in the lives that were claimed. Three people died in \nWashington, two people died in Washington County near St. Louis, and \nthree were killed in downstate Massac County, which is located along \nthe Ohio River.\n  It is a miracle more lives were not lost, particularly in the path of \nthe EF4 tornado that touched down in East Peoria, traveled through the \ncity of Washington and continued up to Long Point, IL. In Washington, \nmany lives may have been saved by the fact that so many members of the \ncommunity were in church when the tornado came through. When the sirens \nwent off, 500 people inside Crossroads United Methodist Church huddled \nin a storm shelter in the building. Half a mile away, at the Apostolic \nChristian Church, many of the 450 or so people who were there took \nrefuge in Sunday school rooms. The tornado, spinning at nearly 200 \nmiles per hour changed course by several degrees just seconds before \nimpact and went right between those two churches. Neither church was \ndamaged.\n  I can't say enough about the tireless efforts the emergency personnel \nwho were there from the minute the sirens went off. They were there to \nhelp under the most extraordinary circumstances. I supported Governor \nQuinn's request for a Federal disaster declaration for 15 counties in \nthe State. The President granted ``individual assistance'' to people in \nChampaign, Douglas, Fayette, Grundy, Jasper, LaSalle, Massac, Pope, \nTazewell, Vermilion, Wabash, Washington, Wayne, Will, and Woodford \nCounties. This declaration allowed people in those communities whose \nhomes and businesses were damaged to start repairs and to find \ntemporary housing if they needed it. The Federal Emergency Management \nAgency has provided more than $28 million in loans to the tornado \nvictims. The Small Business Administration also made loans available to \nbusinesses in the affected counties. To date, it has provided 305 loans \nfor a total of $25.8 million.\n  The people who live and work in the damaged communities have made \nincredible progress rebuilding. Washington Mayor Gary Manier predicted \nlast year that the city would rebuild within a year. The task proved \nfar greater than anyone would have thought but the city has made great \nstrides. Building permits have been issued for more than 70 percent of \nthe damaged properties. More than 25 percent of the destroyed homes \nhave been replaced and reoccupied. Work remains to be done but the city \nhas seen enormous progress.\n  Thousands of volunteers have helped with the cleanup. Ben Davidson, \nexecutive pastor at Bethany Community Church, has coordinated volunteer \nefforts since the early stages. He says volunteers have accounted for \n13,000 workdays and 70,000 hours. Although most volunteers have been \nfrom central Illinois, people from all over the State continue to show \nup on weekends to help plant trees and cut weeds on neglected \nproperties. Hearing the stories of Illinoisans working together to help \nneighbors and even strangers get back on their feet makes me proud to \nbe from Illinois. Thank you to everyone engaged in the rescue and \ncleanup at every level.\n  I also want to recognize the hard work and dedication of: Jonathon \nMonken, head of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency; Gifford Mayor \nDerald Ackerman; Brookport Mayor John Klaffer; and Metropolis Mayor \nBilly McDaniel. They were there when their constituents and their \ncommunities needed them the most.\n  I am thinking of all those whose lives were affected by this tragic \nevent. We are rebuilding--as Americans always do--and will be stronger \nfor it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6190-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6190-S6191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF LAUREN McFERRAN\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

She has been nominated to fill a vacancy that will \nresult from the departure next month of a current Board member, Nancy \nSchiffer. I would like to thank Ms. Schiffer for her dedicated service. \nShe has been a highly respected Board member, and I wish her every \nsuccess in her future endeavors.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is an agency that is absolutely \ncritical to our country, to our economy, and to our middle class. Over \n75 years ago, Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act, \nguaranteeing American workers the right to form and join a union and \nbargain for a better life. The act sets forth a national policy to \nencourage collective bargaining. Specifically, the act states:\n\n       It is declared to be the policy of the United States to \n     eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to \n     the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these \n     obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the \n     practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by \n     protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of \n     association, self-organization, and designation of \n     representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of \n     negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or \n     other mutual aid or protection.\n\n  For union and nonunion workers alike, the act provides essential \nprotections. It gives workers a voice in the workplace, allowing them \nto join together and speak up for fair wages and benefits, and for safe \nworking conditions. These rights ensure that the people who do the real \nwork in this country have a shot at receiving a fair share of the \nbenefits when our economy grows--and with rising income inequality in \nour country, these rights are more important than ever.\n  The NLRB is the guardian of these fundamental rights. Workers \nthemselves cannot enforce the NLRA, but they can turn to the Board if \nthey have been denied the basic protections provided under the law. In \nshort, the Board plays a vital role in vindicating workers' rights. In \nthe past 10 years, the NLRB has secured opportunities for reinstatement \nfor 22,544 employees who were unjustly fired. It has recovered more \nthan $1 billion on behalf of workers whose rights were violated.\n  The Board also provides relief and remedies to our Nation's \nemployers. For example, employers can turn to the Board for relief if a \nunion commences a wildcat strike or refuses to bargain in good faith \nduring negotiations. The NLRB has a long history of helping businesses \nresolve disputes efficiently. By preventing or resolving labor disputes \nthat could disrupt our economy, the work that the Board does is vital \nto every worker and every business across the Nation.\n  That is why it is so important that we maintain a fully functional, \nfive-member NLRB. I am proud of the fact that, just a little over a \nyear ago, we were able to confirm members to completely fill the board \nfor the first time in over a decade. Now, we need to fill a soon-to-be \nopen seat so that the Board can continue to function effectively.\n  Ms. McFerran is not the first nominee for this seat. In September, \nthe HELP Committee approved the nomination of a dedicated public \nservant, Sharon Block. Republicans and Democrats agreed on Ms. Block's \nreputation and qualifications, but her nomination was withdrawn in the \nface of circumstance beyond her control. As a result, Ms. Block will \nnot have the opportunity to serve on the Board. Ms. Block is a \ntremendous public servant whose qualifications are unaffected and \nundiminished by the present circumstances and I look forward to Ms. \nBlock's future service to our country.\n  I am heartened, however, by the President's decision to nominate \nLauren McFerran. Ms. McFerran currently serves as Chief Labor Counsel \nand Deputy Staff Director on my HELP committee. I am proud to have her \nas a member of my staff; she has served the committee with excellence \nand\n\n[[Page S6191]]\n\ngreat professionalism; and I know firsthand that the President could \nnot have found a more able successor to Ms. Schiffer. Ms. McFerran is \nan incredibly talented lawyer with deep knowledge of labor law. She is \na person of sterling integrity and strong character. She will be a \ngreat asset to the Board.\n  It is my hope that by promptly confirming Ms. McFerran's nomination \nto fill the looming vacancy we can continue the progress that has been \nmade recently, and begin a new era where orderly transitions on the \nNLRB are the norm. We should set a new precedent of confirming \nnominees--Democratic and Republican alike--in a timely manner.\n  I have no doubt that Ms. McFerran will do an excellent job in this \nimportant position. I look forward to moving her nomination \nexpeditiously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6191-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO AMBASSADOR WILLIAM J. BURNS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I honor a truly remarkable diplomat \nand legendary statesman. After 33 years of service to our Nation, \nDeputy Secretary of State William J. Burns is retiring from the U.S. \nDepartment of State. Having served under 10 Secretaries and twice \npostponing his retirement, Ambassador Burns has had an enormous impact \non the trajectory of U.S. foreign policy and I would like to recognize \nhis many years of distinguished service and thank him for his tireless \nefforts.\n  Ambassador Burns joined the Foreign Service in 1982 and, within a \nyear of joining, he had already made a name for himself as someone \nwilling to go above and beyond the call of duty. Over the course of his \n33 years in the Foreign Service, he has served in countless posts, \nincluding as Ambassador to Jordan, Assistant Secretary of State for \nNear Eastern Affairs, Ambassador to Russia, and Under Secretary for \nPolitical Affairs. Since 2011, he has served as Deputy Secretary of \nState, holding the rare distinction of being only the second career \ndiplomat to rise to the position.\n  It is a testament to both his character and unique skills that nearly \nevery person who has had the pleasure of meeting Ambassador Burns has a \nstory to tell about it. He has deftly steered our foreign policy \nthrough countless challenges over the past three decades and handled \nwith skill sensitive diplomatic missions that few were willing and \ncapable of taking on. That he has one of the most distinguished tenures \nas a career Foreign Service officer in memory is made all the more \nremarkable by his modesty and humility.\n  Ambassador Burns embodies the mission of the Department of State at \nits finest. He has been a mentor for generations of Department of State \npersonnel and is an inspiration to all public servants, myself \nincluded. America is stronger and the world a better place thanks to \nhis service. And while the Department of State will feel his absence, I \nam relieved to know that he will continue to play an important and \nconstructive role in global affairs through his new position as \npresident of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. I thank \nhim for his willingness to serve our country and I wish him and his \nfamily the best as they embark on a new journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6191-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6191-S6192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JENELLE KRISHNAMOORTHY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute and to extend my \nthanks to an extraordinary individual, Jenelle Krishnamoorthy, who has \nserved on my staff, with one small interruption of service, for a \ndecade.\n  Jenelle came to my staff in the summer of 2003 as a fellow, later \nbecoming a permanent staff member and eventually rising to lead my \nhealth policy team on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions. From the time she arrived, it was clear that Jenelle was \nan exceptional talent--one possessing not just deep knowledge of health \ncare and public health, but also with uncommon instincts about this \ninstitution and about how to accomplish great things in an increasingly \ndivided Congress.\n  Throughout my career, I have been guided by a conviction that our \ncountry does not have a health care system, but rather a sick care \nsystem. If you get sick, you get care. We spend far too much time and \nriches treating disease once it has occurred, and far too little \npreventing it in the first place. Among my first charges to Jenelle \nwhen she arrived on staff was to think about how we make America a \nwellness society, one in which we make the healthy choice the easy \nchoice. How do we, I asked her, change our workplaces, our schools, our \ncommunities, our child care settings, and our health care system so \nthat we prevent the onset of chronic disease, rather than patch and fix \nand treat once a person gets sick?\n  Jenelle responded with a broad vision of a wellness society--a vision \nthat has guided her work, and my own, for the past 10 years. Looking \nback over those 10 years, the breadth of what she has accomplished is \ntruly remarkable.\n  The Affordable Care Act is one of the great health laws of the last \n75 years. As my designee on that bill, Jenelle secured passage of a \nnumber of groundbreaking policy changes that have changed the landscape \nof our health care system. In particular, Jenelle was the primary \ndrafter of the prevention title of that bill. As a result of that, \nevery single American can now receive recommended preventive health \ncare services absolutely free of charge. Routine services such as \nmammograms, vaccinations, diabetes and cancer screenings, among other \nthings, are now cost free, forever, because of Jenelle's work.\n  As part of that bill, Jenelle was also the intellectual force behind \nthe Prevention Fund, which creates a public health partnership between \nthe Federal Government and communities across the country by providing \nbillions of dollars for communities to invest in proven preventive \nefforts such as tobacco cessation, childhood obesity prevention, HIV \nprevention, and public health workforce development. As a result, \nacross the country, communities, from small towns in Iowa to our \nlargest urban centers, are working together to weave health promotion \ninto the very fabric of our communities and the lives of our citizens.\n  Through her work on the Affordable Care Act, Jenelle also played a \nkey role in expanding nutrition labeling to chain restaurants around \nthe country, giving hundreds of millions of consumers access to \ncritical nutrition information that they need to take control of their \nown health, and also successfully fought for new policies to promote \nbreastfeeding.\n  Jenelle's contributions to the health of our country go far beyond \nthe Affordable Care Act. As the health policy director for the Senate \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Jenelle shepherded \npassage of the Food Safety Modernization Act, the most significant \nreform of our food safety system in the country in decades. This law \nstrengthened the Food and Drug Administration with critical new \nauthorities to protect Americans by establishing a better and more \nmodern system for keeping our food safe from farm to fork.\n  And just as she did with the food safety system, Jenelle also \nspearheaded efforts to improve the safety and quality of drugs and \nmedical devices. In successfully leading committee passage of the Food \nand Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Jenelle helped \nensure the safety of our drugs and medical devices, alleviate the \neffects of drugs shortages and manufacturing problems, and implemented \nlong sought reform to help bring critical drugs and medical devices to \npatients faster.\n  Remarkably, these are just the highlights of Jenelle's \naccomplishments in the area of health policy and health promotion. Just \nin this Congress, Jenelle has led 16 bills into law, including bills to \nrespond more quickly and effectively to public health disasters, to \nfacilitate organ donation, to provide equitable funding to children's \nhospitals and ensure a steady supply of pediatric doctors, and to speed \nthe approval of new sunscreens to protect Americans from skin cancer. \nHer efforts in the health arena in this Congress have made the HELP \nCommittee one of the most productive in this Congress. For making me \nlook good as the Chairman of the HELP Committee, I owe Jenelle a \nspecial debt of gratitude.\n  Americans take for granted the safety of our food supply and our \ndrugs and medical equipment. When people go to their doctors and \nreceive a free, often lifesaving mammogram, they do not\n\n[[Page S6192]]\n\nthink of the reasons for it. When a smoker of several decades finally \nreceives the help that he needs to quit so that he can watch his \ngrandchildren grow up, he most likely does not pause to reflect on why \nhe received free cessation services. But none of these things happened \naccidentally. They came to pass because of the heroic and humble \nefforts of a dedicated public servant, Jenelle Krishnamoorthy. For 10 \nyears now, Jenelle has shown up for work in my office with the singular \ngoal of improving the health of Americans. She has succeeded beyond \nmeasure. For that, I owe her my thanks, and so too do tens of millions \nof Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6192-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I express my opposition to the \nPresident's plan to grant executive amnesty to 4 million to 5 million \nillegal immigrants residing in the United States.\n  By circumventing Congress on immigration and instituting his will \nthrough executive actions, President Obama is eroding the very \nfoundation of our country and form of government. This sets a dangerous \nprecedent where future Presidents can flout any law they happen to \ndisagree with and alter the law without going through Congress. Each \nbranch of government is to act as a check against the others and not \nsit idly by as one exercises authority it does not have. A \nconstitutional law professor should know that.\n  I believe we all agree that our immigration system is broken--both \nthe legal system which allows individuals to visit and work in our \ncountry and the failures which continue to allow others to reside \nillegally within our borders. The first step we need to take to fix our \nsystem is to secure our borders and bolster interior enforcement. We \ncannot reduce illegal immigration without better border security and \nentry/exit enforcement measures. We also need to ensure that we have a \nstrong, workable employment verification system in place, because if \nCongress can ensure that only authorized job seekers gain employment in \nthis country, then we remove the incentive for illegal immigration--and \nwe cannot grant those who are here illegally amnesty.\n  Yet this week the President intends to circumvent the will of \nCongress by illegally granting amnesty to 4 millions to 5 million \nillegal immigrants. This cannot stand. The American people do not want \nit, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have advocated \nagainst it, and the President himself has said more than 20 times that \nhe does not have the authority to take this action. I am certain that \nthe Republicans in the Senate will take action next year when we become \nthe majority, and I look forward to being a part of that cause.\n  But I must be clear: this is part of a much larger fight. I know all \nof my colleagues remember the unconstitutional NLRB recess appointments \nthe President made in 2012. In that case, the Supreme Court rejected \nhis move, but it hasn't stopped the President from pushing forward. He \nhas proposed a cap and tax proposal through regulation that Congress \nhas already rejected, and I know my colleagues from coal-producing \nStates intend to fight that EPA rule with me. I know my colleagues from \nWestern States also intend to join me in fighting the EPA's proposed \nrule that could allow the administration to regulate all bodies of \nwater, no matter how small, and regardless of whether the water is on \npublic or private property.\n  This week's action is the latest step too far by the President, and I \nwill continue to fight executive overreach--including amnesty by \nexecutive order--whether by targeting rampant, unaccountable Federal \nspending, working to reverse illegal executive orders with legitimate \nFederal laws or using the Congressional Review Act to reject the \nPresident's actions. I will be looking closely at every option.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6192-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6192-S6193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT ACT OF 2013\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Harkin, \nRanking Member Alexander, and sponsors Senator Mikulski and Senator \nBurr for their tremendous work to bring the Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant Act of 2014 to passage. I thank all of my colleagues in the \nHouse and Senate who helped get us to this point.\n  As many of my colleagues have commented, it is well past time that we \ntake up a reauthorization of this important legislation. The Child Care \nand Development Block Grant, CCDBG, has not been reauthorized since \n1996. In the nearly two decades since, our understanding of early \nchildhood development, and the importance of high-quality child care \nand early learning, has expanded dramatically.\n  Investing in high-quality early learning opportunities such as child \ncare and pre-K sets children on the path to success. This bill updates \nFederal standards to ensure that the Federal Government is supporting \nhigh-quality child care for low-income children. The legislation we \nhave passed sets a new standard for child care in America, making sure \nthat Federal dollars are going to providers who are committed to \nproviding child care that meets certain criteria, such as health and \nsafety standards.\n  Many of these changes reflect proposals I have put forth in previous \nCongresses to improve the Child Care and Development Block Grant, such \nas the Starting Early, Starting Right Act. I am encouraged that we were \nable to reach consensus on many of the provisions I have supported in \nthe past, and that they are represented in this bill.\n  I would have liked to go further. I believe we need to increase our \ninvestment in high-quality child care, and make it easier for child \ncare providers to access training and education opportunities that will \nhelp them become better at caring for children and helping them learn. \nI would like to increase the incentives for States to invest in quality \nratings and improvement systems, QRIS, which encourage child care \nproviders to make continuous improvements in the quality of the care \nthey provide and the facilities they use, often through financial \nincentives such as higher reimbursement rates when a certain quality \nlevel is reached.\n  While the authorized appropriations levels in this bill represent a \n16% increase over the next 6 years--we still have a long way to go. \nNationwide, the number of children served with CCDBG funding from 2012 \nto 2013 fell by 47,500 children. In Pennsylvania, nearly 2,800 fewer \nchildren were served. The important provisions for health, safety, and \nquality in this bill are not without their cost, and Congress must \nfully fund them. No family, child care provider, or State should have \nto make a choice between serving more children or providing quality \ncare. We owe our most vulnerable children no less.\n  Even with the continued need for more funding, I still believe this \nlegislation represents a significant improvement over current law and \nmajor progress for families. For the first time, we are requiring all \nStates to develop robust health and safety standards, and to institute \na consistent background check system for child care providers.\n  We are requiring States to formally coordinate their early learning \nprograms, to improve service coordination and delivery. We are allowing \nchildren who qualify for a subsidy to receive a year of care before \ntheir eligibility is re-determined, promoting stability and continuity \nfor the entire family and encouraging the child to develop strong \nrelationships with his or her teachers and peers in child care.\n  We are increasing the investment in quality, from the 4 percent per \nyear currently required in law to 9 percent within 5 years, and \nincluding a separate set-aside for infants and toddlers. Quality is a \ncontinuum, and a continual investment; it is not a one-time purchase, \nit is something we need to support and sustain.\n  I thank Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Alexander, and Senator \nMikulski and Senator Burr again for all of the work that they and their \nstaff have done to get us to this point. When Congress works together \nchildren and family in this Nation all benefit. With the President's \nsignature, parents can rest a little easier knowing that when they \nleave their child at child care, they will receive great care.\n\n[[Page S6193]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6193-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    VIRGINIA'S COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC PROSPERITY THROUGH EDUCATION \n                               INNOVATION\n\n Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, the key to America's continued \nsuccess lies in improving our Nation's educational system. With the \nchanging needs of our workforce, it is imperative that we utilize \nresearch in STEM fields and the humanities to improve our country's \neconomic prosperity. Even in lean times, Virginia focused on the link \nbetween research and the creative new innovations that are leading this \nNation's economic recovery; the Commonwealth's continued commitment to \nbridging these undertakings is commendable.\n  The Virginia Longitudinal System was created by a partnership between \nthe Virginia Department of Education, the State Council of Higher \nEducation for Virginia, the Virginia Community College System, and the \nVirginia Employment Commission. This vital research tool, the first of \nits kind in the Nation, provides policymakers, researchers, and \ncitizens with information that will prepare and connect Virginians with \nemployment opportunities. Funded with a grant awarded under the \nstimulus bill--the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009--the \ndata system allows State agencies and researchers to study the \nbehaviors and transitions of students through the public school \nsystems, into college, and on to the workforce so Virginia leaders can \nmake informed decisions and create education and workforce policy based \non consistent and relevant data.\n  Earlier this year, several education organizations, including the \nState Council of Higher Education for Virginia, Center for Excellence \nin Education, Center for Innovative Technology, Virginia Chamber of \nCommerce, Virginia Business Higher Education Council, and the Virginia \nEconomic Development Partnership, held the Virginia Higher Education \nResearch Summit. The summit focused on the importance of increasing \nfunding for academic research at Virginia's colleges and universities, \nshowcased the strengths of private/public partnerships between \nVirginia's universities and the private sector, provided a forum for \ndiscussing best practices related to intellectual property issues, and \nstrengthened the public's understanding of where Virginia's research \ndollars come from, including from Federal, State, and private sources.\n  If we are to win the race for talent, we need a long-term plan that \nproduces the best workforce in the world. I am encouraged by these \ninstitutions' open discussion of one of our Nation's most pressing \nproblems--investing in innovative research ideas that will drive our \neconomy and the middle class into the future. I recognize the efforts \nof these stakeholders and the Commonwealth as they build on the \nsubstantial successes already achieved by Virginia's colleges and \nuniversities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6193-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL MARK A.

Mr. President, I wish today to congratulate Bill \nDeist, of Winnemucca, NV, on his retirement. After serving the \ncommunity of Humboldt County for over 15 years, Bill will be retiring \nin December 2014. It gives me great pleasure to congratulate him on his \nretirement after many years of hard work and dedication to Humboldt \nCounty and the Silver State.\n  Bill stands as a shining example of someone who has devoted their \nlife to the betterment of their community. He started serving the \nSilver State in 1997 when he moved to Carlin, NV. His experience of \nover 19 years as the city manager in John Day, OR, made him an \nextremely qualified candidate to become the Carlin city manager--a \nposition that he held for 2 years. After his years as the city manager, \nBill became the Humboldt County administrator, a position that he has \nheld with integrity for the past 15 years.\n  Upon becoming the Humboldt County administrator, Bill became a person \nknown for getting things done. He always worked well with all city, \ncounty, and State governments throughout his career. His consistent \npriority was to create initiatives geared toward the betterment and \nimprovement of the lives of the Humboldt County citizens. Among his \nmany accomplishments, Bill has been credited with the creation of a \nstrong county budget and upon his retirement, he will be leaving the \ncounty debt free and fiscally strong.\n  While representing Humboldt County for 4 years in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and now as its U.S. Senator, I have had the distinct \npleasure of working closely with Bill on important Northern Nevada \npriorities. Bill was an integral part of the Pine Forest review and \nassessment working group that worked for years to develop \nrecommendations that were ultimately included in the Pine Forest Range \nRecreation Enhancement Act, legislation I have fought to enact as a \nmember of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. This bill, \nwhich would greatly benefit Humboldt County once enacted, has near \nunanimous support among residents because of the indepth work done \nprior to introduction. In fact, it is frequently looked to in Congress \nas a national model for how public lands bills should be developed at \nthe grassroots level. Public input and local support is critical to all \nmy public lands work in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on \nbehalf of the State, and Bill's input has been vital in nearly every \neffort I have been involved in benefiting the county.\n  Bill exemplifies the highest standards of leadership and community \nservice and should be proud of his long and meaningful career. I am \ngrateful for his dedication and commitment to the people of Humboldt \nCounty and to the State of Nevada. Today, I ask that all of my \ncolleagues join me in congratulating Bill on his retirement, and I \noffer my deepest appreciation for all that he has done to make the \nSilver State an even better place. I offer my best wishes for many \nsuccessful and fulfilling years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6193-4", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6193-S6194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING DR.

He has left behind an indelible mark \nof impressive leadership and results. On behalf of the U.S. Senate and \nthe State of Louisiana, I applaud Dr. Francis for his devotion to \nLouisiana's higher education system and thank him for his many years of \nservice.\n  Dr. Francis began his journey in the field of higher education \ncountry more than 60 years ago as a student at Xavier University and \ngrew into a cherished leader who later served as the university's \npresident for 46 years. This makes him the longest tenured leader of \nany university in America--quite a remarkable achievement. He is one of \nthe most admired and respected leaders not only in New Orleans and \nLouisiana but in our Nation today. In an extraordinary career, he took \nan active and vital leadership role during the tumultuous decades of \ncivil rights battles in\n\n[[Page S6194]]\n\nLouisiana. Decades later, he helped Governor Kathleen Blanco guide our \nState out of one of its darkest periods following the devastating \nimpact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita as chairman of the Louisiana \nRecovery Authority. His leadership and expertise played an important \nrole in the rebuilding of a world-class quality, State public higher \neducation system.\n  On a personal note, Dr. Francis is one of our family's closest and \nmost cherished friends, and he has most certainly earned his \nretirement. And as a devoted family man, I know he is looking forward \nto more time with his dear wife Blanche, children and growing \ngrandchildren.\n  I am proud that Louisiana's higher education system, especially our \nvalued Historically Black Colleges and Universities, have had the \nstrong leadership and guidance of Dr. Francis over the years and I am \ngrateful for his service. Dr. Francis' leadership as the president of \nXavier University will be missed; however, I have full faith and trust \nthat he will continue to lead in improving the educational prospects \nand outcomes for Louisiana's students in whatever role he pursues next. \nOnce again, I am privileged and honored to formally recognize Dr. \nNorman Christopher Francis for his commitment and efforts to strengthen \nhigher education in Louisiana and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6194-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO STUART CAMPBELL\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Alaska urging the United States Congress to \n     provide a means for consistently and equitably sharing with \n     all oil and gas producing states adjacent to federal outer \n     continental shelf areas a portion of revenue generated from \n     outer continental shelf oil and gas development on the outer \n     continental shelf to ensure that those states develop \n     necessary infrastructure to support outer continental shelf \n     development and preserve environmental integrity; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       House Joint Resolution 26\n\n       Whereas oil and gas development in federal areas, both \n     onshore and offshore, requires additional investment in state \n     infrastructure and increases demand on state and local \n     government resources; and\n       Whereas, under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, the \n     federal government recognizes the effects of oil and gas \n     development in federal onshore areas by sharing with the \n     states 50 percent of revenue from mineral production on \n     federal land within each state's boundaries; and\n       Whereas, under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the \n     federal government recognizes the effect oil and gas \n     development in federal near-shore areas has on states by \n     sharing with those states 27 percent of revenue collected \n     from federal oil and gas leases within three miles of the \n     states' coastlines; and\n       Whereas, under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of \n     2006, the federal government recognizes the effect that oil \n     and gas development in federal offshore areas has on the \n     states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, and \n     recognizes the contributions to national energy, security, \n     and economic interests made by sharing with those states 37.5 \n     percent of revenue from federal oil and gas leases in outer \n     continental shelf areas adjacent to each state; and\n       Whereas the federal government fails to recognize the same \n     effects on and contributions made by other oil and gas \n     producing states adjacent to federal outer continental shelf \n     areas, including this state and California; and\n       Whereas the Alaska outer continental shelf region \n     encompasses the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering seas, Cook \n     Inlet, and the Gulf of Alaska, includes over 1,000,000,000 \n     acres, and contains more than 6,000 miles of coastline, which \n     is more coastline than the rest of the United States \n     combined; and\n       Whereas there are presently 607 active oil and gas leases \n     and more than 3,300,000 acres of leased land in the Alaska \n     outer shelf continental region; and\n       Whereas federal government grants do not adequately address \n     the need for additional investment in state infrastructure or \n     the increased demands on state and local government resources \n     resulting from outer continental shelf development, \n     especially in this state, which has more coastline, more \n     rural communities, and less infrastructure than any other \n     state; and\n       Whereas outer continental shelf revenue sharing would allow \n     states to build infrastructure such as marine ports, \n     airports, utilities, and housing, and increase state \n     services, such as oil spill and emergency response and \n     environmental monitoring and mitigation, which would likely \n     lead to expanded, safer exploration and development activity \n     and increase overall revenue to the federal government; and\n       Whereas additional state infrastructure and increased \n     availability of state and local government resources would \n     likely increase interest in and bids during future federal \n     outer continental shelf oil and gas lease sales, which have \n     generated over $2,750,000,000 in revenue for the federal \n     government in the Alaska outer continental shelf region alone \n     since 2005; and\n       Whereas outer continental shelf revenue sharing could \n     provide a stable funding source for and help fulfill the \n     mission of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a national \n     fund created to safeguard natural areas, water resources, and \n     cultural heritage and to provide recreation opportunities: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     United States Congress to provide a means for consistently \n     and equitably sharing with all oil and gas producing states \n     adjacent to federal outer continental shelf areas a portion \n     of revenue generated from outer continental shelf oil and gas \n     production to ensure the states develop necessary \n     infrastructure to support outer continental shelf development \n     and preserve environmental integrity.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Barack Obama, President of the United States;

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Alaska urging the United States Congress to \n     enact legislation that would require approval by Acts of the \n     Alaska State Legislature and the United States Congress \n     before establishing an international designation of land or \n     water in the State of Alaska; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 15\n\n       Whereas Alaska and the Russian Far East are close neighbors \n     across the Bering Sea, and archaeologists believe that the \n     area was a migration route used by many peoples moving from \n     Asia and populating North and South America; and\n       Whereas some of the indigenous peoples of Western Alaska \n     and the Russian Far East speak the same language and share \n     the same customs and traditions but have, until recent times, \n     been separated by political differences between their \n     respective countries; and\n       Whereas, in recent years, various events and exchanges have \n     been organized to reconnect the residents of Western Alaska \n     and those of the Russian Far East; and\n       Whereas the areas of Western Alaska and the Russian Far \n     East have been referred to as Beringia; and\n       Whereas, in 2010, the United States and Russia began \n     negotiations to develop a Memorandum of Understanding for the \n     purpose of establishing an international protected area in \n     the Bering Strait region that would include the Bering Land \n     Bridge National Preserve, the Cape Krusenstern National \n     Monument, and, in the Chukotka region of Russia, the yet-to-\n     be-created Beringia International Park; and\n       Whereas the National Park Service identifies and defines \n     Beringia as the area bounded\n\n[[Page S6198]]\n\n     on the east by the Mackenzie River in Canada, on the west by \n     the Lena River in Russia, on the north by 72 degrees North \n     latitude, and on the south by the southern tip of Kamchatka, \n     leaving only the south-central and southeastern limits to be \n     determined; and\n       Whereas the federal government historically has attempted \n     to expand the scope of its influence beyond Alaska park \n     boundaries, including the attempt to establish game buffer \n     zones around Denali National Park and Preserve; and\n       Whereas, during the past two decades, the National Park \n     Service has repeatedly expanded the size of the area \n     identified as Beringia; and\n       Whereas the National Park Service manages the Shared \n     Beringian Heritage Program and seeks to foster mutual \n     understanding and cooperation between the United States and \n     Russia and between the indigenous peoples of Western Alaska \n     and the Russian Far East by promoting cultural exchange, \n     supporting subsistence opportunities, and working toward an \n     international designation for the land and water in the area \n     identified as Beringia; and\n       Whereas, for many years, the National Park Service has \n     pursued a program to establish a Beringia International Park \n     that potentially could evolve into a world heritage site or a \n     marine biosphere reserve and would include land and water in \n     Alaska and the Russian Far East; and\n       Whereas officials of the United States Department of State \n     and the National Park Service have traveled throughout Russia \n     and spoken before the Russian Duma in Moscow; and\n       Whereas the international designations contemplated by the \n     National Park Service for the areas included in Beringia are \n     an invitation and another means for United States and foreign \n     environmental nongovernmental organizations to oppose \n     resource development on public and Alaska Native land and \n     water in the state; and\n       Whereas many Alaskans are concerned that the proposed \n     Beringia International Park would impede future rights of \n     access for the Red Dog Mine, the primary economic engine in \n     Northwest Alaska; and\n       Whereas Alaska Native corporations and the state \n     specifically selected much of their land because of the \n     mineral potential and the opportunity to create jobs and \n     other economic opportunities for the people of the state; and\n       Whereas, in September 2012, Governor Sean Parnell sent a \n     letter to then United States Secretary of State Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton asking for time to conduct a meaningful review \n     of the proposed Memorandum of Understanding regarding \n     Beringia and to provide input on the possible effects of the \n     Memorandum of Understanding on the region and the state; and\n       Whereas, on January 17, 2013, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry \n     Medvedev signed a decree creating Beringia National Park as a \n     Russian National Park in the Chukotka Region; and\n       Whereas, in October 2013, members of the Alaska State \n     Legislature learned that the United States Department of \n     State, the National Park Service, and the Russian Federation \n     were in the final stages of formalizing a Memorandum of \n     Understanding regarding a transboundary protected area in the \n     Bering Strait region; and\n       Whereas the current effort to formalize a transboundary \n     protected area would be the first step in imposing \n     international designations and could reduce the sovereignty \n     of the state and the United States over the burdened parts of \n     the state, in violation of the Alaska Statehood Compact, the \n     Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and the Alaska National \n     Interest Lands Conservation Act; and\n       Whereas the Department of Fish and Game is responsible for \n     the management, protection, maintenance, enhancement, \n     rehabilitation, and extension of fish and wildlife resources \n     in the state, including management responsibilities on \n     National Park Service land; and\n       Whereas, in the 1982 Master Memorandum of Understanding \n     between the Department of Fish and Game and the National Park \n     Service, the parties agreed to ``consider carefully the \n     impact on the State of Alaska of proposed treaties or \n     international agreements relating to fish and wildlife \n     resources which could diminish the jurisdictional authority \n     of the State, and to consult freely with the State when such \n     treaties or agreements have a significant impact on the \n     State''; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature asserts that \n     any international Memorandum of Understanding or other action \n     to designate land or water in the state as an international \n     park, world heritage site, biosphere reserve, Ramsar site, or \n     classification of land or water that affects the proper use \n     of the land or water by the state or an Alaska Native \n     corporation should require approval by Acts of the Alaska \n     State Legislature and the United States Congress before \n     taking effect; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature requests that \n     the United States Department of State and the United States \n     Department of the Interior cease all further action to \n     establish an international designation of land or water in \n     the state until the United States Congress and the Alaska \n     State Legislature approve; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature respectfully \n     requests that the United States Congress enact a law that \n     requires Congressional approval of any international \n     designation that affects the use of land or water by the \n     state or the United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature requests that, \n     if the United States Department of State or the United States \n     Department of the Interior nevertheless pursues or proposes \n     the designation of land or water as an international park, \n     world heritage site, biosphere reserve, Ramsar site, or \n     classification of land or water that affects the proper use \n     of the land or water by the state or an Alaska Native \n     corporation, the governor be actively involved in the process \n     and development of any joint action plan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature requests that \n     the state, including the departments responsible for the \n     management of fish and wildlife and other natural resources, \n     be an integral if not primary part of any discussion, \n     agreement, understanding, or other process or document that \n     affects the use or development of fish and wildlife and other \n     natural resources in the state; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     governor and the attorney general to reserve all legal \n     remedies, including the recovery of damages, for a taking of \n     the natural resources of the state in violation of the Alaska \n     Statehood Compact, should a designation of land and water in \n     the state as an international park, world heritage site, \n     biosphere reserve, Ramsar site, or other classification \n     hamper the use or development of the natural resources of the \n     state.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Barack Obama, President of the United States;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Alaska urging the United States Congress to \n     act on the request of the governor to acquire for the State \n     additional land in the Tongass National Forest from the \n     United States Government by purchase or negotiation or by \n     seeking amendment to the Alaska Statehood Act; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Concurrent Resolution 2\n\n       Whereas the Tongass National Forest was created in 1907 by \n     a proclamation of President Theodore Roosevelt; and\n       Whereas, under the Alaska Statehood Act (P.L. 85-508, 72 \n     Stat. 339), the federal government provided Alaska with a \n     103,350,000-acre land entitlement, which was considered to be \n     sufficient for the newly formed state to become economically \n     self-supporting; and\n       Whereas the Alaska Statehood Act (P.L. 85-508, 72 Stat. \n     339) gave the state 25 years to select land for entitlement; \n     and\n       Whereas the 25-year period established in the Alaska \n     Statehood Act (P.L. 85-508, 72 Stat. 339) as the period in \n     which the state may select land for entitlement was later \n     extended, in effect, by various legislation, with the result \n     that approximately 5,500,000 acres of the land entitlement \n     granted to the state by the Act have not yet been conveyed; \n     and\n       Whereas, from the 1950s through the early 1990s, the \n     commercial harvest of timber formed a major part of the \n     economy of Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas the commercial harvest of timber no longer forms a \n     major part of the economy of Southeast Alaska because the \n     timber industry does not have access to an adequate amount of \n     timber that can be economically harvested from the Tongass \n     National Forest; and\n       Whereas, in the past four years, several efforts to \n     revitalize the timber industry in Southeast Alaska have \n     failed because a timber industry cannot exist without an \n     adequate timber supply; and\n       Whereas the United States Congress has placed 40 percent of \n     the Tongass National Forest off limits for commercial use, \n     and the United States Forest Service has administratively set \n     aside an additional 58 percent of the Tongass National \n     Forest; and\n       Whereas, at the present time, only two percent of the \n     Tongass National Forest is managed for the purpose of \n     providing local communities with the opportunity to harvest \n     timber; and\n       Whereas 91 percent of the old growth timber standing in the \n     Tongass National Forest in 1954 remains standing, and the \n     remaining nine percent that has been harvested has now been \n     replaced with young growth timber\n\n[[Page S6199]]\n\n     that will begin maturing in about 30 years; and\n       Whereas findings prepared by the Alaska Timber Jobs Task \n     Force in June 2012 reveal that the timber industry is vitally \n     important to statewide and regional economies in the state; \n     and\n       Whereas the principal barrier to job creation in the \n     Southeast Alaska timber industry is the lack of a sufficient \n     amount of timber that can be economically harvested from the \n     Tongass National Forest; and\n       Whereas an unrealistic Tongass Land Management Plan \n     dictated by Washington, D.C., endless environmental legal \n     appeals, and a lack of political will by public officials who \n     are in a position to support meeting timber harvest targets \n     have prevented the United States Forest Service from \n     providing the timber industry access to enough economically \n     harvestable timber in the Tongass National Forest to make the \n     timber industry commercially viable in Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas because the United States Forest Service has not \n     been able to provide the timber industry with access to \n     enough economically harvestable timber in the Tongass \n     National Forest to sustain the timber industry in Southeast \n     Alaska, it is time for the United States Congress to act on \n     the governor's request to acquire additional land in the \n     Tongass National Forest that will provide enough economically \n     harvestable timber to create a sustainable economic base for \n     the communities of Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas sec. 6 of the Alaska Statehood Act (P.L. 85-508, 72 \n     Stat. 339) limited the state's selection of land from the \n     Tongass National Forest and the Chugach National Forest to \n     400,000 acres with the intention of preserving timber for \n     federal long-term sales; and\n       Whereas sec. 6 of the Alaska Statehood Act (P.L. 85-508, 72 \n     Stat. 339) allowed the state to select land in other regions \n     of the state without restricting the use of the land to \n     recreation and community expansion, and, because the timber \n     industry in Southeast Alaska has become unsustainable, the \n     state should be entitled to acquire some of its remaining \n     land entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act from the \n     Tongass National Forest: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature respectfully \n     urges the United States Congress to act on the governor's \n     request to negotiate state land entitlements under sec. 6 of \n     the Alaska Statehood Act (P.L. 85-508, 72 Stat. 339) or work \n     to amend the Alaska Statehood Act for the purpose of \n     acquiring forested land in the Tongass National Forest; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That, if the United States Congress fails to \n     convey forested land in the Tongass National Forest either by \n     negotiating state land entitlements under the Alaska \n     Statehood Act (P.L. 85-508, 72 Stat. 339) or by amending the \n     Alaska Statehood Act, the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     governor to negotiate the purchase of forested land in the \n     Tongass National Forest from the federal government.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Barack Obama, President of the United States;

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Alaska urging the United States Congress to \n     enact legislation that would require approval by Acts of the \n     Alaska State Legislature and the United States Congress \n     before establishing an international designation of land or \n     water in the State of Alaska; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 15\n\n       Whereas Alaska and the Russian Far East are close neighbors \n     across the Bering Sea, and archaeologists believe that the \n     area was a migration route used by many peoples moving from \n     Asia and populating North and South America; and\n       Whereas some of the indigenous peoples of Western Alaska \n     and the Russian Far East speak the same language and share \n     the same customs and traditions but have, until recent times, \n     been separated by political differences between their \n     respective countries; and\n       Whereas in recent years, various events and exchanges have \n     been organized to reconnect the residents of Western Alaska \n     and those of the Russian Far East; and\n       Whereas the areas of Western Alaska and the Russian Far \n     East have been referred to as Beringia; and\n       Whereas, in 2010, the United States and Russia began \n     negotiations to develop a Memorandum of Understanding for the \n     purpose of establishing an international protected area in \n     the Bering Strait region that would include the Bering Land \n     Bridge National Preserve, the Cape Krusenstern National \n     Monument, and, in the Chukotka region of Russia, the yet-to-\n     be created Beringia International Park; and\n       Whereas the National Park Service identifies and defines \n     Beringia as the area bounded on the east by the Mackenzie \n     River in Canada, on the west by the Lena River in Russia, on \n     the north by 72 degrees North latitude, and on the south by \n     the southern tip of Kamchatka, leaving only the south-central \n     and southeastern limits to be determined; and\n       Whereas the federal government historically has attempted \n     to expand the scope of its influence beyond Alaska park \n     boundaries, including the attempt to establish game buffer \n     zones around Denali National Park and Preserve; and\n       Whereas, during the past two decades, the National Park \n     Service has repeatedly expanded the size of the area \n     identified as Beringia; and\n       Whereas the National Park Service manages the Shared \n     Beringian Heritage Program and seeks to foster mutual \n     understanding and cooperation between the United States and \n     Russia and between the indigenous peoples of Western Alaska \n     and the Russian Far East by promoting cultural exchange, \n     supporting subsistence opportunities, and working toward an \n     international designation for the land and water in the area \n     identified as Beringia; and\n       Whereas, for many years, the National Park Service has \n     pursued a program to establish a Beringia International Park \n     that potentially could evolve into a world heritage site or a \n     marine biosphere reserve and would include land and water in \n     Alaska and the Russian Ear East; and\n       Whereas officials of the United States Department of State \n     and the National Park Service have traveled throughout Russia \n     and spoken before the Russian Duma in Moscow; and\n       Whereas the international designations contemplated by the \n     National Park Service for the areas included in Beringia are \n     an invitation and another means for United States and foreign \n     environmental nongovernmental organizations to oppose \n     resource development on public and Alaska Native land and \n     water in the state; and\n       Whereas many Alaskans are concerned that the proposed \n     Beringia International Park would impede future rights of \n     access for the Red Dog Mine, the primary economic engine in \n     Northwest Alaska; and\n       Whereas Alaska Native corporations and the state \n     specifically selected much of their land because of the \n     mineral potential and the opportunity to create jobs and \n     other economic opportunities for the people of the state; and\n       Whereas, in September 2012, Governor Sean Parnell sent a \n     letter to then United States Secretary of State Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton asking for time to conduct a meaningful review \n     of the proposed Memorandum of Understanding regarding \n     Beringia and to provide input on the possible effects of the \n     Memorandum of Understanding on the region and the state; and\n       Whereas, on January 17, 2013, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry \n     Medvedev signed a decree creating Beringia National Park as a \n     Russian National Park in the Chukotka Region; and\n       Whereas, in October 2013, members of the Alaska State \n     Legislature learned that the United States Department of \n     State, the National Park Service, and the Russian Federation \n     were in the final stages of formalizing a Memorandum of \n     Understanding regarding a transboundary protected area in the \n     Bering Strait region; and\n       Whereas the current effort to formalize a transboundary \n     protected area would be the first step in imposing \n     international designations and could reduce the sovereignty \n     of the state and the United States over the burdened parts of \n     the state, in violation of the Alaska Statehood Compact, the \n     Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and the Alaska National \n     Interest Lands Conservation Act; and\n       Whereas the Department of Fish and Game is responsible for \n     the management, protection, maintenance, enhancement, \n     rehabilitation, and extension of fish and wildlife resources \n     in the state, including management responsibilities on \n     National Park Service land; and\n       Whereas, in the 1982 Master Memorandum of Understanding \n     between the Department of Fish and Game and the National Park \n     Service, the parties agreed to ``consider carefully the \n     impact on the State of Alaska of proposed treaties or \n     international agreements relating to fish and wildlife \n     resources which could diminish the jurisdictional authority \n     of the State, and to consult freely with the State when such \n     treaties or agreements have a significant impact on the \n     State'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature asserts that \n     any international Memorandum of Understanding or other action \n     to designate land or water in the state as an international \n     park, world heritage site, biosphere reserve, Ramsar site, or \n     classification of land or water that affects the proper use \n     of the land or water by the state or an Alaska Native \n     corporation should require approval by Acts of the Alaska \n     State Legislature and the United States Congress before \n     taking effect;

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Alaska urging the United States Congress to \n     provide a means for consistently and equitably sharing with \n     all oil and gas producing states adjacent to federal outer \n     continental shelf areas a portion of revenue generated from \n     outer continental shelf oil and gas development on the outer \n     continental shelf to ensure that those states develop \n     necessary infrastructure to support outer continental shelf \n     development and preserve environmental integrity; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       House Joint Resolution 26\n\n       Whereas oil and gas development in federal areas, both \n     onshore and offshore, requires additional investment in state \n     infrastructure and increases demand on state and local \n     government resources; and\n       Whereas, under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, the \n     federal government recognizes the effects of oil and gas \n     development in federal onshore areas by sharing with the \n     states 50 percent of revenue from mineral production on \n     federal land within each state's boundaries; and\n       Whereas, under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the \n     federal government recognizes the effect oil and gas \n     development in federal near-shore areas has on states by \n     sharing with those states 27 percent of revenue collected \n     from federal oil and gas leases within three miles of the \n     states' coastlines; and\n       Whereas, under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of \n     2006, the federal government recognizes the effect that oil \n     and gas development in federal offshore areas has on the \n     states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, and \n     recognizes the contributions to national energy, security, \n     and economic interests made by sharing with those states 37.5 \n     percent of revenue from federal oil and gas leases in outer \n     continental shelf areas adjacent to each state; and\n       Whereas the federal government fails to recognize the same \n     effects on and contributions made by other oil and gas \n     producing states adjacent to federal outer continental shelf \n     areas, including this state and California; and\n       Whereas the Alaska outer continental shelf region \n     encompasses the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering seas, Cook \n     Inlet, and the Gulf of Alaska, includes over 1,000,000,000 \n     acres, and contains more than 6,000 miles of coastline, which \n     is more coastline than the rest of the United States \n     combined; and\n       Whereas there are presently 607 active oil and gas leases \n     and more than 3,300,000 acres of leased land in the Alaska \n     outer shelf continental region; and\n       Whereas federal government grants do not adequately address \n     the need for additional investment in slate infrastructure or \n     the increased demands on state and local government resources \n     resulting from outer continental shelf development, \n     especially in this state, which has more coastline, more \n     rural communities, and less infrastructure than any other \n     state; and\n       Whereas outer continental shelf revenue sharing would allow \n     states to build infrastructure such as marine ports, \n     airports, utilities, and housing, and increase state \n     services, such as oil spill and emergency response and \n     environmental monitoring and mitigation, which would likely \n     lead to expanded, safer exploration and development activity \n     and increase overall revenue to the federal government; and\n       Whereas additional state infrastructure and increased \n     availability of state and local government resources would \n     likely increase interest in and bids during future federal \n     outer continental shelf oil and gas lease sales, which have \n     generated over $2,750,000,000 in revenue for the federal \n     government in the Alaska outer continental shelf region alone \n     since 2005;

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania uring the President and Congress \n     of the United States to urge the Government of Iraq to take \n     immediate steps to protect the safety and constitutional \n     rights of all Iraqi citizens; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 430\n\n       Whereas, Iraq is currently embroiled in a surge of violence \n     arising from an Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) \n     led offensive that began in the Anbar province, has spread to \n     key locations such as Mosul, Tikrit and Samarra and continues \n     to engulf the region in violence and instability; and\n       Whereas, on June 29, 2014, ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \n     renamed the group the Islamic State and pronounced himself \n     caliph of a new Islamic Caliphate encompassing the areas \n     under his control; and\n       Whereas, Mr. al-Baghdadi has a stated mission of spreading \n     the Islamic State and caliphate across the region through \n     violence against Shiites, non-Muslims and unsupportive \n     Sunnis; and\n       Whereas, upon taking control over northwestern Iraq and \n     Syria, ISIL issued a warning to Christians living under its \n     jurisdiction to convert to Islam, to pay a burdensome \n     religious tax or to be executed; and\n       Whereas, over 1,000,000 people have been displaced by \n     violence in Iraq and reports have surfaced of targeted \n     harassment, persecution and killings of Iraqi religious \n     minorities by the Islamic State with little to no protection \n     from the Government of Iraq and other security forces; and\n       Whereas, reports indicate that Islamic State militants have \n     been marking homes of Christians with the Arabic letter \n     ``N,'' for ``Nazara'' (Christian), beheading children and \n     crucifying captives. ISIL's actions are a crime against \n     humanity and nothing more than genocide or ethnic cleansing \n     against religious minority groups; and\n       Whereas, the Iraqi constitution provides for religious \n     freedom by stating:\n       (1) ``no law may be enacted that contradicts the principles \n     of democracy'';\n       (2) ``no law may be enacted that contradicts the rights and \n     basic freedom stipulated in this Constitution''; and\n       (3) ``[This Constitution] guarantees the full religious \n     rights to freedom of religious belief and practice of all \n     individuals such as Christians, Yazidis, and Mandean \n     Sabeans'';\n       Whereas, President Barack Obama recently declared on \n     Religious Freedom Day, ``Foremost among the rights Americans \n     hold sacred is the freedom to worship as we choose . . . [W]e \n     also remember that religious liberty is not just an American \n     right; it is a universal human right to be protected here at \n     home and across the globe.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Alaska opposing the warrantless collection of \n     telephone call data by the National Security Agency; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 22\n\n       Whereas the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States provides ``The right of the people to be secure \n     in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against \n     unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, \n     and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, \n     supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing \n     the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be \n     seized''; and\n       Whereas the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States provides ``No person shall . . . be deprived of \n     life, liberty, or property, without due process of law''; and\n       Whereas, on December 16, 2013, United States District Court \n     Judge Richard Leon ruled that the National Security Agency's \n     program, bulk collection, and querying of telephone record in \n     metadata are likely unconstitutional; and\n       Whereas the legislature objects to the dragnet approach to \n     data collection allowed by the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court, a court that operates in secret and, \n     under sec. 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, issues orders that \n     perpetuate the warrantless collection of data of nearly all \n     Americans; and\n       Whereas the National Security Agency stores the date and \n     time of calls, their duration, and the participating \n     telephone numbers of the calls of nearly all Americans in a \n     centralized database, which allows National Security Agency \n     analysts to access not only those numbers, but the numbers \n     with which the numbers have been in contact, and, in turn, \n     the numbers in contact with those numbers; and\n       Whereas the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, in \n     its January 2014 report\n\n[[Page S6202]]\n\n     titled ``Report on the Telephone Records Program Conducted \n     under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and on the \n     Operations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court,'' \n     questions the legal basis for the National Security Agency's \n     mass telephone call data collection program; and\n       Whereas, when telephone call data of Americans is collected \n     by the National Security Agency, that data is not related to \n     specific investigations of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation; and\n       Whereas orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court at the request of the federal government \n     require telephone companies to provide new calling records on \n     a daily basis, a Mandate not grounded in statute; and\n       Whereas sec. 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act is designed to \n     enable the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain records \n     in the course of investigations, but the National Security \n     Agency's mass collection of the records is not consistent \n     with that design; and\n       Whereas the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 \n     prohibits telephone companies from sharing consumer data with \n     the government except in special circumstances, and the \n     Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board concluded that \n     the National Security Agency's telephone call data collection \n     program may violate the Act; and\n       Whereas the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board \n     found that the National Security Agency's telephone call data \n     collection program has not prevented, discovered, or \n     identified terrorist attacks, plots, or suspects that \n     threatened the security of the United States; and\n       Whereas the widespread collection of telephone call data of \n     Americans reveals highly sensitive personal information; and\n       Whereas the legislature resolutely opposes the continuation \n     of the National Security Agency's warrantless data collection \n     program; and\n       Whereas the legislature views the National Security \n     Agency's storage in a central database of the telephone call \n     metadata of all Americans as all unconstitutional practice \n     that should be immediately suspended; and\n       Whereas the history of government coercion, persecution, \n     and abuse of personal information and human life in the \n     twentieth century prompts the legislature to seek to protect \n     the liberty of future generations from an oppressive and \n     tyrannical federal government; and\n       Whereas the fundamental rights of Americans to speak freely \n     and associate with others are threatened and are likely being \n     diminished by the National Security Agency's mass collection \n     of telephone call data; and\n       Whereas the National Security Agency's mass collection of \n     telephone call data may intimidate or chill the freedom of \n     expression of individuals and groups that disagree with \n     certain government policies or result in extreme scrutiny of \n     those persons simply for opposing those policies; and\n       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has \n     deviated from its purpose to authorize warrants for \n     electronic surveillance relating only to a specific person, a \n     specific place, or a specific communications account or \n     device; and\n       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n     operates in a secretive manner that prevents the court from \n     hearing public input regarding government requests to conduct \n     surveillance: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     federal government to end the mass telephone call data \n     collection program conducted under sec. 215 of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act, because of its lack of a statutory foundation \n     and because it raises serious constitutional concerns under \n     the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the \n     United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     federal government to eliminate all stored metadata upon \n     ending the mass telephone call data collection program; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     United States Congress to authorize the creation of a panel \n     of private sector lawyers to serve as advocates for the \n     public before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to \n     increase public knowledge and oversight; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges judges of \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to write opinions \n     in a manner that allows the government to declassify and \n     release the opinions to the public; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to work to declassify \n     past opinions and release those opinions to the public; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature requests the \n     United States Attorney General and members of the \n     intelligence and judiciary committees of the United States \n     Congress to inform the Alaska State Legislature of the \n     federal government's activities under the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act and provide the Alaska State \n     Legislature with copies of reports submitted under the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     Governor to prohibit the use of state personnel and resources \n     to assist the National Security Agency in its collection of \n     mass data on Alaskans without a specific search warrant; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature considers the \n     National Security Agency's unilateral collection of the \n     telephone call data of all Americans a violation of statute, \n     an unconstitutional program, and a troubling overreach by the \n     federal government; the Alaska State Legislature has sworn to \n     uphold both the Constitution of the United States and the \n     Constitution of the State of Alaska and will not assist the \n     federal government by facilitating programs that are \n     tyrannical in nature, that subject Americans to unreasonable \n     and unwarranted searches, and that violate the fundamental \n     principle of liberty; let this resolution serve as a notice \n     to this Administration and all future Administrations that \n     Alaskans reject surrendering their liberty in the name of an \n     unconstitutional program.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Barack Obama, President of the United States;

Urging the United States Congress to restore the \n     presumption of a service connection for Agent Orange exposure \n     to United States Veterans who served in the waters defined by \n     and in the airspace over the combat zone in Vietnam, and \n     urging the United States Congress to pass the Toxic Exposure \n     Research and Military Family Support Act of 2013 and to \n     establish a national center for the diagnosis, treatment, and \n     research of health conditions of descendants of veterans \n     exposed to toxic substances; to the Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs.\n\n                       House Joint Resolution 25\n\n       Whereas, during the Vietnam War, the United States military \n     sprayed over 19,000,000 gallons of Agent Orange and other \n     herbicides over Vietnam to reduce forest cover and crops used \n     by the enemy; those herbicides contained dioxin, which has \n     since been identified as carcinogenic and has been linked \n     with numerous serious and disabling diseases affecting \n     thousands of veterans; and\n       Whereas the United States Congress passed the Agent Orange \n     Act of 1991 to address the plight of veterans exposed to \n     herbicides while serving in the Republic of Vietnam; the Act \n     amended Title 38 of the United States Code presumptively to \n     recognize as service-connected certain diseases among \n     military personnel who served in Vietnam between 1962 and \n     1975; that presumption has provided access to appropriate \n     disability compensation and medical care for Vietnam veterans \n     diagnosed with illnesses such as Type II diabetes, Hodgkin's \n     disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, Parkinson's \n     disease, multiple myeloma, peripheral neuropathy, AL \n     Amyloidosis respiratory cancers, and soft tissue sarcomas, \n     and others yet to be identified; and\n       Whereas, under a 2001 directive, the United States \n     Department of Veterans Affairs has denied the presumption of \n     a service connection for herbicide-related illnesses to \n     Vietnam veterans who cannot furnish written documentation \n     that they had ``boots on the ground'' in-country, making it \n     virtually impossible for countless United States Navy, \n     Marine, and Air Force veterans to pursue their claims for \n     benefits; moreover, personnel who served on ships in the \n     ``Blue Water Navy'' in Vietnamese territorial waters were, in \n     fact, exposed to dangerous airborne toxins, which not only \n     drifted offshore but washed into streams and rivers draining \n     into the South China Sea; and\n       Whereas the United States Navy has been excluded from \n     coverage under the Agent Orange Act of 1991 although Agent \n     Orange has been verified, through various studies and \n     reports, to be a wide-spreading chemical that was able to \n     reach Navy ships through the air and through waterborne \n     distribution routes; and\n       Whereas warships positioned off the Vietnamese coast \n     routinely distilled seawater to obtain potable water; a 2002 \n     Australian study found that the distillation process, rather \n     than removing toxins, in fact concentrated dioxin in water \n     used for drinking, cooking, and washing; the Australian \n     Department of Veterans Affairs conducted that study after it \n     found that Vietnam veterans of the Royal Australian Navy had \n     a higher rate of mortality from diseases associated with \n     Agent Orange than did Vietnam veterans of other branches of \n     the military; and\n       Whereas the United States Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention found a higher\n\n[[Page S6203]]\n\n     risk of specific cancers among United States Navy veterans \n     than among veterans of other branches of the military; and\n       Whereas herbicides containing dioxin did not discriminate \n     between soldiers on the ground and sailors on ships offshore; \n     and\n       Whereas Representative Christopher Gibson and 168 \n     cosponsors, including Representative Don Young, introduced \n     the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2013; and\n       Whereas more than 30 veterans service organizations support \n     the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2013; and\n       Whereas, by not passing the Blue Water Navy Vietnam \n     Veterans Act of 2013, a precedent could be set selectively to \n     provide certain groups with injury-related medical care while \n     denying that care to other groups, without any financial, \n     scientific, or consistent reasoning; and\n       Whereas, when the Agent Orange Act of 1991 passed with no \n     dissenting votes, congressional leaders stressed the \n     importance of responding to the health concerns of Vietnam \n     veterans and ending the bitterness and anxiety that had \n     surrounded the issue of herbicide exposure; the federal \n     government has also demonstrated its awareness of the hazards \n     of Agent Orange exposure through its involvement in the \n     identification, containment, and mitigation of dioxin ``hot \n     spots'' in Vietnam; and\n       Whereas the United States Congress should reaffirm the \n     nation's commitment to the well-being of all of its veterans \n     and direct the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     to administer the Agent Orange Act of 1991 under the \n     presumption that herbicide exposure in the Republic of \n     Vietnam included inland waterways, offshore waters, and \n     airspace, encompassing the entire combat zone; and\n       Whereas S. 1602 was introduced in the United States Senate \n     on October 29, 2013, by Senator Richard Blumenthal; and\n       Whereas S. 1602 would establish a national center for the \n     diagnosis, treatment, and research of health conditions of \n     descendants of veterans exposed to toxic substances during \n     service in the armed forces of the United States, provide \n     services to those descendants, and establish an advisory \n     board on exposure to toxic substances: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     United States Congress to restore the presumption of a \n     service connection for Agent Orange exposure to United States \n     Veterans who served in the waters defined by the combat zone \n     and in the airspace over the combat zone; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     United States Congress to pass S. 1602, the Toxic Exposure \n     Research and Military Family Support Act of 2013, and to \n     establish a national center for the diagnosis, treatment, and \n     research of health conditions of descendants of veterans \n     exposed to toxic substances.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Barak Obama, President of the United States;

A bill to improve the Higher Education Act of 1965, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce my comprehensive \nproposal to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, the main law \ngoverning institutions of higher education in this country. My bill, \nthe Higher Education Affordability Act, is the product of extensive \nconversations between both parties in Congress and stakeholders across \nthe higher education community. Over the past year, our Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee has held 12 bipartisan \nhearings on reauthorizing the Higher Education Act on issues ranging \nfrom teacher preparation and accreditation to federal student loans and \nthe States' role in higher education. These hearings were purposely \ndesigned to better inform members of Congress and the public on the \nmost pressing issues in higher education and how best to address them \nat the federal level.\n  In June, I put forward a discussion draft that included many of the \nideas and policies discussed in our hearings. I asked the entire higher \neducation community--including institutions, accreditors, and student \nadvocacy organizations--to weigh in and offer suggestions on how best \nto strengthen my initial proposal.\n  I am pleased to say they delivered abundantly on that request. We \nreceived comments from over 120 organizations from across the country. \nWhat I have put forward today is a direct result of our hearings and \nthe feedback we received. This bill provides clear guidelines based on \nall the work we have done to date on how we should move forward with \nreauthorization in a way that puts students and families first. It \ntakes a holistic approach in addressing the most urgent issues in \nhigher education: increasing college affordability, helping struggling \nborrowers, strengthening accountability, and improving transparency \nthroughout the higher education system.\n  On the matter of affordability, my bill includes a number of policies \ndesigned to reduce college costs for students on the front end. It \nproposes a new federal partnership with States to incentivize them to \nreinvest in their systems of higher education. For too long, States \nhave been cutting funding for their institutions of higher education \nand passing those costs onto students and their families. This is a \ntrend in cost-shifting that must stop. The bill also reinstates year-\nround Pell Grants to enable students to get their degrees faster and \nestablishes a pilot program to reward institutions that do a good job \nof graduating low-income students. My bill also creates two grant \nprograms to promote statewide and institutional innovation in higher \neducation. Making sure college is affordable requires an all-hands-on-\ndeck approach: the Federal government, states, students and their \nfamilies all need to do their part.\n  We also hope to empower students and families through greater \ntransparency by giving students and families better information on \ncollege costs and outcomes from the beginning of the college selection \nprocess and all the way through graduation. The bill promotes a \nseamless process from high school to post-graduation to ensure that \nstudents know exactly what they are getting into with regard to college \nquality and costs before they get started.\n  On the matter of student debt, my bill takes a range of steps to help \nstudent borrowers better manage their loans. It provides for better up-\nfront and exit counseling for students regarding their federally \nguaranteed loans. It eliminates fees on federal loans to save students \nmoney. My bill also strengthens consumer protections for student loans, \nand it creates a safety net for borrowers who are seriously delinquent \non their loans by automatically enrolling them in an income-based \nrepayment plan with affordable monthly payments. To ensure that private \nstudent debt is treated no differently than any other consumer debt, my \nbill would allow private student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy, \nas they were before the law was changed in 2005.\n  My bill would hold schools more accountable to both students and \ntaxpayers by ensuring that no Federal money goes to marketing and \nadvertising instead of education. I am also introducing new metrics, \nincluding a repayment rate, by which to better measure schools' \nperformance. The bill also changes the current ``90/10'' rule to ``85/\n15'' to ensure that for-profit schools are not wholly subsidized by the \nFederal government. For those bad actors making record-breaking profits \nthrough fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars, my bill includes a number \nof provisions designed to penalize this behavior and to stop it.\n  Our country has reached a critical point in higher education. Beyond \ndisagreements on specific policy issues, we must come together to \ndecide whether higher education should be preserved, first and \nforemost, as a public good. Over the past two decades, rising college \ncosts have been shifted unfairly onto the backs of students and \nfamilies. The central question we must ask is whether this accelerating \ntrend is the right direction for this country--whether paying for \ncollege should be the sole responsibility of students and families or \nour shared responsibility as a nation. My bill reflects the overall \nbelief that all stakeholders--states, the Federal Government, students \nand families--should invest together in higher education to keep \ncollege affordable and accessible to all. Our country's economic future \nand the promise of equal opportunity depend upon this critical \ninvestment.\n  It is unacceptable to ask students and their families to shoulder the \nbulk of college costs. Historically, this has never been the case, and \nwe should not allow this unfortunate trend to grow worse. My bill would \nget us back on the right track, ensuring that our higher education \nsystem is affordable, transparent, and ultimately accountable to our \nstudents and taxpayers. Higher education should serve as an equalizer \nof opportunity for all, and that is a promise that we must fulfill \ntogether.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON (for himself, Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \n        Booker):\n\n[[Page S6208]]\n\n  S. 2956. A bill to prevent caller ID spoofing, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in 2010 Congress passed, and the President \nsigned into law, the Truth in Caller ID Act, which prohibits caller ID \nspoofing when it is used to defraud or harm Americans.\n  What is caller ID spoofing? It is a technique that allows a telephone \ncaller to alter the phone number that appears on the recipient's Caller \nID screen. In other words, spoofing allows someone to hide behind a \nmisleading telephone number to try to scam consumers or trick law \nenforcement officers.\n  The Truth in Caller ID Act put in place tough new sanctions to crack \ndown on phone scams, empowering States to help the Federal Government \ntrack down and punish these fraudsters.\n  Since then spoofing technology has evolved to give fraudsters new \ntools to pull the wool over our eyes. They take advantage of innovative \ntext messaging services to trick unsuspecting Americans into sending \nmoney or providing sensitive personal information.\n  I believe our laws must evolve and adapt to the new tactics and \ntechnologies used by these criminals. That is why I am introducing the \nPhone Scam Prevention Act of 2014, to update the protections we put in \nplace in 2010 and give consumers the tools they need to help them \nprotect themselves.\n  The bill does 3 simple things.\n  First, it extends the current prohibition on Caller ID spoofing to \ncalls coming from outside the United States and stops crooks from using \ntext messaging services to scam consumers.\n  Second, it ensures consumers have access to what are known as \n``whitelist services,'' where the technology exists. Whitelist services \nallow consumers to pick a list of approved phone numbers to ring \nthrough to their phone. All other numbers are automatically forwarded \nto voicemail or rerouted to a different number.\n  Calls from first responders, government agencies, and other important \nentities would still ring through to the consumer's phone.\n  Several phone companies currently offer whitelist services to their \ncustomers. It only makes sense to allow more Americans to have access \nto these valuable services so that they can help protect themselves \nfrom abusive phone calls.\n  Third, the bill directs the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, \nto develop Caller ID authentication standards within 5 years from the \ndate of enactment to ensure Caller ID information is accurate, or at \nthe very least warn consumers when such information cannot be verified.\n  An international group of telecom engineers, including specialists at \nthe FCC, are currently working to develop such standards. The bill \nwould merely accelerate the timeline for the standards to be finalized \nand move us to a more secure telephone system sooner.\n  When in place, Caller ID authentication will give consumers the \ninformation they need to judge the legitimacy of the call. Scammers \nwill no longer be able to use spoofing technology to claim to be from \nthe IRS, your bank, your utility company, or law enforcement and bilk \nyou out of all your savings.\n  I invite my colleagues to join Senators Collins, Donnelly, Booker, \nand me in support of the Phone Scam Prevention Act of 2014. Working \ntogether, I am hopeful that we can finally stop many of the fraudsters \nbehinds these phone scams.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2956\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 585\n\n       Whereas phenylketonuria is a rare, inherited metabolic \n     disorder that is characterized by the inability of the body \n     to process the essential amino acid phenylalanine, and which \n     causes intellectual disability and other neurological \n     problems, such as memory loss and mood disorders, when \n     treatment is not started within the first few weeks of life;\n       Whereas phenylketonuria is also referred to as ``PKU'' or \n     Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency;\n       Whereas newborn screening for PKU was initiated in the \n     United States in 1963 and was recommended for inclusion in \n     State newborn screening programs under the Newborn Screening \n     Saves Lives Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-204);\n       Whereas approximately 1 out of every 15,000 infants in the \n     United States is born with PKU;\n       Whereas PKU is treated with medical food;\n       Whereas the 2012 Phenylketonuria Scientific Review \n     Conference affirmed the recommendation of lifelong dietary \n     treatment for PKU made by the National Institutes of Health \n     Consensus Development Conference Statement 2000;\n       Whereas the American College of Medical Genetics and \n     Genomics and Genetic Metabolic Dieticians International \n     published medical and dietary guidelines on the optimal \n     treatment of PKU in 2014;\n       Whereas medical foods are medically necessary for children \n     and adults living with PKU;\n       Whereas adults with PKU who discontinue treatment are at \n     risk for serious medical issues such as depression, impulse \n     control disorder, phobias, tremors, and pareses;\n       Whereas women with PKU must maintain strict metabolic \n     control before and during pregnancy to prevent fetal damage;\n       Whereas children born from untreated mothers with PKU may \n     have a condition known as ``maternal phenylketonuria \n     syndrome'', which can cause small brains, intellectual \n     disabilities, birth defects of the heart, and low birth \n     weights;\n       Whereas although there is no cure for PKU, treatment \n     involving medical foods, medications, and restriction of \n     phenylalanine intake can prevent progressive, irreversible \n     brain damage;\n       Whereas access to health insurance coverage for medical \n     food varies across the United States, and the long-term costs \n     associated with caring for untreated children and adults with \n     PKU far exceed the cost of providing medical food treatment;\n       Whereas gaps in medical foods coverage has a detrimental \n     impact on individuals with PKU, their families, and society;\n       Whereas scientists and researchers are hopeful that \n     breakthroughs in PKU research will be forthcoming;\n       Whereas researchers across the United States are conducting \n     important research projects involving PKU; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness of PKU among the general public and the medical \n     community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates December 3, 2014, as ``National \n     Phenylketonuria Awareness Day'';\n       (2) encourages all people in the United States to become \n     more informed about phenylketonuria; and\n       (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the National PKU \n     Alliance, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving \n     the lives of individuals with phenylketonuria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6209-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6209-S6210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 586--CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF BURMA TO DEVELOP A \n NON-DISCRIMINATORY AND COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION THAT ADDRESSES RAKHINE \n   STATE'S NEEDS FOR PEACE, SECURITY, HARMONY, AND DEVELOPMENT UNDER \n   EQUITABLE AND JUST APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Cardin, Mr. \nRubio, Mr. Markey, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Booker, Mr. Coons, and Mrs. Shaheen) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 586\n\n       Whereas, of the 1,500,000 members of the Rohingya ethnic \n     minority community worldwide, over 1,200,000 stateless \n     Rohingya live in Burma, mostly in northern Rakhine State, \n     including 140,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs);\n       Whereas the security, stability, and development of Rakhine \n     State is dependent on the rule of law and non-discriminatory \n     access to citizenship, livelihoods and services, and \n     protection for all residents;\n       Whereas, on November 12, 2014, President Barack Obama \n     traveled to Burma, where he ``stressed the need to find \n     durable and effective solutions for the terrible violence in \n     Rakhine state, solutions that end discrimination, provide \n     greater security and economic opportunities, protect all \n     citizens, and promote greater tolerance and understanding,'' \n     while noting that legitimate government is a government based \n     on ``the recognition that all people are equal under the \n     law'';\n       Whereas the Department of State has, since 1999, regularly \n     expressed its particular concern for severe legal, economic, \n     and social discrimination against Burma's Rohingya population \n     in its Country Report for Human Rights Practices;\n       Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human \n     Rights in Burma reported a ``long history of discrimination \n     and persecution against the Rohingya Muslim community which \n     could amount to crimes against humanity'';\n       Whereas the current Government of Burma, like its \n     predecessors, continues to use the Burma Citizenship Law of \n     1982 to exclude Rohingya from a list of legally recognized \n     ethnic groups, despite many having lived in Rakhine State for \n     generations, thereby rendering Rohingya stateless and \n     vulnerable to exploitation and abuse;\n       Whereas, in its March 2014 census, the first in over 30 \n     years, the Government of Burma reneged on its commitment to \n     allow all people in Burma to self-identify and ordered the \n     Rohingya to ethnically identify as ``Bengali'', resulting in \n     their exclusion from census data and thereby severely \n     undermining the validity of the data for Rakhine State and \n     creating the potential for further discrimination and \n     conflict;\n       Whereas local and national policies and practices \n     discriminate against Rohingya by denying them freedom of \n     movement outside their villages and camps, restricting access \n     to livelihood, education, and health care;\n       Whereas authorities have required Rohingya to obtain \n     official permission for marriages, with reportedly onerous, \n     humiliating, and financially prohibitive requirements for \n     approval;\n       Whereas a two-child policy sanctioned solely upon the \n     Rohingya population in two\n\n[[Page S6210]]\n\n     townships in northern Rakhine State hinders the ability of \n     additional children to access basic government services, \n     marry, or acquire property and restricts the rights of women, \n     sometimes resulting in serious health consequences due to \n     illegal and unsafe abortions;\n       Whereas persecution, including arbitrary arrest, detention, \n     and extortion of Rohingya and other Muslim communities, \n     continues to be widespread;\n       Whereas violence targeting Rohingya in Maungdaw, \n     Buthidaung, and Sittwe in June and July 2012 resulted in the \n     deaths of at least 57 Muslims and the destruction of 1,336 \n     Rohingya homes and left thousands displaced;\n       Whereas, between October 21-30, 2012, numerous people were \n     killed, and a village in Mrauk-U township was destroyed \n     during deadly ethnic violence between the Rakhine and \n     Rohingya communities;\n       Whereas the lack of a credible independent investigation \n     has resulted in persistent questions about violence that may \n     have resulted in the death of Rohingya in a village in \n     Maungdaw township in January 2014, and human rights groups \n     reported mass arrests and arbitrary detention of Rohingya in \n     the aftermath of this violence;\n       Whereas local, state, and national security police and \n     border officers have failed to protect those vulnerable to \n     attack and, in some cases, participated in violence against \n     Rohingya and other Muslims;\n       Whereas the Government of Burma has relocated displaced \n     Rohingya into displacement camps where they have limited \n     access to adequate shelter, clean water, food, sanitation, \n     health care, livelihoods, or basic education for their \n     children;\n       Whereas thousands of Rohingya are entirely reliant on \n     international assistance for food, clean water, and health \n     care because they are not permitted to move for work and \n     therefore cannot provide for their families;\n       Whereas, in February 2014, the Government of Burma \n     suspended the activities of Nobel Laureate Medecins Sans \n     Frontieres, the primary provider of healthcare to hundreds of \n     thousands in Rakhine State;\n       Whereas the Government of Burma entered into a Memorandum \n     of Agreement with the Medecins Sans Frontieres in September \n     2014 but all services have not resumed;\n       Whereas attacks on organizations and their property in \n     Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, in March 2014 caused \n     over 300 international aid workers to evacuate the area, and \n     while many of these aid workers have now returned, they have \n     not yet been able to resume full operations, leaving many \n     more people vulnerable, particularly in the area of health \n     care;\n       Whereas the denial of unhindered humanitarian assistance \n     when populations are in need of such services is a severe \n     breach of a government's responsibility to protect and \n     support its residents and suggests disregard for individuals \n     who suffer the effects of disease and malnourishment as a \n     result of a lack of assistance;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled to \n     neighboring countries, including 34,000 that have registered \n     in official camps in Bangladesh, plus another 300,000 to \n     500,000 that are unregistered in Bangladesh, and at least \n     35,000 in Malaysia, plus many thousands more in Thailand and \n     Indonesia;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations High Commissioner \n     for Refugees, approximately 100,000 Rohingya have fled from \n     Rakhine State, and up to 2,000 Rohingya who fled Burma by \n     boat are presumed dead or are missing at sea since 2012;\n       Whereas up to 200,000 Rohingya, who fled persecution from \n     Burma up to 20 years ago and sought refugee protection in \n     Bangladesh, continue to face discrimination, statelessness, \n     and other hurdles to accessing necessary services in their \n     country of refuge;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State's 2014 \n     Trafficking in Persons Report, the Rohingya community in \n     Bangladesh is especially vulnerable to human trafficking, and \n     unregistered Rohingya who were trafficking victims may have \n     been detained indefinitely in Bangladesh due to lack of \n     documentation;\n       Whereas the Government of Bangladesh has banned marriage \n     registrars from officiating marriages involving Rohingyas \n     attempting to wed one another and those seeking unions with \n     Bangladeshi nationals; and\n       Whereas, in Thailand, according to the United States \n     Department of State's 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report, \n     corrupt civilian and military officials are alleged to have \n     profited from the smuggling of Rohingya asylum seekers from \n     Burma and Bangladesh and allegedly have been complicit in \n     their sale into forced labor on commercial fishing vessels: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the Government of Burma to develop a non-\n     discriminatory and comprehensive solution that addresses \n     Rakhine State's needs for peace, security, harmony, and \n     development under equitable and just application of the rule \n     of law;\n       (2) welcomes the Government of Burma's announcement that \n     Medecins Sans Frontieres has been invited back to work in \n     Rakhine State and encourages the Government of Burma to \n     ensure that the organization is able to resume operations \n     alongside other humanitarian organizations without undue \n     restrictions on their humanitarian operations;\n       (3) calls on the Government of Burma to end all forms of \n     persecution and discrimination, including freedom of movement \n     restrictions, of the Rohingya people and ensure respect for \n     internationally recognized human rights for all ethnic and \n     religious minority groups within Burma;\n       (4) calls on the Government of Burma to respect the \n     Rohingya's right to self-identification, redraft the \n     Citizenship Law of 1982 so that it conforms to \n     internationally recognized legal standards, and include both \n     Rakhine and Rohingya leaders and community members in the \n     redrafting process;\n       (5) calls on the Government of Burma to support an \n     international and independent investigation into the violence \n     that has occurred in Rakhine State since June 2012, implement \n     the recommendations put forth, and prosecute the perpetrators \n     of violence consistent with due process;\n       (6) calls on the Government of Burma to conform to \n     international norms on the provision of unrestricted \n     humanitarian access by international organizations to all in \n     need, without discrimination based on nationality, race, \n     ethnicity, gender, religious belief, or political opinion;\n       (7) calls on the regional governments to protect the rights \n     of Rohingya asylum seekers and refugees, as well as respect \n     the international legal principle of non-refoulement; and\n       (8) calls on the United States Government and the \n     international community to call on the Government of Burma to \n     take all necessary measures to end the persecution and \n     discrimination of the Rohingya population and to protect the \n     fundamental rights of all ethnic and religious minority \n     groups in Burma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url":

Res. 587\n\n       Whereas the division of the Korean Peninsula into the \n     Republic of Korea (referred to in this Resolution as ``South \n     Korea'') and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \n     (referred to in this Resolution as ``North Korea'') separated \n     more than 10,000,000 Koreans from their family members;\n       Whereas since the signing of the Korean War armistice \n     agreement on July 27, 1953, there has been little to no \n     contact between Korean Americans and their family members who \n     remain in North Korea;\n       Whereas North and South Korea first agreed to divided \n     family reunions in 1985 and have since held 19 face-to-face \n     reunions and 7 video-link reunions;\n       Whereas the aforementioned reunions have subsequently given \n     approximately 22,000 Koreans the opportunity to briefly \n     reunite with their loved ones;\n       Whereas the most recent family reunions between North Korea \n     and South Korea took place in February 2014 after a \n     suspension of more than 3 years;\n       Whereas the United States and North Korea do not maintain \n     diplomatic relations, and certain limitations exist for \n     Korean Americans to participate in inter-Korean family \n     reunions;\n       Whereas more than 1,700,000 Americans are of Korean \n     descent;\n       Whereas the number of first generation Korean and Korean \n     American divided family members is rapidly diminishing given \n     their advanced age;\n       Whereas many Korean Americans with family members in North \n     Korea have not seen or communicated with their relatives in \n     more than 60 years;\n       Whereas Korean Americans and North Koreans both continue to \n     suffer from the tragedy of being divided from their loved \n     ones;\n       Whereas the inclusion of Korean American families in the \n     reunion process would constitute a positive humanitarian \n     gesture by North Korea and contribute to the long-term goal \n     of peace on the Korean Peninsula shared by the Governments of \n     North Korea, of South Korea, and of the United States;\n       Whereas the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181) requires the President to \n     submit a report to Congress every 180 days on ``efforts, if \n     any, of the United States Government to facilitate family \n     reunions between United States citizens and their relatives \n     in North Korea'';\n       Whereas in the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 \n     (Public Law 111-242), Congress urged ``the Special \n     Representative on North Korea Policy, as the senior official \n     handling North Korea issues, to prioritize the issues \n     involving Korean divided families and, if necessary, to \n     appoint a coordinator for such families'':\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate:\n       (1) recognizes the significance of North Korea's past \n     willingness to resume reunions of divided family members \n     between North Korea and South Korea;\n       (2) acknowledges North Korea's release in November 2014 of \n     incarcerated American citizens Kenneth Bae and Matthew \n     Miller;\n\n[[Page S6211]]\n\n       (3) encourages North Korea to permit reunions between \n     Korean Americans and their relatives still living in North \n     Korea;\n       (4) calls on the Department of State to further prioritize \n     efforts to reunite Korean Americans with their divided family \n     members;\n       (5) acknowledges the efforts of the American Red Cross to \n     open channels of communication between Korean Americans and \n     their family members who remain in North Korea;\n       (6) encourages the Government of South Korea to include \n     United States citizens in future family reunions planned with \n     North Korea;

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 588\n\n       Whereas access to quality health care services determines \n     whether individuals in the United States can remain in the \n     communities they call home and whether their children will \n     return to those communities to raise families of their own;\n       Whereas more than 60,000,000 individuals in rural areas of \n     the United States rely on rural hospitals and other providers \n     as critical access points to health care;\n       Whereas rural areas of the United States need quality \n     health care services to attract and retain business and \n     industry;\n       Whereas, to ensure that communities in the United States \n     survive and flourish, Congress must address the unique health \n     care needs of individuals in rural areas of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas individuals in rural areas of the United States \n     are, per capita, older, poorer, and sicker than individuals \n     in urban areas of the United States;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, ``rural areas have higher rates of poverty, chronic \n     disease, and uninsurance, and millions of rural Americans \n     have limited access to a primary care provider'';\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Agriculture, \n     individuals in rural areas of the United States have higher \n     rates of age-adjusted mortality, disability, and chronic \n     disease than individuals in urban areas of the United States;\n       Whereas the 20 percent of the population of the United \n     States that lives in rural areas is scattered over 90 percent \n     of the landmass of the United States;\n       Whereas the geography and weather of rural areas of the \n     United States can make accessing health care difficult, and \n     cultural, social, and language barriers compound rural health \n     challenges;\n       Whereas individuals in rural areas of the United States are \n     more likely to be uninsured and less likely to receive \n     coverage through an employer than individuals in urban areas \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas access to health care continues to be a major \n     challenge in rural areas of the United States, as--\n       (1) 77 percent of the 2,050 rural counties in the United \n     States are designated as primary care Health Professional \n     Shortage Areas (commonly referred to as ``HPSAs'');\n       (2) rural areas of the United States have fewer than half \n     as many primary care physicians per 100,000 people as urban \n     areas of the United States; and\n       (3) more than 50 percent of patients in rural areas of the \n     United States travel at least 20 miles to receive specialty \n     medical care, compared to only 6 percent of patients in urban \n     areas of the United States;\n       Whereas, because rural hospitals and other providers face \n     unique challenges in administering care to patients, Congress \n     has traditionally supported those providers by implementing--\n       (1) specific programs to address rural hospital closures \n     that occurred in the 1980s by providing financial support to \n     hospitals that are geographically isolated and in which \n     Medicare patients make up a significant percentage of \n     hospital inpatient days or discharges; and\n       (2) a program established in 1997 to support limited-\n     service hospitals that, being located in rural areas of the \n     United States that cannot support a full-service hospital, \n     are critical access points to health care for rural patients;\n       Whereas hospitals in rural areas of the United States \n     achieve high levels of performance, according to standards \n     for quality, patient satisfaction, and operational \n     efficiency, for the types of care most relevant to rural \n     communities;\n       Whereas, in addition to the vital care that rural health \n     care providers provide to patients, rural health care \n     providers are critical to the local economies of their \n     communities and are one of the largest types of employers in \n     rural areas of the United States where, on average, 14 \n     percent of total employment is attributed to the health \n     sector;\n       Whereas a hospital in a rural area of the United States is \n     typically one of the top 2 largest employers in that area;\n       Whereas 1 primary care physician in a rural community \n     annually generates approximately $1,500,000 in total revenue, \n     and 1 general surgeon in a rural community annually generates \n     approximately $2,700,000 in total revenue;\n       Whereas the average Critical Access Hospital, a limited-\n     service rural health care facility, creates 107 jobs and \n     generates $4,800,000 in annual payroll, and the wages, \n     salaries, and benefits provided by a Critical Access Hospital \n     can amount to 20 percent of the output of a rural community's \n     economy;\n       Whereas hospitals in rural communities play a vital role in \n     caring for the residents of those communities and preserving \n     the special way of life that communities in the United States \n     foster; and\n       Whereas the closure of a hospital in a rural community \n     often results in severe economic decline in the community and \n     the departure of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other \n     health providers from the community, and forces patients to \n     travel long distances for care or to delay receiving care, \n     leading to decreased health outcomes, higher costs, and added \n     burden to patients: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that access to hospitals and other health \n     care providers for patients in rural areas of the United \n     States is essential to the survival and success of \n     communities in the United States;\n       (2) recognizes that preserving and strengthening access to \n     quality health care in rural areas of the United States is \n     crucial to the success and prosperity of the United States;\n       (3) recognizes that strengthening access to hospitals and \n     other health care providers for patients in rural areas of \n     the United States makes Medicare more cost-effective and \n     improves health outcomes for patients;\n       (4) recognizes that, in addition to the vital care that \n     rural health care providers provide to patients, rural health \n     care providers are integral to the local economies and are \n     one of the largest types of employers in rural areas of the \n     United States; and\n       (5) celebrates the many dedicated medical professionals \n     across the United States who work hard each day to deliver \n     quality care to the nearly 1 in 5 people in the United States \n     living in rural areas, because the dedication and \n     professionalism of those medical professionals preserves the \n     special way of life and sense of community enjoyed and \n     cherished by individuals in rural areas of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6211-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6211-S6212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 589--HONORING THE LIFE OF THOMAS M.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 5728.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5728) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 \n     and title 17, United States Code, to extend expiring \n     provisions relating to the retransmission of signals of \n     television broadcast stations, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will finally act to send \nlegislation to the President's desk that will ensure that Vermonters \nand 1.5 million Americans across the country will continue to receive \nsatellite television programming at the end of the year. The \nlegislation reauthorizes the Satellite Television Extension and \nLocalism Act, STELA, which creates a distant signal statutory license \nto receive broadcast television signals via satellite. This legislation \nis the product of four committees in the Senate and\n\n[[Page S6220]]\n\nHouse. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I worked with \nSenator Grassley on the copyright aspects of this legislation to focus \non preventing disruption to consumers. Because of our work together, \nthe Judiciary Committee unanimously reported its portion of this bill \non June 26 and all of these provisions are in the bill the Senate will \npass today.\n  Sending this bill to the President shows the American people that \nCongress can come together in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion to \npass legislation. Vermonters who rely on the distant signal license for \ntheir broadcast programming can rest easy today knowing that their \nexisting television stations will not disappear from their screens come \nDecember 31.\n  Over the years I have worked on the Judiciary Committee to ensure \nthat all Vermonters have access to Vermont broadcast television \nstations. In previous reauthorizations, including STELA's most recent \nreauthorization in 2010, I have made it a priority to ensure that every \nVermont satellite subscriber has the option to watch Vermont-focused \nprogramming. Local broadcast stations play an important role in \ninforming and fostering a sense of community. This is particularly true \nin a small State like mine. I am proud to have made sure that residents \nin every corner of Vermont will continue to have a choice to see \nVermont news.\n  The Judiciary Committee portion of this legislation reauthorizes the \ndistant signal license for another 5 years. It is narrowly crafted to \nensure that consumers do not see any disruption in service, but also \ndesigned to make sure that content holders who are paid royalties under \nthis license continue to receive an annual cost of living adjustment \nbeginning from the rate that is currently in place. The distant signal \nlicense is important to consumers. I recognize, however, that \ncompulsory licenses do not always reflect the true market value of the \ncontent that is being licensed. The mechanisms to modestly increase the \nrate when appropriate remain in place. Through the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee process, I worked with Senator Durbin, who offered a non-\ncontroversial amendment to expand the carriage of low power television \nstations on cable systems. I was happy to support this amendment \nbecause improving the reach of these stations so that more viewers can \nsee them will help to expand the diversity of voices available on \ncable. That is as important in Burlington, VT as it is in Chicago.\n  I share the concerns of several Senators who wanted this legislation \nto do more to promote competition. It is unfortunate that the House of \nRepresentatives would not agree to the Senate's stronger language in \nthis regard, but I was willing to compromise because the threat of \nletting the law expire was too great. The language in the bill we will \npass today is better than what was in the original House bill. Overall, \nthis legislation is a win for viewers in Vermont and across the \ncountry. I look forward to the President signing it into law.\n  Mr. ROCKFELLER. Mr. President, the bill being considered by the \nSenate today represents what can happen through hard work on both sides \nof the aisle and in both chambers of Congress. The STELA \nReauthorization Act of 2014 will make sure that 1.5 million Americans \ndo not lose access to distant broadcast network signals at the end of \nthe year. It also adopts a number of pro-consumer video policy reforms, \nmany of which originated in the bill that Senator Thune and I worked \ndiligently to pass through the Senate Commerce Committee. I am proud of \nthis legislation, and pleased that it has garnered the unanimous \nsupport of both the House and the Senate.\n  I know not everyone in this body agreed with all of the specific \npolicy provisions in the bill before us. But such is the nature of \nlegislative compromise. I was sympathetic with many of those policy \nconcerns, but failing to reauthorize STELA and disenfranchising \nmillions of television viewers simply was not an option. I appreciate \nmy colleagues' recognition of this important fact.\n  I want to thank Senator Thune, as always, for his willingness to work \nwith me in a strong bipartisan manner throughout this year-long \nreauthorization effort. I also want to thank Senators Leahy and \nGrassley for their good work and contributions to this must-pass \nlegislation. And I am grateful to Representatives Upton, Waxman, \nWalden, and Eshoo for working with us in good faith to find consensus \non an eminently reasonable compromise bill.\n  Of course, legislation of this magnitude does not come about without \ndedicated and savvy staff. So, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the \ntireless efforts of Ellen Doneski, John Branscome, Shawn Bone, David \nQuinalty, and Hap Rigby, as well as House Energy and Commerce staff \nDavid Redl, Grace Koh, Ray Baum, Shawn Chang, Margaret McCarthy, and \nDavid Grossman. Their commitment to public service is commendable, and \nthe American people ultimately will benefit from their work.\n  This legislation, and the debate around it, has started what I \nbelieve will be a lasting conversation about the future of the video \nmarketplace. Today's action takes positive steps toward a more \nconsumer-centric video policy in this country. More importantly, it \nalso represents what can be accomplished when we all go about our \nbusiness legislating in a practical and productive way.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 5728) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/20/senate-section/article/S6220-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE GOALS OF NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY AND NATIONAL \n                             ADOPTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 590.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 590) recognizing National Native \n     American Heritage Month and celebrating the heritage and \n     cultures of Native Americans and the contributions of Native \n     Americans to the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, each November, we reflect on the \ntremendous contributions Native Americans have made and continue to \nmake to our nation. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs, I am honored to continue that tradition by introducing this \nresolution, along with 26 of my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle, honoring National Native American Heritage Month.\n  Native Americans have contributed immeasurably to the character and \nculture of the United States. They played an instrumental role as code \ntalkers in both World Wars by using their Native languages on the \nbattlefield, and to this day, they continue to serve in the military at \na higher rate per capita than any other group in the country. In my \nhome State of Montana, I am proud to represent more than 5,000 Native \nAmerican veterans, as well as eight great tribal nations.\n  As we celebrate and commemorate the rich and diverse cultures and \ntraditions of Native Americans nationwide, it is important to \nacknowledge the enduring challenges many tribal communities face in \nmeeting the education, healthcare and general welfare needs of their \npeople.\n  This month is an opportunity to recommit to strengthening the \ngovernment-to-government relationship between tribes and the United \nStates. It is also a reminder that the Federal government has treaty \nand trust obligations to the 566 Federally recognized tribes, and we \nmust do more to ensure they have the tools they need to build stronger \nand healthier communities.\n  I look forward to continuing my work with Indian Country, and I hope \nmy colleagues and the American people will join me in celebrating the \naccomplishments of Native Americans, not just this month, but \nthroughout the year.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, each November, we \nrecognize National Native American Heritage Month to celebrate the \nheritage and culture of the great nations that originally inhabited \nthis country. During this month, we should reflect on the numerous \nachievements made over the previous year. Each day, individuals and \norganizations across Indian Country continually tackle tough issues and \nstrive to make significant impacts for their people and tribes. It is \nthese efforts that show the strength and vitality of Indian Country.\n  This year, across the Nation, Native American movements have unified \nand rallied the Native voice on several important issues to Indian \nCounty. Thousands of individuals have come together on the steps of the \nU.S. Capitol to share their views on environmental protections, treaty \nrights and the use of a racial slur by a professional sports league. A \ngrassroots movement in South Dakota also spurred voters living on the \nPine Ridge Indian Reservation to get out the vote and approve the \nchange of their county name from Shannon County to Oglala Lakota \nCounty. These actions reflect a positive drive in the Native community; \na drive that tribal, local, State and Federal Governments cannot simply \nignore.\n  As sovereign nations, tribes have the ability to empower and govern \ntheir own people. Native American leaders in South Dakota and across \nthe country have recognized that preserving their culture is vital to \nfuture growth and success. Native languages are being revitalized and \ntribal cultures are being infused into programs. With its treaty and \ntrust responsibility, the Federal Government must support this \ncontinued progress. I have always fully believed that the best ideas \ncome from tribal governments and leaders, and not from Washington, DC. \nWe must continue to work together to understand and implement \nsuccessful approaches.\n  South Dakota is home to nine treaty tribes, each with its own \ndistinct culture and heritage. Throughout my years of service, I have \nhad the opportunity to work closely with many leaders from each \nreservation. I would like to personally honor each of the South Dakota \ntribes: Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, the \nFlandreau Santee Sioux Tribe, the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, the Oglala \nSioux Tribe, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, the \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe, and the Yankton Sioux Tribe.\n  With the commencement of the National Native American Heritage Month, \nI encourage everyone to join in commemorating the unique culture of the \nindigenous peoples of the United States. Throughout the country, \nnumerous tribes and organizations are coordinating educational events \nand celebrations. While the month of November is in tribute of \ntraditions and accomplishments of tribal nations, it is important to \ncontemplate the many more undertakings that must be addressed. We must \nall continue to work together to find positive solutions for Indian \nCountry.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.
