Madam President, it is obvious when you check the press \nthat the Republicans have had a very, very bad week. On the same day \nthat Democrats in Congress delivered quality affordable health \ninsurance to tens of millions more Americans, the Republican Congress \ndelivered this Nation a government shutdown.\n  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, yesterday millions of Americans \nwent on line to shop for affordable insurance policies in the new \nmarketplace exchanges. Some compare that to when Google went on line \nand the many problems that Google had because they had no idea people \nwere so interested in Google. There were some problems they had. Of \ncourse, now we know how people feel about Google.\n  The same is going to happen with this Affordable Care Act. People \nhave until December to sign up. They are on again today as they were \nyesterday signing up. But thanks to the Republican government shutdown, \nhundreds of thousands of public servants were sent home without pay. \nThanks to the Republican shutdown, tourists lined up outside Red Rock \nCanyon outside Las Vegas where more than 1 million people a year go. \nBut they did not go there yesterday. There were gates. They could not \nget in.\n  Thanks to the Republican government shutdown, a group of World War II \nveterans who traveled from Iowa and Mississippi had to break down \nbarricades to visit the Washington, DC, memorial in their honor, some \nof them in wheelchairs.\n  Thanks to the Republican government shutdown, 200 very sick patients, \nincluding 30 children, were turned away from the National Institutes of \nHealth clinic that offers lifesaving--that is an understatement--\nlifesaving treatment. Most of the children turned away are suffering \nfrom some type of cancer.\n  I read that modern-day anarchists in the House have been celebrating \nthe shutdown--celebrating the shutdown. They can barely contain their \nglee at having realized a 2010 campaign promise to halt the basic \nfunctions of government. Here is what the tea party spokesperson said. \nShe is their spokesperson, Michele Bachmann. Remember, she is the woman \nthat ran for President and was the leading contender for about 4 hours \nor whatever it was. But anyway, she loves to talk. Here is what she \nsaid yesterday, ``It's exactly what we wanted, and we got it.'' You \ncannot make up stuff like that. Can you imagine anyone saying that when \nwe have babies turned away who are coming for lifesaving treatment? \n``It's exactly what we wanted, and we got it.''\n  It is time for my Republican colleagues to do a gut check. \nRepublicans in the House have proposed one cockamamie, can't-pass idea \nafter another the last few days: defund\n\n[[Page S7106]]\n\nObamaCare, delay ObamaCare, deny preventive health. They tried that \nbefore. They tried it again. They were not satisfied until they said: \nNow, let's also go after women--things as basic as contraceptives--or \nelse we will shut the government down. That is what they said.\n  They are obsessed with ObamaCare. Now they have gotten their way. \nThey have shut down the government. As Bachmann said, ``It's exactly \nwhat we wanted, and we got it.'' But none of their wacky ideas are any \ncloser to becoming law. Instead of reading the writing on the wall, \nHouse Republicans have turned to a new bad idea, to cherry-pick a few \nparts of government that they like and reopen only those parts.\n  Credit for this idea goes, I am told, to the junior Senator from \nTexas. He goes over to the House and tells them what they should do. \nHe, along with people like Bachmann, are tea party, they are \nanarchists. They are happy. Listen, I have come here, and I have talked \nabout how happy they are in hurting government. We now have them \nspeaking out openly. ``It's exactly what we wanted, and we got it.''\n\n  But I do have a little bit of advice for my Republican colleagues in \nthe House. When your latest brilliant idea came from the same person \nwho proposed the ``dumbest idea ever'' according to one of his own \nSenate Republicans here, I would think it is a sign you are on the \nwrong track. It is time for Republicans to stop throwing one crazy idea \nafter another at the wall in hopes that something sticks. Nothing has \nstuck.\n  There has been a sensible plan to reopen the government right in \nfront of House Republicans all along: A clean 6-week resolution that \nopens government today. We passed it in the Senate last week. I believe \nreasonable Republicans--I hope--are desperately looking for a way out. \nThat is what all of the newspapers said today, all of the news reports. \nEach day a couple more come forward. I do not blame them for looking \nfor a way out.\n  These piecemeal bills are not a way out. The Obama administration \nalready promised to veto them. So they obviously are not the answer. \nReopening only parts of government that they like is not a responsible \nsolution. The Senate already has a plan to reopen the government while \nwe work out our budget differences--open the government based on the \nresolution we passed last week.\n  If Republicans really want to reopen the government, they should just \ngo ahead and reopen the government. They have had that power all along. \nOnce they do that, we will be happy to appoint conferees, work out \nlong-term budget priorities with the House. Let's go to conference. We \ntalked about it. Patty Murray has been here 18 times to talk about it.\n  We should not be fighting over a 6-week stopgap budget bill. We \nshould be working out our long-term fiscal issues. Americans are tired \nof this type of knockdown, drag-out debt fight, which costs our economy \nbillions of dollars. The way to put our Nation on sound fiscal footing \nis to set sensible policies through regular order in the legislative \nprocess, not to extort concessions through dangerous hostage taking.\n  First, Republicans must reopen the government. The next move is to go \nto conference and set our minds on reaching a reasonable compromise. \nRight now, Republicans led by John Boehner are the only thing standing \nbetween Congress and compromise. I would suggest he stop taking advice \nfrom Bachmann and Cruz.\n  Unfortunately, it seems that some in the Republican conference are \nsimply too mad at me personally, too obsessed with getting me \npersonally to back down from doing what most of America believes is \nright. The National Review said yesterday that I was ``the villain of \nvillains.'' John Boehner could reopen the government if he wanted to, \nbut he is too obsessed with beating the villain of villains, and \nobviously too afraid of the tea party to do the right thing for the \ncountry.\n  When I read this yesterday, I said: Villain. Huh. Be careful of the \nwords you choose. Gee, no one likes to be called a villain. So I looked \nit up in the dictionary. Uncouth person. Well, I acknowledge, I \nprobably was not born in a place that most people would like to be born \nin. I was not raised the way most people like to be raised. But I would \nhope over the years that I am not uncouth. I have tried my best to \nbecome part of mainstream society.\n  The other definition is I am a scoundrel or a criminal. Well, I am \nnot a criminal. I am not a scoundrel. So they better get a different \ndefinition for me. In spite of being the villain of villains, I have \nsome advice and a suggestion. I really do believe there are reasonable \nRepublicans in Congress. They have to, as I said, do a gut check and \nunderstand who they represent--understand that America is waiting for \nthem to do the right thing. I know they believe in public service. But \nthey have to understand why public service is important. I urge them to \nthink about 30 babies--babies, little kids, who yesterday were brought \nby their parents to Washington, DC, for hope--hope that their little \nbabies and children are not going to die, that they can get lifesaving \ntreatment. They were turned away. So I urge them to do the right thing. \nI urge them to join us to reopen the Federal Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/02/senate-section/article/S7106-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, if it was not clear earlier this week \nwhy Republicans were asking to delay ObamaCare, it should be pretty \nclear to everybody this morning. The rollout of this thing made a trip \nto the DMV look like a good time. The word of the day was ``glitch.'' \nYou could probably explain one or two of these glitches away, maybe \nthree, but not glitches in Nebraska, Maryland, Florida, Wisconsin, \nIllinois, and in Kentucky--not glitches all across the country.\n  Kentuckians who tried to log in yesterday got a message that read \n``server error.'' Let me translate that. It did not work. I mean, if \nthe plural of anecdote is data, it seems to me the plural of glitch has \nto be systemic failure. This is the law that Washington Democrats were \nso adamant about unveiling yesterday, they were willing to shut down \nthe government over it.\n  Instead of agreeing to a couple of commonsense proposals related to \nthis law, they stuck to their absolutist position: 100 percent of \nObamaCare when and how they want it, no matter what. This, of course, \nunless the President thinks you are one of the chosen few who deserve a \nspecial break.\n  So basically Washington Democrats shut down the government because \nthey did not think middle-class Americans deserve the same kind of \ntreatment as their employers, and because they did not think Congress \nshould have to follow the same rules on ObamaCare exchanges as \neverybody else.\n  These were fair things to ask for. They were reasonable. If the \nDemocrats who run Washington could have brought themselves to that \nsensible position, they would have voted to keep the government open. \nBut in the end, they got their shutdown, which they apparently think \nwill help them politically. They held on to their absolutist position \non ObamaCare regardless of the consequences for American families.\n  Two days into this thing they still refuse to budge. The President \nreiterated again yesterday he is not interested in talking. The \nmajority leader made it clear he is not interested in talking either. \nHe shot down just about every attempt to engage in serious discussions \nwith the House or with any one else for that matter.\n  Look, this week Washington Democrats had a choice: Defend basic \nprinciples of fairness when it comes to ObamaCare or shut down the \ngovernment. They chose the latter. It was the wrong decision, in my \nview. It is time for them to start finding solutions, to start talking, \nand put the interests of their constituents ahead of the interests of \ntheir party.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/02/senate-section/article/S7106-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7106-S7107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, there were two headlines in most of the \nmajor newspapers across the United States this morning. I saw it in \nFinancial Times as well as the Wall Street Journal. The headlines \nnoted: ``Americans flock to insurance exchanges.''\n  It was the first day when we had the rollout of the Web site where \nuninsured Americans had an opportunity to shop--real competition, a \nvariety of plans. Illinois has 54 choices for uninsured people. This is \na dream come true. Most of these people have lived their entire lives \neither without health insurance or with no choice, a take-it-or-leave-\nit policy that may be worthless when they need it. These are situations \nwhere many of them never once in their lives were able to be insured \nwhen it came to health insurance. There were a lot of reasons for it. \nSome of them had jobs that paid so little, offered no benefits, and \nthey couldn't afford to buy health insurance. Some of them had \npreexisting conditions or perhaps a history of asthma in their family, \ndiabetes, cancer survivors. They couldn't buy health insurance if they \nwanted to. It wasn't even offered.\n  Yesterday was different. October 1 was different as 2.8 million \nAmericans came on the first day to this Web site to go shopping for \nhealth insurance. What a relief it must have been.\n  The Chicago papers told the story of a man who had just about given \nup hope because he had a child with a mental illness and because of \nthat he could never buy health insurance. He was shopping yesterday. He \nwas disappointed. He wanted to sign up yesterday, but so many people \ncame to this Web site the first day that it wasn't able to meet all of \nthe needs of the people who were shopping, or wanted to.\n  It will. There will be an opportunity. I am sure it will be soon.\n  I can't get over when I hear the Republican leader come to the floor \nand, with barely disguised glee, talk about the first day's problems \nwith the Affordable Care Act. There is no question that many \nRepublicans are not only praying for the Affordable Care Act to fail, \nthey are betting on it.\n  None of them voted for it, not one. Not a single Republican voted for \nit. They are frightened--frightened at what is to come when the verdict \nof history comes down on this program. I think I know what the verdict \nwill be. There will be some bumps in the road, glitches, maybe, some \nproblems with the Web site. But in the end the American people \nunderstand the fundamental fairness of the Affordable Care Act; the \nfundamental fairness that said, yes, we have a right as Americans to \nhealth care protection. I believe we do and we should.\n  I have lived the life, a good one, but I had a moment in that life \nwhen I had no health insurance. I was a brandnew father with a brandnew \nbaby with medical challenges and no health insurance. I have never felt \nmore helpless in my life, praying that my little girl would get the \nbest when I didn't have health insurance.\n  Multiply that times 40 million uninsured Americans and understand \nwhat is at stake. Those on the other side who are opposed to affordable \ncare don't want to extend the helping hand of health insurance to those \nwho have been denied for years. They don't have anything to replace it \nwith. Stick with the current free market system.\n  Forty million Americans have been left behind with this current \nsystem. That is why I supported the Affordable Care Act. This is why \nthe President is fighting for the Affordable Care Act. This is why we \nhave to continue to fight every single day to make sure it is not \ndefunded, as the Republicans tried to do only a few days ago, to make \nsure the coverage for individuals is not delayed as the Republicans \ntried to do only a few days ago.\n  No, we have to fight to make sure Americans have this chance. There \nis no turning back when it comes to offering health insurance to \nfamilies who desperately need it.\n  What are the Republicans prepared to bet on this wager to end the \nAffordable Care Act and health care reform? They are willing to bet the \nFederal Government. They are willing to shut it down over the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Harry Reid, our Democratic leader, told the story that was reported \nin the Wall Street Journal that the National Institutes of Health--not \nfar from here, in the near suburbs of Maryland and which is a beacon of \nhope--this is where some of the most important medical research in the \nworld is taking place. The head of NIH, Dr. Francis Collins, may be one \nof the most extraordinary people who has ever been involved in public \nservice. He was head of the National Genome Project. They said it would \nprobably take him 5, 6, or 8 years. He was so good and had so much \ntalent that he did it in a very brief period of time--mapping the human \ngenome. In doing so, he started opening doors to understanding, \nknowledge, and finding cures. He took that back to the NIH and they \napply it every single day to save lives and find cures.\n  For the second day in a row, three-quarters of the scientists, \ndoctors, and researchers at NIH sit at home, unable to engage in this \ncritically important research, unable to find the new drugs, new \nsurgeries, new medical devices, and the new procedures to save lives.\n  That is part of the Republican government shutdown. Oh, they may \ncongratulate themselves on finally bringing this government to its \nknees, but they have to take responsibility for what they have done as \nwell. They have shut down the National Institutes of Health. They have \nshut down medical research. It is worse because the toughest medical \ncases in America end up at the doorsteps of NIH. These are the most \nchallenging medical conditions, families and people who have just about \ngiven up hope and think there is one last place to go, NIH, the very \nbest.\n  Yesterday Dr. Francis Collins announced that 200 people who would \nhave started clinical trials this week at the NIH were turned away \nbecause of the government shutdown. Within that population of 200, 30 \nwere children, most of them cancer victims. Imagine for a moment that \nyou are the mother or father of a child diagnosed with cancer and have \none last hope, the National Institutes of Health. It may be a great \npersonal sacrifice for you and your family to pick up and come out \nhere, but you are going to do it. It is your baby. Then when you arrive \nat the door of the NIH there is a sign that says: This agency is \nclosed.\n  Why is it closed? Some national emergency, some disaster, some \ncrisis? No. It was a manufactured political temper tantrum coming from \nthe tea party, Speaker Boehner, and those who believe this is the right \nway to go.\n\n  Excuse me if this example is so stark, but I haven't even begun to go \ninto the details. I would invite any family who has been a victim of \nthis government shutdown at NIH or any other medical facility, come to \nmy Facebook page, my Twitter account. Send me a message and tell me \nyour story. I wish to come to the floor and tell that story too.\n  People shouldn't disappear into the shadows as we make all this noise \nover this political debate. They ought to be front and center. Please \nshare your story if you wish. I know it is a matter of privacy and \nconfidentiality. If you don't want to, I certainly understand.\n  This is what it has come down to. Yesterday, for example, in the \nHouse they said: Oh, we are going to open the Veterans' Administration. \nSenator Cruz has made a decision he is going to pick and choose the \nagencies to reopen. We will start with the Veterans' Administration. In \nother words, as former Speaker Pelosi said, they are going to release \none hostage at a time when it comes to our Federal Government.\n  But what Senator Cruz and the tea party Republicans failed to \nacknowledge is of the 800,000 Federal employees who have been \nfurloughed, over 500,000 are veterans. They are out of work. If they \ncare about the veterans, put this government back to work, put 500,000 \nof our veterans back to work. Incidentally, one out of four of them is \ndisabled, disabled veterans put off the payroll and furloughed. There \nis no\n\n[[Page S7108]]\n\npromise they will ever be paid because of this tea party government \nshutdown.\n  We have serious challenges facing America, but we need to reopen this \ngovernment now. Now. There are no excuses. Speaker Boehner sits there \nwith a bill that he could bring before the House by 11 o'clock this \nmorning. They could vote on it and the word would go out before noon \nthat the government is reopened. That is how quickly he can act. It is \nthere, but he won't call it for a vote.\n  What is he afraid of? Why won't he call this measure for a vote \nbefore the House? He knows it will pass because every Democrat will \nvote for it and moderate Republicans will step up and vote for it.\n  The only hope we have to end this tea party Republican crisis is if \nmoderate Republicans will step forward now and say we are not part of \nthis strategy. We want this government open. We are prepared to face \nall the challenges that follow, but we are not going to move forward at \nthe expense of patients coming to the National Institutes of Health.\n  This is only one example. There are many more just like it.\n  I would say this in closing. Once again the Republican leaders come \nto the floor and mention the fact that Members of Congress will be in \nthe insurance exchanges, the same insurance changes that were \nadvertised yesterday for the first time. To give a moment of reflection \nin history, we are in the insurance exchanges because of an amendment \noffered by a Republican Senator, Senator Grassley. This is an amendment \nwhich was part of the Affordable Care Act, which passed. We will be \nbuying insurance, the same kinds of policies, exactly the same kinds of \npolicies offered to all Americans on the exchanges. There are no \nspecial favors for Members of Congress.\n  Now we hear an objection from Senator McConnell to the employer's \ncontribution for our staff and for Members of Congress. Over half of \nthe American people get their health insurance through their place of \nemployment. Virtually all of them have employer contributions that help \nthem pay their monthly premiums. The same thing is true for Federal \nemployees. The same thing is true for Members of Congress. The same \nthing will be true when it comes to the insurance exchanges. There is \nno special treatment of Members of Congress. The notion that we can't \nhave an employer's contribution when it comes to the insurance \nexchanges is flatout wrong. A business with fewer than 50 employees, \nfor example, can send their employees to the exchanges and continue to \ncontribute to their premiums. It is already accepted under law so there \nis no special treatment in this. It is only another diversion.\n  Trying to find ways to create chaos and uncertainty when it comes to \nthe Affordable Care Act is the message of the Republican Party. \nUnfortunately, it is being delivered at the expense of 800,000 \nfurloughed Federal employees, the services this government offers, and \n200 people turned away this week for clinical trials at the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I listened with great interest to the \ncomments of the distinguished deputy Democratic majority leader.\n  I was reminded of a radio commentator, who perhaps is not remembered \nas frequently now, but when I grew up, he had radio show where when he \nstarted out he would say: And now for the rest of the story.\n  I wish to offer the rest of the story. I listened as Senator Durbin \nspoke about the fact that the National Institutes of Health is not open \nfor business. The good news is that Republicans and Democrats both \nagree that we should reopen the National Institutes of Health. In fact, \nit is my understanding that the House of Representatives will pass a \nbill perhaps as early as today and send it over to the Senate.\n  I hope Senator Reid, unlike over the last few days where he has \nkilled every reasonable offer by the House of Representatives, will \nreconsider and he will not kill that funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health during this partial government shutdown.\n  There are some other areas where I think we could work together. \nSenator Reid knew that Republicans were going to come to the floor and \ntry to make sure that our uniformed military continued to get their \nfull pay on time during this impasse of Congress. Like the good \npolitician he is, he actually beat us to the punch. He came down here \nfirst and made the same offer. The good news is there was bipartisan \nsupport for funding our troops in full, our uniformed military, on a \ntimely basis during this impasse.\n  This has been sort of a surreal experience in so many ways because my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle have been making what I consider \nto be some very strange arguments. The argument they have been making \nis that President Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act, \notherwise known as ObamaCare, is untouchable, and that our efforts to \nmodify it in any way are illegitimate. Their favorite word is \n``extreme'' or the product of some effort by the tea party Republicans \nor some other disparaging connotation.\n  I am not sure exactly how to respond except to say this: If ObamaCare \nis untouchable, if the Obama administration is perfect, if we can't \nchange one word and one sentence about ObamaCare, then you need to tell \nthe Obama administration. Since 2010, the administration has granted \nmore than 1,000 different waivers to its friends and political allies. \nIt suspended all work on a large portion of ObamaCare known as the \nCLASS Act. It has delayed ObamaCare's basic health program and delayed \nthe employer mandate. When we tried to delay the individual mandate so \naverage Americans get the same sort of consideration from this \nadministration that employers get, that businesses get, we were told \nthis is an unreasonable request. Senator Reid tabled that, in essence \nkilling that provision rather than taking it up and embracing it and \nsaying: You know what. If employers get a break for 1 year, then let's \ngive average Americans a break.\n\n  The Obama administration has likewise delayed the eligibility \nverification for the exchanges. It started yesterday. In other words, \nyou can apply for one of these insurance exchanges, but you don't have \nto prove what your income is. If there is a bigger open invitation for \nfraud, I am not aware of what it might be. But that is what the Obama \nadministration has done, delayed the eligibility verification for the \nObama exchanges, and they have delayed the cap on out-of-pocket \nexpenses.\n  In short, the Obama administration has, by its very actions, \ndemonstrated that ObamaCare is not perfect. The administration itself, \nby its own actions, has acknowledged ObamaCare is not ready for prime \ntime.\n  This became painfully obvious to millions of Americans yesterday when \nthe ObamaCare exchanges encountered widespread problems on its first \nday of operation. The President calls these glitches--glitches, a nice \npoll-tested, fairly benign-sounding word. But these were systemic \nfailures of the ObamaCare exchanges yesterday when they came online--\nobviously, not ready for prime time.\n  Meanwhile, there have been other changes in this perfect, inviolable, \ncan't-change-a-word ObamaCare. While the Supreme Court, we certainly \nacknowledge, has upheld major portions of ObamaCare, it is important to \nremember it declared a major piece of the law--the compulsory expansion \nof Medicaid--as unconstitutional. Unconstitutional: incompatible with \nour fundamental law of the land. Does that sound like a law that is \nperfect, can't be changed?\n  Let me give another example. During the ObamaCare debate, Democrats \nvoted on a party-line vote to impose a medical device tax on medical \ndevice manufacturers. It is not based on their income, it is based on \ntheir gross receipts or how much money comes in the door, before they \neven deduct their cost of doing business and their overhead. So they \nwould actually have to pay taxes without it generating any net income \nbecause of the nature of this tax. This is a job-killing tax.\n  I have had constituents come into my office and say: We have \noperations in Costa Rica, so we are going to have to move jobs we would \ncreate in Dallas to Costa Rica because of this job-killing medical \ndevice tax. You know what. Medical devices are some of the\n\n[[Page S7109]]\n\nmost innovative parts of our health care system. How better to \ndiscourage medical innovation and lifesaving discoveries and \nmanufacturing than to impose this gross receipts tax on medical \ndevices.\n  That is not just my opinion. The last time we had a debate on the \nbudget resolution, 79 Senators voted against the medical device tax \nbecause they realized it was a terrible mistake in this law we are told \ntoday, yesterday, and the day before is perfect in every way, wouldn't \nchange a thing. But Senate Democrats are now lining up to repeal the \nmedical device tax. Somehow, in a schizophrenia I don't quite \nunderstand, other Democrats are saying an attempt to do that would \nrepresent partisan extremism. Which is it? I think the American people \nknow.\n  I am not sure exactly how our friends on the other side of the aisle \ndefine extremism, but I would submit that very few extreme ideas gain \nthe support of 79 Senators in the Senate on a bipartisan basis. How is \nit extreme to delay ObamaCare's individual mandate when the \nadministration has unilaterally done the same thing for businesses? How \nis it extreme to ask Members of Congress to live by the same laws that \napply to everyone else?\n  The majority leader, Senator Reid, tabled two amendments to the \ncontinuing resolution that would change this special carve-out for \nCongress that would provide a delay of the individual mandate for \naverage Americans, such as the administration has already done for \nbusinesses, and we are told that is extreme; that somehow we are the \nones who caused the government shutdown.\n  I am absolutely convinced President Obama and Harry Reid think this \nshutdown is the best thing that ever happened to them politically in \nrecent memory. So rather than come out and tell sympathetic stories \nabout what is happening at NIH, let's work together to mitigate some of \nthe hardship and inconvenience. Let's talk about working through this \nimpasse. Why can't we get the President to do what he reportedly \nintended to do in the first place, which is to convene a meeting at the \nWhite House with Republicans and Democrats to work through this? They \nare not just refusing to negotiate big compromises, they are refusing \nany compromise. It is my way or the highway.\n  They will not even agree to keep the war memorials open for our Honor \nFlights coming to Washington, DC. I would urge the majority leader and \nPresident Obama to join with us in passing a bill today that would keep \nour war memorials open.\n  My father was a World War II veteran. He is dead now, but he was a B-\n17 pilot in World War II. On his 26th bombing mission, he was shot down \nand captured as a prisoner of war. My father-in-law landed on Utah \nBeach the second day of the Normandy invasion. He is 95 years old now. \nHis mind is still sharp, his body not quite what it used to be. He \nwould love nothing better than to come to Washington, DC, on one of \nthese Honor Flights. Unfortunately, his health will not allow him to do \nit.\n  The chairman of the Honor Flight Network, James McLaughlin, has said:\n\n       It is beyond belief that those deserving men and women who \n     have waited decades to see their memorial and were selected \n     for this trip of a lifetime, to discover they may not be able \n     to see their memorial.\n\n  For many of them, this may be the last time they get during their \nlifetime. I would ask that the President cancel his trip to Asia--he is \nleaving on Saturday--to overrule Senator Reid and convene that meeting \nat the White House and come together to try and work through some of \nthese differences.\n  We can fund NIH. We could do it today if Senator Reid and President \nObama would allow it. But, no, instead, we are told it is my way or the \nhighway. We actually like this shutdown, they are saying to themselves, \nbecause they think they are winning politically. But they are not \nwinning politically when the American people are the net losers.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My good friend, whom I saw in the gym this morning, \nsometimes stretches credulity. Who shut down the government? Was it \nHarry Reid? No. He kept passing messages to keep the government going. \nWas it Barack Obama? No. We all know who it was. It was the small band \nof tea party people in the House. It was his junior colleague in the \nSenate, Ted Cruz, who had the idea of shutting down the government.\n  As Leader Reid said yesterday, we are not in 1984. Truth has some \ndegree of credulity. For my colleague from Texas to get up and say: \nHarry Reid and Barack Obama open the government, when his junior \ncolleague led the charge to shut it down, when the cries of the tea \nparty are ``shut it down,'' and we are desperately trying to keep it \nopen makes no sense and it is not going to wash.\n  One of the amazing things about our politics is how rhetoric has \nbecome so detached from reality, and then we have talk radio and some \nof the networks, FOX News, that repeat it. I saw a cartoon in the New \nYork Post yesterday saying that Senators and Congressmen are exempt \nfrom ObamaCare. That is just not true. We are part of ObamaCare, and we \nwill join the exchange--I will and so will my colleagues--because that \nis what they have to do.\n  But that doesn't even matter. The hard right is so angry at ObamaCare \nand, frankly, at President Obama and the fact he just trounced them in \n2012 in an election that was run on their issues. They are so angry and \nwhite hot that their rhetoric just becomes totally detached from \nreality and totally detached from the truth.\n  I feel badly for the veterans who couldn't get to the memorial. But \nwhy was the government shut down? Because Speaker Boehner and the House \nwouldn't keep it open. Senator Cornyn and many other Republicans paved \nthe way for us to open the government with a vote to allow us to go \nforward. That got 25 Republicans, even though Ted Cruz, his junior \ncolleague, was urging him not to vote that way. That was the right \nvote. We know that. He knew, Senator Cornyn did, to his credit, that \nshutting down the government was bad. So on the one procedural vote \nthat mattered, where he could have had the Senate say shut down the \ngovernment, he voted the other way.\n  The real onus here is on Speaker Boehner. The entire focus of this \ndebate should be on Speaker Boehner. Some might say it should be on Mr. \nCruz, the Senator from Texas. Some might say it should be on the 30 or \n40 hard-line tea party people in the House. But in my view it is the \nSpeaker of the House who has the responsibility not to listen to a \nsmall faction of his party when so much is at stake. Instead, Speaker \nBoehner seems to be listening to the junior Senator from Texas. The \njunior Senator from Texas has become the de facto Speaker of the House. \nIf he says jump, the House jumps.\n  The junior Senator wanted the House to embark on a crusade to defund \nObamaCare, so the Speaker, Speaker Boehner, did it. The junior Senator \nfrom Texas told the House to delay ObamaCare for 1 year, so the \nSpeaker, Speaker Boehner, did it. Now this junior Senator from Texas is \ntelling the House to pass piecemeal bills in a cynical attempt to pit \nimportant programs against each other, and now the Speaker is trying to \ndo just that.\n  Senator Cruz has driven Speaker Boehner to pit kids who should be \nenrolled in Head Start against kids who should be enrolled in cancer \ntrials. He has driven the Speaker to pick families who want to visit \nthe Statue of Liberty against families who own a small business and \nneed help from the SBA. He has pitted research and cancer against \nhealth care for our veterans.\n  It is a cynical strategy. Similar to all the others they have sent us \nand that have failed, as these will fail today, it has one purpose: not \nto get anything done but to try and wiggle out of this view that they \nhave shut down the government. Senator Cornyn's rhetoric will not work. \nIt is too far detached from reality.\n  So Speaker Boehner tries to come up with these gizmos, these \ngimmicks, these legislative ploys to say: Hey, I am trying to do \nsomething. At the same time he is in the vice grip of the tea party \nmembers of the House who are taking their orders from the junior \nSenator from Texas.\n  There is a simple way to open the government, I would say to my \nfriend--and he is my friend, Senator Cornyn of Texas--and my other \ncolleagues on the Republican side in the House.\n\n[[Page S7110]]\n\n  There is a bill sitting there waiting for a vote. It will open NIH, \nit will open the Veterans' Administration, it will open the World War \nII memorial, it will open the Statue of Liberty so the guy with the \nlittle sandwich shop right by the Statue of Liberty can get some \nbusiness back. Make no mistake about it: This crisis doesn't just hurt \nthe Federal Government. It doesn't even just hurt 800,000 families who \naren't getting the paychecks on which they depend. This is not \nabstract. It hurts lots of private sector people as well, whether they \nbe construction workers building a road using Federal dollars or the \nveteran waiting for that disability claim to come through or the guy \nwith the sandwich shop next to the closed Statue of Liberty who is \nmaking those sandwiches. It is not abstract. I get a little resentful \nwhen I hear my colleagues talk about the Federal Government as if it is \nsome big ogre; shut it down.\n  If you watched Rachel Maddow the other night, she had a variety of \ntea party congressmen who were running for the Congress in 2010 who \nsaid they were going to shut the government down. I think it was \nCongressman Mulvaney of South Carolina who said: When I get to \nCongress, I am going to shut the government down. And the tea party \naudience cheered and said ``shut it down'' before they even had a plan \nbecause they hate the Federal Government so much. That is the goal, to \nshut it down. ObamaCare is an excuse.\n  Mainstream Republicans know that shutting the government down is a \nbad thing and know that they are indeed paying a political price. So \nSpeaker Boehner should follow the majority and stop being scared of the \ntea party. He will face them down easily in a challenge for Speaker. \nSpeaker Boehner knows, as the ``National Review'' said this morning, \nthat more than 100 House Republicans would vote for our bill to reopen \nthe government if he put it on the floor. Instead, Republicans are \nwasting time on political stunts in asking to go to conference on a \nshort-term CR.\n  The Republicans have this exactly backward. They say: Let's talk, and \nthen maybe we will open the government. They ought to say: We will open \nthe government, and then we can talk. If Republicans would simply \nswitch all the lights back on, allow hundreds of thousands of \nfurloughed Federal employees to go back to work, allow cancer research \nto continue, veterans to get their disability claims, kids to go back \ninto Head Start, we could have a discussion about the budget, which \nthey rejected 18 times.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I woke up this morning feeling like I \nthink most Americans feel today--pretty disappointed in the antics of \nWashington, DC.\n  As my colleague from New York just pointed out, we all know why we \nare here: Speaker Boehner and the Republicans in the House demanded a \nransom in order to keep our government open, and their ransom was to \nrepeal a law they do not support--ObamaCare. They made it very clear \nthat the government was going to shut down. My constituents in \nWashington State who were supposed to go to work today--thousands of \nthem--aren't going to get their paychecks because of that ransom. They \nmade it very clear that they were not going to open the government over \na policy about which they care passionately.\n  I have to say that I started my morning this morning talking to a \nnumber of businesspeople involved in the construction industry in the \nState of Washington. They told me that this uncertainty, this crisis, \nthis shutdown of government is impacting their small businesses at home \nin the State of Washington because who is going to sign a contract to \nbuild something new when it is so unclear where our economy is going to \nbe as a result of this shutdown and the looming debt ceiling crisis. So \nthey are seeing a real retraction of their own businesses right now--\nnot because of the government funding of a program or anything else \nthat is ongoing or in dispute but because of this shutdown today.\n  Just a few minutes ago, on the other end of a spectrum, I talked to \nsome moms and dads in Head Start from my home State of Washington. A \nyoung mom from Bremerton, WA, who has a 2-year-old daughter, told us \nthat a few years ago she was on the streets, homeless, a victim of an \nabusive partner, and because of Head Start and the wraparound services \nthey provide, they found her a place to stay and got her and her child \ninvolved in early childhood education. Because of that support and an \nearly Head Start program, now 2 years later she is back at school \nworking on her degree, her daughter is doing well, and she is back on \ntrack.\n  Thousands of moms and dads such as her exist across the country \ntoday, with a helping hand at the right moment from the right program. \nBut because of sequestration and now because of the government \nshutdown, we are telling moms and dads such as her: Sorry, we are not \ngoing to be there for you.\n  I happen to be a very passionate advocate for early childhood \neducation. I was a former preschool teacher. I am using my skills as a \npreschool teacher right now. I think all of our colleagues could learn \na lot from those kinds of skills. No bullying; it is my turn to talk; \nbe reasonable; teach our children to play well in the sandbox. Those \nare lessons we teach in preschool. I think we could all learn from \nthat.\n  I think about that, and I think about those Head Start kids and the \nchildren whom I taught before and who are not being taught now because \nof the sequestration. What lesson are we giving them--that if I don't \nget my way right now about a bill I fought against and voted against \nand an election was run and won on, but I lost, and I am so mad that I \nam not going to let you have anything else because I am just so \nentrenched in that. That is not a lesson we should teach our kids.\n  Let's look at the other side of that argument. What if I came out \nhere and said: I am so passionate about funding early childhood \neducation because I know the research and what a difference it makes \nand I know what that investment will do for our country not just for \ntoday but for 10 or 20 years, and if I don't get my way to make sure \nevery child in this country has that start, this government is going to \nshut down. That is not the way we run a country. I adamantly and \npassionately fight for any cause I believe in. Any legislator here can. \nBut the way you get your way isn't to hold the country hostage.\n  We have a country that is counting on us to be responsible adults and \nto come to the table and work out our disagreements between each other. \nAnd they are large, there is no doubt about that, but you don't do it \nby hurting every family, every neighborhood, every community, every \npart of this country by holding this country hostage.\n  We have a responsibility. It is to pass a clean continuing \nresolution. It is to get our government working again. It is to tell \npeople they are going to get their paychecks. We are going to \nresponsibly do that, and then we, as Members of Congress, are going to \ntake our differences to a negotiating table and hammer them out. I may \nwant $1 million for something. My House counterparts may say no. We may \nmeet in the middle. I may say: I didn't get my way; OK, you got yours. \nThat is what you do in a conference committee. You don't do it by \nholding your country hostage.\n  So we say to Speaker Boehner today: Open the government. Let \neverybody go back to work. Don't hold our economy hostage. And we will \nthen sit down with you and work out our disagreements, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows we have asked 18 times now to do and have been told, no, \nwe are not going to let you go to that negotiating table, we are not \ngoing to let you talk--by the same people who want this government \nshutdown.\n\n  I find myself in a very odd place where we have a country that is \nclosed for business. We are sending a very bad message and lesson to \nthe children of this country that we can't work and play well together, \nthat we can't even disagree together in an admirable way. And we are \ndoing it while people are getting hurt.\n  Speaker Boehner, open the country again, open our economy again and \nagree to work out our differences the way responsible adults should do.\n  My understanding is, after trying all kinds of different ways to \nappease some of his Members with all kinds of different proposals, the \nlatest proposal is\n\n[[Page S7111]]\n\nto send us over piecemeal pieces of legislation. Well, OK. We feel bad \nabout the veterans--and we all do. I am the biggest veterans advocate \nin here. We will take care of them now. And, oh gosh, some of our \nconstituents are mad because they have flown out here and the national \nmuseums aren't open, so we will open those, and on and on, whatever the \ncause of the day is. I guarantee that if we began to pass those \npiecemeal pieces of legislation, my moms and dads in Head Start would \nbe at the end of the line and would never get funded. I am standing up \nfor them today and saying: You are first in line too.\n  We are all in this together. We need the government open--all of our \nagencies. Everybody gets a chance and an opportunity in this country. \nAnd we are going to stick together and say to Speaker Boehner: Pass a \nclean CR, and then allow this country and this government and the \nAmerican way of life to function as our forefathers said--by sitting \ndown at a negotiating table and working out our differences. That is \nwhat I have asked for as chair of the Budget Committee 18 times now. It \nis what we need to say we are going to do again but not while our \ncountry is shut down, not while my families in Head Start are held \nhostage, not while our small businesses are held hostage, not while \neverybody in this country is looking at us, wondering how we ever got \nto this.\n  Open the government, and let's be responsible legislators. That is \nwhat I came here to do. I certainly know it is what the Presiding \nOfficer came to do. And let's tell the kids in this country who are \nwatching us today that this country can function, we can work as \nadults, and we have a responsibility to do that--here and abroad.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we find ourselves in a very predictable \nsituation, and what is unpredictable is what our response to this \nsituation is going to be. For some time I have talked about the box \ncanyon that we were taking ourselves into, and I think it has now \nbecome very apparent to folks on both sides of the aisle that to \noverturn a central piece of legislation, it takes more than one-third \nof government to do so. When we have the presiding President over that \npiece of legislation, it actually takes two-thirds of each of the \nbodies to make that happen. I think people have realized that. It gives \nme no joy, but this is something I have obviously talked about for some \ntime. Now we find ourselves in this box canyon.\n  What was also very predictable was that my friend Tom Coburn, the \ngreat Senator from Oklahoma, laid out very clearly on the Senate floor \nthat even if there was a government shutdown, the health care bill \nwould continue. I think what Americans are waking up to and seeing--\neven though Republicans have strongly opposed the health care bill at \nevery turn--that even with government being shut down, the health care \nbill is continuing on and people around the country are signing up for \nwhat people call ObamaCare. So both of these were very predictable \noutcomes.\n  What is now unpredictable is what our response to that is going to \nbe. I am speaking mostly to my friends on this side of the aisle. There \nhas also been a number of people on the other side of the aisle who \nhave spent a great deal of time over the last 2 or 3 years trying to \nfocus on ways to reduce spending in the government and making our \ncountry stronger in the process.\n  I think to a person over here--as well as many on the other side of \nthe aisle--we understand that our inability to deal with the fiscal \nsituation in which we find ourselves in this country has hurt us \neconomically. People have not been willing to invest in capital \ninvestments within their companies and around the world in many cases \nbecause they don't know what is going to happen in our country.\n  I know first hand as the ranking member on Foreign Relations--and as \nI have traveled the world--there is no doubt it has affected us around \nthe world. People really do not understand whether we are going to be \nable to meet the obligations we have made from a security standpoint.\n  Again, where we are today is very predictable, and I don't want to be \ncrass. Obviously, I know this is creating a hardship for some people \nwho have been furloughed, and it is certainly affecting people around \nour country, and that is obviously not good. On the other hand, if \nthere is some way for some good policy outcome that strengthens our \ncountry over the longer haul, which is why we are all here, then that \nis a good tradeoff. We will see what happens.\n  Here is my concern: While the situation we are in is very \npredictable--and many people in this body predicted we would end up \nexactly where we are today in this box canyon--we knew people would \nstill sign up for the new health care law, which some have tried to \ndefund, in spite of the fact that government has shut down.\n  What I am concerned about is this: We have made great strides as a \nnation, and in this body, to reduce government outlays we have control \nover. This has not happened in this Nation since 1955 and 1956. Two \nyears ago we were at $1.43 trillion in annual outlays from a \ndiscretionary standpoint, and that is what we deal with in a CR. Last \nyear we were at $988 billion, and this year--if we continue to uphold \nthe law we put in place--we will be at $967 billion.\n  That is a phenomenal result for us to have achieved in this body and \nfor our country--to have achieved to strengthen our Nation. While there \nmay be ways of changing the way those outlays are done--and maybe there \nis mandatory spending that is substituted for discretionary spending. \nMaybe there are ways of doing it to make it more sensible to people in \nthis body. It is truly remarkable that Washington figured out a way to \nreduce the amount of spending that was taking place. I know we can \nfigure out a way to do that even smarter.\n  Let me get to the unpredictable point. Sometimes when people find \nthemselves in a box canyon or in a place that is difficult, they begin \ndoing things that are not in the interest of themselves, and certainly \nnot in the interest of the body that they represent. What I am worried \nabout is that while so many people have been focused on this shiny \nthing over here and so much of the Nation's focus has been on this \nshiny thing over here, what people\n\n[[Page S7112]]\n\nhave not been focused on, in the way I would hope, is the gains we have \nmade in controlling spending as a nation. What I worry about--as it \nlooks like we are now beginning to combine the continuing resolution \nprocess with the debt ceiling--is that people forget about the \ntremendous gains we have made in strengthening this Nation. While I am \nsaying this to an empty Chamber, like most of us do when we speak on \nthe Senate floor--and I know people are busy and have other things to \ndo--my talk today is really focused on people in the other Chamber.\n  I know there is a lot that is happening over there. What I am worried \nabout is that as the leadership over there tries to cobble together 218 \nvotes to maybe do something relevant to the continuing resolution, and \nat the same time do something to the debt ceiling, that somehow or \nother--because we are in this boxed canyon that was very predictable--\nthey deal away what we have gained.\n  What I hope we will do on this side--and to all of those--and there \nare many--on the other side who have fought so hard to try to get the \nmomentum going so we will save our country from huge deficits down the \nroad and do what we can to make sure we leave this country a better \nplace for young people like these interns and pages here on the floor--\nof the aisle is keep our focus on the fact that whenever negotiations \ntake place around a debt ceiling, they traditionally and always have \nbeen about making sure we are trying to do those things to keep us from \nhaving more debt down the road. We need to keep our eyes focused on the \nreforms that are necessary to keep that process going.\n  To be candid--and this is the first time I have said this publicly--\nto look at a continuing resolution at $988 billion--I'm sorry. As it \nnow is, the law says we would be spending--beginning a couple of days \nago in this new year--at $967 billion. I know the discussions here on \nthe floor have been: Well, in 6 weeks the sequester--by the way, the \nsequester is that mechanism that was put in place during the Budget \nControl Act to continue to put downward pressure on spending--will kick \nin according to all of the discussions that have taken place.\n  I think most of us who have fought hard to try to save our Nation \nfrom these mounting deficits down the road were a little disappointed \nthat we would be looking at extending last year's spending for 6 weeks, \nand really not taking ourselves down to $967 billion. I realize what \nhas happened. But here is my point to the other side of the building, \nthe House: Whatever you have to do to cobble together 218 votes to pass \na bill over there relative to maybe the CR and the debt ceiling, please \ndo not negotiate away the hard-won gains we were able to put in place \nto reduce spending and help make our country stronger for the young \npeople like those sitting in front of me. That is my message.\n\n  We are in a place that is very predictable. The outcome is \nunpredictable, but what I hope the outcome will be is an outcome that \ncauses us not only not to deal away the gains that have been put in \nplace, but to maybe put in place mandatory reforms that we all know \nneed to occur to make this country stronger. There is tremendous \nbipartisan support.\n  In April the President laid out a budget that had a number of \nmandatory reforms that he was in agreement with. So what I hope will \nhappen is we will keep the discretionary levels at levels we have \nalready agreed to and we will take up some of those mandatory reforms \nthat the President has already said he thinks are in the interest of \nour Nation and use those to help us raise the debt ceiling. As a \nresult, we will have an outcome that causes this country to be \nstronger, causes this economy to grow, and over time causes us to \ncontinue to be able to honor the commitments we have made around the \nworld.\n  With that I note absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I had a great honor this morning, and it \nwill change the nature of the remarks I intended to make on the Senate \nfloor.\n  I just returned from the World War II Memorial. We had a group of 90 \nWorld War II veterans who flew here on an Honor Air flight. Honor Air \nis a national program. The funds for it are raised by friends, \nneighbors, and community individuals to help bring their World War II \nveterans to the Nation's Capital.\n  I have probably visited the World War II Memorial dozens of times--\nmaybe 40 or 50. I visit it every time there is an Honor Air flight from \nmy home State and I am in Washington, DC, I like to be there to say: \nWelcome and thank you. It is an honor to have you at the memorial that \nwas built for you.\n  I visited the World War II Memorial. It is especially meaningful to \nme personally. My dad is a World War II veteran. My dad has been on the \nHonor Air flight. My dad will be 98 in November.\n\n  A few days before the World War II Memorial opened, I walked down \nthere--I was a House Member then, not a Senator--and got a glimpse of \nwhat it was going to be like. It is a wonderful place and it reminds us \nof many things. That day, I stepped away from the memorial and used my \ncell phone to call my dad at home in Plainville, KS. I was fortunate I \ngot the answering machine, because these are difficult things to tell \nyour parents. So I said: Dad, I am at the World War II Memorial. Thank \nyou for your service to our country. I respect you and I love you. It \nwas great to be able to say that to an answering machine instead of to \nyour own parent.\n  My dad actually one-upped me. A few moments later my cell phone rang \nand he said: Gerald, I couldn't understand what you said.\n  So I repeated it in person.\n  The great thing about the memorial is it causes us to reflect and say \nthings and express ourselves in ways that we otherwise would never do. \nSo that memorial, as do others that honor our service men and women, is \none that calls us to say we thank you for your service, we respect you, \nwe love you. That was my experience again this morning.\n  Again, I try to be there every time a group of veterans comes from \nKansas, and I was hoping today wouldn't be any different. With the \nshutdown of our government, with the funding on hold for the National \nParks, there was some concern about whether these veterans would be \nable to actually get to the memorial. It all worked fine. I appreciate \nthe way the morning's events transpired and there was no confrontation \nand no one wanted to deny those veterans their chance to visit their \nmemorial for the first time.\n  In addition to those sentiments about these individual veterans, I \nthink what may be of value as we approach today and tomorrow and try to \nfind the solutions that are necessary to solve the circumstance we find \nourselves in is a recognition that our veterans--I have had this \nthought every time I have walked to the Vietnam Wall or to the Korean \nWar Memorial and now to this newer memorial, the World War II \nMemorial--not a single person represented on that wall or memorialized \nin the World War II Memorial or the Korean War Memorial, not one of \nthem--I cannot imagine that a single one of them--volunteered or was \ndrafted for purposes of a fight between Republicans and Democrats. No \none went to serve our country, no one volunteered to serve our country \nbecause they believed in Republicans or they believed in Democrats. \nKnowing veterans as I do, my view is they answered the call to duty. \nThey were willing to serve because they believed in America. They \nbelieved in the United States and our principles and the freedoms and \nliberties it provides, and they knew their service would make a \ndifference in the lives of their kids and grandkids. They knew their \nservice would help make America a better place for everyone, but \ncertainly for people they knew--their family members.\n  I hope I can portray to my colleagues here in the Senate and here in \nthis Capitol building and down Pennsylvania Avenue that the battles we \nengage in need to be a lot less about Republicans and Democrats and \nmuch\n\n[[Page S7113]]\n\nmore about what is good for the country. We ought to use the veterans \nwe met with this morning and those who are memorialized on the National \nMall in every circumstance to remind ourselves that there is a higher \ncalling to what we do in our Nation's Capital. There is something more \nimportant than political skirmishes.\n  I don't say this in any Pollyanna way. I don't say it in a way that \ndoesn't acknowledge partisan differences. I always assumed and believed \nthat America sent a variety of people to Washington, DC, to represent \ntheir interests and my State of Kansas will probably send somebody \ndifferent than some other State. We all come here with a philosophy, a \nbackground of the way we grew up, the way we think about things, the \ninstructions our constituents have given us, and all of that is \nreflected in the way we vote, the issues we pursue, the priorities we \nhave. So it is not that we are all supposed to agree, but surely there \nought to be a recognition that when there is disagreement, as there \noften is, there is a desire, just as our service men and women had to \nserve the country, much more important than the desire to serve our \npolitical party.\n  Today's trip to the World War II Memorial, while it is a common \nexperience for me, was especially useful and meaningful because it \nhappened at a time when these veterans came not knowing whether they \nwould be able to gain entry to the memorial. Being there to encourage \nthem and seeing them welcomed and greeted was important but, perhaps \nequally as important, it served as a reminder to me that what we do in \nthe Senate is motivated by the best of intentions and the greatest of \ngoals; the idea that America is a special place and we who serve here \nhave a special responsibility. We have a chance to try to do something \ngood for the country.\n  One of the things that has always inspired and pleased me about \nKansans--and I assume it is true elsewhere--most of the conversations I \nhave with folks back home are a lot less about what they want me to do \nfor them but more about what decisions they want me to make, to make \ncertain their kids and grandkids have a better life. There is something \nvery great about how we have an interest--as human beings, as parents--\nin the well-being of the next generation and not just the well-being of \nourselves. So my efforts in trying to find resolution to the \ncircumstance we find ourselves in is strengthened, the resolve I have \nto try to work with others here in the Senate is one that is \nhighlighted by my experience this morning at the National Mall.\n  I think about where we are and where we need to go. Again, having \ndecried the high partisanship nature of this place, I don't want to \ndetract from that, but we need to be able to have leaders who are \nwilling to have discussions, conversations, and a coming together. It \nis true of Republicans and it is true of Democrats and it is certainly \ntrue of whoever is the President of the United States. We need to make \ncertain we have the ability to recognize that not all of us agree on \neverything, but with the efforts we make to find a solution to a \nproblem, there is a coming together. It seems to me we have now gotten \nourselves in this entrenched position. And while I was pleased moments \nago to learn that our President has called congressional leaders to the \nWhite House, it is disturbing to me that the message is: But we are not \nnegotiating. I am not certain what the purpose of the White House visit \nwill be. I hope it results in movement, in success.\n  It is my understanding my colleagues on the Democratic side of the \naisle have agreed this morning to ``not negotiate.'' All I know about \nthat is what I have read in the press. I don't--again, in an attempt to \nmake certain this doesn't sound partisan and detract from what I was \nattempting to convey moments ago, we need to make certain Republicans \nunderstand we can make progress in the positions we hold even without \ngetting everything we want.\n  So this experience I described of being a Senator--a Member of this \ngreat deliberative body--hasn't been my experience in the short time I \nhave been a Member of the Senate. The idea that we can't negotiate \nseems to me to be contrary to the purpose of this historic body.\n\n  I hope the attitude and approach changes and every Senator recognizes \nit is not an all-or-nothing proposition. It is an opportunity for us to \nresolve differences and each find some satisfaction in moving in a \ndirection or preserving the status quo, if that is one's position; that \nbecause America is a diverse place and that people care differently \nabout different issues and have different opinions, we certainly have a \nresponsibility to represent those views of the folks back home, but \nrecognizing that the country doesn't always agree with us. Surely, \nthere is that common ground, that opportunity to find solutions.\n  My call is for leadership--and by leadership I mean broadly all 100 \nof us; not leadership in the sense of someone who occupies a position \nof leadership beyond being a Member of the Senate but all of us--to \nfind the leadership to find the necessary resolve to solve our \ncountry's problems.\n  The Affordable Care Act is a very controversial piece of legislation. \nIt has been said here on the Senate floor: It is the law, it is not \nnegotiable. That position doesn't make sense to me. In fact, the \nPresident has delayed, excluded, found exemptions for what is the law. \nSo, surely, if the President can, for example, delay the implementation \nof the employer mandate, it is not outside of the realm--in fact, I \nwould say it is the constitutional responsibility of Congress--to have \nthe debate, discussion, and consideration of whether to delay the \nindividual mandate. It is the law of the land, but if the President can \nmake changes to the law of the land, surely the body created by article \nI, the legislative branch, has that opportunity to do so as well. So it \nought not be nonnegotiable.\n  It is time for the Senate to function. It is time for us as \nindividual Senators to provide the leadership to resolve our problems.\n  In my view, we desperately need leadership from the President. While \nI have serious policy and philosophical disagreements with President \nObama, my greatest complaint about his Presidency is his lack of \nleadership. We need somebody to rally us, to come together and find \nsolutions to those problems, to better resolve our differences. Again, \nI don't want to detract from the observations about how partisan this \nplace has become by talking about President Obama. In this case, he is \na Democrat and I am a Republican, but regardless of who is the occupant \nof the White House, in order for the Congress to resolve difficult \nissues, it takes the leadership of a President.\n  My call is, as it was earlier to my colleagues in the Senate to \nprovide leadership--I hope the President, in his meeting with the \nleadership of the Senate and House today, will provide the leadership \nnecessary to help us move in the right direction and step back from the \nstatement that while we are meeting, nothing is negotiable.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to address the Senate and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. First, I wish to apologize to the people of West \nVirginia. I am embarrassed and ashamed as a Senator and Member of \nCongress by how we are acting. I have been answering phones in my \noffice. They are upset. I said: Well, you are not as upset as I am. I \nhave a front-row seat, and it is not pretty.\n  This is not what we were sent here to do. It is not what I signed up \nfor. It is not why I asked the people in West Virginia to allow me to \nrepresent what I consider to be the greatest State in the Nation, and I \nam sure each Senator feels the same way about their State and its \nwonderful people. I have always looked at public service as an \nopportunity to fix problems, to make life better, to be able to use the \nwisdom and skills we have obtained through our experiences in life and \nwatching people and the compassion we have for people to try to make it \nbetter.\n  Shutting down government is simply unacceptable. I don't care what \nway a person looks at this, it is unacceptable.\n  This is the first time in 17 years that our government is not open \nfor business--the first time in 17 years we are not open. This is self-\ninflicted. This did not happen by any outside forces. This has all been \nself-inflicted. It not only hurts the people of West Virginia deeply, \nit hurts people all over this country, and they are feeling the \neffects. This is only the second day, but it is 2 days too long.\n\n[[Page S7114]]\n\n  Most of you know I am pretty moderate. I am very conservative on \nfiscal issues. This is how we were raised. We were expected to pay our \nbills, to take care of our debts, and take care of ourselves and our \nfamilies. So I have watched that very carefully.\n  When I became Governor, the first thing I did was I tried to put our \nfinancial house in order in West Virginia so that basically we could \ntake care of our values. That was our priority, based on what we \nwanted--our children to have opportunities. We never cut any services \nduring the recession. We took care of our seniors with the dignity and \nrespect and pride they should have. We took care of our veterans. We \ncould not be everything to everybody, but we really watched our dollars \nand got our financial house in order. So I look at it from that \nstandpoint, where I come from, as a proud West Virginia Democrat, but I \nam also very compassionate on social issues. Watching my grandparents \nand watching my family in the little town of Farmington, WV, where I \ngrew up, people expected you to do things. They expected you to really \nchip in and help people, but they expected you to help yourself also, \nand they expected you to take care of those who could not, the less \nfortunate. I have always taken that with me in every aspect of public \nservice.\n  I think I am reasonable and willing to compromise and work with \nanybody on any issue. I have always put my State's interests ahead of \nmy party politics. I do not make any excuses. I really believe I am an \nabsolutely privileged person to be living in the greatest country on \nEarth and to be a member of a great family in the great State of West \nVirginia. But I am an American, I am a West Virginian, and then I am a \nDemocrat in West Virginia, and I have dear friends who are Republicans \nfrom West Virginia and from all over the country.\n  So when I looked at the cause of this problem we have right now, it \nis about finances, strictly about finances. Can we continue to pay? I \nalso looked at the way I felt Democrats truly looked at this. They \nsaid: Fine, we will agree to the $986 billion number--$986 billion. \nThat was the Republicans' request, to keep that spending level. The \nDemocrats would have loved to have $1.058 trillion. They reduced it $90 \nbillion. To me, that was a good compromise. We can live with that $986 \nbillion number. We have to tighten our belts a little bit, but we are \ngood at that in West Virginia. And we did it.\n  Then, all of a sudden, the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare, as \npeople have referred to it--becomes the issue. There are a lot of \nthings in that piece of legislation that I do not agree with. I do not \nknow how I would have voted if I had been here. I would have tried to \nmake what I would have thought were constructive changes. But do you \nknow what. It is the law. And I said: I am in a mode that I would call \nfor a reform, repair, and then repeal parts of it we cannot fix. I do \nnot know that yet. We have to get in there and do it.\n  I am probably part of the problem and caused some of this because I \nmade a statement. We were talking to some people, and they asked me: \nWhat do you think is going to happen?\n  I said: Well, for my colleagues and friends on the other side of the \naisle--my Republican friends--I would think they would look, and if \nthey really want to talk about health care, can it be extended for 1 \nyear before it takes effect as the law.\n  I did not mean to postpone it. I did not mean to stop and don't start \nit until next year. I meant the fines and the penalties.\n  Think about this. I am very much opposed to the individual mandate, \nbut I understand it is part of the process. But I would have thought, \nwhy wouldn't we have a transition year?\n  So the law took effect as of yesterday. It has. We have people trying \nto find the best opportunity they have. In my little State, we do not \nhave a lot of options, so I want to make sure the people who have good \ninsurance are somehow able to keep that. There has to be a way we can \nwork through that. I want to make sure the people who have no insurance \nand have never been able to buy insurance can now be able to afford it. \nI want to make sure of that. I want to make sure people who had a \npreexisting condition or had a child who was born with a condition are \nable to keep the insurance they now have that they could not have \nbefore. I want to make sure that basically the senior citizens in West \nVirginia, who basically are filling the doughnut hole out of their \npockets, which they cannot afford, are taken care of. They can go get \nan exam on an annual basis and not have to pay a copayment from their \nMedicare. Those are all good things, and I know my good friends on the \nRepublican side feel the same way about some of this. Why would you \nwant to throw the baby out with the bathwater when all you have to do \nis maybe change the water every now and then and we have a little clean \nwater we can bathe the baby in again? These are sensible solutions, \nlike how I was raised, looking at how do you fix it?\n  I can assure you this: I have never fixed a problem by calling \nsomebody else a name. I have never chastised somebody for their \nbeliefs. I really have not. I have tried to think, OK, if I were in \ntheir shoes, how could we fix this?\n  When I was Governor, I used to sit down with people on the opposite \nside and think, OK, in the profession we are in--public service--how do \nI allow them to go home to save face? How do I allow them to have some \ncomfort that they are going to be able to bring constructive ideas to \nthe table that basically make it better? I have always thought of that.\n  So you are not going to hear me saying that we are right and they are \nwrong. In this case here, I will say: Please, don't have this self-\ninflicted pain on the people of my State of West Virginia or your State \nor this country. There could be a time when we might not be able to \nstop what might be happening. The market forces might push us in a \ndirection that we cannot control. This is something we can control, and \nall we are asking for--please, let government continue. If you want to \ntalk about a big, grand plan, which I hope we do, which is fixing the \nfinancial condition, getting our financial house in order, I have been \na big supporter of Bowles-Simpson. It is the only bipartisan package \nthat has been on the table since I have been here. There are an awful \nlot of things of which people say: Well, I don't like this, I don't \nlike that. None of them have said it is not what needs to be done. It \nis a three-pronged approach. That is the big fix we have talked about. \nBut we are not talking about any of that. We are talking about things \nwe do not like. We are talking about people we do not like. We are \ncalling people names. And it just does not fix things. It does not make \nit right. So you will hear me continue to talk about the grand bargain. \nThis is the time, between now and the debt ceiling.\n  I will say this about the debt ceiling: Raising the debt does not fix \nthe debt. We need to have a path to fix it. We should not be going \nthrough this political fight every 3, 6 months. This is the fifth time \nI have been in a debt ceiling debate. How many times have we voted on \nthe so-called ObamaCare? It is ridiculous to continue to fight the same \nfight over and over.\n  I hope we are in a reform or repair, and then repeal when you cannot \nfix it. When you have given it your all for the betterment of your \ncountry and it is just not fixable or doable, then you change. We have \nnot gotten there yet. We have all naysayers and people basically who \njust do not want change. I have too many people who need the services \nof government. I have too many people who depend on it--not that I \nbelieve people should be dependent. I hope people would be independent. \nBut government is so intertwined in all of our lives, and to just say \nyou want to stop it all is wrong.\n\n  So I would ask my dear friends and my colleagues on the Republican \nside to please think about a continuing resolution. Please. We have \ncome to the agreement on the number that you wanted of $986 billion. \nHealth care--if you wanted to bring up the Keystone Pipeline, I am a \ntotal supporter of the Keystone Pipeline for energy independence. I am \nan ``all energy'' person--use whatever we have. It is not the place for \nit. As much as I would like to see it, it is not the place for me to \ndraw the line to inflict so much pain on so many Americans, so many \nWest Virginians, just because of one issue I like or do not like. There \nis a time for that. There will be a time for this health\n\n[[Page S7115]]\n\ncare bill, ObamaCare. It will either succeed or fail on its own. But we \nought to try to make it better if we can. If we cannot, then come to \nthe conclusion we cannot, but do not shut down government because you \ndo not think it will work--or maybe you are afraid it will work. That \ncould be it too.\n  With all that being said, I say to my friends, you will never hear me \nsay anything derogatory about you. You can always reach across the \naisle to me. I am always going to sit down and talk to you. I am \nwilling to compromise and work on any issue that betters the position \nwe have, that betters the quality of life, that creates opportunities, \nthat makes us the strongest and most powerful Nation on Earth. I will \ncontinue to fight for that. But I am asking you for this time, do not \nallow this self-inflicted pain to continue. This is not fair to my \nState, it is not fair to the people of West Virginia, it is not fair to \nthe Presiding Officer's State of Wisconsin or to anybody in this great \ncountry of ours.\n  With that, Madam President, I say thank you for allowing me to say \nwhat has been on my mind. I am a proud American, and it is about this \ncountry first, and it is always going to be about this country first. \nIf the United States of America does well, I will guarantee you the \ngreat State of West Virginia is going to be just great, we are going to \ndo fine. But we have to work together and put our priorities in place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, first of all, I want to commend the words \nof my colleague from West Virginia about, first of all, the frustration \nthat so many Americans feel that we share and also his words about \ntrying to come to a resolution. I think it bears repeating.\n  The main purpose of my remarks today will be focused, really, on one \ncentral theme; that is, in the House right now Speaker Boehner could \nput a bill on the floor that would open the government after a House \nvote. I am holding in my hand the bill that would do that. This is the \nbill that passed on Friday. It is amendment No. 1974 to H.J. Res. 59. \nThis is the bill that, if the Speaker were to put it on the floor, \nwould pass overwhelmingly. But you would get not just one side of the \naisle, it would be a bipartisan vote to pass that bill, and upon \npassage, then, of course, getting the bill to the President for \nsignature. So within however long it takes for the House to complete a \nvote--a rule and maybe two votes--and then getting it to the President, \nthis could be over. And it should be over.\n  We should open the government. This is the way to do it--a bill that \ndoes not have anything attached to it. It just funds the government. I \nwould hope the Speaker at long last would put that bill on the floor. \nWe are hearing voices that are bipartisan today asking for the Speaker \nto do just that. We have also heard a lot of talk about negotiation and \ncompromise, and it is good that people are talking about that. But I \nhope some of our Republican friends talk about it with a degree of \nfaithfulness to the facts or add adherence to the facts about what has \nhappened over the last couple of months.\n  In an effort to reach an agreement that would avoid the shutdown--\ngoing back now a number of weeks and even months--Democrats here in the \nSenate and in the House as well accepted some of the very difficult so-\ncalled sequestration cuts. What do I mean by that? I mean the across-\nthe-board indiscriminate cuts that went into effect in 2013 and were, \nunfortunately, a carryover from a battle and a fight in the summer of \n2011. So we have accepted those difficult cuts in this budget \nnegotiation in the so-called continuing resolution--meaning the bill \nthat would keep the government operating, the one I just held up--as a \ncompromise. This happened a while back.\n  I mentioned that last Friday, September 27, the Senate passed the so-\ncalled clean continuing resolution, which is just a fancy way of saying \na budget bill without add-ons--nothing about any other issue, just a \nbill to fund the government. That bill--the one I referred to earlier \nthat passed the Senate on the 27th and is sitting over in the House--\nwould open the government and continue funding for the government until \nthe middle of November so we get past this crisis, we do not have this \nas a problem in the next debate about paying our bills, and we can have \na big debate in November about making sure we can pay for government \noperations.\n  What we should do as well, as we are debating in November--I hope we \ncan get there, but as we are debating that, we should figure out a \nway--this is a bipartisan concern--to shut off, to turn off at least \nfor 2 years the across-the-board cuts with which I think both parties \nhave real disagreement. But the key is passing this in the House, this \nmeasure that will end the crisis, open the government.\n  When we passed it here in the Senate, we accepted those levels of \nspending, which are significantly less than Democrats would have hoped \nfor, would have wanted. We accepted those despite the fact that we \nreversed the sequester in the budget we passed this spring. So we had a \nlong budget debate here and, some might remember, last spring voted \nwell into the early morning hours. I think our last vote was at 4 or 5 \nin the morning.\n  That was a higher number than we have agreed to already. So Democrats \nhave compromised substantially already on the spending level. That does \nnot seem to get reported very often. The bill that passed the Senate \nlast Friday is a $70 billion cut from the last fiscal year, 2013, the \nlevels that were enacted spending levels--enacted fiscal year 2013 \nbefore the across-the-board cuts went into effect.\n  To restate, this legislation which is in the House right now and they \ncould pass with overwhelming bipartisan support, and it would open the \ngovernment and end this crisis--they could do it this afternoon. They \ncould do it this evening. They could do it without a lot of trouble if \nthey put this bill on the floor. It does not mean all Republicans have \nto vote for it. The Speaker himself could vote against it. But putting \nit on the floor and having an up-or-down vote I think would be good for \neveryone.\n  It would end this crisis, open the government, and then we could \nbegin to work on what I think the American people want us working on. \nThey expect us to keep the government open. That is fundamental. But I \nthink they expect us as well to work on strategies to create jobs or at \nleast put into effect strategies that will lead to job creation.\n  I will say it again: This bill that is sitting in the House is not \njust a bill that will open the government, it will have overwhelming \nbipartisan support there. The bill is $70 billion less than what we \nwanted. To say that is a compromise is an understatement. On the main \nissue before us, how do you fund the government, how much in terms of \ndollars do you direct toward the operations of the government, we have \nalready compromised a long time ago to reduce that number by $70 \nbillion.\n  So when our friends are saying Democrats are not negotiating or \ncompromising, my goodness, we compromised on day 1. They prevailed in \nthat debate. We decided it is better to compromise in that number and \nkeep the government operating and move the process along in terms of \nthe budget, rather than shutting the government down to get our way.\n  Some Democrats may have said to us: You know what. You should have \ntaken this part and not accepted those cuts, and maybe even take it as \nfar as some Republicans want to take the debate on health care and shut \nthe government down. We said: That does not make any sense. It is bad \nfor the economy. It is bad for vulnerable people. It is bad for \nnational security and a whole host of other reasons which I will \nmention in a minute, to shut down the government.\n  So from the beginning, we were not only willing to compromise and \nnegotiate, we have already done it in a very substantial way on the \ncore issue, which is the budget and the number. For them to say: Well, \nwe are not going to insist that the government stay open, and then they \nwant to have some negotiation about that does not make a lot of sense, \ndoes it, when you consider the compromises we have already made?\n  I think the fundamental thing the American people want us to do is \nopen the government. The key to opening the government is not only \nsitting in\n\n[[Page S7116]]\n\nthe House, the key is already in the lock. All the Speaker has to do is \nturn it ever so slightly--turn that key. The turning of the key is this \nbill. If this bill goes on the floor of the House of Representatives \ntoday, tomorrow morning, tomorrow afternoon, tonight, whenever, it will \npass with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  I will come back to that in a moment. But I think the question of \ncompromise is, frankly, weighted to our side. I think we have already \nmade a substantial and significant compromise in the negotiation, and \nthat was done a long time ago. I think at this point, when it comes to \nthe question, some Members of the House have tried to do, to bring us \nto this point where there is a shutdown, I think their actions are, in \na word, irresponsible. I think a lot of Americans expect they would act \nin a more responsible manner. By pushing an agenda that has now led to \na government shutdown, in addition to being irresponsible or a \ndereliction of their duty, is also reckless.\n  This is a reckless step to take just to make a point about health \ncare, about anything else. There are a lot of us who would like to have \nour arguments litigated or debated in a way that gets a lot of \nattention paid to it. But to take it this far, where you are literally \nwilling to take an action which leads, as this has done, to a \ngovernment shutdown, is both irresponsible and reckless.\n  I think we are just beginning now, in these hours--and now \nunfortunately we are into the second day--we are now just beginning to \nunderstand the impact this is having on Americans. But in the case of \nPennsylvania, we are just beginning to hear the impact on individual \nPennsylvanians.\n  This morning I learned that Bushkill Outreach, a food pantry located \nin the Delaware Water Gap Recreational Area, is closed because it is on \nFederal land operated by the National Park Service.\n  When you close a national park area or a national park itself, you \nare not just impacting what happens there and the opportunity for \npeople to tour a national park or to recreate, you are actually having \nan adverse impact, in this case on a food pantry. This particular food \npantry, Bushkill Outreach, feeds 30 families per day, amounting to 120 \npeople per day and 1,200 people per month. Imagine that. You have a \ngroup of Members of Congress in Washington who believe their \nideological point of view on one issue is so compelling and so \nimportant to the country that they are willing to shut the government \ndown and deny those 30 families the opportunity to have the benefit of \na food pantry in a still tough economy.\n  We have had, fortunately, a lot of job growth over the last several \nyears. We are happy about that. We are happy that the economy is moving \nin the right direction on job growth. But it is not moving fast enough \nfor Pennsylvania. In this sense, we have hovered around half a million \npeople for too long. It was well above 500,000 people. Fortunately, it \ncame down below half a million. But it has begun to creep up again. \nOnce again, Pennsylvania has an unemployment number which is just at \nabout 501,000 people.\n  In my home area, northeastern Pennsylvania, we saw data today--\nunfortunately in my home county, Lackawanna County, and the county next \ndoor, Luzerne County, at least one, maybe two more, in that region of \nthe State, including the region where Bushkill Outreach is--the \nunemployment rate in several of those counties is more than 9 percent.\n  So there a food pantry is not just a place for people who are \nparticularly vulnerable; those are people who have been vulnerable, \nbecause of job loss, because of the economy. The shutdown has two \nadverse impacts on those families. It has a direct impact on their \nability to access food every day. That is horrific enough. Talk about \ndirect and substantial pain, physical pain on an individual or family. \nBut it also has another impact when they shut the government down, \ncertainly over a long period of time for sure--and this is \nirrefutable--you injure the national economy. When you injure the \nnational economy, you make it less likely that those people who have to \naccess food banks can actually get a job in northeastern Pennsylvania \nor anywhere else in the country.\n  This is about real life. This is not some Washington theoretical \ndebate. There are thousands of reasons to open up the government. I say \nto the Speaker of the House: Get this bill on the floor, and the food \npantry will no longer be adversely impacted. Our national security will \nno longer be adversely impacted if we can open the government up again. \nA lot of the folks who access this food bank are on fixed incomes, so \nit has a detrimental effect on them.\n  How about national security? The shutdown is having a direct and \nsubstantial impact on national security. Our colleague Senator \nFeinstein was on the floor yesterday and spoke of the critical impact \nthe shutdown is having on the intelligence community. As many Americans \nknow, intelligence gathering is not just the CIA, it is a whole range \nof agencies that gather intelligence which arms us with information to \nprotect ourselves and to be able to protect ourselves from terrorist \nthreats.\n\n  In the intelligence community, meaning all of the Federal agencies \nthat gather intelligence to protect us, 72 percent of the civilian work \nforce is furloughed. It is hard to comprehend the adverse impact of \nthat. This means the bulk of Federal employees who gather critical \nintelligence and work with law enforcement agencies are not working \nduring the shutdown.\n  You have to ask yourself at this point--if you are a Member of the \nHouse or the Senate who believes that the point you want to make on \nhealth care or anything else that has led to this shutdown--do you \nreally want to maintain that position, that your point is so important \nand so compelling that you are willing to allow a shutdown to take \nplace and to continue and allow the number I read, 72 percent of the \ncivilian workforce in the intelligence community, to be furloughed? It \nputs at risk our soldiers, the fighting men and women on battlefields \naround the world or in danger zones, it puts at risk our diplomatic \npersonnel, and at some level at some point in time puts Americans at \nrisk because you cannot stop terrorism. You cannot arm yourself against \nterrorist attacks unless you have information. You do not get the \ninformation unless you have the full means of intelligence gathering. \nSo I hope folks would ask themselves: Is my ideological point of view \non this or that issue important enough that we should have a government \nshutdown in place which injures our ability in gathering intelligence \nfor national security? I hope people would ask themselves that question \nand see what the answer would be.\n  I have also heard, when you tell people about the furloughs, I have \nheard some Republicans--not all, a few--make the argument that somehow \nthe President is making the decision about furloughs that adversely \nimpact national security and he is making a mistake when he does that, \nhe or his administration, or that maybe Members of Congress are somehow \npart of the decision on furloughs that would adversely impact national \nsecurity.\n  Look, every Member of Congress is exposed to intelligence. Every \nMember of Congress has an opportunity to take action on national \nsecurity and intelligence. Every Member of Congress has an opportunity \nto say things about decisions that impact national security. But I \nwould say this to my Republican friends: If the charge is the President \nand his administration are making decisions about furloughs that \nsomehow compromise our national security, if you are going to assert \nthat--you are free to do it; it is a free country--but if you are going \nto assert that, you should have proof. If you are going to make a \ncharge like that against any President, or, frankly, any Member of \nCongress, Democrat or Republican, you have got to have proof there. So \nI would hope the media--when someone makes that charge against the \nCommander in Chief, I would hope that Member of Congress would have in \ntheir hand the proof, a document, a statement, something they can put \non the table and say that is the proof. Because if you are going make a \ncharge which is that serious, in such a grave matter of national \nsecurity, you have got to prove it. If you cannot prove it, you should \nkeep your mouth shut and not make that charge. So I hope when people \nsay somehow this furlough number--I have heard people say: That is \nsupport personnel in the intel community; you really do not need those\n\n[[Page S7117]]\n\nfolks. If you are going to contest the number and say our national \nsecurity is okay during the furlough, during a shutdown, you have got \nto prove it.\n  A lot of things people say in Washington are part of the political \ndebate, but if one is going to accuse someone of taking an action that \nwould undermine national security, one should have to prove it.\n  Why do I say that? I spent 6\\1/2\\ years on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I have traveled to the Middle East several times, to \nPakistan three times, to Afghanistan three times, and to Iraq twice. In \nregions of the world where our national security interests are directly \nat stake, we have personnel--either uniformed or diplomatic personnel. \nI have seen directly how much people can be at risk at those postings \nin embassies, consulates, and how dependent they are on having marines \nor literally soldiers to protect the embassy or a consulate, but how \ndependent they are on good intelligence.\n  There are a lot of reasons to open the government. There are a lot of \nreasons for the House to vote on this today and open the government, \nbut there are few as compelling as national security and intelligence.\n  I wish to go through a list of impacts that the shutdown is having.\n  We know that the shutdown has an impact on small businesses. Why do \nwe know that? Well, the SBA on a weekly basis provides help to many \nsmall businesses across the country. We know that more than 1,000 \nbusinesses a week could see their critical financial support deferred \nuntil the government opens again. It is bad for small business for the \ngovernment to be shut down.\n  A shutdown would end nutrition support for pregnant women and \nchildren, the Women, Infants and Children Program, WIC. WIC is the \nacronym we frequently hear. It is a great program. In the event of a \nshutdown such as we are living through now, WIC will only be able to \ncontinue serving participants for 1 week. We are in day 2 of the \nshutdown. After 1 week, they would have to stop serving participants.\n  What are the numbers here? The basic numbers from fiscal year 2012 \nare that the average monthly participation totaled more than 8.9 \nmillion people. Of that 8.9 million, 4.7 million are children and 2.1 \nmillion are infants. This is another good reason to pass this bill in \nthe House today with a quick vote. It would be overwhelmingly \nbipartisan. In addition to national security and intelligence, this \nwould make sure that the WIC Program will serve people who need it.\n  A government shutdown would compromise public health. Why do I say \nthat? In the shutdown, 70 percent of NIH employees would be furloughed. \nThis is the National Institutes of Health which does research on all \nkinds of diseases and ailments. It is the envy of the world. No other \ncountry in the world has anything equivalent to the National Institutes \nof Health, but a shutdown will lead to the furlough of 70 percent of \ntheir employees. That is another reason.\n  As we heard on the news this morning, there is a lot of reporting \nabout the Centers for Disease Control. It is also adversely affected in \nthe shutdown.\n  A shutdown also compromises school readiness for young children. A \ngovernment shutdown delays funding for 22 Head Start providers across \nthe country, jeopardizing early childhood education care for the 18,000 \nchildren and families those programs serve. We are speaking about 22 \nproviders for Head Start not being able to provide services for 18,000 \nchildren and families.\n  Finally, a shutdown endangers benefits owed to our veterans. The \nVeterans' Administration will run out of money to pay mandatory \nbenefits for existing beneficiaries by the end of this month. I know we \nhave heard people saying: Well, this check or that check will not be \nstopped. Ultimately, there is going to be a direct impact if the \nshutdown is continuous.\n  I would say to our friends in the House they can take action right \nnow to prevent this from happening. How may they do that? It is very \nsimple. All they need to do is take the bill sitting there and put it \non floor. A lot of people can vote against it, but the vote for it \nwould be overwhelming.\n  If Speaker Boehner puts that on the floor today, tonight or \ntomorrow--he should do it tonight--we can be beyond this. According to \na new report in the National Review there are potentially more than 100 \nHouse Republicans who would be open to a so-called clean CR. When we \nhear that, this is a clean bill to fund the government. It doesn't have \nanything attached to it. It includes the $70 billion compromise \nDemocrats have already agreed to by reducing the overall cost of the \nfunding of the government.\n  I hope we could end the shutdown today by having the House adopt this \nlegislation. I urge the Speaker to put the bill on floor for a vote in \nthe House today.\n  I wish to conclude with some separate remarks related to the \nshutdown, but they are also related, unfortunately, to a lot of other \nbudget items. I wanted to do this the other day and want to put it on \nthe record.\n  In addition to everything else I have spoken about, during the \nshutdown over 30,000 correctional officers in our Federal prisons \nreport to work not knowing when they will receive their next paycheck. \nThese are officers who put their lives at risk every day and deserve to \nknow when they will be paid. During the last shutdown in the \nmidnineties, some guards went well over a month without being paid. \nThese men and women are literally putting their lives on the line every \nday. Yesterday, I was scheduled to be at an event with a number of \nfamilies who have been directly impacted by the violence that is \nperpetrated against corrections officers, but I couldn't be there \nbecause it was at the same time as our 9:30 vote on the budget trying \nto reverse the shutdown.\n  I was supposed to meet with Don and Jean Williams, the parents of \nEric Williams, who lost his life as a corrections officer. Officer \nWilliams lost his life performing his duties at a U.S. penitentiary in \nnortheastern Pennsylvania, my home area. I was able to meet his parents \nbriefly at his viewing. That is real life for the Williams family.\n  Unfortunately, they were not the only family represented at the event \nyesterday. There were several other families who had lost loved ones in \nthat way.\n  I am not sure I had a full appreciation for this before I was elected \nto the Senate. We have corrections officers in Pennsylvania in our \nState system. I had some exposure to their work, but it wasn't until I \nspent a lot of time talking to corrections officers at the Federal \nlevel that I learned the gravity of this problem. It is a problem with \nmultiple elements.\n  One, of course, is an erosion of support for corrections officers \nover time, so that over time the ratio of one corrections officer to \ninmates has grown. To say they have grown to dangerous proportions is \nan understatement.\n  One of the reasons Officer Williams lost his life is because often \nthese officers are in situations where they are outnumbered, sometimes \nby hundreds of inmates. They, of course, can't carry a weapon. The \ntragedy officer Eric Williams suffered, and the tragedy others have \nsuffered, serves as a stark reminder of the risks that corrections \nofficers and staff face every day.\n  Budget cuts over time, with across-the-board-cuts from sequestration, \nplus a shutdown leads to a very dangerous situation for corrections \nofficers. We need to address their concerns and these issues as part of \nthis overall debate about the budget.\n  In conclusion, I reiterate that I hope the House will take up the \nbill that can end this crisis and open the government.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today we continue to find ourselves in \nthe unfortunate position of a partial government shutdown. Following a \nveto threat from the President, last night Democrats in the House of \nRepresentatives killed three spending bills that would have funded \nparks and monuments, veterans programs, and the DC government. Senate \nDemocrats have already rejected four House-passed proposals that would \nhave provided Americans with relief from ObamaCare while\n\n[[Page S7118]]\n\nensuring that government operations continued. Senate Democrats even \nrejected one proposal that would have sent the two Chambers to \nconference--the House and Senate--to work out some sort of a solution \nto this standoff we find ourselves in, but they haven't even been \nwilling to talk. In fact, when that request from the House came to the \nSenate to create a conference that would allow the House and Senate to \ncome together to try to find a solution, it was tabled. It was soundly \nrejected--tabled--by the Democrats here in the Senate.\n  So we are continuing in this holding pattern as the House continues \nto send proposals over and they continue to be rejected by the Senate, \nwith Senate Democrats not even wanting to sit down and talk with the \nHouse about how we might resolve this.\n  I am happy to hear the President has, after a week of essentially \nignoring congressional Republicans, called the leaders to the White \nHouse tonight. I am a little confused, however, about the purpose of \nthe meeting, as the White House continues to say they are not going to \nnegotiate. I hope the President does change his mind on that, that he \nis evolving on it, and that he will at this meeting express a \nwillingness to work with Republicans because it really is important for \nthe President to be engaged in this process.\n  I can't imagine a scenario where we have consequences such as these, \nwith a continuing funding resolution still not approved, a partial \ngovernment shutdown, a debt limit coming up in the middle of the month, \nand the President essentially saying: I am not going to negotiate. I am \nnot going to negotiate on any of this.\n  I think that is a position that is completely unreasonable, and I \nthink the American people find it to be completely unreasonable as \nwell.\n  In the meantime, we have an opportunity now to address some of the \nconcerns that have been raised by people about various parts of our \ngovernment that as a result of this unnecessary shutdown are not open. \nSo Republicans continue to try to work to open government and at the \nsame time to provide ObamaCare fairness for all.\n  I have said this before, but I get the sense some of our colleagues \non the Democratic side and the President seem to be content with \nshutting down the government. Well, we Republicans are not. We are \nconsistently trying to come up with solutions.\n  The House of Representatives will be meeting today, and they are \ngoing to be voting again on some of the same proposals that were voted \ndown last night by House Democrats. They are commonsense spending bills \nthat would ensure that important functions of government can resume. \nThese bills would ensure that benefits for our Nation's veterans \ncontinue uninterrupted, they would allow our members of the National \nGuard and Reserve to be paid, and they would provide funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health to ensure this senseless shutdown does \nnot prevent patients from receiving lifesaving treatments.\n  I will explain briefly what some of these bills would do that are \ngoing to be coming over later today from the House of Representatives \nto the Senate, where, at least to date, none of the proposals that have \nbeen advanced by the House of Representatives have been accepted here \nin the Senate. They have been tabled by the majority leader. That is \nunfortunate because it is the essence of what the American people \nbelieve we ought to be doing, which is working together, coming \ntogether to find a solution to some of these big problems. \nUnfortunately, as I said before, when the request came over to go to \nconference with the House, that was tabled as well. So there has been \nno discussion, no willingness to talk, no willingness to think and \ncooperate in a way that would help us get the fundamental operations of \ngovernment up and running again.\n  Anyway, these bills are going to come over from the House today, and \nthey follow, as I said, the same track they tried to get approved last \nnight. One deals with the availability through the annual \nappropriations process of the Department of Veterans Affairs to \ncontinue to serve veterans--namely, veterans' disability payments, the \nGI bill, education and training, and VA home loans--under the same \nconditions that were in effect at the end of the just-completed fiscal \nyear. In other words, it would take all those programs that benefit \nveterans and make sure they continue uninterrupted and are funded just \nas they were at the end of the fiscal year until such time as Congress \ncan come up with a longer term solution. That might be an \nappropriations bill--which, frankly, should have been passed much \nearlier this year and wasn't because none of the appropriations bills \nwere moved here in the Senate--or another temporary funding measure, \nsuch as a continuing resolution, that is put forward. A similar \nproposal was introduced by a number of Senate Democrats. So when it \ncomes over from the House of Representatives today, I hope we will have \nbroad bipartisan support in the Senate for making sure veterans \nprograms are continued and are funded.\n  There is also going to be a bill coming over that deals with national \nparks and museums, and it would provide immediate funding for National \nPark Service operations, the Smithsonian, the National Gallery of Art, \nand the U.S. Holocaust Museum at the same rate and under the same \nconditions as were in effect at the end of the just-completed fiscal \nyear. So the same thing I mentioned with regard to the veterans \nprograms--these functions of government would be funded at the same \nlevel they were at the end of the year we just completed until such \ntime as an appropriations bill is passed or a temporary funding measure \nis put in place.\n  That was something the House voted on yesterday, and it was defeated. \nI shouldn't say Democrats universally defeated it, but almost so when \nthat measure was brought up yesterday. Hopefully, today they will get a \ndifferent outcome in the House. I think they will, and it will come \nover to the Senate.\n  Another bill the House will move today will provide for the immediate \navailability of local funds--which are subject to the control of \nCongress through the annual appropriations process--for the District of \nColumbia, again under the same conditions as were in effect at the end \nof the just-completed fiscal year.\n  Finally, there will be a bill that comes over from the House that \nprovides funding for the pay and allowances of military personnel in \nthe reserve component who are in active status. So it will fund the \nGuard and Reserve. Those funds would be made available at the same \nlevel as the just completed fiscal year until such time as Congress \ntakes more formal action.\n  Finally, there will be a fifth bill coming from the House that will \nprovide immediate funding for the National Institutes of Health at the \nsame rate and under the same conditions as in effect at the end of the \njust completed fiscal year. So the important work done by the National \nInstitutes of Health will continue--if the bill is enacted here in the \nSenate--and go on even in the midst of a partial shutdown.\n  What I am saying is Republicans are trying to address all of these \nconcerns that we have about various elements of our government that are \nnot functioning today because of this partial shutdown. Last night they \nwere met with resistance in the House of Representatives and they were \nvoted down by Democrats. We are hoping for and I think we will have a \ndifferent outcome today in the House of Representatives, at which point \nthose bills will come here to the Senate.\n  So if the Senate is interested in going on the record and making sure \nthere is funding available for veterans programs, for the museums and \nour monuments, for our Guard and Reserve, for the National Institutes \nof Health, and for the District of Columbia--which is under the \njurisdiction of the Congress when it comes to funding--the Senate \nshould vote affirmatively and actually ensure that those important \nfunctions of our government are addressed and funded.\n  What I am simply saying is that time and time again the House of \nRepresentatives has sent to the Senate legislation--measures--that \nwould continue to fund the government, and in earlier cases when they \ncame over here addressed what I think the American people have said \nthey want to see addressed in ObamaCare.\n  The President of the United States has granted a 1-year delay to \nemployers in this country from the employer mandate. So essentially he \ngave a\n\n[[Page S7119]]\n\ndelay--a waiver--to big business. The House of Representatives in one \nof the bills they sent to the Senate said we ought to in fairness give \nthe same break to individuals. There is an individual mandate in the \nObamaCare law that kicks in, and we ought to be able to give \nindividuals in this country the same treatment that we give to big \nbusinesses. So as a matter of fairness that was proposed by the House \nof Representatives.\n  When that bill came over, it also included a provision that would \nensure that Members of Congress and their staffs and the staffs at the \nPresident's office and in the executive branch of the government are \nall subject to the same law and to the same provisions--that the \nObamaCare law is applied in the same way as to other Americans. So we \nhad a 1-year delay--a temporary relief from the individual mandate--\nincluded in that, and a provision that ensured that those of us here \nand our staffs and members of the executive branch are treated the same \nway as are other Americans. That too was tabled in the Senate.\n  It strikes me that as we think about the impact of this law, we ought \nto ensure that middle-class Americans deserve the same relief that the \nPresident and Democrats here in the Senate have already given to \nMembers of Congress and to their staffs, as well as to big businesses \nin this country.\n  We had an opportunity to do that the other night. That was rejected \nby the Senate. I think the question that every American ought to be \nasking is, Why wouldn't Democratic Senators give the same break to the \nAmerican people that big businesses have received? I would again argue \nthis is an issue of basic fairness. We think it ought to be delayed for \nall Americans, not just for the favored few.\n  There is bipartisan support for this. I mentioned before that we have \na Democratic Senator in the Senate who has said a delay in the \nindividual mandate is a very reasonable and sensible approach. I hope \nat some point that view will start to spread to others, and we will be \nable to actually provide some relief to the American people from the \nharmful effects of ObamaCare.\n  But at least while we are in this period, as this continues to be \ndiscussed and hopefully, eventually a solution reached, we ought to be \nprotecting those Americans who are being hit by the shutdown.\n  When these bills come over from the House of Representatives today, I \nhope the Senate will pick them up quickly and act on them.\n  We had an example or incident yesterday where a number of World War \nII veterans came here to Washington, DC, as Honor Flight guests. This \nis an organization that brings World War II veterans here to see their \nmonument--the World War II monument--here in Washington, and they \ncouldn't get access to it because of the shutdown. That should be \nunacceptable to every American. We need to ensure that never happens \nagain.\n  There was even reporting that they had made a request of the \nadministration to be able to go there and they were turned down. I \ncan't imagine turning down a group of World War II veterans who simply \nwanted to see and have access to the very memorial for which they \nfought and defended our country.\n  So those are the types of things that action taken by the Senate here \ncould prevent, if in fact when these bills come over from the House of \nRepresentatives the Senate will act in an expeditious way, pick up \nthose bills and pass them, so we can ensure that people have access to \nthose types of monuments and memorials. We can ensure that veterans \nprograms continue to be funded and operational. We can ensure the \nNational Institutes of Health and the important work that it does \ncontinues, and we can ensure that our National Guard and Reserve also \nare funded through this time. It strikes me that is a very commonsense \nway to approach the situation in which we find ourselves today.\n  I hope that at the end of the day we can come to some resolution that \nwould allow the government to be funded on a more sustainable basis. I \nthink when we continue to do these things on a short-term basis, it is \nnot a good way to govern a country as large as ours. We can do better. \nThe American people deserve better. But at least, at a minimum, until \nwe get that broader issue resolved, we ought to work and ensure that \nveterans and members of the Guard and Reserve, people who are visiting \nour country wanting to see the memorials and museums and that sort of \nthing have the opportunity to do that. We can do that today by picking \nup and passing the bills coming over from the House of Representatives.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me review where we are.\n  Listening to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle talk about the \neffects of a government shutdown, I will admit I am pretty sensitive \nabout this. My State of Maryland that I have the honor of representing \nis home to 286,000 Federal workers--124,000 furloughed today. We have \n172,000 Federal workers who work in the State of Maryland. So I am very \nmuch aware of what the consequences of this government shutdown have \nbeen to our local economy. But let me review where we are, because I am \none who wants to get together and get government open as quickly as \npossible. I hope we can reach agreements and move forward, pay our \nbills, get rid of sequestration, and get a budget that makes sense. But \nlet me just review how we got to this point, because it has been 6 \nmonths since the Senate passed a budget. That is the blueprint for our \ncommittees to work.\n  The House passed a budget, which was different than the Senate \nbudget. Then it was important for both sides to negotiate well before \nOctober 1 to get a budget we could agree on so we could pass the \nappropriations bills. But one party--and one party alone--refused to \nmeet. That was the Republican Party. They refused to meet.\n  Then we got to October 1. This is not the first time in American \nhistory that Congress hasn't been able to pass appropriations bills by \nOctober 1. It happens too frequently. But what we do if we can't reach \nagreement is that we keep government open while we continue at last \nyear's funding level. That is called a continuing resolution. That is \nwhat this body did. We passed a continuing resolution so the government \nwould stay open at the funding level the Republicans wanted. We didn't \nwant to get into that fight because of the importance of keeping \ngovernment open.\n  Then we had the votes to pass that. We passed it here. We had the \nvotes in the other body. But for one person--the Speaker of the House--\nnot bringing that up for a vote in the House of Representatives where \nwe could have had a bipartisan majority--the government shut down at \nmidnight on September 30.\n  I know people say it is a Democrat speaking or a Republican speaking. \nSo let me read from the Baltimore Sun today and what they said about \nthe negotiations.\n\n       It would be tempting, of course, to write that this \n     impasse--the inability to agree on a continuing resolution to \n     fund government past the end of the fiscal year--was the \n     fault of Democrats and Republicans alike. But that would be \n     like blaming the hostages for causing the perpetrator to put \n     a gun to their heads. As President Barack Obama noted, he and \n     Congressional Democrats put forward no agenda other than \n     keeping the government operating temporarily at current \n     levels.\n       House Republicans set conditions, not Senate Democrats. \n     It's not even clear how many in the GOP truly wanted this to \n     happen. Conventional wisdom is that a so-called ``clean'' \n     resolution funding government would have passed on a \n     bipartisan vote if it had been allowed on the floor by House \n     Speaker John Boehner--\n\n  The editorial goes on and I continue to quote.\n\n       Do House leaders think they can push the blame on President \n     Obama? Some have already tried, but it sounds suspiciously \n     like shoplifters blaming store owners for having so much \n     tempting merchandise lying about. National polls show the \n     public isn't buying it--most Americans didn't want the \n     government to shutter over ObamaCare, and Congressional \n     Republicans have a double-digit lead over the White House \n     when it comes to the public's choice for who most deserves \n     the most blame.\n       Even the unusual anti-government crowd can't find much \n     comfort in this, as sending federal workers home isn't saving \n     anybody any money. The last time the federal government had \n     an extended shutdown--for 21 days in late 1995 to early \n     1996--it cost something on the order of $2 billion. What an \n     extraordinary waste of money, particularly at a time when \n     conservatives claim to be worried about the deficit.\n\n\n[[Page S7120]]\n\n\n  So it is hard to negotiate when one side has put on the table where \nwe should be--allowing government to stay open using last year's \nnumbers--and the other side brings in issues that are totally unrelated \nto the continuation of government.\n  Having said that, we have got to find a way to get government open. I \nam pleased the President is meeting with the leaders this afternoon. I \nam pleased they are also talking about making sure we pay our bills, \nwhich is at jeopardy in just 2 weeks.\n  I mentioned earlier that I am a little sensitive about this because \nof the impact it has on the economy of my State. It has an impact on \nthe entire country. In my State, it is $15 million a day in revenue \nthat we lose directly as a result of the government shutdown. It has \nbeen estimated by Moody's Brian Kessler that if the shutdown went 3-4 \nweeks, it would cost our economy $55 billion. This is no small impact \non our economy. It is a major impact on our economy.\n  It is not just Federal workers who aren't going to get paychecks. It \nis the shop owners who depend on business that is going to be cut back. \nIt is contractors who depend on the contracts being honored by the \nFederal Government, and the list goes on and on of the impact it has on \nour economy. As I quoted from the Sun paper, it is the taxpayers who \nwill pick up the tab. They are not going to save any money. It is going \nto cost them money--not a few bucks. It is going to cost a lot of \nmoney. And every day we wait, it costs the taxpayers of this country \nmore money. So we are interested in dealing with the deficit and \nkeeping government operating. It is a huge waste of resources to shut \ndown the government.\n  We are going to lose some vital services. Earlier today I held a \nconference with Senator Mikulski, Senator Warren, and Senator Boxer \nwhere we went over some of the real impacts that occur, and we were \njoined by Federal workers that wanted to be at work, doing service to \nthis country, but because of the government shutdown they were \nfurloughed.\n  This is not the first attack against Federal workers we have seen. We \nhave seen freezes on their budgets in the last couple of years. We have \nseen them furloughed as a result of sequestration. We have seen freezes \non hiring so they are asked to do more with less. We have the fewest \nworkers per capita in modern history, asked to do more work. Let me \nrelate some of the stories, some of the accounts by people who came to \nWashington today so their stories can be told.\n  Marcelo Del Canto works for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration. He works in Rockville. He lives in \nPoolesville, MD. He has been a Federal employee for 8 years. He does \nvital work to help prevent substance abuse. He has work on his desk \nthat he could do today to help keep people healthier. Instead, he is \nfurloughed, sitting at home--can't go in to work.\n  We heard from Amy Fritz, a meteorologist and physical oceanographer \nat the National Weather Service. She works in Silver Spring, MD. I have \nbeen there. This is the agency that tracks the storms. Thank goodness \nwe had reliable information about Hurricane Sandy. That work was done \nnot on the weather channel, it was done by Federal public servants. Amy \nhas a double degree. She is a national expert in this area.\n  Do you know what she said today? ``How do I know we should not be \ntracking a storm right now, getting additional information to keep our \ncountry safe?'' That is what is at stake. We have seen incredible \nweather episodes of late. Every person should be on board, doing their \nwork. NOAA had to furlough, same as a layoff, 55 percent of their \nworkforce, 6,633 employees furloughed as a result of the government \nshutdown.\n  We heard from Carter Kimsey. She works for the National Science \nFoundation. She has been there since 1976. She works with young people, \ngetting them involved with science, awarding grants for the basic \nresearch that is critically important for economic growth and this \ncountry's competitiveness. She tells us she has work on her desk that \nis critically important to young people continuing in science. She \ncan't work today because of the government shutdown. That is going to \naffect America's competitiveness. We are going to lose scientists. We \nare going to lose a great deal as a result of government being shut \ndown.\n  I heard from Steve Hopkins, Office of Pesticide Programs at the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. EPA had to furlough 94 percent of \ntheir workers; 15,181 workers were furloughed at EPA. What is he not \ndoing today that he could have been doing? Helping keep our environment \nsafe from the overuse of pesticides, making it a little bit safer for \nour children as they breathe the air and drink the water of this \ncountry. That is what is at jeopardy here.\n  I could tell you about their individual stories. When I talked to \nMarcelo Del Canto, he told me he recently purchased a home in \nPoolesville, MD. We are happy about that. But he has a mortgage \npayment. He is married. I asked how is his spouse doing? She is also \nfurloughed. How are they going to make their mortgage payment?\n  Carter Kimsey was telling us about the ethics they use in scientific \nexperiments. She talked about how they treat the animals they use. She \nsaid: You know, we make sure they get the resources necessary. They are \nfed, they are taken care of. How about our Federal workers? Shouldn't \nthey have their paycheck to pay their food bills?\n  This is outrageous as far as being wasteful, as far as being against \neconomic growth in this country, but it is also wrong. It is wrong to \nthe people who have been victimized by this, who do not know if they \nare going to get a paycheck. We have people working who do not know if \nthey are going to get paid. We have people who are not working who do \nnot know they are going to get the money to pay their bills. Where is \nthe empathy here for what you are doing? This is outrageous.\n  My colleagues already talked about the National Institutes of Health \nlocated in Maryland; 73 percent of their employees are furloughed. Do \nyou know what they do? Just the most incredible research in the world \nso we can stay healthy, we can find out the mysteries of incredible \ndiseases. They are working on a vaccine now to deal with influenza to \nsave millions of lives, and what do we do? Tell them to go home and not \nwork? This is not a game. We are affecting people's lives by what we \nare doing here.\n  Two hundred patients will be denied care this week at NIH as a result \nof the shutdown. Who knows for one of those individuals whether it is a \nquestion of life or death? That is what is involved.\n  At the FDA, 45 percent of their employees are furloughed. They will \nnot be able to conduct the inspections for the compliance and \nenforcement of our food laws, our food safety laws.\n  At the Department of Interior, 81 percent of their employees are \nfurloughed. What an embarrassment.\n  I was talking to a reporter from another country.\n  What an embarrassment, the iconic national parks of America are \nclosed, but it also affects the businesses all around those parks as \nwell as inconveniencing the public.\n  At the Small Business Administration, two-thirds of their employees \nare furloughed. Suppose you are a small business person depending on a \nloan. You do not have the officer there to process that loan. What do \nyou do?\n  The list goes on and on. I could go through every agency. There is \nonly one answer to this: Keep government--not one agency, two agencies, \nthree agencies--keep every agency open. That is the responsible thing \nfor us to do. We should do that. We should make sure we pay our bills, \nand yes, we should negotiate a balanced way to move forward with a \nbudget.\n  I have been talking on the floor many times about that. There is a \ngive and take that we have to make on the budget moving forward. We \nhave to balance our books. We need the revenues necessary to do it. We \nhave to look at all spending, not just discretionary domestic spending. \nWe have to look at all spending. We have to do that in a bipartisan \nmanner because, guess what, the Republicans do not control the House, \nthe Senate, and the White House, and the Democrats do not control the \nHouse.\n  The public expects us to work together on a budget. That is not what \nthis debate is about. This debate is\n\n[[Page S7121]]\n\nabout whether we are going to keep government open, whether we are \ngoing to pay our bills. We must do that for the sake of the people of \nthis country.\n  I want to mention one other issue. I filed yesterday legislation with \nmany of my colleagues to make it clear that those Federal workers who \nare furloughed, we are going to fight to do what we did in the 1990s \nwhen we went on government shutdown, and pay all Federal workers. They \nare innocent. They should be made whole. My legislation is cosponsored \nby many of my colleagues. We have bipartisan support in the House of \nRepresentatives. We have to make sure we get that bill passed so every \nFederal worker is made whole as a result of this shutdown that is not \ntheir fault.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Wow, I think we are growing weary. I think we are \ngrowing weary of the gridlock, deadlock, and hammer lock on our \ngovernment. I think we are growing weary of the partisan posturing by \none faction in one party in one House. The American people want us to \nreopen government so that the government can meet the national security \nneeds of the United States, protect the safety of the people of the \nUnited States, meet compelling human needs, and do what we can to \ncreate jobs today, such as physical infrastructure, and to lay the \ngroundwork for jobs tomorrow by investing in research and development.\n  The American people want a government that works as hard as they do, \nand so do I. Instead of working hard to serve our veterans or our \nelderly or promoting a growing economy, we are dealing with the \nshutdown of the government.\n  The House is sending us bills which on first blush seem attractive. I \nmean, who doesn't support our National Guard? Who doesn't want to fund \nNIH? I certainly do. NIH is located in my State. I am so proud of the \nmen and women who work there. Funding also goes to great State \nuniversities doing research, such as the University of Wisconsin. They \nare out there doing it. We cannot cherry-pick. What they are doing now \nis a public relations ploy.\n  The House wants to send us cherry-picked solutions to the shutdown \nproblem. It is contrived, and it is cynical. What I am asking the House \nof Representatives to do is take up the Senate bill we sent them that \nis a clean continued funding resolution. What does clean mean? It means \nit is stripped of politically motivated ideological riders.\n  The second thing is it would fund the government for 6 weeks. In that \n6 weeks, it would give us the chance to work out what our funding \nshould be for the rest of the year. I would hope we could find a way to \ncancel the sequester, which is to reduce public debt without reducing \njobs or opportunity, and get us through the debt ceiling. Please--that \nbill is pending in the House now, and I ask that they do that instead \nof sending us these piecemeal solutions.\n  I remind my colleagues that the continuing funding resolution passed \nthe Senate last Friday. It reopens the government, and it gives us the \nopportunity to renegotiate. I am willing to negotiate, but we can't \ncapitulate to these partisan demands to defund ObamaCare and do other \nkinds of riders that work against us. To move forward, we need to pass \nthe Senate continuing resolution.\n  I understand that later today the President is meeting with Speaker \nBoehner, Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Reid, and Senator McConnell. I \nhope that wiser heads will now prevail so we can get a path forward to \nreopen all of government, not just cherry-picked items--many of which \nare absolutely desirable--and open the entire Federal Government.\n  I know that the House wants to send something over to reopen NIH. Of \ncourse. That's what I just said. But what about the Centers for Disease \nControl? So we open NIH, but we don't open the Centers for Disease \nControl. It is an agency that is located in Atlanta, but it is part of \nour public health triad, which is the work at NIH, the work of the Food \nand Drug Administration, which stands sentry over the safety of our \nfood supply and the safety and efficacy of our drugs and medical \ndevices, and then there is the Centers for Disease Control, which is \ndown in Atlanta.\n  Right this very minute in Atlanta, GA, at the Centers for Disease \nControl, close to 9,000 people have been furloughed. Furlough is just a \nnice word that means layoff. It also means that it not only affects the \nlabs in Atlanta, but it also affects labs in Colorado, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, and West Virginia.\n  The work of the CDC is also nationwide because they are our \nbiosurveillance system on infectious diseases. That means that State \nhealth departments--all 50 States and the territories--depend on the \nCenters for Disease Control to track and give them information on what \nthe trends are related to infectious diseases. They are the ones who \nalert clinicians and pediatricians if there is a new kind of ear \ninfection that could infect children. But because of the government \nshutdown, there is no one there who can do this.\n  Earlier this year--to give an example--Hepatitis A sickened 162 \npeople in 10 States. The CDC linked the outbreak to pomegranate seeds \ncoming in from a foreign country in a frozen berry mix. We were able to \ngo right to the private sector. They complied with us right away, and \nwe were able to get that off the market and contain this so it wouldn't \nspread to other people. They worked with the private sector in order to \nprotect the American people.\n  Don't we want to reopen CDC? I could go over disease after disease \nand infection after infection which will not monitored. Let's take the \ncommon one, flu. We have all had the sniffles, but the sniffles can \nalso kill people. On average more 200,000 Americans will be \nhospitalized because of flu and 3,000 Americans die from flu. Vaccines \ncan prevent the flu.\n  The CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, were out there making sure \nthere was enough vaccine available, that it was being distributed \nfairly and equitably in the United States, but also watching the \ninfection trends because if a trend was heading to one State or one \nlocale, the public health people could work together in order to \naccelerate or expand our flu vaccine. This is what they do.\n  Did you also know that there are disease detectives? Many people \ndon't know that there are disease detectives. So what does Senator Barb \nmean when she says this?\n  Sometimes there is an outbreak and people get sick. People even die. \nThey wonder what it is. They dial 911, and there is a group of people \nwho are like a disease identification SWAT team. They work with the \nbest and brightest at that State level, use the best technology in \nscience from our country, and even around the world, to identify what \nthat is. That is how we found out about Legionnaires' disease, and the \nHantavirus disease which affected Indian reservations. That is how we\n\n[[Page S7122]]\n\njumped in on the pomegranate seed situation. They get right in there. \nBut you know what. Those people were furloughed. What is this?\n\n  Do I want to reopen NIH? I absolutely do, but I am going to talk \nabout the Centers for Disease Control. I could also talk about other \nFederal employees and what shutting down means. It obviously isn't just \npublic health.\n  I believe in Social Security. I really do. It has meant so much to so \nmany people. It is one of the great earned benefits in our country. I \nwant to make sure there is no false alarm here: Social Security checks \nwill go out. However, as of this week, the people who work at Social \nSecurity, those who oversee eligibility benefits for the elderly and \ndisability benefits for those who are unable to work, have been \nfurloughed. Over the entire United States of America, Social Security \nhas furloughed--there are 18,000 people who work in Social Security \noffices in local communities that were furloughed.\n  Social Security is everywhere. They provide access for the American \npeople to apply for their Social Security, to apply for disability \nbenefits, and also to apply for their Medicare--18,000 people. Social \nSecurity is headquartered in Maryland. This isn't because it is in \nMaryland. I know these workers. I know the exams they take to qualify \nto work for Social Security--whether it is a claims representative or \nan actuary predicting the trends. Those 18,000 people were proud to \nwork for Social Security and make sure that one of the greatest social \ninsurance programs ever was administered efficiently, effectively, and \nthat the people who were eligible got what they earned.\n  Did you know that the overhead for running Social Security is less \nthan 2 percent? It is lower than any private insurance company in \nAmerica. Gosh. So they do it well and they do it smartly. They have \nbeen stretched because of sequester, but they are there. Right now, \nbecause of what we have been doing, we are only going to further delay \nthese other benefits. So I want to open the doors of Social Security. \nWhen people apply, they want to be sure help is there. When people \ndial, they want people to be there.\n\n  That is all, by the way, coming back to NIH and what they want to \nsend over from the House. It is in the Labor-HHS appropriations. That \nis under my very able subcommittee chairman, Senator Tom Harkin.\n  Senator Harkin has worked very hard on his bill to make sure we meet \nthe needs but we do it in a way that is cost-efficient. Did my \ncolleagues know that because of parliamentary obstructionism, Senator \nHarkin has not been able to bring his bill to the floor since 2007--\n2007, year after year, hearing after hearing. When he wanted to bring \nup the funding for the Department of HHS, which these agencies are in--\nEducation, as well as the Department of Labor, which has things such as \nmining safety in it--he could not even bring it to the floor because \nthey would not let him or it would be filibustered.\n  While everybody over there is strutting around saying we are going to \nfund NIH, after we shamed them into it yesterday, what they don't tell \nus is they can't move the Labor-HHS bill in the House. Do we know why? \nBecause they fund it at $122 billion. Do we know what level that is? \nThat is the 2003 level. It is not even the 2012 level or the 2010 \nlevel. They want to fund it back to George Bush and right around the \nfunding level of 2003. They want to take us back a decade. They want to \ntake us back to the Dark Ages. Well, not in the Senate.\n  Senator Harkin wanted to come to the floor with funding at $164 \nbillion, a slight increase from last year. There is a 42-percent \ndifference between the House and the Senate Labor-HHS bill: $164 \nbillion to $122 billion.\n  I want Senator Harkin to be able to bring his bill to the floor and \ndebate it. Do we want an NIH? Let's fund it. Do we want a Centers for \nDisease Control, which is in the State of Georgia, with two excellent \nSenators from Georgia. Then fund it. Let's debate. Let's discuss. Let's \namend. Senator Harkin cannot even get it to the floor. Over in the \nHouse, they can't move it either because the funding for Health and \nHuman Services, Education, and the Department of Labor is at the 2003 \nlevel. So while they want to send us an individual bill for an \nindividual agency--for HHS and so on--as desirable as it is, I want to \nreopen government. That is what the Senate bill is. I want to reopen \nnegotiations. I would like to return to a regular order, where using \nthe parliamentary tools, tactics, and even tricks cannot delay bringing \na bill to the floor. Since 2007, Senator Harkin has not been able to \nbring a bill to the floor for an open debate, unfettered by filibuster, \nto be able to discuss this.\n  So this is what this is all about. This isn't about numbers. This is \nabout meeting compelling human needs. In the Labor-HHS subcommittee, we \nfund NIH, the Centers for Disease Control, the Social Security \nAdministration, mining safety, Department of Education. This is what we \nshould be working on. We should be working on education, money for the \ndisabled, et cetera.\n  So I come to the floor again as the chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee. I am proud of the work my subcommittee chairmen have done in \ngetting bills ready to come to the floor for debate by following \nregular order. I so appreciate the cooperation we have received from \nthe other side of the aisle in our committee. There has been a great \nsense of cooperation. We have had disputes and disagreements on funding \nlevels and even matters of policy, but I had an open amendment process. \nEverybody had their say. Everybody had their day. We moved the bills \nforward. That is called regular order. That is called democracy. \nEverybody has their day and everybody has their say. But let's move the \nbill.\n  So let's reopen government. Let's have a true negotiation. I hope \nthat out of the 5:30 meeting will come a path forward. But we have one \nnow: Pass the Senate resolution in the House, come back, and let's let \nthe work of the Senate and the U.S. Government get going again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for her comments and all of the effort she has \nmade and the bipartisan cooperation there has been to get bills to the \nfloor. But we are in kind of a pickle right now. We are talking about a \ncontinuing resolution. A continuing resolution means we didn't get our \nwork done. If we had the appropriations bills passed through this body, \nwe wouldn't need a continuing resolution. Every agency would understand \nwhat it can spend for the whole next year. Instead, we are quibbling \nover how long a continuing resolution we ought to have and what ought \nto be in it.\n  We haven't done total appropriations by the October 1 deadline for I \nam not even sure how many years. That would be the answer to what we \nare going through right now. If we got to debate each of those bills in \na timely fashion, with an open amendment process--I appreciate there \nhas been an open amendment process in the committee. I am always \ndisturbed that we haven't had much of an open amendment process around \nhere on the floor. Every time a bill comes to the floor--almost every \ntime a bill comes to the floor--there are negotiations about how many \namendments each side can have. I have seen those negotiations go on for \n2 weeks. Do you know how many amendments we could vote on in 2 weeks? I \nthink we could probably vote on 50, maybe 100 in 2 weeks. Instead, we \ndon't vote on amendments, which gives everyone the impression, of \ncourse, that there isn't an open amendment process.\n  The longer the stopper is kept in the bottle, the more anger there is \naround here. I would say there is anger on both sides because both \nsides have amendments they would like to bring up.\n  We have to quit dealmaking and start legislating around here. This is \nthe way this process was designed. They had legislation in the \ncommittee, but we need to have the ability to legislate on the floor--\nnot allocating something to a few people on both sides of the aisle and \nboth ends of the building to come back with some kind of a proposal by \nsome kind of a fiscal falloff date, and that fiscal falloff date, of \ncourse, happens to be in statute that the year begins on October 1. \nThat was yesterday. That is when every agency is supposed to know \nexactly how much they can spend.\n  How has that been affecting us? There was a sequester. The \ninteresting thing about the sequester is it was 2.3 percent of the \namount of money an\n\n[[Page S7123]]\n\nagency, program, department was to get. What did it actually turned out \nto be? It turned out to be 5.3 percent. Why did it turn out to be 5.3 \npercent? We were already eight-twelfths of the way through the year \nbefore they found out that there was going to be a sequester, that they \nfound out for sure that there was going to be a limitation on their \nspending. They had already spent one-twelfth of what they spent the \nyear before, each month, during that 8-month period and then found out \nthat for the whole year's worth of revenue that they got--eight-\ntwelfths of what they already spent--they have to take a 2.3-percent \ncut. That makes it a 5.3 cut. That makes it much more difficult.\n  Actually, CBO scored my penny plan--that is where we just do a 1-\npercent reduction in every dollar the U.S. Government spends, with \nflexibility--and if we add that to the sequester, which would bring it \nto 3.3 percent, they say the budget would balance in 2 years--2 years \nwe could balance the budget. It hasn't happened for over a decade. It \nonly happened four times, I think, in the last 50 years. But we could \ndo it, and I am pretty sure the people would say if we had our \nappropriations done timely so the agencies knew what they were doing on \nOctober 1 and then had a sequester plus 1 percent, I think they could \nlive with it. I think they could make effective cuts, if they wanted \nto.\n  One of our problems around here is that government doesn't usually \nlike to make effective cuts. Government likes to make it hurt. When it \nhurts, people come back and are very upset at what has been taken away \nfrom them. But we have a lot of redundancy in government. We have a lot \nof waste. We have a lot of programs that are happening in a whole bunch \nof different agencies, none of which are effective, but we are still \ndoing it everywhere. We could get rid of all that duplication or at \nleast half of it. Half of it is all that could be totally effective and \ngive them a little bit of a bonus for doing it. But we are now at a \npoint where we are going to make it hurt.\n  There were World War II veterans in town yesterday. They were flown \nin here so they could see their memorial, a tribute to their tremendous \nefforts. What did they find? They found barricades. I have been to the \nWorld War II Memorial a lot of times. There haven't been any barricades \nthere. I also didn't see another person there if I was there late at \nnight. So what was the purpose of the barricades? We have the national \nparks. Did the national parks get shut down?\n  Here is the extreme this is being carried to: Over in Teton National \nPark they even have barricades at the turnouts. Turnouts can be used to \nfix a flat tire or get a rest if one is tired of driving. They can also \nbe used to take pictures of gorgeous scenery such as the Tetons. That \nis what the turnouts are primarily designed for. But how much does it \ncost us if somebody pulls off and takes a picture of mountains? How \nmuch could that cost us? How much does it save us by putting up \nbarricades so they can't pull off the road? How much did it cost us to \nput barricades out there so they can't pull off the road and take \npictures of the Tetons?\n  Throughout government, we are trying to make it hurt. We are trying \nto emphasize to people that we did so poorly they need to suffer, and \nif they suffer enough, they will get hold of us and make us reverse \nwhat we have done. We should have been busy last April working on \nappropriations and working through that process.\n  The President is about to leave on a trip. I am not planning on \nleaving until everything has been cleared up here, and I would suggest \nthat he not do that either.\n  I got an interesting letter from one of my constituents that says: \nHow does the private sector see the Federal Government? The private \nsector sees the Federal Government as a wagon being pulled by the \nprivate sector, and the wagon is filled with people who work for the \nFederal Government, and there aren't enough people pulling the wagon \nand too many people riding in the wagon. He makes quite a point. He \ndoes admit that the people riding in the wagon pay taxes too, but he \nalso points out that those taxes came from the private sector to pay \nthe wages from which the taxes are taken. So, yes, there are people \nriding in the wagon, even though they are working as well, but he is \npointing out how the private sector has this extra load and now they \nare getting a little bit more of a load. He makes the point that we \nneed more people in the private sector and said that maybe the private \nsector ought to shut down.\n\n  What would happen if the private sector shut down? What would happen \nif trucks did not haul any more goods across this country? What happens \nif the filling stations do not open? What happens with the myriad of \nthings, groceries, the things we count on every day that come from the \nprivate sector? He just wanted me to know he is tired of pulling the \nwagon with so many people in the wagon.\n  We have a chance to reduce the load in the wagon, and we ought to \ntake advantage of that, but we are not. We need to take advantage of \nthat in a timely manner, and we need to get this wrapped up and get the \ngovernment under way so people are not suffering in the ``make it hurt \natmosphere'' we have right now. There is another way to do it. There is \na better way to do it. We should have done it. We should have been \ndoing it much earlier.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have great affection for my friend from \nWyoming. He is a fine man. I enjoy working with him. I am not going to \nnitpick what he said, but I am going to direct my attention to one \nthing he said: Why didn't we do our appropriations bills? Mr. \nPresident, please, I would not expect that coming from him. We have \ntried. We were filibustered. We tried one here. Remember Transportation \nappropriations? We got one Republican vote. Susan Collins. They killed \nthat. So do not come and lecture us on why didn't we do the bills last \nApril.\n  I have often said I sympathize with John Boehner, and I do. He has a \nvery difficult job. Even when the Speaker would prefer to be \nreasonable, when he would prefer to be the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives--the whole House, Democrats and Republicans, because \nthat is what he is--instead of just Speaker of the Republicans in the \nHouse of Representatives and sometimes appearing to be the Speaker for \na minority within his majority--he seems to be kowtowing to everything \nthey ask. This is the tea party. These voices in his caucus push him \nfurther and further to the right and over the cliff.\n  It can be difficult to balance the responsibilities of remaining true \nto one's party's core beliefs and doing the right thing for the \ngovernment as a whole.\n  I would like to give a personal example. I try not to do that often, \nbut I will give one today.\n  The Presiding Officer was not here during the Iraq war. I did not \njust oppose it, I thought it was bad for our country. I will give you \nsome reasons why I did not like it at all. I hated it as much as I am \nsure John Boehner dislikes the Affordable Care Act. But even though I \nvoted for the 2002 authorization to confront Saddam Hussein, I quickly \nwas appalled at how that authority was used, and the information that \ngot me to vote for it was absolutely false. There were no clear \nobjectives, not a coherent strategy. No one even knew in the \nadministration the difference between Shias and Sunnis. There was no \ninternational support for that.\n  I spent many, for lack of a better description, gut-wrenching nights \nand some days trying to figure out what I should do. I was disgusted \nand mad at President Bush and Republicans in Congress that even one \nmore American would be killed or maimed. I was so angry that I said \nthings I wish I had not. They are in the history books. They are there. \nSome of my friends on the other side of the aisle, especially John \nMcCain, as he can do, told me how wrong I was in opposing the war.\n  I thought I would be willing to do anything to stop that war, but I \nfaced a choice in 2007. The Commander in Chief, President George Bush, \nrequested $93 billion for additional government funding to continue the \nwar. Without that, no more war.\n  Congress sent President Bush a supplemental appropriations bill that \nended his blank check in Iraq. He vetoed that bill. At this point, I \ncould have taken the very same steps Speaker Boehner has taken this \nweek. I\n\n[[Page S7124]]\n\ncould have blocked funding for the Federal Government in order to block \nfunding for that war. I faced immense pressure from the left--\nmoveon.org. Oh, I got thousands and thousands and thousands of e-mails \nand letters from that organization, from my own base, to do just that.\n  It was a very difficult choice for me. I could put my own opposition \nto that senseless war and my fellow Democrats' opposition to the war \nbefore everything else. But as the leader of the Senate, I had an \nobligation to ensure the smooth operation of the Federal Government. I \ncould not do both. I tried to figure out a way to do both. I could not \nfigure out a way because there was no way. I could not do both.\n  It is a decision I took extremely seriously, as I know anyone else \nwould. In the end, I actually defied the strident voices on the left \nurging me to stay true to my personal belief that the war in Iraq was \nan unjust war and that I should end that war at any cost, but I felt I \nhad other responsibilities; one was to make sure our government was \nfunded, that we did not lose face in front of the international \ncommunity and resort to that kind of extremist legislative tactic. So \nwe funded the government. We funded the war I did not like. My choice \nmade a lot of Democrats very unhappy. It made people on my own staff \nupset with me, their boss. But looking back on that decision, I came to \nthe right decision, in my own mind.\n  Today, the country finds itself perhaps in a similar situation. \nRepublicans in Congress, for reasons we have discussed on the floor, \nare obsessed with ObamaCare. They do not like it. I have no reason to \ndoubt their sincerity. I doubt their logic, but I do not doubt their \nsincerity when they say they believe the Affordable Care Act is \ndamaging our country. They are wrong. They are wrong now, and time will \nshow how truly wrong they are because millions of Americans, right now \ntoday, are already benefiting from this law, and millions more will \nbenefit in the years to come. So when these history books are written \nthat people will read, ObamaCare will be seen as one of the greatest \nsingle steps to help America. It is in the same league as Social \nSecurity and Medicare and it will provide quality affordable health \ncare for America--all Americans. I understand why my Republican \ncolleagues disagree with what I just said.\n  Unfortunately, though, when Speaker Boehner was faced with the same \nchoice I was faced with in 2007, he made a very different decision. He \nput his own opposition to ObamaCare and his fellow Republicans' \nopposition to ObamaCare above all else, even above ensuring the \nstrength of our economy and the smooth operation of this government we \nlove. History will prove that to be shortsighted and wrong. But \nregardless of right or wrong, our responsibility as leaders is to find \na path forward to reopen the government and protect our economy.\n  So earlier today, at a quarter to 11 or thereabouts--no, it was a \nquarter to 12 this morning--I offered John Boehner, the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives, a reasonable compromise that respects both of \nour priorities.\n  Before the House is a Senate-passed legislative tool to reopen the \ngovernment. The measure funds the government at the level chosen by not \nus but the House leaders, a level much lower than I would have chosen \nor Senator Murray would have chosen or the chairman of our \nAppropriations Committee Senator Mikulski would have chosen.\n  I propose that the Speaker allow this joint resolution to come for a \nvote before the full House of Representatives. Every Democrat will vote \nfor that over there, and according to news reports, more than 100 House \nRepublicans are prepared to vote for it as well.\n\n  In short, what it says is: Reopen the government. Then I, on behalf \nof the Democratic caucus, commit to name conferees to a budget \nconference, as the Speaker has requested. This conference can engage on \nthe important fiscal issues facing our Nation. The Speaker has often \ncited these fiscal issues as the most important challenge to our \ngeneration.\n  A conference will be an appropriate place to have these discussions. \nIn a letter that I wrote to the Speaker, we did not limit what we would \ntalk about in the conference. In fact, I will read parts of this \nletter:\n\n       Now we find ourselves at loggerheads.\n\n  I say in the letter to John Boehner:\n\n       There needs to be a path forward to reopen our Government \n     and protect our economy. This is a communication to you \n     offering a sensible, reasonable compromise.\n       Before the House you have the Senate-passed measure to \n     reopen the Government, funded at the level that the House \n     chose in its own legislation. I propose that you allow this \n     joint resolution to pass, reopening the Government. And I \n     commit to name conferees to a budget conference, as soon as \n     the Government reopens. That conference can discuss the \n     important fiscal issues facing our Nation. You and your \n     Colleagues have repeatedly cited these fiscal issues as the \n     things on which we need to work. This conference would be an \n     appropriate place to have those discussions, where \n     participants could raise whatever proposals--such as tax \n     reform, health care, agriculture, and certainly discretionary \n     spending like veterans, National Parks, and NIH--they felt \n     appropriate.\n\n  That is pretty direct and to the point. These conferees could do \nwhatever they wanted without the threat of a government shutdown and \nensuing economic collapse hanging over their heads.\n  Together, we can end this government shutdown and work to address the \nimportant issues facing our Nation. Together, we can work to put our \nnation on sound fiscal footing by engaging in a responsible, long-term \nbudget process--not 5 weeks like the CR that is now before us.\n  This morning on the Senate floor I warned of the effects of a \nRepublican government shutdown that have already come to bear. My \ncolleagues have done this all day about what has this done to Federal \nemployees generally? What has it done to NIH? What has it done to \ntransportation? What has it done to the Centers for Disease Control? \nAnd on and on with all these programs that are now stunningly stopped.\n  There are many unintended consequences of this irresponsible and \nshortsighted shutdown. It is reckless and irresponsible.\n  But Speaker Boehner can end this Republican government shutdown \ntoday. We have given him what he wants. They sent over from the House: \nLet's go to conference. We are saying: We will go to conference on \nanything you want to go to conference on.\n  Defy the strident voices on the right urging you to put your personal \nbeliefs and the beliefs of your caucus before the strength of our \neconomy and the needs of our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follow:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 2013.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: I hated the Iraq war. I think I hated it \n     as much as you hate the Affordable Care Act. Even though I \n     voted in 2002 to give President Bush the authority to \n     confront Saddam Hussein, I became appalled at how that \n     authority was used--without clear objectives, a coherent \n     strategy, or significant international support. There were \n     many gut-wrenching nights when I struggled over what I needed \n     to do to end the carnage. In those days, when President Bush \n     was Commander in Chief, I could have taken the steps that you \n     are taking now to block Government funding in order to gain \n     leverage to end the war. I faced a lot of pressure from my \n     own base to take that action. But I did not do that. I felt \n     that it would have been devastating to America. Therefore, \n     the Government was funded.\n       Now we find ourselves at loggerheads. There needs to be a \n     path forward to reopen our Government and protect our \n     economy. This is a communication to you offering a sensible, \n     reasonable compromise.\n       Before the House you have the Senate-passed measure to \n     reopen the Government, funded at the level that the House \n     chose in its own legislation. I propose that you allow this \n     joint resolution to pass, reopening the Government. And I \n     commit to name conferees to a budget conference, as soon as \n     the Government reopens. That conference can discuss the \n     important fiscal issues facing our Nation. You and your \n     Colleagues have repeatedly cited these fiscal issues as the \n     things on which we need to work. This conference would be an \n     appropriate place to have those discussions, where \n     participants could raise whatever proposals--such as tax \n     reform, health care, agriculture, and certainly discretionary \n     spending like veterans, National Parks, and NIH--they felt \n     appropriate.\n\n[[Page S7125]]\n\n       I hope that we can work together in this fashion. Together, \n     we can end this Government shutdown and work to address the \n     important fiscal issues facing our Nation. I look forward to \n     hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Democrats and Republicans have some \nserious differences when it comes to our policies and our values and \nour priorities. But one thing we should be able to agree on--the bare \nminimum expected of us in Congress--is that we should not actively \nallow our constituents to be hurt.\n  That is why Senate Democrats will be here today with a clear message \nto Republicans: Open the government. End the shutdown. Allow the \ngovernment to open, make sure our families and communities that we \nrepresent do not have to pay the price for the disagreements we have \nand then come back to the table and work with us on a long-term budget \ndeal to avoid these constant crises.\n  Majority Leader Reid has made it very clear to Speaker Boehner that \nhe is willing to sit down and talk, and I truly hope House Republicans \ntake him up on that.\n  On Monday night, as the government was shutting down, Speaker Boehner \nand the House Republicans lurched even deeper into the theater of the \nabsurd. I was shocked. I could not believe my ears when I heard, with \nminutes to go before the shutdown began, Speaker Boehner was asking us \nfor a conference on the spending bill. I thought: Is he serious? Is \nthis some kind of joke?\n  Even by the standards of a party that shut down the government to \nstop the health care reform law that was going to come online \nyesterday, no matter what they did, that was bizarre.\n  I say to Speaker Boehner today: Yes, let's start a budget conference. \nIt is a bit late. I have been fighting to start one for 6 months, but \nbetter late than never. Let's sit down, let's negotiate, let's work \ntoward the balanced and bipartisan long-term budget deal that our \nconstituents are expecting--a real budget conference, not like the \nphoto op we saw in the House of Representatives yesterday; a budget \nconference where the two sides can sit at a table, offer some \ncompromises and work toward a balanced and bipartisan long-term budget \ndeal the American people expect.\n  But there is one condition. It is a reasonable one. It could not be \nmore important. Speaker Boehner and the House Republicans should stop \nallowing our families and our communities to be hurt while we \nnegotiate. They should pass our short-term bill, reopen the government, \nand then join us at the table for a budget conference where we can work \ntogether toward a long-term deal. This is common sense. It is the \nresponsible thing to do. There is absolutely no reason why we should \nnot get the government back open, right now, while all of us get in a \nroom and work on a deal.\n  Given that Republicans spent the day yesterday talking about their \nnewfound interest in a conference, I think it would be helpful to go \nback a bit to remind people who are following us here today how we got \nto this point.\n  For 4 years Republicans in the Senate and in the House said it was \ncritical that the Senate pass a budget. They came here to the floor, \nthey blasted out press releases, they made it part of every one of \ntheir campaigns across the country.\n  At the beginning of this year, it seemed that Democrats and \nRepublicans agreed on at least one thing: The budget debate should \nproceed through regular order. The House was going to pass their \nbudget, the Senate was going to pass ours, and then we were going to \nget together in a conference room and work out our differences.\n  Senator McConnell said back then that once the Senate and House \npassed budgets, ``the work of conferencing must begin.'' Republicans \nsaid a conference was the ``best vehicle'' for the budget debate \n``because we are doing it in plain sight.''\n  I absolutely agree. The Senate Budget Committee wrote our strong \nprogrowth, pro-middle-class long-term budget. I am sure the hours that \nwe spent debating this budget are not forgotten by anybody on this \nfloor. We spent a week here in an open process debating and voting on \namendment after amendment until the very wee hours of the morning. On \nMarch 23, the Senate passed our budget. We all remember that. The \nHouse, by the way, passed theirs earlier that day.\n  I thought the next step would be we would go to a conference as \nquickly as possible. I went to the House Budget Committee chairman, \nChairman Ryan. I told him the American people were expecting all of us \nto get in a room and work it out. I thought it was a no-brainer. We had \nsignificant differences between our two budgets, but I was ready to go \nto work with my colleagues and make compromises.\n  With 6 months to go before the end of the fiscal year, we had plenty \nof time. But I was absolutely floored when I heard the House \nRepublicans had changed their mind. They no longer wanted to go to \nconference. They no longer wanted to follow regular order.\n  I am sure the idea of debating their budget and having it compared in \nan open and public forum was pretty unpleasant to them. They knew how \nunpopular their plans were to end Medicare as we know it and to cut \ntaxes to the rich. But they put it in their budget and now it was their \njob to negotiate with them.\n  I came here to the Senate floor and I asked for consent to go to a \nbudget conference. I was joined by Senator Reid and many others. We \nasked to begin bipartisan negotiations. But Senate Republicans said no. \nWe tried again and again and again. On April 23, we were blocked--April \n23, blocked by Senator Toomey; on May 6, Senator Cruz stood up and \nobjected; on May 7, May 8, May 9, May 14, and May 15, Senator McConnell \nsaid no; on May 16, Senator Lee said no; on May 21, Senator Paul \nblocked our negotiation; May 22, it was Senator Rubio; May 23, Senator \nLee; June 4, Senator Rubio; June 12, Senator Lee; June 19, Senator \nToomey; June 26, Senator Cruz; July 11, Senator Rubio; July 17, Senator \nLee; on August 1, Senator Rubio blocked us from starting a conference, \nright before the August recess.\n  We have come here 18 times. Every single time we tried to get in that \nroom, every time we tried to start a conference and negotiate, \nRepublicans stood and they blocked us.\n  By the way, it was not just Democrats either. Quite a few of our \nSenate Republicans joined us in pushing for a conference. My colleague \nSenator McCain joined Democrats on the floor and said blocking a \nconference was ``incomprehensible'' and ``insane.''\n  Senator Corker said to ``keep from appointing conferees is not \nconsistent.''\n  Senator Flake said he ``would like to see a conference.''\n  Republicans offered one excuse after another. By the way, none of \nthem add up. First, they said they wanted a preconference framework, \neven though that is exactly what a budget is, and was exactly what we \nwere negotiating over.\n  Then they said they would not allow us to go to conference unless we \nguaranteed in our budget that the wealthiest Americans and biggest \ncorporations would be protected from paying a penny more in taxes. Then \nthey said they did not want a bipartisan conference to take away the \nleverage that they would have during a debt ceiling debate. Then they \ncalled for a ``do-over'' of the budget debate, including another 50 \nhours of debate here on the floor, and a whole new round of unlimited \namendments, even after, I will remind all of us, many of them praised \nthe open floor debate that we had during the Senate budget debate.\n  Their story kept changing. Senator McCain said Republicans' \npreconditions and excuses were ``absolutely out of line and \nunprecedented.'' Senator Collins said that even though there is a lot \nwe do not see eye to eye on, we should at least go to conference and \nmake our best effort to make a deal.\n  The stalling from some Republicans was, to quote Senators McCain and \nCollins, ``a little bit bizarre'' and ``ironic, to say the least.''\n  Republicans kept making excuses for stalling. But the bottom line was \nthat after spending years saying the most important thing was for the \nSenate to pass a budget, once we did, they ran away as quickly as they \ncould. You know, I told Republicans again and again, right here on the \nSenate floor\n\n[[Page S7126]]\n\nand when I talked to them in private, if you do not join us in a \nconference and give us the time we need to work out a deal, you are \ngoing to be pushing us into a completely avoidable crisis. They did not \nlisten. They did not want to conference. They did not want to \nnegotiate. They thought they would have more leverage in a crisis. They \nwere doing everything they could to push us to one. Well, they were \nright; they pushed us into a crisis. Now families across our country \nare paying the price.\n\n  If Speaker Boehner truly wants to negotiate and end this lurching \nfrom crisis to crisis, he would let the House vote to keep the \ngovernment open. It would pass, by the way, with a strong bipartisan \nvote. Then he would join us at the table in a conference that I have \nbeen trying to start for months.\n  I am going to ask unanimous consent for the 19th time to start a \nbudget conference. To be very clear, this is not a replacement for an \nimmediate end to this shutdown. It would build on a short-term bill to \nend this crisis. It is not to negotiate a short-term deal while our \nfamilies and our communities are being hurt by a shutdown. It is to \nmake sure the door is open for long-term negotiations that can start as \nsoon as the threat of a shutdown is taken off the table.\n  I am hopeful our Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwho have watched as our constituents look on in amazement at the Senate \nand House as they say: We were unable to do the job that we have been \nasked to do, which is to govern the country in a responsible way--I \nwould hope they would take a moment to pause and to say: It is time to \nstand. It is time to be a leader. It is time to stop holding our \ncountry and our communities hostage. It is time to stop putting fear \ninto the lives of so many people. It is time to say, yes, we are going \nto open the government, we are not going to hold this country hostage, \nwe are going to do our job. That is simply what we are asking to do \ntoday, allow the Senate bill to come up for a vote in the House. It \nwill pass. We know we have the votes, Republicans and Democrats \ntogether, who want to stop this crisis.\n  Then we will sit down and do what we have been asked to do by the \nRepublicans for a number of years now, to write a budget, to have the \nHouse write a budget and sit down and work out our differences.\n  I see Senator Durbin here on the floor. Senator Durbin worked on the \nSimpson-Bowles Commission for many years to try and resolve our \ndifferences. I think he would agree with me, it is time to get this \ndone.\n  I see Senator Warner on the floor right now. He has spent a great \ndeal of time working to get us to a point where we can solve this \ncrisis and have a way to go forward and a path that our country can \nrely on.\n  I think many of our colleagues are ready to get past this crisis, are \nready to open the government, and begin the responsible thing of \nworking in the way we are supposed to. I hope they listen to Senator \nReid and what he offered them today. I hope they do the right thing so \nfamilies across our country do not have to continue bearing the burden \nof the Republican Party's dysfunction and division.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives a \nmessage from the House that they have passed H.J. Res. 59, as amended \nby the Senate, the Senate then proceed to the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment at the desk, which is the \ntext of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution passed by the Senate, be \ninserted in lieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed \nto, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable; that the Senate proceed to a vote on a motion to insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses, and authorize the Chair to appoint conferees on the \npart of the Senate, with all of the above occurring with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in a second I am going to ask we go into a \nquorum call so the Republicans can give this due consideration. I do \nnot want to try to rush into this, so we are going to go into a quorum \ncall, giving the Republicans the opportunity to look at and study this \nconsent agreement.\n  We have done what we thought the Speaker would want, what the \nRepublican leader would want. We have said we will discuss whatever you \nwant to talk about in the conference. We hope this is something they \nwill accept.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Washington?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Reserving the right to object, I would point out a couple \nof things I didn't hear in the discussion of the Senator from \nWashington.\n  One is the fact that the House has passed three different measures to \nfund the government. That has already happened. They were sent over \nhere, and each one was rejected by the Senate Democrats, one after \nanother, so that we are now in a government shutdown.\n  I would also point out that after the Senate Democrats rejected every \nmeasure the Republicans sent over to fund the government, the \nRepublican House sent over a measure to go to conference so that we \ncould resolve this problem. I find it a little bit ironic, to say the \nleast, that our Democratic colleagues are saying: We need to go to \nconference on the budget resolution. Now, I know the terminology here \ncan get confusing for people, but that is a vehicle that has nothing to \ndo with the immediate problem we have right now, which is the funding \nof the government, because we don't have a continuing resolution to \nactually fund the discretionary spending of the government, and that \nhaving expired and our Democratic friends having voted down every \nattempt by the Republicans to fund the government, we are in this bind.\n  Now we have the unanimous consent request, if I have this right, that \nsays that if the Republicans agree to every demand the Democrats have \nmade beforehand, initially, then and only then would our Democratic \nfriends like to have a conference on the budget. This is what I am \nhearing.\n  What I would ask is whether the Senator from Washington would \nconsider a modification to the unanimous consent request, and this \nwould be two things. One would be that they also would agree to go to \nconference on the CR so we can work out the problem that is preventing \nus from reopening the government. The other would be that when we go to \nconference----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would the Senator yield for a clarification?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Your request that we go to conference would be while the \ngovernment is shut down. It doesn't matter in your request whether the \ngovernment is shut down or not; is that correct?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. My request is that we try to find a resolution to the \nshutdown. Go to conference----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. While the government is shut down?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Go immediately, right now. The government is shut down. \nLet's go right now to conference as the House has requested so that we \ncan reopen the government and can work out an agreement rather than \nhave this impasse. Let's try to break the impasse by trying to go to \nconference. That would be one condition.\n  Then I would go back to what our concern has been about the budget \nconference all along. I have asked unanimous consent to go to \nconference on the budget. I am a member of the Finance Committee. I \nwould like us to do that. What I have objected to and what many of us \nhave objected to is using it as an opportunity to break the Senate \nrules and airdrop in a debt ceiling increase without the opportunity to \nhave the 60-vote threshold we ought to have in the Senate if we are \ngoing to consider increasing the debt burden on the American people.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Washington agree \nto those two modifications.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify her request?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me\n\n[[Page S7127]]\n\nmake it very clear that what the Senator from Pennsylvania is asking is \nthat we continue to hold our country, our communities, and our families \nhostage while they try to get something out of a conference. Mainly, \nthe Senator is talking about saying ObamaCare will be repealed unless \nwe pass a very short-term--a few weeks--continuing resolution. That is \ncompletely unacceptable not only to this Senator but to the vast \nmajority of Americans.\n  The Senator is also saying we can talk while everyone is not at work \nwhile the government is shut down. We have been asking to talk for a \nlong time, but the American people deserve to be able to go to work, \nget their paychecks, and to have our communities and our country \nrunning without the threat of this over their heads.\n  I object to the Senator's request.\n  I repeat my request that we allow the House to vote on the bill that \nwas sent over to them, that they have the votes on, open the \ngovernment, and then do as we have asked 19 times, do what the American \npeople expect us to do, which is to go to conference and work out our \ndisagreements.\n  I renew my original request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Washington?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. The Senator from Washington objects to my request that we \ngo to conference so we can resolve the impasse of the shutdown of \ngovernment and instead wishes to go to conference on something else, \nwhich is the budget resolution, in the event it does not reopen the \ngovernment.\n  I object.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me make it clear. The Senator from Washington does \nnot believe we should be negotiating in the dark of night. The \ngovernment should be open, public, and people should be able to see \nwhat we are doing. That is why our unanimous request was so important. \nI am so disappointed the Republicans are saying: Hold the country \nhostage. That is the place we are left in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I know my colleague from Pennsylvania has gone. Let's \nclarify a few things because obfuscation is the rule of the day when \nyou are not holding many cards.\n  First, the Senator from Pennsylvania said they have asked to open the \ngovernment--they have asked, rather, to go to conference three times \nand open the government. Yes, they have--if ObamaCare is repealed, if \nObamaCare is delayed for 1 year, and if the individual mandate is \ndelayed for 1 year. That is not a request to go to conference. That is \nsaying: Unless I get my way on ObamaCare--which has been voted on by \nthese Chambers, which has been litigated in the election--I am going to \nshut the government down. Their position hasn't changed. The bottom \nline is very simple. The bottom line now is very simple. The bottom \nline now is, oh, let's go to conference. All of a sudden--sure. Let's \ngo to conference while cancer treatments are being refused. The more we \ndelay, the worse that is. Let's go to conference while veterans' \nbenefits can't be processed, and the more we delay, the more veterans \nwill be hurt. Let's go to conference before 800,000 people get their \npaychecks, which they need to feed their families. Let's go to \nconference while the Statue of Liberty is closed and my little sandwich \nshop nearby is not making any revenue.\n\n  Please, I say to my colleague, what the Senator wants to do is use a \nbludgeon since a small group of tea party fanatics, as they are called, \nhas Speaker Boehner in the palm of their hand and they have the power \nnot to fund the government. They say: Until you do what we want, we \nwon't fund the government. So nothing has changed, and there is no \nconcession or willingness to negotiate on a fair basis by the other \nside--no.\n  Let me repeat to my colleague from Pennsylvania, you have it \nbackward. You are saying: Let's negotiate, and then we might open the \ngovernment. The right way to do it is by the resolution offered by the \nchairwoman of the Budget Committee. Let's open the government, and then \nwe will be happy to sit down and negotiate. That is the fundamental \ndifference here.\n  On whose side are the American people? Ours--70 to 22. On whose side \nis every Democrat at each end of Pennsylvania Avenue? Ours, of course. \nIf you look at the quotations in the House and Senate, a large number \nof votes from the other side of the aisle are on our side too. But \nbecause a small number of irresponsible members of the tea party have \nSpeaker Boehner in their control right now, we can't succeed. So the \ntea party shutdown, the shutdown, originated, engineered, and put into \nplace by the tea party with Speaker Boehner's fearful acquiescence, is \nstill the law of the day. It will not be for much longer. The pressure \nfrom the public, on the economy, and the pressure from Members on the \nother side of the aisle will increase, and I believe in a short while--\nin a short while--the other side will have to say: OK, we will fund the \ngovernment; now let's sit down and talk. That is what Leader Reid and \nChairwoman Murray have simply asked for today. It will just take a few \ndays more, but it will happen.\n\n  I wish the other side would acquiesce now because so many innocent \nmillions are being held hostage and being hurt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the unanimous consent request made by the \nSenator from the State of Washington is eminently sensible. It \nbasically says: Why hold 800,000 Federal employees hostage while we go \nabout the negotiation of our future budget? The majority leader has \nmade this offer. He has said we are going to go forward. He has offered \nto Speaker Boehner the opportunity--the opportunity--for us to open the \ngovernment and then get into meaningful negotiations on all of the \nmajor issues.\n  So what do we hear from the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nToomey? His objection. He wants to continue to keep the government shut \ndown while we are supposed to initiate negotiations. Who pays the price \nfor that? Well, it wouldn't be any Senator. The people who pay a price \nfor it are those 800,000 furloughed employees and all of the people in \nAmerica who count on their services every single day.\n  I have said it before, but it bears repeating. Two hundred people \nwere turned away from the National Institutes of Health this week who \nwanted to enter clinical trials because of a serious life-threatening \nillness, including 30 children--cancer patients coming to the NIH with \ntheir parents for one last hopeful move to save their lives. So the \nSenator from Pennsylvania says: Sorry, we can't take care of those \nchildren. We can't take care of those seriously ill Americans. We have \nto sit down and negotiate.\n  It is easy for him, and perhaps easy for others to say it is all \nabout us, but it isn't. It is all about America. It is all about the \npeople we were sent here to represent. It is all about the reputation \nof this Nation.\n  What it will take to get beyond this current crisis is very obvious. \nWe have unity on the Democratic side to open the government. We have \nsent a continuing resolution to the House to do the same. What has to \nhappen now is for moderate Republicans to step forward.\n  It is interesting to me in the last 48 hours how few have come to the \nSenate Floor to talk about this issue. Privately they tell me they are \ntorn and worried over what this is doing to our country and what it is \ndoing to their party. But some moderate Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives have spoken. I would like to, if I can, at this point, \nrecount what has been said by some of those who have spoken.\n  Representative Pat Meehan, Republican of Pennsylvania, said:\n\n       At this point, I believe it's time for the House to vote \n     for a clean, short-term funding bill to bring the Senate to \n     the table and negotiate a responsible compromise.\n\n  A clean short-term funding bill. That has already passed the Senate. \nIt is sitting in the House waiting for the Speaker to call it up.\n  Representative Mike Fitzpatrick, another Republican from \nPennsylvania. A Fitzpatrick aide tells the Philadelphia Inquirer the \nCongressman would support a clean funding bill if it came up for a \nvote.\n  Representative Lou Barletta, Republican of Pennsylvania. Barletta \nsaid\n\n[[Page S7128]]\n\nhe would ``absolutely'' vote for a clean bill in order to avert a \nshutdown of the government.\n  Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania said: ``I'm \nprepared to vote for a clean continuing resolution,'' he told the \nHuffington Post.\n  In addition to that, Representative Jim Gerlach, another Republican \nfrom Pennsylvania, issued a statement saying he would ``vote in favor \nof a so-called clean budget bill.''\n  The list goes on--and I have mentioned a few on this list: \nRepresentative Pat Meehan, Republican of Pennsylvania; Representative \nScott Rigell--I am sorry if I mispronounced that--Republican of \nVirginia; Representative Jon Runyan, Republican of New Jersey; \nRepresentative Mike Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania; \nRepresentative Lou Barletta, Republican of Pennsylvania; Representative \nPeter King, Republican of New York; Representative Devin Nunes, \nRepublican of California; Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of \nPennsylvania; Representative Frank Wolf, Republican of Virginia; \nRepresentative Michael Grimm, Republican of New York; Representative \nErik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota; Representative Rob Wittman, \nRepublican of Virginia; Representative Frank LoBiondo, Republican of \nNew Jersey; Representative Randy Forbes, Republican of Virginia; \nRepresentative Jim Gerlach, Republican of Pennsylvania; Representative \nLeonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, and Representative Mike \nSimpson, Republican of Idaho.\n  Seventeen. Why is that number significant? It takes only two or three \nmore Republican Congressmen--Republican Congressmen--to step up and say \nthey will vote for the CR we sent over from the Senate to reopen the \ngovernment of the United States of America.\n  There are six Republican Congressmen in my State of Illinois. I \nchallenge all of them to join this group of their fellow colleagues and \nDemocrats in the House who don't want to punish America and 800,000 \nFederal workers.\n  What is at stake here? It isn't just bragging rights about how this \ncrisis ends. What is at stake is much more. It even goes beyond the \nlife-and-death situation faced by hundreds at the National Institutes \nof Health. I am still stunned by what I was told yesterday by Senator \nFeinstein. It is public knowledge. She announced it on the floor. \nSeventy-two percent--72 percent--of the civilian workforce in America's \nintelligence agencies have been furloughed. What do they do? Well, I \nwill tell you what they do. They listen closely to places and people \nall around the world to see a threat coming against the United States. \nThey are sent to work each day with the most serious mission of almost \nanyone working for our government. They are sent there with the mission \nto avoid the next 9/11, to spare innocent people across America the \npossibility of a terrorist attack.\n  I am not over-dramatizing it. That is what the intelligence agencies \nare all about every day. Today, almost three out of four of the \nprofessional men and women on the civilian side of intelligence are \nhome. They are not listening. They are not watching. They have been \nsent home by this tea party Republican shutdown. It will only take \nabout 3 more Republican Congressmen to step forward and say: This has \nto come to an end for the good of our Nation, for the safety of our \nNation, and for the future of our economy. That is what we are up \nagainst.\n  What we are trying to do is get the conversation underway to resolve \nsome major issues. I hope we are successful. But in the meantime, let \nus protect America. Let us serve the people who sent us here. Let us \nreopen this government as quickly as possible. It has gone on now for a \nday and a half. It should end this afternoon.\n  Speaker John Boehner has it within his power to end this government \nshutdown in a matter of minutes--minutes--and then we can start a \nconversation about the important issues facing us. I think \nthe President is right. We have to do this in a responsible manner and \nto say once and for all we are not going to hold the American people, \nthe American taxpayers or America's security, hostage to a political \ntemper tantrum. We have to face our responsibilities honestly and \ndirectly.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Illinois for his comments on this issue. I will comment as well, \nbut I also want to thank the chair of the Budget Committee for asking \none more time and saying: Let's negotiate this.\n  I think it is important to note, as the Senator from Illinois \nmentioned, some of the folks who say this is not just about the 800,000 \nFederal workers who are going on without pay, it is about national \nsecurity. Seventy-two percent of the folks who work in the intelligence \ncommunity, who are civilians, are furloughed today. It means our troops \nin harm's way are in greater danger. Our embassies are in greater \ndanger, and our country is in greater danger.\n  I also have heard some remarkable comments from some of our \ncolleagues on the other side about the free enterprise system. I have \nto say I have spent longer in the free enterprise system than I have in \nelective office. I can never imagine two businesses that were \nnegotiating saying: We are going to shut down our business rather than \nnegotiate. I mean this really has entered into a new realm of the \ntheater of the absurd.\n  We think about why so many of those Congressmen from Virginia have \nstepped up, and it is because this is not just about the Federal \nworkforce. I point out that today, at NASA Langley, one of our premier \nresearch institutions in America, where there are normally 3,500 \nemployees, there are only six working today. But this doesn't just \naffect NASA Langley. It affects the gas station nearby, where the folks \nwho go to work at NASA Langley buy gas. It affects the shops and \nrestaurants around there, where people go to eat.\n  I wonder what the folks who talk about the free enterprise system \nwill say to that motel owner along Skyline Drive in Virginia or outside \nYosemite who has a cancellation this weekend. That is not a government \nworker. That is part of the free enterprise system. No business leader \nin America, regardless of political stripe, thinks shutting down the \nFederal Government makes good business sense.\n  Earlier today, along with my colleagues from Maryland--Senator King \ncouldn't be there, but he was very supportive--we brought in some--not \nfaceless budgets but real folks who were directly affected by this \nshutdown. We had a woman who had worked for the National Science \nFoundation for close to 40 years, saying she had gone through a $2,500 \nhit from furloughs already and was unsure. She hadn't bought a car last \nweek because this was hanging over her head. She felt she was going to \nbe fine in some way, but she wondered what young scientist would come \nwork in public service today. Again, in a free enterprise system--this \nis a competitive world--the rest of the world is not going to stop \ntheir science, their innovation, their creativity because America can't \nget its act together and keep its government operating.\n  I have been occasionally called by some of my colleagues on this side \nof the aisle too reflexively bipartisan. There is always both sides of \nan argument. But on this argument, with these facts, there is no lack \nof clarity in my mind that holding not just our Federal workforce but \nthe economy of America hostage, and saying that until we get our way we \nare not going to reopen the largest enterprise in the world--the \nFederal Government of the United States--is more irresponsible than \nanything I have seen, not only in my political life but in my business \nlife.\n  I have had some of the same conversations my colleagues have had, and \nI know there is a great deal of uneasiness on the other side. I \nactually don't believe this is Democrats versus Republicans. We have \nour bill over on the House side, and I believe, candidly, we will see \nthe majority of the House Republicans join in reopening the government. \nThen let's have this kind of very real debate about health care, about \ntax reform, about getting our country's balance sheet right.\n  The notion that we are basically going to affect the lives of 800,000 \nfolks who are furloughed, and countless millions of others who depend \non those\n\n[[Page S7129]]\n\nservices, or countless millions others in the free enterprise system \nwho depend upon our workforce as their customers, is stunningly \nirresponsible. All of us here say we want our economy to recover. Well, \nlet's get our balance sheet right. But in the meantime, let's open the \ngovernment. Let these folks get back to their job, and let's have this \nconference that has been called for 18 different times.\n  I will close, and I know other folks have mentioned this. No matter \nwhat happens going forward, we are going to ask our Federal workforce \nto do more with less resources. Again, I have spent more time in the \nprivate sector than in the public sector. I have built companies. The \nlast thing you do to your workforce, when you are asking them to do \nmore with less, is disrespect them continuously the way we have done to \nthe Federal workforce over the last 3 years--3 years without a pay \nincrease, furloughs, being told that somehow they are riding in the \nwagon not driving the wagon.\n  Let me say, as somebody who got here because of a good public school, \nbecause of a student loan program, because I had a free enterprise \nsystem that allowed me to fail, but then succeed because there was a \nsupport system put forward by a Federal Government, I think those folks \nare pulling that wagon every bit as much as every other American.\n  I hope we will be able to get not only those folks in the House but \nothers to be willing to say it is time to get this government bill, it \nis time to have a long overdue conversation about our balance sheet. I \nappeal to all of my colleagues, let's get this behind us. Please, don't \nbring somebody down here and say that under the free enterprise system \nsomehow it is rational, logical, or makes good business sense to keep \nthis government shuttered.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, in all this mess there is \nsome good news. The Affordable Care Act is up and running, and the \npeople of America are responding in remarkable numbers.\n  Remember how the Republicans said this is bad, it is a failure? They \nkept saying it was a failure even though it had not even started. In \nthe first 24 hours of healthcare.gov being up, the national \nmarketplace, 4.7 million people visited. In California, which has its \nown State-run marketplace, 5 million people visited that site \nyesterday. I noted that I heard the Republican leader out here earlier \ntoday. In his home state of Kentucky, with 78,000 visitors, they \nstarted nearly 4,700 applications and completed more than 2,900 \nyesterday in the first day.\n  I think what this all indicates is the American people is hungry to \nget covered with health insurance. With 30 million people out there \nwithout health insurance, with a preexisting condition, or maybe they \nare ill right now, maybe they have had other things happen or are out \nof work--now they can go on the marketplace and get health insurance \ncoverage. And they are flocking to it, because it has been sorely \nneeded for decades.\n  The Republicans still want to hold the government hostage and defund \nthe Affordable Care Act. I would like to know what the Republican \nleader might say to those 4,700 people who applied in Kentucky \nyesterday. And we know it is going to be more as the weeks and months \ngo by. We have 6 months to sign up. But think about those figures just \nin the first day.\n  Fifty-five thousand people went to Colorado's exchange and 1,450 \ncreated accounts to allow them to start shopping. I mentioned New York. \nThere were 10 million attempts to reach their Web site.\n  We had some glitches. Yes, some Web sites froze because they didn't \nexpect that many people to come on the first day.\n  Andrew Stryker was among the first people to purchase health care \nthrough the marketplace. Mr. Stryker is 34 years old and lives in Los \nAngeles where he is a freelancer. He has a preexisting condition--high \nblood pressure--and says health insurance companies had denied him \ncoverage on the individual market. He said signing up for coverage \nthrough the marketplace will save him over $6,000 per year when \ncompared with his monthly premium for his COBRA plan. For that, he \nsaid, I would have waited all day.\n  So the Affordable Care Act is up and running, and people all over \nthis country are flocking to it to get the good news that they can get \naffordable coverage for themselves and their family.\n  The same is happening in my own State of Iowa, where the plans have \ncome in as some of the lowest in the country.\n  So that is the good news. The bad news is Republicans here are still \ntrying to stop it before too many people get health insurance because \nthen they know they won't be able to turn it back. The people of \nAmerica have waited too long to have health insurance coverage for \nthemselves and their families. Now everyone can get health insurance at \na price they can afford. So we are going to have health coverage not \njust for the healthy and the wealthy but for everyone in this country. \nThat is the good news.\n  We are now in day 2 of the Federal shutdown. If we listen to some \nMembers across the aisle and in the other body, one might get the sense \nthat it is no big deal. The Congressman from my own State said, the sky \nhasn't fallen. We have had government shutdowns and the sky hasn't \nfallen, the roof hasn't caved in. No big deal. I may have paraphrased a \nlittle bit, but that is basically what he said. They seem to think you \ncan simply turn off the Federal Government for a few days or a month or \ntwo and it won't matter. I don't understand this attitude, but it is \nwhat we hear from Members of the other party.\n  Let me explain what a government shutdown means in the areas I am \nmost familiar with as the chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee and as chair of the Appropriations Committee that \nfunds those programs.\n  As of yesterday, the National Institutes of Health stopped enrolling \nnew patients in 497 ongoing clinical research trials. Of those trials, \n255 are studying treatments for cancer and 50 involve children with \ncancer. These are ongoing clinical research trials right now--stopped--\n50 involving children with cancer. What do you say to those families? \nClinical trials can't be completed if they don't have enough patients. \nBut as long as there is a shutdown, the process stops.\n  I remind everyone, when I am talking about NIH I am not just talking \nabout Bethesda, MD. I am talking about all over this country. NIH funds \nresearch and clinical trials in every State in this country. As of \nyesterday, the NIH began turning away people from its clinical research \ncenter. Each week of a shutdown, NIH estimates it will close its doors \nto 200 new patients who need help. Also yesterday the NIH stopped \nprocessing applications for new research grants. These applications are \nsubmitted by scientists all over the country, from universities and \nother places in our States, not just from Bethesda and not just from \nWashington, DC.\n  We might say OK, so they have stopped processing new research grants. \nSo what. The sky hasn't fallen, the roof hasn't caved in, according to \nthe Congressman from Iowa. We have no idea which of those grant \napplications might lead to the next cure for cancer or Alzheimer's or \ndiabetes or might be that one bit of research that fits into that slot \nwhere other people can build on it to find cures. But so long as there \nis a shutdown, none of them will be considered. That is the effect on \nNIH.\n  I understand the House is proceeding to some kind of a measure to \npass an appropriations measure just for NIH and maybe a couple other \nthings, and they are going to send it over here. Do you know what they \nare missing if they want to talk about health? They are missing the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  The CDC is the premier public health agency--not just in America but \nin the world. The people who work there protect America from threats to \nour health and safety like infectious diseases, chronic diseases, \noutbreaks of foodborne disease. As of yesterday, the CDC--the premier \npublic health agency in the world--is shut down. All of their labs are \nclosed. The scientists are furloughed. The expert hotlines that \nphysicians and the public call for information are turned off. The \nemergency operations center is on a skeleton crew for outbreak \nresponse. Maybe that\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\nshould give us some comfort. But the CDC is not doing any disease \nmonitoring. So who is going to sound the alert if they are not doing \nthe monitoring? I have to add, viruses don't just break out when the \ngovernment is open.\n\n  I will never forget what our former chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and under whom I served some years ago, Mark Hatfield, the \ngreat Senator from Oregon, said when he gave his final speech here on \nthe Senate floor. I remember it well. I remember him saying it is not \nthe Russians are coming, the Russians are coming; it is the viruses are \ncoming, the viruses are coming.\n  Senator Hatfield was looking ahead because he knew what was \nhappening. We know for a fact that the viruses are coming because \nOctober is the beginning of flu season. And yet because the government \nis shut down, there is no one at CDC monitoring influenza.\n  Why is that important? For most of us, I suppose flu is an \ninconvenience. For most of us, we can go down here to the doctor's \noffice and get our flu shot. But for many people, flu can be a matter \nof life and death. More than 200,000 Americans are hospitalized from \nflu every year. In a mild year, 3,000 Americans who get the flu will \ndie. In a severe year, that toll can rise to almost 50,000.\n  So right now is precisely when the Center for Disease Control should \nbegin monitoring which strains are circulating across the country, \nwhich communities are being hit hardest, so they can isolate it, find \nout what is happening, and keep it from spreading. As long as there is \na shutdown, the CDC is not doing this.\n  This past April, a new strain of flu, H7N9, appeared in China during \ntheir flu season. It is very deadly. Twenty percent of the people who \ngot it died. Thank goodness, we haven't had that outbreak in America; \nbut as long as the CDC is shut down, no one is watching for it. No one \nis monitoring to see if that strain of flu might cause an outbreak \nsomeplace in this country.\n  I say that to tell people we may think everything is just fine and \ndandy. My fellow Congressman from Iowa may say, well, the sky hasn't \nfallen, the roof hasn't caved in. And I hope and pray we don't have an \ninfluenza outbreak. I hope and pray we don't have any serious virus \noutbreaks in the next few days. But viruses don't just wait around for \nthe government to be open.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes of his time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under what order are we proceeding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous consent agreement that \nSenators will speak for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have more to say about the Centers for Disease Control, \nbut I guess I will have to seek my 10 minutes later on in the day.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, if the Senator from Iowa needs a couple of \nminutes to wrap up, I don't think I will take my whole 10 minutes so I \nwould be happy to cede to him a couple of minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. She is very kind. I have at least \nanother 5 to 7 minutes to go. I have some data from CDC that I want to \nput in. So I thank her very much.\n  I have been talking about the Centers for Disease Control and what \nthe shutdown means in terms of monitoring outbreaks, food-borne \noutbreaks, illnesses, virus outbreaks--and that is not happening now.\n  I want to turn to another thing; that is, what CDC is and how CDC \nkeeps Americans safe every day, and that is in food safety.\n  The Centers for Disease Control has stopped its epidemiological work \nto identify potential outbreaks and link the outbreak to a food source. \nI can't tell you what might be missed while the CDC is shut down. I can \ngive a few examples where recently the CDC has sounded the alarm and \nkept Americans safe.\n  Only 12 days ago, 162 people in 10 States became ill with hepatitis A \nas a result of eating contaminated frozen berries--the kinds of mixed \nberries you get in the grocery store freezer department. The States are \nas far apart as Arizona, California, New Jersey, Hawaii, and Wisconsin, \nbut because of the expertise of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, they were able to go out, get this secured, recall the \nfood, and trace it down. They traced it, believe it or not, to some \npomegranate seeds that came from Turkey--not America but Turkey. This \nis another way in which the Centers for Disease Control protects the \nsafety of Americans.\n  In August cyclospora infected 643 people who ate a particular salad \nmix in 25 States. A lot of people may remember that. The outbreak was \nfirst identified in my home State of Iowa. They immediately called the \nCenters for Disease Control, and then the CDC got a hold of other \nStates. The next place it popped up was Texas--Iowa, then Texas. They \ntraced it. CDC put its detectives, as I call them, to work. They \nisolated this salad mix, and it was traced to a place in Mexico. It was \nrecalled. Yes, 643 people got sick, but we stopped it before it spread \nany further and before anybody died. That is what the CDC did.\n  Now, because of the government shutdown, CDC has stopped.\n  I hope there is not another outbreak like this, but one never knows. \nBut the detectives on the CDC epidemiology team are now furloughed. \nWhat does that mean for the safety of Americans?\n  When the Congressman from Iowa on the other side said: Well, you \nknow, the sky hasn't fallen and the roof hasn't caved in because the \ngovernment has shut down, implying that it is no big deal, I hope and \npray we don't have a virus outbreak, a bacteria outbreak, or a food-\nborne outbreak such as I just mentioned. Well, will food contamination \nhappen tomorrow? Will a flu outbreak happen this weekend?\n  I have heard people say: We shouldn't be too concerned about the \nshutdown. It might last only a few days.\n  To those I ask, how many days can we afford to lose when a virus \nemerges? In those few days, how many people will buy and eat a \ncontaminated product? How many more people will catch the flu, West \nNile virus, hepatitis or E. coli? I could go on and on. How long can we \nafford to put a blindfold on the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention?\n  I am not trying to unduly frighten anybody, but I am telling the \nfacts. What I said here happened recently. This is not mythological. \nThis is not maybe. These things actually happened within the last few \nweeks in America. People got sick. People lost work.\n  Again, we have to be concerned. Yes, maybe the sky hasn't fallen or \nthe roof hasn't caved in. Is that what we have to have happen before we \nreopen the government? I say to that Congressman from Iowa, is that \nwhat has to happen--must a lot of people have to get sick, or do lot of \npeople have to die? Then maybe we will say: Oh, I guess now we have to \nreopen the government. What a terrible way to run a government.\n  In another area--and again I am talking about things under my \njurisdiction as the chair of this committee--the Social Security \nAdministration furloughed 18,000 Federal employees and Social Security \nofficers across the country--29 percent of the agency's workforce.\n  I suppose some would say: Well, so what. They are just bureaucrats.\n  Let's take a look at them. Checks will still go out, Social Security \nchecks will still go out, disability and retirement claims will still \ncome in, but that is it. What that will mean is delays in basic \nservices for the 180,000 people who visit a Social Security office \nevery day in America or the 445,000 people who call Social Security \noffices every day who have a problem, who have a question, maybe a lost \ncard. Need I mention what it means when you have a lost Social Security \ncard, don't have that ID, trying to get some health care services or \nsomething else and you don't have your Social Security card? Some \n22,000 Americans a day file for retirement benefits. Twelve thousand a \nday apply for disability benefits.\n\n  As I said, Social Security will continue to accept those, but nothing \nwill happen. That means the backlog piles up and piles up and piles up \nevery day. Twenty-two thousand a day file for retirement benefits. They \ncan file it, but nothing happens. So that just builds up day after day \nafter day, and the backlog gets worse.\n\n[[Page S7131]]\n\n  It already takes about 13 months, on average, to get a decision on an \nappeal for disability benefits. With this shutdown, it is going to be \nlonger. It is going to be 14 months, 15 months and 18 months, and on \nand on. If you need a new Social Security card, sorry. As long as there \nis a shutdown, you can't get one. You cannot get a new Social Security \ncard. If you need to replace your Medicare card, tough luck, you are \ngoing to have to wait a long time.\n  The Department of Labor staff, who investigate worker violations such \nas wage theft, will be at home instead of on the job. Some worker \nprotection staff are still on the job but they are only looking at the \nhighest risk facilities or responding after an accident has occurred. \nThis isn't acceptable.\n  Take, for example, MSHA, the Mine Safety Health Administration. It is \nunable to conduct all of its required inspections because of the \nshutdown. How many safety and health violations won't be identified and \ncorrected? How many miners are at risk of lifelong injuries and \nillnesses because of this shutdown?\n  As someone remarked the other day: You know, these mine operators, \nthey can smell a mine inspector 2 miles away. Well, now, what are these \nmine operators going to do, when we know what their track record has \nbeen in the past, violating safety precautions? When they know they are \nnot going to get inspected, will they ramp up production? They will get \nas much out of their miners as they can and they won't worry about the \nsafety because the inspectors aren't coming around. How many miners \nwill have their health affected or will be injured? I certainly hope \nnot die, but you never know. That is just at the Department of Labor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator has used 10 \nminutes. I apologize for interrupting him.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 more minutes.\n  Mr. President, it is not just our current workforce that is impacted \nby this stalemate. The government shutdown is also threatening to shut \nthe door at Head Start classrooms. This month, grants for 22 Head Start \nproviders are scheduled to be renewed. These are simply continuations \nof existing grants. The providers have already enrolled children. But \nafter a shutdown, this funding will be cut off. As a result, 18,000 \nchildren and families that those programs serve are going to be losing \naccess to early childhood education services this month--this month--\nthis month.\n  As I said, I could go on and on, but I just wanted to point out how \npeople are being affected by this shutdown. It may not be visible to \nall, but it is there, and it is hurtful to them and their families and \nto our country. This shutdown needs to stop. It is time for cooler \nheads to prevail. It is time to end this mindless, damaging, \npreventable shutdown.\n  There is one simple way to do it. All the Speaker of the House has to \ndo is bring up a clean continuing resolution which is sitting over \nthere right now--bring it to the floor of the House. The votes are \nthere to pass it, and the government will be back in business tomorrow. \nIf he did that, the shutdown would be over, and Americans would know \ntheir safety and health--everything from food to illnesses to viruses \nto bacteria and food safety--will again be protected by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention. We would know the research and the \noperations of the National Institutes of Health will continue. We would \nknow our workers will be safe once again on the job because of the \nDepartment of Labor. We would know our Social Security offices will be \nopen and running and will be able to process claims and issue new \nSocial Security cards and Medicare cards.\n  I just want to make it very clear there are a lot of people being \nhurt by this. They may not be on the front lines or highly visible, but \nthey are out there and they are being hurt today. It is a shameful, \nshameful comment on a great nation like ours that we continue this \ngovernment shutdown, hurting so many people in this country.\n  With that I yield the floor.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, as I said before--and I said certainly as \nI came to this floor last week--governing by crisis is no way to run a \ngovernment. We simply have to get our act together and work together to \nget the government funded again, to not lose the forest for the trees \nin terms of addressing the fiscal challenges our country faces, to come \nup with a fiscally responsible plan that puts our Nation first and puts \nus on a path to economic security. And, frankly, we have wasted too \nmuch time and energy on political brinkmanship and self-inflicted \nfiscal crises that also keep us from focusing on the real challenges we \nface, including our $17 trillion in debt, an economy that could be much \nstronger than it is right now to create the best climate for jobs in \nthis country.\n  As I came to this floor last week, I reiterated my strongly held \nopposition to ObamaCare because I have seen the impact, hearing from \nbusinesses and individuals in New Hampshire concerned about rising \nhealth care costs. In New Hampshire, we only have one insurer that will \nbe on the exchange, and 10 of our 26 hospitals will be excluded from \nthe exchange.\n  But I also said last week that shutting down the government in an \nattempt to defund ObamaCare was not a winning strategy for success. \nWhy? We have already seen exhibit A why it was not a winning strategy \nfor success--because the government shut down yesterday and the \nObamaCare exchanges opened and continued anyway. Why is that? We knew \nin advance that the Congressional Research Service had told us that the \nmandatory funding piece that was put in ObamaCare would continue even \nif the government were to shut down. We have seen that happen.\n  While I continue to believe this law is wrong for America because it \nis causing rising health care costs, because of the notion--in fact, I \nthink it was well said recently by the chairman of the board of \ntrustees of the Frisbie Memorial Hospital, who originally supported the \nAffordable Care Act but recently came to say: I supported it because we \nwere told we could keep our doctor, and that has turned out to be a \nlie.\n  I certainly want to work with my colleagues to do whatever I can to \ncome up with ways that we can repeal ObamaCare, replace it with reforms \nthat are actually going to drive down health care costs, allow people \nto keep their physicians, and foster more competition in the insurance \nsector to give people more choice, but we need to end where we are \nright now. We need to come to a resolution to keep this government \nfunded in a fiscally responsible way.\n  I am glad congressional leaders are going to speak to the President \ntonight. We do not need another photo op. What we need is results. We \nneed both sides of the aisle working together to negotiate, to come up \nwith a plan to fund the government, to move forward, to find common \nground.\n  I know there is some common ground in areas of ObamaCare that both \nsides of the aisle are concerned about--for example, the medical device \ntax. When we had the budget votes earlier this year, the vote was 79 to \n20 to repeal the medical device tax. Members on both sides of the aisle \ndecided that tax was not good for innovation, for jobs, and that it \ndrives up health care costs. That is an area where we have had some \ncommon ground in how we can affect this health care law--a health care \nlaw I still deeply oppose, but it is time for us to make sure we can \nget the government funded again.\n  Why? In my home State of New Hampshire right now, at the Portsmouth \nNaval Shipyard--one of our Nation's four public shipyards--the skilled \nworkers there are being put in jeopardy. They have a very important \nfunction to defend our Nation, to maintain our Virginia-class \nsubmarines. Yet, due to the government shutdown, more than 1,700 \nworkers at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard are being furloughed. Instead \nof maintaining our submarine fleet and defending our Nation, they are \nworried about their paychecks. It is wrong.\n  For our National Guard, more than 330 of our New Hampshire National \nGuard military technicians are being furloughed. These individuals lost \n25 to 30 percent of their pay this summer when they were furloughed \nbecause of sequestration. This is no way to treat Americans who are \nhelping defend our country. They play a critical role in the operations \nof our Guard. Yet we are also being told that the New Hampshire Air \nNational Guard--if they do\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\nnot receive more furlough exceptions, they may have to shut down their \nair-refueling and air-bridge operations to Europe and the Middle East. \nThis is about the defense of our Nation. Many of them canceled their \ncivilian job days at work to come to their drill weekend this weekend, \nwhich is now being canceled, so they are losing those days of pay as \nwell.\n  Yesterday I was answering my phones. I had a constituent call me \nsaying that his family had saved for years for a vacation, that it was \ngoing to cost them $25,000 to $30,000, and they were at the Grand \nCanyon. They said: Senator Ayotte, what is going on? We took our kids \nout of school for 2 weeks, we saved for years for this vacation, and we \ncannot go down into the canyon.\n  We must get this resolved, and we must look for common ground on both \nsides of the aisle to negotiate this, to get a responsible fiscal plan \nfor the Nation.\n  By the way, we are fighting about 6 weeks of a continuing resolution \nright now. Give me a break. We should be looking at long-term funding \nfor this Nation, not 6 weeks. To have this kind of impasse over 6 \nweeks? I can understand why the American people are frustrated and \nangry.\n  All I can say is that tonight, as congressional leaders on both sides \nof the aisle meet with the President of the United States, we do not \nneed any more posturing. Let's give up the blame game on both sides. No \nmore photo ops. You have all seen enough photo ops at this point. Come \nout of that meeting with results. Yes, results means that both sides \nare going to have to negotiate. Both sides are not going to get \neverything they want, but that is what people do in their daily lives. \nThat is what I know people in New Hampshire do to resolve their \ndifferences. That is what the American people expect of us.\n  I hope this ends soon so we can move forward on behalf of this great \nNation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. On Tuesday at midnight, the Federal Government shut its \ndoors, closed for all but the most essential business concerning \nnational security and the safety of the American people.\n  Mr. President, you know Vermonters, like Americans in every State and \ntown of this country, are frustrated. They are angry and confused. They \nhave seen Congress's inability to do its job and keep the government \nrunning. They have seen us pass a budget--we passed a continuing \nresolution here in the Senate--and a small group in the House of \nRepresentatives, a small group of Republicans said: No, we have to have \neverything we want or nothing.\n  Visual consequences of the shutdown can be found around Washington, \nwhere museums and national monuments are barricaded. But it is more \nthan just that. It is more than that.\n  In the States, national parks and national refuges have closed their \ngates and thousands of Federal offices are shuttered. We heard this \nmorning in the Senate Judiciary Committee from the Director of the \nNational Security Agency, Keith Alexander, that as ``each day goes by, \nthe impact and the jeopardy [of a shutdown] to the safety and security \nof this country will increase.'' That is true, but the toll of \nthis needless exercise is just beginning to be felt.\n\n  While some decry Federal spending as though it were some kind of \ncommunicable disease, millions of American families--Republicans, \nDemocrats, Independents--rely on government-supported programs that \nprovide the very lifeline keeping them afloat. Key nutrition programs \nlike the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program support 100,000 \nVermonters. Another 1,600 children and families benefit from Head \nStart. They are the ones who are going to create and run our jobs in \nthe next generation. More than 117,000 seniors are enrolled in \nMedicare, and close to 200,000 Vermonters are enrolled in Medicaid. \nThese Vermonters will continue to receive assistance through the \nshutdown, but at what pace, when and for how long is uncertain. They do \nnot know how long this is going to continue.\n  The shutdown is hurting in other areas, too. Buyers hoping to \npurchase a home with a loan from the Federal Housing Administration \nwill be turned away. Can you imagine that ripple effect, when real \nestate has finally started to pick back up?\n  What they are saying is: oh, the economy; we worry about the economy. \nThey are trying to kill the economy by not letting the Federal Housing \nAdministration work.\n  Our Nation's readiness to respond is threatened. In Vermont alone, \n450 technicians in the National Guard were furloughed yesterday, and \nanother 100 were released from active orders. That has a financial \neffect, of course, but the national security effects are amazing.\n  In Vermont we have a lot of agriculture. For farmers in Vermont \nrequiring assistance from the Department of Agriculture, there is no \none in the field and no one in the office; over 200 USDA workers--who, \nespecially at this time of the year, are there to help Vermonters--have \nbeen forced to close up shop as a result of the shutdown.\n  WIC, the supplemental food program for pregnant women and young \nchildren is 100 percent federally funded; there is only two weeks of \nfunding available in Vermont for the nearly 16,000 participants in the \nState.\n  We will say in two weeks, sorry, child, or sorry, pregnant woman, we \ncannot feed you. Can you just wait until we get our act together? We \nare eating very well, but could you go without food for a few weeks \nbecause we have a few more press conferences and a few more photo ops?\n  What will happen to them? Our Republican colleagues in the House will \nnot say. They apparently do not care.\n  Just yesterday, my office heard from one Vermont organization, Rural \nEdge. With the assistance of the USDA Rural Rental Housing Loan \nProgram, Rural Edge is building much needed affordable rental housing \nin St. Johnsbury, VT. The time has come for Rural Edge to pay their \ncontractor. They have the money, but nobody is home at USDA's Rural \nDevelopment office to authorize the payment, and the work is likely to \nstop. People are apt to be laid off. Winter is going to come, and the \ntime to construct this affordable housing will be lost. This is just \none of countless examples of how this needless shutdown has already \nstarted to impact my State. Every Senator could tell similar stories.\n  Many Americans think a government shutdown is a Washington, D.C. \nproblem, and that the hundreds of thousands of Federal workers \nfurloughed live in or near the Nation's capital. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. Federal agencies operate in all 50 States. We \nknow that. More than 40 Federal agencies operate in Vermont, from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, to the U.S. Postal Service, the \nVeterans Administration to the Department of Defense, the Department of \nAgriculture to the Department of Justice.\n  These agencies employ over over 7,000 people in my little State \nalone. Nearly 1,000 of these employees reported to work on Tuesday only \nto receive a furlough notice. These workers and their families are \nfacing an unnecessary financial hardship, all because a handful of \nideologues in Washington have elected to shut the government down \nrather than come to the table to find an acceptable way to pay our \nbills and respond to the needs of the American people.\n  These people have families. They have mortgages. They have payments. \nThey have medical expenses. Suddenly, we said: Oh, I am sorry, people; \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives--a small segment of them--\nare saying, we are making points for our supporters, so tough for you. \nYou are not going to find an acceptable way to pay your bills. We want \nyou to pay your bills; we are just not going to pay ours.\n  Failing to fund the government does not simply mean Federal workers \nare furloughed and government programs are suspended. No. Revenue \nstreams for the Federal Government also dry up.\n  The Department of Education? Nobody is there to collect on defaulted \nstudent loans.\n  The Department of Justice? Civil fraud investigations and litigation, \nincluding False Claims Act and fraud cases that bring a lot of money \nback to the government, are on hold.\n  They are on hold.\n  The Internal Revenue Service? Audits that recoup millions in owed \ntaxes\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\nare suspended. Billions of American taxpayers' dollars invested across \nthe country and around the world. A shutdown means no one is home \nmonitoring those investments.\n  After ping-ponging a continuing resolution back and forth, the House \nof Representatives has now adopted a piecemeal approach to reopening \nthe government, agency by agency. Cherry-picking the parts of the \ngovernment they want to fund is no way to fulfill our responsibilities \nto the American people. Come on.\n\n  If they really care about having the government going, they should \npass the appropriations bills and go to conference. Let's do it without \nbeing filibustered here by some of their same supporters. Go to \nconference and vote them up or down.\n  If Republicans in the House were so concerned with staffing our \nNational Parks, they should have passed an Interior appropriations bill \nwhich would have funded not only the National Park Service, but also \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, and other \nagencies.\n  They did not.\n  If Republicans in the House want to address funding for individual \nagencies, there is a clear path forward. Let's reopen the government \nand get to the business of passing and conferencing appropriations \nbills in regular order. Let's consider the spending bills that include \nfunding for the National Parks and the Smithsonian, but which also \ninclude funding for wildfire prevention and clean drinking water.\n  Let's consider spending bills that fund the District of Columbia, \nalong with the Treasury and Federal Judiciary.\n  The Democrats in the Senate have passed a continuing resolution to \nfund all Federal agencies and would provide us the time needed to \nconsider a path forward over the next 6 weeks. This is a crisis driven \nby a handful of partisans in the House of Representatives who say: No, \nwe can't do it.\n  Vote after vote, day after day, the Senate has rejected one flawed \nHouse proposal after another, and still the House has not voted on the \nclean continuing resolution passed by the Senate. For a handful of \nHouse members, there is no path to compromise to keep our government \nrunning.\n  We are elected officials sent here to make decisions--not slogans--on \nbehalf of our constituents. We are sent here to make government work \nfor the American people. This Vermonter, like so many others, is sick \nand tired of the politics-as-usual approach that has led to this \nshutdown.\n  Let's come to the table. Let's be grownups and do what we said we ran \nto do. Let's work together for the good of the American people, reopen \nthe government, and find a responsible and reasonable way to get our \nfiscal house in order.\n  It's time for each of us to be a leader, not a sloganeer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today is day 2 of the ongoing government \nshutdown, and negotiations to find a resolution to our differences \nremain at a stalemate. Actually, I don't think we can use the word \n``negotiations'' because you really can't negotiate if there is only \none side at the table. It takes two parties, and there is only one \nparty there. Yesterday Majority Leader Reid made it crystal clear when \nhe blocked the House Republican proposal to sit down and talk. For \nmonths we have heard that Republicans need to sit down and talk--from \nthe Senate. The House sent over a bill to do just that, and the \nmajority leader blocked that.\n  To say that the people in my State are frustrated with this type of \naction is an understatement. Hoosiers and Americans are tired of the \nongoing dysfunction in Washington and the inability of Congress and \nthis administration to do our job. We can't do our jobs if we are not \ntalking to each other and if the White House continues to be absent.\n\n  I recently learned that the President has called congressional \nleaders from both parties to come to the White House. I initially \nthought that was a positive step, but then I heard the news that the \nWhite House has already released a statement saying the President is \ndoing this to reiterate he will not negotiate. So my question is: What \nis the point? Maybe it is a chance for a photo opportunity, but \ncertainly no progress will be made on the stalemate we are addressing \ntoday, tomorrow, and perhaps for weeks ahead.\n  It is ironic that the President is willing to talk and negotiate with \nthe President of Iran or the President of Russia but is unwilling to \nnegotiate with Republicans or Democrats in the Congress. Sadly, this \nhas been the model over at the White House--continued campaigning, \nignoring governing, and assembling pseudo-campaign-like settings to \nblast Republicans. This is not a helpful strategy to achieve a \nresolution to this shutdown.\n  We have seen a series of attempts by House Republicans to send over \nlegislation that would at least fund some of the more dysfunctional \neffects of a shutdown. Fortunately, we agreed we will fund our troops. \nThey are in harm's way. They have families at home who are trying to \npay the mortgage, keep things together, buy food for the kids, save \nmoney for their education. They do all of those things while their \nspouses are overseas defending our country. It would be unconscionable \nto stop their paychecks, and that is the positive step we have taken.\n  House Republicans have also offered a number of other initiatives--\nall of which has been deep-sixed by the majority leader. They are not \neven allowing debate--we can do that in this morning business time--\nunder the bill. We simply have a motion to table which does not even \nallow us an up-or-down vote.\n  I wish to mention two things that the House is going to send over--\nand it may already be here--which is five more proposals and they also \ninvolve our uniformed soldiers. I am a U.S. Army veteran, but I think \nevery American--whether you are a Democrat or Republican, veteran or \nnot--would agree we have a duty to remember, honor, and support those \nwho have sacrificed so much to protect and defend our country. When \nthey complete their service and come home, those veterans deserve to \nreceive the care and support they need.\n  The House has sent over an act called Honoring Our Promise to \nAmerica's Veterans Act. It is a bill that would provide funding for \ndisability payments, the GI bill, education, training, and VA home \nloans under the same conditions as in effect at the end of the just \ncompleted fiscal year.\n  This legislation needs to be brought before us. It needs to be \ndebated, and it needs to be passed--hopefully unanimously. I am asking \nthe majority leader not to deep-six this legislation. This is too \nimportant for our veterans, it is needed, and it should be funded. Any \nattempt to deny this, I believe, would be a great disservice to the men \nand women who dedicated so much and put themselves at so great a risk \nto serve in our military.\n  Another one of those proposals--and there are five, but I will just \ntalk about two--is the Pay Our Guard and Reserve Act. The bill provides \nfunding for the pay and allowances of military personnel in the Reserve \ncomponent who are scheduled to report for duty--many as early as this \nweekend. In Indiana, we have over 20,000 reservists and guardsmen. It \nis the fourth largest Army National Guard in the country and the sixth \nlargest National Guard Force out of all of the 54 States, provinces, \nand territories when it is combined with the Air National Guard.\n  Indiana is home to two Air National Guard wings: the 122nd Fighter \nWing in Fort Wayne and the 181st Intelligence Wing in Terre Haute, as \nwell as the 434th Air Refueling Wing at Grissom Air Reserve Base.\n  The Senate unanimously approved to pay our troops and remove them \nfrom the crossfire of the government shutdown debate.

Mr. President, I rise not to talk about ObamaCare, not \nto talk about a shutdown, not to talk about the debate we have been \ngoing through the last couple of days but, rather, I rise to talk about \na man by the name of Chris Carr, who is my chief of staff and has been \nmy chief of staff since I have been in the Senate.\n  Chris will be leaving my office on November 1 to become the \ncommissioner of economic development in the State of Georgia. It is a \ntremendous opportunity for him and my State. While it is a loss for me \npersonally, it is a continuation of economic development in my State, \nwhere my fingerprint still lies because he will be replacing my former \nState director, Chris Cummiskey, who has been the commissioner of \neconomic development in the State of Georgia, which means I will still \nhave that fingerprint there.\n  Chris is a very special person who deserves a tribute on the floor of \nthe Senate for all he has done for me, not just as a Member of the \nSenate or as my chief of staff but as a deep and abiding personal \nfriend.\n  Chris joined me in 2003 when I announced I was going to run to \nreplace Zell Miller, who retired as a Senator from Georgia. Before \nthat, Chris had been an attorney at Alston & Bird for what he always \nrefers to as a 15-minute brief time of period. But he went on from \nthere to be an adviser to the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, and a \ndear friend of ours by the name of T. Rogers Wade, who, by the way, was \nthe executive director for Herman Talmadge and chief of staff years ago \nin the Senate.\n  Chris joined me in 2003 for a great adventure--my race for the \nSenate. He guided us through a primary a lot of people said I couldn't \nwin and a lot of people said I would never win without a runoff. My two \nopponents were a former Congressmen from the State of Georgia and \nHerman Cain, who everybody knows later ran for President of the United \nStates.\n  Georgia is a primary State that requires 50 percent plus 1 in terms \nof votes. So we had to get 50 percent plus 1 in a Republican primary. \nWe did that without a runoff because of Chris's leadership, his \ndynamics, and his hard work in how he guided that campaign.\n  We won the general election by 58.8 percent. I brought Chris to \nWashington, DC, to be my chief of staff in my office, and he has done a \nphenomenal job. He has traveled with me to Africa--as the Presiding \nOfficer knows because he has been with us on some of these trips. He \nhas guided me through difficult times in my journey from the \nForeign Relations Committee to the Finance Committee to the Commerce \nCommittee. He has been a great guiding hand.\n\n  Most important, he brought together a staff that has been loyal, \ndedicated, and gotten the job done for the people of the State of \nGeorgia.\n  Chris is a great Georgian. He is what we refer to in our State as a \n``double dawg.'' He graduated with his undergraduate degree from the \nUniversity of Georgia--which I might add beat LSU very handily last \nSaturday--and then went to law school at the University of Georgia to \nget his second degree, a bachelor of law degree from the University of \nGeorgia.\n  After that he went on, as I said, to Austin & Bird, and then to the \nPublic Policy Foundation, but he has been with me ever since--almost a \ndecade. During that period of time, he has served me as chief of staff. \nMy deputy chief of staff, Joan Kirchner, will be replacing him as chief \nof staff, so we will have a continuity of service in our office.\n  I know I would not be where I am today if it weren't for Chris Carr. \nI know the State of Georgia is going to go places it never thought it \nwould go because of his guiding leadership as commissioner of economic \ndevelopment.\n  So for a brief minute on the floor of the Senate, I wish to pay \ntribute to a friend, a chief of staff, a leader, someone who has had a \npositive influence on my life but, most importantly has had a positive \ninfluence on his country, the United States America.\n  I am thankful to Chris Carr for his support and thankful for all he \nhas done for my State, my country, and our office.\n  I yield back my time and defer to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding, and I ask \nunanimous consent to address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/02/senate-section/article/S7134-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7134-S7139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, in Vermont and all across this country \nthere is huge frustration with what is going on in Washington. It is \nclear to me that with the middle class of this country disappearing, \nwith millions of Americans working longer hours for lower wages, with \npoverty today at an alltime high in terms of the number of people \nliving in poverty, with young people graduating college deeply in debt \nand others not having the resources to go to college, with real \nunemployment at close to 14 percent, youth unemployment higher than \nthat, minority unemployment very high, an infrastructure that is \ncollapsing, with the IPCC, the scientists all over the world who are \nstudying global warming and telling us we have a planetary crisis that \nmust be addressed by cutting greenhouse gas emissions, what people are \nseeing is that we have all these problems affecting them, their kids, \nand the planet, and in the Congress we cannot even get a budget passed.\n  People are angry in Vermont and across the country and they are \nfrustrated. I know many people are saying a plague on everybody; you \npeople are all terrible.\n  I just hope we can go a little bit beyond that and try to understand, \nin fact, what is happening and what the cause of this terrible \ngovernment shutdown is and why 800,000 decent people who happen to work \nfor the Federal Government are not at work, are not earning a paycheck, \nand are scared to death about how they are going to provide for their \nfamilies or take care of other basic needs.\n  How did it happen? I think, very simply, what we should understand is \nthat the Senate passed a conservative budget--continuing resolution--\nuntil November 15. It was much lower than I had wanted. In fact, it is \na Republican budget. It includes this terrible sequestration--something \nI strongly opposed--that was passed as a compromise gesture, and it was \nsent to the House.\n  Here is the most important point people need to understand in terms \nof what is going on in Congress: Right now, according to a very \nknowledgeable source, the House of Representatives has the votes to \npass a clean continuing resolution, the bill that was passed in the \nSenate. They have the votes. It is not a question of the Speaker coming \nforward and saying: Gee, I just don't have the votes. They have the \nvotes.\n  The political problem is that the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives has chosen to be the Speaker of the Republican Party, \nnot of the whole House of Representatives. What is happening is he has \n30 or 40 extreme rightwing people who are absolutely insistent that \nthey want to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare. \nThe only way they will support any budget is if there is language in it \nthat defunds ObamaCare.\n  The reason we cannot support that language is not just because \nObamaCare was passed close to 4 years ago and signed by the President \nand it is the law of the land, it is not just because the U.S. Supreme \nCourt ruled that it was constitutional, it is not just because there \nwas an election held last year in November in which this was perhaps \nthe major issue and the President won reelection by 5 million votes--\nand in the Senate the Republicans lost two seats and in the House they \nlost some seats--the real reason we cannot accept that language is that \nwe would begin to accept a terrible precedent.\n  What the precedent would be is that it doesn't matter what happens in \nan election. It doesn't matter what happens in terms of the normal \nlegislative\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\nprocess of the Congress. What we would be saying is that a small group \nof people can blackmail the American people and hold the American \npeople hostage unless they get their way.\n  If they are successful in succeeding in terms of what they want to do \nright now, I can absolutely guarantee that in 2 weeks, when this \nCongress and the White House are going to have to deal with the debt \nceiling and the question of whether, for the first time in the history \nof the United States of America, we do not pay our bills, the money we \nowe, we could drive the American financial system and the world's \nfinancial system into what economists are describing as a catastrophic \nsituation. Nobody knows what will happen. It has never occurred before, \nthat the largest economy in the world would say, We are deadbeats; we \nare not paying our bills. But some economists believe this could have a \nhuge impact all over the world: financial chaos, significant shrinkage \nof GDPs all over the world--gross domestic products--more and more \nunemployment, at a moment when the world's financial system is already \nfragile.\n\n  People don't have to believe Bernie Sanders in saying that. \nIronically, we have all of these guys on Wall Street--no friends of \nmine. We have the Chamber of Commerce and all the multizillion-dollar \nbusinesses, saying to the Republicans: Don't do it. Don't take us over \nthe edge; it will have a catastrophic impact on the economy.\n  When we talk about what is going on here, I don't want people to take \nmy word for it. I have a political position and people know what that \nis. But I want you to hear what some responsible Republicans are saying \nabout the reckless actions taking place in the House. I am not going to \nread them all, but let me read just a few. These statements are what \nRepublicans are saying about the House Republican attempt to attach \nObamaCare to the budget resolution and bring the U.S. Government to a \nshutdown.\n  Saxby Chambliss, Republican Senator from the State of Georgia, who is \nno friend of ObamaCare, says:\n\n       I'd love to defund ObamaCare too, but shutting down the \n     government and playing into the hands of the President \n     politically is not the right thing to do. Plus, it is going \n     to do great harm on the American people if we pursue that \n     course. We have been there; it didn't work.\n\n  Dan Coats, Republican from Indiana, on the floor a moment ago:\n\n       Here's the hard truth. President Obama will not overturn \n     his signature legislation so long as he is President and the \n     Democrats have control of the Senate. Along with these \n     political realities, refusing to pass legislation to keep the \n     government funded will not stop ObamaCare from going into \n     effect.\n\n  Representative Peter King, Republican from New York, in the House:\n\n       We should not be closing down the government under any \n     circumstances. That doesn't work. It's wrong, and you know, \n     ObamaCare care passed. We have to try to defund it. We have \n     to try to find ways to repeal it, but the fact is we \n     shouldn't be using it as a threat to shut down the \n     government.\n\n  Many more Republicans are saying the same.\n  What we believe right now is that a significant majority in the House \nof Representatives today is prepared to end the shutdown if the Speaker \nwill give them the opportunity.\n  Interestingly enough, while we have great discussions here about \nObamaCare and many of my Republican friends come to the floor to say \nhow terrible it is, the American people are today in a sense voicing \ntheir opinion on ObamaCare all over this country--in their homes and in \ntheir offices all across America. Nationally, more than 10 million \nAmericans have gone onto the Web site healthcare.gov and other Web \nsites to look for affordable health insurance plans under ObamaCare or \nto receive more information--10 million Americans in a 2-day period.\n  The truth of the matter is 48 million Americans have no health \ninsurance--something my Republican friends forget. Many of them are \npaying much more than they can afford for health insurance. So, yes, \npeople want an opportunity to get insurance if they don't have it and \nthey want an opportunity to get more affordable insurance if they can. \nSo while these guys are talking about ending ObamaCare, millions and \nmillions of people all across the country are trying to find out how \nthey can get into the program, and these guys are saying, Well, we \ndon't care what millions of people want; we are going to defund it.\n  I mentioned 10 million people have gone to the Federal Web site. In \nmy small State of Vermont, more than 13,000 people have visited our \nAffordable Care Act Web site. California, if we can believe this--one \nState--has reported 5 million visits to its Affordable Care Act Web \nsite. In Kentucky, more than 78,000 visitors have gone to its \nAffordable Care Act Web site. Importantly, Kentucky is the only State \nin the South that has chosen to participate fully in ObamaCare by both \nexpanding Medicaid and operating a State-level health insurance \nexchange.\n  In New York State, almost 10 million people visited the Web site on \nthe first day.\n  So, to nobody's surprise, if people don't have any health insurance, \nor if people today have health insurance they cannot afford, and they \nare given an opportunity to come into a program which provides them \nwith some help, people are taking advantage of it.\n  As millions and millions of people are trying to figure out how they \ncan get into the system, we have our Republican friends over in the \nHouse who are saying, No, we want to defund it; we don't want to give \npeople that opportunity.\n  There is a Web site called nationofchange.org, a very good Web site. \nI wish to read some of the headlines they have assembled about how \npeople are responding to the Affordable Care Act. In Connecticut: \n``Health Care Plans Begin: 28,000-plus Go Online to State \nMarketplace.''\n  Georgia: ``Enrollment Sites Are Swamped On First Day,'' according to \nthe Augusta Chronicle.\n  Idaho: ``Idaho Health Exchange Launches With Few Hiccups,'' Idaho \nStatesman.\n  Indiana: ``Insurance Marketplace Draws Strong Early Interest,'' from \nJournal and Courier.\n  Kentucky: ``Kynect Opens To High Demand,'' the Courier-Journal.\n  Maine: ``Insurance Marketplace Opens To Flood of Interest.''\n  Delaware: ``Off And Running In New Market: Website Overwhelmed On \nFirst Day Of Access.''\n  Michigan: ``Insurance Exchange Debut Draws Millions,'' the Detroit \nNews.\n  New Mexico: ``ObamaCare: Plenty Of Interest, a Bevy Of Computer \nSnags.''\n  On and on and on.\n  Colorado: ``Heavy Traffic Slows Health Website On Debut Day.''\n  All across the country, to nobody's great surprise, people who have \nno health insurance are saying, Yes, we don't want to go throughout \nlife worrying about whether we are going to go bankrupt or whether we \nare going to be able to go to a doctor, and they are trying to get more \ninformation about the Affordable Care Act, and they are signing up in \nhuge numbers--higher than people had anticipated.\n  Our Republican friends in the House are saying, We don't care that on \nthe first day 10 million people expressed interest in this legislation. \nWe want to end it. We want to end it.\n  It passed. It is the law. Millions of people are signing up, gaining \ninformation. And they are saying, We will continue to shut down the \nU.S. Government, deny a paycheck to 800,000 American workers; we don't \ncare what happens to them, unless we get our way. And right here in the \nSenate--and in the House--we have sensible Republicans who are saying \nwhat is obvious: You don't have to agree with ObamaCare. I don't agree \nwith ObamaCare. I think it needs to be improved. I believe in a \nMedicare-for-all, single-payer program. But at least ObamaCare is \nproviding health insurance to some 20 million Americans today who do \nnot have it.\n\n  I think it is important to make a point that is not being made often \nenough in terms of putting what is going on today with this shutdown in \na broader context. Of course we can have an argument over ObamaCare. I \ndon't think it is perfect; I want to see it improved. But where our \nextreme rightwing friends in the House are coming from is a lot more \nthan trying to end ObamaCare. Everybody needs to understand this, and I \nthink there is too little discussion on this issue. What we are looking \nat is a small group of people--these are tea party folks, rightwing \nextremist people--people who are\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\nfunded by billionaires such as the Koch brothers who are worth some $71 \nbillion, and I want to tell my colleagues what their vision is for \nAmerica, because this is not just about ObamaCare. It is a vision for \nAmerica and what these guys want to accomplish. For them, I should \nsay--and some of them have been quite public about it--shutting down \nthe government is great. It is great because they don't believe in the \nconcept of government.\n  I think one of the good sources we can use to get a clue as to where \nthese rightwing extremists are coming from is the Texas Republican \nParty platform of 2010. I want to use that. I could use other sources, \nbut Texas is a very large State. Texas is today controlled by very \nconservative Republicans. And the truth is that the party platform of \nTexas, of one State, ends up being the--the ideas in it end up being \nadopted more or less by Republicans here in the Congress and all over \nthe country. What they say is--this is not some small fringe group. I \nam not finding some whacko group out there. This is the State of Texas \nRepublican Party platform of 2012.\n  I want to be very clear in telling my colleagues what this platform \nthey have is about. These are the ideas by and large that our rightwing \nextremist friends believe in. It is about a lot more than ObamaCare. \nThis is what the 2012 Republican Party platform states:\n\n       We support an immediate and orderly transition to a system \n     of private pensions based on the concept of individual \n     retirement accounts, and gradually phasing out the Social \n     Security tax.\n\n  Well, if we phase out the Social Security tax, we are ending Social \nSecurity. Goodbye, Social Security. In my view, Social Security is \nprobably the most important program ever passed by this U.S. \nGovernment. Today, over 50 million people are in the Social Security \nsystem. Social Security has gone a very long way in lowering poverty \nfor senior citizens. Before Social Security, it was close to 50 \npercent; now it is somewhere around 10 percent. We have a long way to \ngo to get that number lower, but we have made real progress.\n  What they are saying is they want to eliminate Social Security \nfunding, eliminate Social Security, and when they do that, I am not \nquite sure what happens to a working person when that person is 67, 68, \n75 years of age. No Social Security. And for people who doubt me, go to \nthe Texas Republican Party platform. I just read exactly their quote.\n  This is the other thing they want to do--and I speak now as the proud \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. We have \noversight over what the Veterans' Administration is doing. Within the \nVeterans' Administration right now, we have about 152 VA hospitals, we \nhave some 900 community-based outreach clinics, we have hundreds of vet \ncenters. In my view, they are providing not perfect but pretty good \nhealth care for the veterans of America, some 6 million of whom are now \nwithin the VA health care system. It is something I believe we should \nexpand. I think we should make VA health care available to every \nveteran in this country.\n  This is what the Texas Republican Party platform says:\n\n       We support the privatization of veteran's healthcare.\n\n  I am not quite sure what that means, but it means ending the VA \nsystem as we know it because the VA is a government-funded system. If \nyou privatize it--you can do it in a million ways--but, most likely, it \nsounds to me as though you would give veterans a voucher, something \nsimilar to what the Republicans in the House wanted to do with \nMedicare. Give people a sum of money. Go out, find the doctor or \nhospital you need. I think that is a terrible idea for the veterans of \nthis country. But, again, I quote the Texas Republican Party platform \nof 2012:\n\n       We support the privatization of veteran's healthcare.\n\n  Another plank in terms of what they want:\n\n       We support abolishing all federal agencies whose activities \n     are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution; \n     including the Departments of Education and Energy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Did I have a time limit? I was not aware there was a \ntime limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The only time remaining is for Republicans.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I see. Let me conclude, if I may. I ask unanimous \nconsent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me say this: This debate is a lot bigger than \nwhether the Republicans are successful in shutting down the government \nbecause of their insistence that ObamaCare be defunded. This debate is \nabout whether a minority of the people in the House of Representatives \nis able to blackmail and hold hostage the American people and the U.S. \nCongress and the President and say: If we do not get our way, we do not \ncare what happens to 800,000 workers and the millions of people who \ndepend on government services. We do not care. It is our way or the \nhighway. And in 2 weeks, these same people, I assure you, will be \nsaying: We do not care if there is an international financial collapse, \nmaybe the loss of millions of jobs. We do not care unless we get our \nway.\n  To surrender to that approach would be a horrible precedent because I \ncan guarantee you absolutely that if we move down that path of \ngovernment, they will be back again and again, and maybe next year it \nis: We are going to shut down the government unless you abolish Social \nSecurity; we are going to shut down the government unless you end the \nconcept of the minimum wage because we do not believe in the minimum \nwage.\n  I hope that Speaker Boehner becomes the Speaker of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and not just for the Republican Party. Let the Members \nof the House vote. And if they do, I believe this government will be \nreopened within hours.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will respond to a couple points my \ncolleague from Vermont referred to. If one looks at the votes on \neverything that has come to the Senate thus far, I think the lowest \nvote total was 221, which is a majority of the House. A majority of the \nHouse spoke. What we do with it is our business here in the Senate. So \nit is not necessarily a minority of the minority. If it were, you would \nnot have 221 votes. That is the first point I make.\n  The second: I do not know what the Texas Republican Party's platform \nis. But yours truly has thought that one of the things we ought to do \nfor veterans is to give them real health care rather than promise them \nhealth care and then make them travel 200 miles to get it.\n  So part of privatization is giving veterans who have service-\nconnected health care available to them a card that says you can go \nwherever you want so you do not have to travel--like in Oklahoma, if \nyou are going to have a knee operation--145 miles to the VA center in \nOklahoma City. You can actually get it done by an orthopedist who has a \nwhole lot more experience than a local hospital, paid for at Medicare \nrates.\n  So the point is, there are options that will give our veterans better \naccess than they have now. I do not know if that is what they are \ntalking about. But that was part of the Patient's Choice Act that was \nnever considered by the Senate.\n  I want to spend some time talking about where we are and why we are \nhere, and then I want to talk about the continuing resolution, whether \nit has something attached to it or not.\n  As I look at the process, what I see us stuck on has to do with a \nprinciple that has been true throughout our Nation. When you do big \nthings in government, the only way those things are successful is when \nthey are done in a bipartisan manner. To quote Daniel Patrick Moynihan: \nHistoric laws don't pass barely. They pass 70-to-30 or they fail. They \neither fail in implementation or they fail in acceptance by the \nAmerican public.\n  I applaud the vigor of my friends in opposing the Affordable Care \nAct. As a practicing physician, I see what this is ultimately going to \ndo. As the majority leader has spoken, the whole idea behind this--and \nI think my colleague from Vermont would concur--is for a\n\n[[Page S7137]]\n\nsingle-payer government system as a better solution.\n  Certainly what we had was not working well. I would not disagree with \nthat. But not having a bipartisan health care bill, rather than a \nstrictly partisan health care bill, has probably instigated a lot of \nthe problems we have with this bill, besides the fact that over 62 \npercent of the American public do not favor this bill. They do not want \nthe Government shutdown over it. That is obvious. But we are where we \nare.\n  One of the reasons we are where we are is failed leadership, both by \nRepublicans and Democrats, and a polarization in our country that is \nnot healthy.\n  So we have now said--with 800,000 employees on furlough, having a \nreal but small negative effect on our economy--what has to happen when \nyou have people far apart? What you have to have is leadership that \nsays: I am going to try to solve this problem by brokering toward the \nmiddle. I do not know what that middle is. But what I have not seen yet \nin the leadership, including the President, is a willingness to find \nthe common ground that will move us in a direction that puts us where \nwe need to be.\n  The thing we forget too often in the Senate is that we are all \nAmericans, every one of us. What we do up here matters. It has a \nprofound effect on individual lives. The fact that we find ourselves \nunable to come to a consensus on this very difficult subject is what \nhappens when you have an absence of leadership.\n\n  So it is great that the President is meeting or has met with the \nleaders of the House and the Senate. It would be great if they spent \ntime working on a solution rather than giving press reports after the \nmeeting. It would be good for all Americans if we were not in a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  The very premise that you can get the President and those who have \nfoisted the Affordable Care Act--which I think will be highly \nunaffordable for our children and us--to change this law at this time \nis probably not going to happen.\n  But there has to be a way for a continuation of dialog rather than to \nsay: We will not consider anything. So the House today is going to \noffer up several bills that will actually take care of very great \nnecessities of this country. It will be unfortunate if we do not \nconsider them. We can vote them down. But not considering is not \ntalking. It is not reaching across and trying to find a solution. It is \nhardening positions.\n  I would think the American people would want us to take a timeout and \nsay: What are you doing? What is your job? I recently got a letter from \nthe Liberty Foundation of America, from a man I greatly respect, Dr. \nDavid Brown, a renowned orthopedist in Oklahoma. What he is saying to \npeople in America today is a recognition of the failure of our \nleadership.\n  I ask unanimous consent his letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            The Liberty Foundation of America,\n\n                            Oklahoma City, OK, September 30, 2013.\n     Subject: An Open Letter to the Leadership of the United \n         States of America.\n       To Whom It May Concern: The vast majority of the American \n     people oppose the Affordable Care Act, many because the \n     measure is proving to be quite unaffordable. We have a nation \n     falling off the edge of the fiscal cliff, and the best our \n     government can do is have our President assure the people \n     that our deficit has decreased in its growth rate--meaning we \n     are still going broke but luckily at a slower pace than \n     before. We have an extremely dysfunctional federal \n     government; the two legislative branches can't put aside \n     differences to accomplish anything positive for the country, \n     the executive is merely interested in popularity and amassing \n     power, and the judiciary has forgotten how to read the \n     Constitution. It has been stated, and surely was intended, \n     that we have a representative form of democracy--one ``Of the \n     People, For the People and By the People''--something for \n     which many men and women greater than us made the ultimate \n     sacrifice. Therefore, when the government reaches such a \n     level of dysfunction and incompetence as present, it becomes \n     imperative that the people take over responsibility and \n     monitor that government with essential diligence. Today, our \n     nation has reached a necessary impasse, with countless \n     Washington-based solutions that solve little, if anything. \n     Therefore, it behooves each and every state to monitor their \n     representation in Washington--to the tune of each and every \n     vote--and publicize this information, unedited, so the people \n     can ensure their interests and that of their state are truly \n     represented, as opposed to the vested Washington interests \n     that currently enjoy splendor. The status of our country's \n     ineffective leadership from all three branches and the \n     unsatisfactory biased reporting needs to be bypassed for \n     America to solve her problems.\n       To those elected officials in our nation's capital: Do not \n     follow; lead or get the hell out of the way.\n       To my colleagues in each state-based organization: You are \n     the closest to the grassroots--the people, the voters. Do \n     your duty for the United States of America.\n           Respectfully,\n                                             David R. Brown, M.D.,\n             Trustee; The Liberty Foundation of America, Chairman \n       Emeritus; The Heritage Foundation, Chairman & Founder; The \n                               Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. He makes some profound observations about where we are \nand the lack of leadership. Here is a practicing orthopedist who loves \nhis country, who wants us to solve the problems, who wants us to take \nback control of our government and do what is in the best long-term \ninterests of the country, not what is in the best long-term interests \nof a politician or a political party. I think that is where we have \ngotten off. Everything is measured by the next election rather than by \nthe next generation.\n  Although I do not always agree with my colleagues, as most of them \nknow, I am willing to work and compromise and meet as long as we are \nattaining long-term good goals for our fellow countrymen and for our \nchildren.\n  The other issue I want to talk about is the CR itself, because lost \nin all of this battle is a CR that plays a lot of games on the American \npeople. It is disappointing for me to see that we play games with \nmandatory spending by moving numbers from one year to the next year so \nwe can actually spend more money in a present year.\n  I did not vote to have a sequester because I think it is an idiotic \nway to cut spending. But I do support trimming the spending of the \nFederal Government. As a matter of fact, nobody in the last 9 years has \ndone more to offer amendments, to outline duplication, to outline \nfraud, to outline abuse than I have on the floor of the Senate.\n  So it is one thing to do it stupidly. It is wholly another to \nactually keep your commitments to the American people. The vast \nmajority of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted for the \nBudget Control Act, as did most Republicans. So we have a commitment to \nkeep our word.\n  I will outline to you that--first of all, I will make two points. One \nis that we are not keeping our word with the continuing resolution \ncoming from the House. It actually will spend $38 billion more than \nwhat we promised the American people we would spend. I know in \nWashington $38 billion is not a large amount of money. But the way you \nget rid of trillion-dollar deficits is a billion dollars at a time--or \n$38 billion at a time.\n  I am disheartened we are playing the green-eyeshade and walnut-shell \ngame on the American people with this bill.\n  To make my point, I would like to outline some of the spending and \nsome of the false maneuvers that have been done in what is called \nCHIMPS, which are changes in mandatory program spending.\n  We have a program in the United States called the DOJ Assets \nForfeiture Fund. These are funds that the Justice Department collects \nthat are forfeited by criminals, by people breaking the law, whether it \nbe a car in a drug bust or the money from a drug bust. So what we are \ngoing to do is take that money out of that fund, which goes toward \nthings that actually enforce our law enforcement, and plus that down--\nin other words, steal that money--so we can spend more money somewhere \nelse. That is just $723 million. It is almost $1 billion.\n  More concerning to me is the fact that there is a victims \ncompensation fund in this country--and that is where criminals pay into \na fund to compensate victims--there is $8.9 billion in that fund, \nsupposedly. But last year the appropriators did exactly the same. They \ntook that $8.9 billion and said they would pay it back next year--this \nyear--and they were allowed to spend almost $9 billion more on other \nthings, taking that money that should have been given to victims and \nspending it through the Federal Government.\n  Lo and behold, they did not add the $8.9 billion back this year. They \ncounted the same thing again. So now we have $18 billion of not \ntaxpayer money\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\nbut criminal money that should be going to victims that is now going to \nbe spent on other things, and the victims will not receive the money \nthat is due them through either court orders or judgments.\n  Finally, there is a lot of spending in the bill that most Americans \nwould see as foolish. I thought I would outline just a little bit of \nit.\n  One other point I would make. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office \ncollects fees when you file a patent. For years they have been falling \nfurther and further behind. Thankfully, they got caught up. But the \nmoney that is paid for a patent application has been siphoned off, not \nfor patent applications but for spending on other things. It is a user \nfee. Consequently, now it is over 8 months if you file a patent before \nsomeone ever even looks at that at the Patent Office. It is 27 months \nbefore you get a response. If we are going to get ahead and compete in \nthis competitive world, we have to allow our Patent Office to work. \nThey are taking hundreds of millions of dollars from the Patent and \nTrademark Office.\n  What does the CR spend money on that we really should not? Here are \nsome examples for last year when we spent money that we should not \nhave: funding for the National Science Foundation for the development \nof a Snooki, a robot bird that impersonates a female sage grouse; \nfunding an NSF grant that studies American attitudes toward the \nfilibuster in the Senate; an NSF grant, sitegrabber.com, a new Web site \nto rate the trustworthiness of other Web sites; an NSF grant funding \necoATM, a company commercializing an ATM to give out cash if you give \nthem your old cell phone--that is totally a private separate sector \nventure, yet we are funding that, in an era when we have a $750 billion \ndeficit this year and a $17 trillion debt--an NSF grant paying for \nparticipant expenses to attend an annual snowmobile competition in \nMichigan through 2015.\n  I do not think that is a priority when we are struggling to pay our \nbills.\n  I have a list of Department of Agriculture grants. I will put those \nin the Record.\n  We are still spending $30 billion a year for 47 job training \nprograms, none of which have a metric on them. All but three, according \nto the Government Accountability Office, overlap one another, in other \nwords, do the same thing.\n  There are 20 Federal programs across 12 different Federal agencies \nfor the study of invasive species. I think we should study invasive \nspecies, but I do not think we should have 12 agencies studying them. I \nthink we should have one agency study them. We ought to concentrate the \ndollars so we get good value out of that.\n  We are still sending unemployment checks to people who make more than \n$1 million a year.\n  We have 15 different financial literacy programs, a new one being \ncreated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This is across 15 \ndifferent agencies. We are spending millions on that.\n  We are spending $1 million for NASA to test food that can be eaten on \nMars 30 years from now. I would not think that is a priority.\n  We are spending $4 billion for 250 different grant programs at the \nDepartment of Justice which, as GAO says, has the worst record of any \nagency in terms of monitoring their grants and the veracity and the \ncompliance of those grants.\n  We are spending $3 billion on 209 different programs for science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math across 13 different Federal agencies. \nI think it is fine if we want to incentivize that, but do we really \nneed over 200 programs to do that? No, we do not. But we have not \naddressed any of that. It has been known.\n  We have the GAO out with a report, their third report this year, and \nthey will come with another one next year, outlining at least $250 \nbillion that could be saved by the Federal Government on duplicative \nservices; in other words, multiple agencies doing the same thing, \nstepping on each other.\n  Not one bill has come before this body that addresses that $250 \nbillion expenditure that could be saved every year, not one bill in \nthis session of Congress. So we are having a fight over spending. Yet \nCongress is the very real problem we are having on spending. We need to \nlook at what the real problem is. The real problem is the failure to do \nour job, the failure to look at programs and see if they are effective, \nthe failure to look at programs and see if they are truly a role for \nthe Federal Government as far as the Constitution and as far as common \nsense, a failure to offer substantive changes or have the ability to \noffer substantive changes to those bills.\n  I will conclude with one final remark. The Appropriations Committee \ndid a good job this year, even though at higher levels above the Budget \nControl Act, of getting their bills in order. Only one of those bills \nwas offered on the floor. It was withdrawn when Members of my caucus \nwere not allowed to offer amendments, because it was not going anywhere \nif we were not allowed minority rights to offer amendments to change an \nappropriations bill. So we are doing a continuing resolution to fund \nthe government and handicapping the very employees we are going to ask \nto make good decisions for our country, because we will not pass \nappropriation bills on time. We do not need a budget to pass \nappropriations bills, because we have the Budget Control Act that \nspells out where we are going to be on discretionary spending for the \nnext 10 years. We know what the levels are.\n  Consequently, we end up at an impasse over a continuing resolution--\nover a continuing resolution that says we have not done our job anyway. \nI think what Dr. David Brown says in his letter is quite accurate. \nThere is a total lack of leadership in this city, sitting at the \nexecutive branch, in the House and in the Senate. Only America can \nchange that. I hope it does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to repeat a point \nthat I think is worth repeating, which is that on this second day of \nthe shutdown of our Federal Government, we need to focus more on \nmanufacturing jobs than on manufacturing crises.\n  I have been here as a Senator now just 3 years. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows, and many of my other colleagues know, the folks from \nhome are calling us in record numbers to say they want us to listen to \neach other, to work together, and to try to help to get America back to \nwork.\n  We all remember where we were 5 years ago at the depth of the fiscal \ncrisis, our financial system in collapse and our economy on life \nsupport. Millions lost their jobs and millions more lost their savings. \nWe have begun to recover and to heal. We have had 7\\1/2\\ million jobs \ncreated over the last 42 months, jobless claims are now at a 5-year \nlow, and we have had 9 consecutive quarters of economic growth. I think \nwe need to find ways to work together to continue to sustain that \nforward movement. The shutdown of this government does not help in any \nway.\n  One thing I want to highlight is some good news we have had. We just \nlearned the manufacturing sector grew last month at its fastest pace in \nmore than 2 years. We need to invest in that success and invest in that \ngrowth.\n  In the first decade of this century, we lost 6 million manufacturing \njobs in this country, good-paying jobs, high-skilled jobs, jobs that \ncome with benefits, jobs you can raise a family on. In the last 3 \nyears, we have gained back half a million manufacturing jobs, but we \nare still way short of where we were in 2000.\n  There are a few items we could focus on that would help us grow this \nsector: skills training, opening markets abroad, expanding access to \ncapital, and creating a national manufacturing strategy. I hope to come \nback to the floor and speak to these in much more detail in the days \nahead.\n  Let me close by saying something that I think is simple. A shutdown \nis not the answer to this ongoing economic recovery. Defaulting on our \ndebt is not the answer to what the folks from our home States are \ncalling and asking us to do. The answer is for the Speaker of the House \nto allow the House to vote on a bill passed in this Chamber that, if \nadopted, would reopen the Federal Government and allow us to work \ntogether to revitalize our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7139]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/02/senate-section/article/S7139-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an \norganization that has been providing opportunities for Arkansans that \nare blind or visually impaired since 1940. The Arkansas Lighthouse for \nthe Blind started as a dream of a blind Methodist minister, the late \nRev. Jeff Smith, and became a reality thanks to $100 in donations from \nfriends. Since those humble beginnings, the Arkansas Lighthouse for the \nBlind has grown into a nationally recognized manufacturing business, \nnow employing over 80 people in Little Rock.\n  The Arkansas Lighthouse for the Blind is a partner of the AbilityOne \nProgram, a Federal purchasing program that enables over 47,000 \nAmericans who are blind or severely disabled to work and provides \nproducts and services to Federal and commercial customers. This year \nmarks the 75th anniversary of AbilityOne, and I am pleased to have such \nan important organization promoting the employment and advancement of \npeople who are blind and visually impaired in my State.\n  Today in America, 70 percent of blind and visually impaired working-\naged Americans are not employed. Through the AbilityOne Program, \norganizations like Arkansas Lighthouse for the Blind harnesses the \npurchasing power of the Federal government to provide quality products \nand services from participating community-based nonprofit agencies \ndedicated to training and employing individuals with disabilities. \nThese workers proudly manufacture a wide range of paper, textile, and \napparel products. From the small SKILCRAFT memo pads on our desks, to \nthe shirts on the backs of our men and women in uniform, they are a \npart of our American manufacturing base that keeps our government \nmoving each and every day.\n  I have visited the Arkansas Lighthouse for the Blind and had several \nopportunities to meet with their employees. During each interaction, I \nhave been impressed by the opportunities this organization provides \ntheir associates, both personally and professionally. It is a place \nthat truly lives up to its mission and expands opportunity for persons \nwho are blind throughout the State. I am a proud AbilityOne Champion \nand appreciate this partnership which allows us to work together to \nexpand opportunities for individuals with disabilities.\n  The month of October serves as National Disability Employment \nAwareness Month and I recognize the Arkansas Lighthouse for the Blind, \nas well as the AbilityOne program, for the opportunities they have \nprovided for Americans with disabilities. Americans that have worked \nthrough this program over the years have acquired job skills and \ntraining, received good wages and benefits, as well as gained greater \nindependence and quality of life. It is for this reason that I stand in \nsupport of the work they do each and every day to open doors of \nopportunity for Americans who are blind or visually impaired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/02/senate-section/article/S7139-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7139-S7140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-3273.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today, because \nAmericans all across the country today are speaking out about their \npersonal experiences with the ObamaCare exchanges yesterday. Instead of \nit being as easy as buying something from Amazon, which the President \nhad promised, Americans ran into roadblocks and technical disasters \nState after State.\n  Instead of getting good coverage, their computers crashed. These were \nnot just glitches, they were system failures to the point that in the \nCasper Star Tribune, on the front page today, it was talking about \npeople spending time working their way just trying--on the computer--\none little section had a little cartoon at the bottom. The one guy \nworked so hard trying to work the computer that he ended up getting \ncarpal tunnel syndrome, while trying to get through the computer to \nfind out more about the costs of the Obama health care law through the \nexchanges.\n  The Obama administration has had 3 years to prepare for the launch \nthat occurred on October 1. Even if the technology finally gets fixed, \nthe issue of health care will not. After people finally get a chance to \nexamine what is being offered to them when they make a decision about \nenrolling or not under the mandates of the law, Americans are still \ngoing to find that the exchanges do not match the President's promise.\n  Let's think about what those promises were. Last week, the President \nwas in New York with Bill Clinton. They had what seemed like an \ninfomercial to me. What the President said is that: Most people will be \nable to shop and compare. For many people it is going to be cheaper \nthan an average cell phone bill.\n  The people are not going to find that it is cheaper, even with \ngovernment subsidies, than the average cell phone bill.\n  The President has also said: The process is going to be as easy as \nAmazon. Even if the administration is able to paper over the many \nproblems with the exchanges, it is not going to be as easy as shopping \non Amazon.\n  Remember, from the beginning the President said: If you like your \ndoctor, you can keep your doctor. We are now seeing in State after \nState that the exchanges are such that, to try to get costs down, they \nare limiting the market in a way and the networks in a way that fewer \ndoctors are included, fewer hospitals are included.\n  That is causing an uproar. Instead of doubling down on a broken \nsystem, the President should grant all Americans a 1-year delay--the \nexact same delay he gave their bosses.\n  The President talks a lot about a ``fair shake'' for all Americans. \nWe heard it in his campaign speeches, and we hear it as he goes around \nand talks to groups. He uses the words quite frequently.\n  ObamaCare, unfortunately, delivers the exact opposite. What the \nPresident has done unilaterally is gone outside the law to grant \nspecial deals to almost everyone except to people who need it the most, \nwhich is the hard-working American public. He basically, I believe, \nshut down the Federal Government in order to continue his own policy of \nhis health care law, picking winners and losers. This can't continue.\n  The good news is that today, after once again attempting to lead from \nbehind in a crisis, the President is finally having congressional \nleaders down to the White House within the next hour to meet with him. \nThis is an opportunity for the President to do the right thing, to open \nthe government, and to finally deliver fairness for Americans under the \nhealth care law. After all, if we are going to give people's bosses a \nbreak from the mandates of the health care law, the President ought to \ngive hard-working men and women of America the same break. The same for \nMembers of Congress. If the President decides that his own \nadministration, White House employees, and Members of Congress have \nspecial treatment under the health care law, that shouldn't be so. That \nshould be eliminated.\n  I do want to talk for a minute specifically about the government \nshutdown. Over the past week Senate and House Republicans have voted \noverwhelmingly for legislation passed by the House of Representatives \nthat keeps government operations running. It keeps parks open, and it \nkeeps Americans working. Senate Democrats have overwhelmingly rejected \nthese proposals and have allowed to have the government shut down, to \nhave the gates closed at America's national parks, and to have critical \nservices for America's veterans go unfunded through the Veterans' \nAdministration.\n  Today or tomorrow the Senate will have the opportunity to pass \nlegislation from the House that will immediately open our parks, fund \nservices offered through the Department of Veterans Affairs, and \nprovide time-sensitive funding for the National Institutes of Health. \nWe should pass these bills. We should make sure Americans can use these \nessential government services right now.\n  I also would like to talk for a minute about another looming issue \nthat is important to the American people, to our Nation, and one that \nthe President has recently addressed. Later this month Congress will \nbegin debate on the President's sixth debt limit increase, the sixth \ntime he has come to increase the debt limit in his 5 years of office. \nThe President has said he is refusing to negotiate on this issue. \nInstead, I believe the President should accept that our country can no \nlonger avoid a bipartisan agreement to reform entitlements. The \nPresident can no longer avoid a bipartisan agreement to reform \nentitlements. It is the President's job, responsibility, obligation, \nand opportunity to lead the effort.\n  If the President is unwilling to seriously deal with our country's \ndebt, Congress is left with little choice but to use the debt limit to \nforce him into fiscal solutions. The debt ceiling is merely a symptom \nof a much larger illness, which is Washington's addiction to spending. \nOn spending, the status quo is not sustainable.\n  It is interesting how the President has seemed to change his tune. \nThe President gave a number of speeches in the Senate when he was a \nSenator. We can go back and see what he said about raising the debt \nceiling. He said that adding to the debt--of course, this was when \nGeorge W. Bush was President--his key word was ``irresponsible.'' \nPresident Obama as a Senator said it was unpatriotic--raising the debt \nceiling--unpatriotic and unacceptable. This was Barack Obama in this \nbody, in this Chamber, in 2006. President Obama--at the time a \nSenator--actually called raising the debt ceiling ``a failure of \nleadership.'' Isn't that what the President himself should be accused \nof right now as he tries to do what he so vehemently objected to when \nhe was in the Senate?\n  How bad is the situation? Well, in September the Congressional Budget \nOffice reported that in the long term defense, education, \ninfrastructure, and all discretionary spending will be squeezed by \nentitlement programs as well as interest on the debt. Over the next 75 \nyears discretionary spending\n\n[[Page S7142]]\n\nwill increase by 39 percent. This makes the sequester cuts look like \nchild's play. Medicaid and other health spending increases will be by \n159 percent; interest on the debt increases 823 percent; Social \nSecurity spending rises by only 37 percent only because CBO assumes \ndrastic benefit cuts in the year 2033.\n  The President recently spoke about making cuts, though, to \ndiscretionary spending. That number is underestimated. The President \nfailed to mention that by refusing to make much needed changes to \nentitlement programs, he is guaranteeing that these investments, as he \ncalls them, will continue to shrink.\n  Entitlement reform is needed not only to preserve other Federal \nspending but in order to slow our ever-expanding debt. President Obama \nhas bragged that he is no longer setting up the record-setting deficits \nhe did in his first 4 years. Those self-congratulatory statements will \nbe short-lived, as the Congressional Budget Office has predicted that \ndeficits will soon start to rise unless real reforms are made today. \nWithout real reform, America's debt will continue to grow, and \nAmerica's interest and entitlement payments are on course to overwhelm \nthe entire Federal budget.\n  The American people deserve to hear the truth about the tough choices \nwe must face together as a nation. They also deserve an open and honest \ndiscussion about how we are going to make those choices. The President \nand congressional Democrats ought to rethink their strategies of \nleadership via blame game and saving via spending.\n  The President and Democrats have an opportunity today at the White \nHouse to put the games aside and work with us on opening the \ngovernment, on delivering fairness for all Americans, and on actually \nreducing our debt. I hope they use this meeting to finally do what is \nright and to help the American people.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/02/senate-section/article/S7142-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
