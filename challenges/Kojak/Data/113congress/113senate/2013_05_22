Mr. President, last night the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nafter some 24 hearings and several weeks of markup, advanced a \ncommonsense, bipartisan proposal to fix our broken immigration system. \nNo one can dispute that it is broken. No one can dispute that it needs \nto be fixed. I commend the good work of the committee, and I am \ngrateful to everyone who worked those long hours. I will bring this \nbill, which is a strong bipartisan bill, to the floor in June, sometime \nsoon after we return from the Memorial Day work period.\n  Although neither Republicans nor Democrats will support each and \nevery aspect of this legislation, it is gratifying to see the momentum \nbehind these reforms that will make our country safer and help 11 \nmillion undocumented immigrants get right with the law. I applaud \nsignificantly the efforts of the Gang of 8--four Democrats and four \nRepublicans--who showed bravery as they set aside partisanship to \naddress the critical issues facing our Nation.\n  I am confident that for everyone in that Gang of 8, Democrats and \nRepublicans, there are parts of this bill they do not like. But that is \nhow we move legislation forward for the greater good--compromise. I \nadmire their legislative skills and appreciate very much their ability \nto set aside these partisan differences and move this extremely \nimportant bill to the floor.\n  There was other courage on display on the Senate floor yesterday when\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\ntwo Republican Senators bucked the majority of their party for the good \nof the country. Senators McCain and Collins--two Senators I admire \ndeeply--came to the floor to call on their own party to stop blocking \nbipartisan budget negotiations.\n  John McCain and I came to Congress together. In 1982 we were elected. \nWe spent two terms in the House together, and we have been in the \nSenate together since then. Over these many years, more than three \ndecades, John McCain and I have disagreed on several things, but I have \nnever lost my admiration for this patriotic man. He is courageous in \nbattle--not only in the fights that take place in a war but legislative \nbattles. I am so appreciative that he decided the right thing to do was \nto move forward and see what we could do to get this bipartisan \nnegotiation started.\n  Susan Collins and I have served together for a long time in this \nbody. We have worked together on some extremely important measures. I \ndon't need to run through all these, but there are parts of the law of \nthis country that would not be law but for her willingness to move \nforward and move across the aisle. Susan Collins and I disagree on \nquite a few things, but we agree on quite a few things.\n\n  The people of Arizona are very fortunate to have John McCain as a \nSenator, and the people of Maine are fortunate to have Susan Collins as \na Senator. The reason they stepped forward is because it has now been \n60 days--2 months--since the Senate passed its commonsense, progrowth \nbudget. The question everyone raises is, Why are Republicans standing \nin the way? Not only are Democrats asking that question, Republicans \nare asking that question now.\n  We passed a budget. Senators McCain and Collins do not think our \nbudget is the best. They think they could do a better job. But they \nalso understand the legislative process--that is, you have to work \ntogether. Just as the Gang of 8 did to get the bill on immigration to \nthe floor, we need to work together to get a budget. The House has \npassed one. We have passed one. Let's go to conference and work out our \ndifferences.\n  For 60 days Republican leaders have objected to a conference with the \nHouse of Representatives where we could work out our differences \nbetween our budget and our priorities. The differences between our \nbudgets are there. We know that, but we need to work together on our \npriorities. The House Republicans and House Democrats need to come up \nwith what they want, and we will come up with what we want, working \nwith the Republicans here. That is what a conference is all about. In a \nconference it is not just the Democrats from the Senate on the \nconference committee, Republicans will be on it also. And just like in \nthe House, it will not be all Republicans, it will be Democrats also.\n  The only explanation their Republican leaders have given for their \nendless obstruction is this: They refuse to negotiate unless we agree \nin advance to let them have their way. Yesterday the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona and the Senator from Maine--both Republicans--condemned \nthat. They said it was hypocrisy. That is my word, not theirs; they can \ndefine it any way they want. But the point is that they have been \ncalling for regular order for several years, and now they have the \nchance for regular order and they are walking away from it.\n  Senator McCain called the obstruction by his fellow Republicans a \nlittle bizarre. I used that word also to describe the gridlock here. \nSenator Collins agreed that it was ironic at least. That is what she \nsaid. The senior Senator from Maine went on to say:\n\n       We have called repeatedly for a return to the regular order \n     in this body. Regular order is going to conference.\n\n  We agree. We have a progrowth budget that we will proudly defend. \nHouse Republicans should be ready to do the same with theirs. I don't \nknow why my Republican colleagues in the Senate are so afraid of an \nopen conference. The conference committee report will need both \nDemocratic and Republican votes to pass. Do my Senate Republican \ncolleagues not trust their House Republican colleagues to hold the line \non their priorities?\n  Congress must set sound, long-term fiscal policy through the regular \norder of the budget process and through compromise, but Democrats and \nRepublicans will never find common ground if we never get to the \nnegotiating table.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  On another subject, Congress has worked hard and compromised often \nover the last 4 years in order to reduce the deficit and reverse the \ntrend of rising debt that began under President Bush. That work has \npaid off. We have reduced the deficit by about $2.5 trillion.\n  But as our Nation has succeeded in setting a course for financial \nresponsibility, students across the country have struggled to do the \nsame. The rising price of higher education puts college out of reach \nfor many promising young people, and it saddles those who do get an \neducation with an unsustainable debt, a debt that causes them to delay \nbuying their first home, put off having children, or give up the goal \nof starting a business.\n  Today Americans have more than $1 trillion in student loan debt. \nThere is more student loan debt than credit card debt, and the average \ngraduate owes more than $25,000 when they get out of school. I think a \ncollege education should free young people to achieve their dreams, not \nsaddle them with crushing debt for the rest of their lives.\n  College is already unaffordable for too many young people, but if \nCongress fails to act soon, that cost will go up again. On July 1, \ninterest rates on student loans are set to double, from 3.4 percent to \n6.8 percent, effectively socking 7 million students with $1,000 a year \nin additional loan costs. In Nevada alone this will cost 26,000 \nstudents more than $21 million next year. We should be removing the \nobstacles keeping young people from getting an education, not raising \nmore barriers. Raising interest rates would put higher education even \nfurther out of reach for many promising students.\n  Last week Senate Democrats introduced a proposal to freeze student \nloan rates at current levels for 2 years without adding a penny to the \ndeficit. This is paid for by closing wasteful tax loopholes. The \nlegislation being pushed by House Republicans will take a different \nroute, sticking it to students instead of closing loopholes. Rather \nthan investing in the next generation of American workers, the House \nbill would cost students as much as $6,500 more in interest than the \ncurrent rates. In fact, passing the House proposal would be worse than \ndoing nothing at all. We would be better off letting the rates go up to \n6.8 percent than passing the House bill. Passing the House bill or \nletting the rates go up to 6.8 percent is not the right thing to do. We \nneed to do what we suggest; that is, keep the interest rates where they \nare.\n  Under the House bill, students would pay up to $2,000 more if we \nallow the rates to double in July. But Democrats know an investment in \neducation is an investment in our economy, so we will keep student \nrates low and hold back the rising price of education.\n  Last year, after months of obstruction, the Republicans eventually \nconceded and helped us achieve that goal. After all, it was great \nelection-year politics for them. This is what Mitt Romney said about \nthe effort to keep loan rates low: ``I fully support the effort to \nextend the low interest rate on student loans.'' Even my friend the \nminority leader, Mitch McConnell, said there was not a soul in \nWashington who thought student loan rates should go up. We agree. But \nunlike Republicans, we don't abandon our commitment to students just \nbecause the election is over. Can my Republican colleagues say the \nsame? I hope they still share our goal of keeping the American dream \naffordable. If they do, there is an easy way to prove it: work with us \nto quickly pass the proposal to protect American students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3702-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, recently we have seen troubling signs. \nThere are some in the executive branch who would use the power of the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\nGovernment to intimidate political opponents. For instance, there were \nreports that the IRS targeted conservative groups for harassment and \ndiscriminatory treatment because they sought to exercise their first \namendment rights of freedom of association and speech, and during the \ndebate on ObamaCare when the Department of Health and Human Services \nissued a gag order on insurance plans in an attempt to prevent them \nfrom telling their customers about problems with the bill.\n  Now there are published reports that the same department is trying to \nshake down some of these same companies for money so it can try to \nconvince Americans to finally like ObamaCare.\n  Over at the FCC, the President's allies are trying to shut down or \nmake it difficult for people who want to buy advertising to exercise \ntheir first amendment rights to criticize the administration. There are \nsimilar efforts over at the SEC. It all points to a culture of \npolitical intimidation.\n  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem the culture of intimidation is simply \nconfined to the executive branch. The administration's allies in the \nSenate are trying to intimidate their political opponents as well. What \nI am talking about is the persistent threat by the majority to break \nthe rules of the Senate in order to change the rules of the Senate; in \nother words, to use the nuclear option if they don't get their way.\n  For example, Senate Democrats were incensed that Republicans had the \ntemerity to exercise their advice and consent responsibility to block a \ngrand total of just one nominee to the DC Circuit. What did our \nDemocratic colleagues do in response? They consulted with the White \nHouse and pledged to pack the DC court with appointees ``one way or \nanother''--meaning use the nuclear option.\n  They are certainly not doing this because the DC Circuit is burdened \nwith cases--far from it. The DC Circuit is one of the least busy courts \nin the country. They want to use the nuclear option to pack the DC \nCircuit so it can rubberstamp the President's big government agenda--\nthe same big government we have seen over at the IRS and elsewhere.\n  That is not the limit of the culture of intimidation in the Senate. \nLet's look at the NLRB situation. Despite the story that the \nadministration and Senate Democrats want to spin, Senate Republicans \ndid not block the President's nominees to the National Labor Relations \nBoard; rather, it was the President who blocked the nominees to the \nRepublican slots on the NLRB so he could, once again, pack a powerful \nbranch of government, in this case, the NLRB.\n  The administration sat on one of the two Democratic vacancies at the \nNLRB for 4 months. Then it waited until the middle of December in 2011 \nto send up both nominees for the Democratic seats on the NLRB while \nrefusing to send up any of the nominees for the Republican seats. In \nfact, the administration sat on the Republican nominees to the NLRB for \n9 months.\n  Then, with no Republican nominees to the NLRB before the Senate, the \nPresident purported to recess appoint the two Democratic nominees to \nthe Board when their nominations had been before the Senate for less \nthan 3 weeks. It was so fast the majority leader didn't even have time \nto schedule a hearing. Our Democratic colleagues did not defend the \nSenate from the President's unprecedented and unconstitutional power \ngrab. Senate Republicans had to do that.\n  Now that the DC Circuit has found these purported appointments to be \nunconstitutional--by the way, that was a unanimous three-judge court--\nand other circuit courts are agreeing with its reasoning, what is the \nDemocratic majority threatening to do now? It is planning to double \ndown and aid the administration with its power grab at the NLRB.\n  Specifically, as with their effort to pack the DC circuit, the \nmajority is threatening to use the nuclear option so they can push \nthrough unlawfully appointed board members over the principled \nobjection of Senate Republicans. It doesn't seem that our Democratic \ncolleagues want to respect the rules of the Senate or that they want to \nrespect the rulings of our Federal courts. It appears they want to \nenable the President and organized labor to exercise power at a \npowerful Federal agency without anyone getting in the way.\n  Let's be clear. These threats to use the nuclear option because of \nobstruction are just pretext for a power grab.\n  What are the facts? The Senate has confirmed 19 of the President's \njudicial nominees so far this year. At this point in President Bush's \nsecond term when my party controlled the Senate, President Bush had a \ngrand total of four judicial nominees confirmed. There have been 19 \nconfirmed so far in the second term of President Obama with Democratic \ncontrol of the Senate and four in the second term of President Bush \nwith a Republican control of the Senate.\n  Moreover, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee just voted \nunanimously to support the President's current nomination to the DC \nCircuit. The Senate Republican conference agreed yesterday to hold an \nup-or-down vote on his nomination--which has only been on the calendar \nsince Monday of this week--to occur after the Memorial Day recess. That \nway Members who do not serve on the committee, which is a vast majority \nof the Senate, could have at least 1 week to evaluate this important \nnomination.\n  Instead, the majority leader chose to jam the minority. He rejected \nour offer for an up-or-down vote, just 10 days or so from now, and \nfiled cloture on the nomination just 1 day after it appeared on the \nexecutive calendar. This is just another example of the majority \nmanufacturing a crisis to justify heavy-handed behavior.\n  As for the NLRB, Republicans are willing to support nominees who are \nnot unlawfully appointed and who have not been unlawfully exercising \ngovernmental power. Regarding nominees generally, Senate Republicans \nhave been willing to work with the President to get his team in place. \nThe Secretary of Energy was confirmed 97 to 0, the Secretary of \nInterior was confirmed 87 to 11, the Secretary of the Treasury was \nconfirmed 71 to 26, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nwas confirmed 96 to 0, and the Secretary of State was confirmed 94 to \n3, just 7 days after the Senate received his nomination.\n\n  These continued threats to use the nuclear option point to the \nmajority's own culture of intimidation in the Senate. Their view is \nthat we had better confirm the people they want when they want them or \nthey will break the rules of the Senate to change the rules so we can't \nstop them. So much for respecting the rights of the minority and so \nmuch for a meaningful application of advice and consent.\n  Senate Republicans will work with the administration and the \nDemocratic majority, but we will not be intimidated. We have principled \nobjections to some of the President's nominees and constant threats to \nbreak the rules are not going to work. Constant threats to break the \nrules are not going to work. We want to work with the Democrats, but \nthese tactics are not the way to go about getting our cooperation.\n  The majority leader has twice committed on the Senate floor not to \nuse the nuclear option. The last time was just a few months ago. These \nwere not conditional commitments. They were not commitments not to \nviolate the rules of the Senate unless it became convenient for \npolitical purposes to violate the rules of the Senate.\n  The comments of Senators are supposed to matter. Our words are \nsupposed to mean something around here. The commitments of the Senate \nmajority leader need to matter. We simply cannot start breaking \ncommitments around here, especially on something that goes to the very \nessence of the Senate. The majority leader needs to keep his \ncommitments.\n  I indicated to the majority leader I was going to ask unanimous \nconsent--and I assume he has a copy of it--on the DC Circuit Court \nnomination that the majority leader filed a cloture motion on last \nnight. We have already stated that we agreed to a debate and a vote \nwhich came out of the committee unanimously.\n  We confirmed two judicial nominations Monday of this week, and we \nhave an additional two scheduled for later this week. I have already \nindicated that confirmations of judges this year are stunningly fair to \nthe majority compared to a time when President Bush was in his second \nterm and my party controlled the Senate.\n\n[[Page S3704]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3704-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3704-S3706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Again, I remind my colleagues that we confirmed 19 \njudges this year. We will have 21 judges confirmed by the end of this \nweek.\n  Therefore, bearing that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncloture motion filed on Calendar No. 95 be vitiated and the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of this nomination at a time on Tuesday, \nJune 4, to be determined by the majority leader after consultation with \nthe Republican leader; further, I ask that there be 1 hour of debate on \nthe nomination equally divided in the usual form; that at the \nexpiration or yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to vote on \nthe confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this good man, Sri Srinivasan, was first \nnominated in June of 2012. He is a brilliant man. He is an honors \ngraduate from Stanford Law School.\n  Justice Roberts left that court in 2005. We have been trying to fill \nspots on that court for all of these many years--6 or 7 years. The DC \nCircuit is the court that some say is more important than the Supreme \nCourt. No judge has been confirmed in the DC Circuit since 2006. It is \nan 11-member court established by law, so to have a 7-member court is \nunfair.\n  We have had one woman, for example, Caitlin Halligan, a highly \nqualified nominee, who has been filibustered twice by the Republicans. \nShe was nominated to fill the seat of Justice Roberts.\n  The man we are talking about today has been nominated to a seat that \nhas been vacant for 5 years. The four seats were vacated in 2005, 2008 \nand have senior status by two other judges in the last year or two. His \nnomination has pending for 345 days. That is by far the longest wait of \nany of the judicial nominations currently awaiting confirmation by the \nfull Senate.\n  My friend the Republican leader talks about Bush's second term and \nhow he didn't get many nominations. He didn't get many nominations at \nthat time because we approved so many in the first term. It is just the \nopposite with President Obama. Eighteen Bush circuit court nominees \nwere confirmed within 7 days or less after being reported by the \ncommittee.\n  A Republican-controlled Senate filed cloture on three circuit court \njudges--including some real controversial ones, such as, William Pryor \nand Janice Rogers Brown. Cloture was filed in less than 1 week.\n  There has been a stall going on in the Senate for years. It doesn't \ntake a mathematician to figure it out. We are being held up on \nnominations and legislation.\n  President Obama has been trying to have the people he wants as part \nof his team for 4\\1/2\\ years. There are multiple vacancies in this \ncourt. It has been reported out unanimously by the committee.\n  There is all of this stalling and waiting so that maybe they will be \nable to render another couple of opinions over the next couple weeks \nand thwart the law which says there should be 11 people on the court. \nBut to pack the court with what has been determined the number of \npeople who should be on that court? Is it right to have a total of six \nmembers of the Circuit Court? Is it packing the court because we want \nto fill the court as it is called for in the Constitution? No. We \nshould vote on the nomination of this young man today so he can go to \nwork and help fill one of the four vacancies that has been long \nstanding in that court for 5 or 6 or 7 years.\n\n  Unless there is an agreement, we will have a cloture vote at the end \nof tomorrow, and if they want to use their 30 hours, which they are \nentitled to do under the arrangement we made at the beginning of this \nyear, they can use the 30 hours. But we are going to get this young man \nconfirmed. It is the right thing to do and we are going to get him \nconfirmed as soon as possible. Having waited 345 days, I think he \ndeserves it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the first time this nominee, who was \nreported out of committee unanimously, appeared on the Executive \nCalendar was 2 days ago. President Obama waited years before making any \nnominations to the DC Circuit. Then he made just one--Caitlin \nHalligan--and this is his second nominee to that court.\n  More broadly, the issue is, How has the Senate been treating \nPresident Obama? We have confirmed a total of 190 Obama judicial \nnominations. We have defeated two. That is 190 to 2. There are 70 \npercent of the Federal judicial seats without any nominees--70 percent \nof the vacancies without any nominees.\n  Look, this is a manufactured crisis. The core point here, I would say \nto my friend the majority leader: We have a good relationship. We work \ntogether every day. But the majority leader gave his word to the Senate \nthat we would determine what the rules are for this Congress. A number \nof my Members felt it was settled. We voted for resolutions and some \nrules changes at the beginning of the year based upon the majority \nleader's word. It is important for his word to mean something, not just \nto his Members but to ours.\n  Statistically, it is not true. The math can't be denied. It is simply \nnot true that we have been mistreating the President in any way with \nregard to the confirmation process. With regard to the way the Senate \nitself is working, the majority leader has been actually quite \ncomplimentary, and I give him credit for helping us to get back to \nnormal here, to have a regular process on bills. WRDA is a good example \nof where we were calling up amendments. Many of them we are getting on \nwithout even a motion to proceed, based upon the majority leader's \nrepresentation we are going to have votes and, by golly, we have been \nhaving votes and, amazingly enough, Senators like that. They are not \nmarginalized by a process under which they don't get to participate. So \nI think we have made an enormous amount of progress. I wish to make \nsure the majority leader intends to keep his word, so we can continue \nto have the kind of collegial, constructive atmosphere we have had this \nyear in the Senate throughout the balance of this Congress.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. We have to work together here, but it is mutual work, it is \nnot all on one side. It is not my word versus somebody else's word.\n  In 2005, we had a knockdown, drag-out battle here. My friend the \nRepublican leader, along with others, gave speeches on the Senate floor \nthat the process regarding judges wasn't moving along quickly enough. \nAs a result of that crisis, in an effort to resolve the matter, we \nagreed to put some people on the bench we have regretted since then, \nincluding Janice Rogers Brown, Thomas Griffith, and Brett Kavanaugh, \nbut we agreed to that and they are on the court now. We need a balance.\n  My friend has focused on judicial nominations. We have been doing \nbetter there. But other nominations, not so. We can talk about all the \nrights of the minority and all that. The President of the United \nStates, whether it is George Bush or President Obama or Jeb Bush or \nHillary Clinton, whoever it might be, deserves the right to have the \npeople they want to work there and not be held up for months and months \nto fill some of these minor posts. I could run through a list of names \nthat were held up and have been held up for a long time.\n  My friend the Republican leader said during the squabble we had \npreviously how he agreed with the fact we should change the rules. I am \nnot saying we are going to change the rules, but I am saying we have to \ndo a better job than what is going on around here. This is no threat. \nWe need to look at the facts. Look at the facts.\n  We are going to continue working to try to work through this morass \nwe have here. But let's not focus only on the judiciary. We have a lot \nof problems with regular nominations. We haven't talked about \nlegislation. We are doing a little better on that, but a perfect \nexample of that is what is going on with the budget. People begged \naround here, yelled and screamed and fought, for regular order. They \nget it and then they don't want it.\n  I am convinced we need to move forward. I think one of the things we \nshould do with something that has been reported out of the committee 18\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\nto nothing, and there have been vacancies for 6 or 7 years, is we \nshould do that immediately, not wait for a couple of weeks to do it. If \nsomebody cares about this good man, his record is available. They can \nread it in 10 minutes.\n  I am sorry I had to object to my friend's unanimous consent request, \nbut it was easy to do because the request is simply wrong.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me thank my friend the majority \nleader for confirming that he intends to keep his word.\n  With regard to judicial nominations, the facts are not irrelevant. Of \nthe 33 nominations in the Senate we have acted on this year--this \ncalendar year--cloture has been required on three: Brennan, Hagel, and \nHalligan, and cloture was not invoked on only one. We have confirmed 33 \nboards--actually judges, agencies--33 nominations confirmed this year. \nCloture was required on only three, and cloture was not invoked on only \none.\n  My only point to my friend the majority leader is, the math is hard \nto dispute. We have made a major effort here to move the Senate back in \nthe direction that I know the majority leader and I agree on, the way \nthe Senate ought to operate. We have made major progress. I think that \nprogress needs to be recognized. My friend the majority leader said it \non various occasions this year in connection with bills we have \nprocessed in a fair and open way with plenty of amendments and an \nopportunity for everybody to be involved. So let's tone down the \nrhetoric.\n  I want to say again I appreciate the majority leader's commitment to \nkeep his word. It is important around here. It has a lot to do with how \nwe go forward. I think the conversation this morning has been \nconstructive, and I thank him. I am sorry he feels we can't wait 10 \ndays to do this nominee, particularly since there are circuit judges, I \nbelieve, and maybe district judges as well, already on the calendar. \nThe way we have been trying to do it around here that I thought the \nmajority leader agreed with is we would take them up in the order they \ncame out and appeared on the calendar. I know, for example, there is a \njudge from Wyoming that Senators from Wyoming in my party are for, and \nthey are asking me why this particular nominee was jumped over, over \ntheir nominee, because we have been sequencing these, I believe, have \nwe not, as they come out.\n\n  So here we have a nominee we all agree on for a court that is not \noverloaded with work--a nomination only recently made and recently \nconfirmed--and the only dispute here seems to be over whether we do it \nthis week or a week from now. Thus, my friend, that is why I call this \na manufactured crisis. There is no crisis here. We are not arguing over \nthis nominee. We like him. So the majority leader can make us have a \ncloture vote this week and we can skip over the judges who have been \nwaiting who came out of committee and are on the calendar if he so \nchooses; there are some advantages to being the majority leader. But \ngoodness gracious, we have enough arguments here over things we \ndisagree on, and it sounds to me as though we are having an argument \nover something we agree on.\n  So I hope we can tone down the rhetoric and continue the good way we \nhave been operating this year. We have big, controversial issues coming \nour way. Let's don't make being a Senator and functioning in the Senate \nany more difficult than it is anyway, because we have big differences \nabout the future of the country. But let's have those debates in a \ncollegial way and not manufacture crises that don't exist.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, everyone knows that numbers--we can show \nanything we want with numbers. The fact is there has been slow-walking \ndone on the President's nominations, and we can look at how they do \nthat. It has been interesting. It is a new way of doing things around \nhere. A nominee comes up and what the committee does is submit hundreds \nand hundreds of questions. One of our nominees got 1,000 questions in \nwriting the person had to respond to. That has never happened before. \nWe have all of these ways of stalling.\n  I know the Senators from Wyoming want to vote on and have spoken to \nme about Gregory Alan Phillips to be a circuit court judge for the 10th \nCircuit. Let's do it right now. Let's do him today. The Wyoming \nSenators shouldn't have to wait.\n  That is why I ask unanimous consent that we do--I am sorry. I like \nhim, but the man on whom we are going to invoke cloture graduated law \nschool with my son. He is a fine man, but I am not the only one who \nmesses up his name. He was a basketball player in Kansas. He said his \nparents came to all of his games and they cringed every time his name \nwas pronounced because it is a hard name to pronounce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by me, the \nSenate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 95, \nSrikanth Srinivasan; that there be 1 hour of debate equally divided in \nthe usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of that time the \nSenate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the \nnomination; the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate; that no further \nmotions be in order to the nomination; that any statements related to \nthe nomination be printed in the Record; and that President Obama be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, again, I \nthink what we are witnessing here is a manufactured crisis. We are \ndoing four judges this week--this very week--four judges. There are \nfive others on the calendar before the nominee the majority leader has \nbeen trying to get us to process this week. I think it is a better \npolicy to continue to set votes that the facts show are in a timely \nway.\n  Why are we doing this? We are not having a problem confirming judges. \nI don't understand. Why are we doing this? It doesn't make any sense. \nWe have big issues coming our way on immigration, for example, that are \ngoing to be very controversial. Members on both sides have been making \nevery effort to tone down the rhetoric, to get us in the proper place \nto deal with a very difficult and contentious piece of legislation.\n  Why are we doing this? What is the point? All of these judges are \ngoing to be approved in a relatively short period of time in an orderly \nprocess we have been working on all year that has produced four times \nas many judicial confirmations for President Obama in his second term \nas President Bush had at this point in his first term when we had a \nRepublican Senate.\n  This is an unprecedented, rapid pace for confirmations. So I would \nsay to my friend, why are we doing this? I am going to object, but I \nwould like to know what the point is. What is the problem?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be happy to respond to what the \nproblem is.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Leahy said yesterday:\n\n       A recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research \n     Service compares the whole of President Obama's first term to \n     the whole of President Bush's first term, and the contrast \n     could not be more clear. The median Senate floor wait time \n     for President Obama's district [court] nominees was 5 times \n     longer than for President Bush's. President Obama's circuit \n     [court] nominees faced even longer delays, and their median \n     wait time was 7.3 times longer than for President Bush's \n     circuit nominees. The comparison is even worse if we look \n     just at nominees who were reported and confirmed unanimously. \n     President Bush's unanimously confirmed circuit nominees had a \n     median wait time of just 14 days. Compare that to the 130.5 \n     days for President Obama's unanimous nominees.\n\n  So 14 days compared to 130.5. Things are going along really well? I \ndo not think so.\n  On with what Senator Leahy said:\n\n       That is more than 9 times longer. Even the nonpartisan CRS \n     calls this a ``notable change.'' There is no good reason for \n     such unprecedented delays, but those are the facts.\n\n  So that is why we are doing this. There is no reason to wait 10 days \nor 2 weeks for this good man to fill a seat on a court that has been \nwaiting for people to get on the court for 7 years. We have a majority \nin that court that\n\n[[Page S3706]]\n\nis wreaking havoc with the country. For the first time in 230 years, \nthey rule the President cannot make a recess appointment. So, yes, \nthere is a crisis, and we need to do something about it. One way to \nresolve part of it is to get this good man on the court now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I gather, listening to the majority \nleader, the whole purpose is to stack the court. So the real issue, I \nguess, is he disagrees with the rulings on the DC Circuit.\n  Look, we have been voting to confirm judges we know we will not \nprefer the outcome of their decisions. But it sounds to me like the \nmajority leader has finally kind of fessed up to what the real problem \nis. The reason it needs to be done this week versus next week is \nbecause he does not like what the DC Circuit is doing. So it does not \nhave anything to do with caseload or anything else. In fact, what is \nunprecedented is confirming a DC Circuit court judge 2 days after he \nhas been on the calendar--2 days. Goodness. What is the difference \nbetween now and next week? I find it impossible to understand.\n  In fact, I do not understand why we are having this whole discussion \nthis morning. We have plenty of things to debate around here and plenty \nof things we disagree upon. We have had an orderly process. This \nCongress has done well: 19 judges compared to 4 for President Bush at \nthis point.\n  If there is still a consent request pending, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think the majority leader and I ought to sit down \nlike we normally do and figure this out and eliminate a manufactured \ncrisis and go forward.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in school we studied a lot of things. But \none of the things I cannot forget is George Orwell's ``1984.'' It was \nan interesting book because in that book he talked about people coming \nto a time when whatever they said was factually just the opposite.\n  Here is where we are now. It has been legislatively determined the DC \nCircuit should have 11 members. My friend says we are stacking the \ncourt? There are four vacancies. Stacking the court by having eight \nthere instead of seven? That math is not very good.\n  My friend also keeps talking about that the DC Circuit does not have \nanything to do. The DC Circuit is now more than one-third vacant with \nfour judicial vacancies. Mr. Srinivasan is nominated to the eighth seat \non the DC Circuit. Three still remain empty.\n  And, yes, we are. The country is concerned about the decisions coming \nout of that court. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals is considered by \nsome the most important court in the land. But by virtually everybody, \nit is ``the second most important court in the land'' because of the \ncomplex nature of the cases they handle. The court reviews complicated \ndecisions and rulemaking of many Federal agencies and in recent years \nhas handled some of the most important terrorism and enemy combatant \nand detention cases since the attacks of September 11. These cases are \nvery complex in nature, requiring additional time for consideration.\n  Congress took action to address these concerns about their caseload \nby decreasing the number of judgeships in 2008 from 12 to 11. Congress \nhas set the number of judgeships needed by the court at 11. The court \nshould not be understaffed by one-third.\n  In reality, according to the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, \nthe caseload per active judge has increased by 50 percent since 2005, \nwhen the Senate confirmed President Bush's nominee to fill the 11th \nseat on the DC Circuit.\n  So Senate Republicans willingly confirmed President Bush's nominees \nto the 9th, 10th, and 11th seats on the DC Circuit. We did not think \nthey were stacking it. I did not particularly like some of the people \nthey put on there, but it was not stacking it. That is what the \nlegislation called for.\n  This good man is President Obama's second nominee to the DC Circuit \nto fill the eighth seat, and they filibustered Halligan twice.\n  So this is a situation that needs to be resolved quickly. We cannot \nhave the second, or first, most important court in the land one-third \nvacant. We are stacking the court with one person? I think not.\n  So we can stay here longer, but I have made my point. One thing I \nhave to say to my friend, although we have gotten into a few of these \nlittle conversations before on the Senate floor, I will wind up getting \nthe last word.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I know the majority leader will always have the \nlast word. That is the advantage of being in the majority and not the \nminority. I think it has been actually a good discussion this morning. \nI think we have demonstrated there is no real problem. We have \nconfirmed the President's nominees both for the judiciary and for the \nexecutive branch in a very timely fashion, and we will continue to \nprocess these judges in consultation with the majority leader as they \ncome along.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only thing I would say is, what about \nthe judge from Wyoming? Why don't we do that today? Could there be a \nmore Republican State in the country than Wyoming? Maybe. I do not \nknow. Maybe Idaho is vying for No. 1. But I am willing to approve this \njudge today. Why don't we vote on him today?\n  Well, if you want to go ahead and have us invoke cloture on this \nother guy, we will do that, but I am willing to vote on the Wyoming guy \ntoday.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Since the majority leader always reminds me he has the \nlast word, I am hesitant to speak again. But we will continue to \nprocess these judges in an orderly fashion, as we have all year long, \nand, hopefully, he and I can discuss this further off the floor and \nfind a way forward.\n  Mr. REID. I do not want anyone thinking I am not keeping my word. I \nwas not going to say anything, but I thought I said I would get the \nlast word.\n  So Senator McConnell can say something now, and I will not get the \nlast word.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3706-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am very much appreciative of the \nSenator from Kentucky and the Senator from Nevada having this very \nimportant discussion.\n  Washington tends to operate inside a bubble where one can easily \nforget just how much Main Street America is hurting economically, how \nmany Americans feel their rights are being threatened, and how many \nfear we are not going to leave behind a better country for our \nchildren.\n  That is why it is so important we stay connected to our constituents. \nIt is why I travel home almost every weekend, hold telephone and online \ntownhalls from my Washington office, and try to read my mail, which is \nso very important.\n  In a recent townhall I answered some difficult questions on the \nissues we are facing as a nation. However, one of the toughest \nquestions that was posed was not about a specific policy issue. \nInstead, it was when I was asked: How do we fix the mess in Washington?\n  I answered, in part, that transparency and accountability would go a \nlong way to restoring faith in Washington. That was before the Benghazi \ncontroversy escalated. Then news of the IRS scandal broke. Almost \nimmediately after that we learned the Department of Justice had \nobtained the private phone records of dozens of Associated Press \nreporters.\n  This is the opposite of what we need to do to fix the problems in \nWashington. These scandals move us in the wrong direction.\n\n[[Page S3707]]\n\n  It is hard to pick which one of these I find the most troubling, but \nI want to focus on the IRS scandal because targeting political groups, \nsingling them out for additional scrutiny simply because you disagree \nwith their ideological views is wrong on every level.\n  Dismissing this massive overreach as if it is just the acts of a few \nrogue agents in Cincinnati, as some have tried to do since the onset, \nis not taking leadership nor is it seeking to hold the agency \naccountable.\n  We now know the Acting IRS Commissioner knew of these abuses for at \nleast a year, and officials at Treasury and as high up as the Chief of \nStaff at the White House were briefed before the leak despite the \nrepeated claims that the administration learned about it through news \nreports.\n  We know it was not just Cincinnati. IRS officials at the agency's \nWashington headquarters also sent queries to conservative groups asking \nabout their donors, and progressive groups, who operated the same way, \nwere not subjected to this type of harassment.\n  On top of all this there is real concern that IRS officials may have \nlied to Congress in an effort to cover up the agency's misdeeds. \nYesterday before the Finance Committee the former head of the agency \nwho was in charge at the time of these abuses claimed this was not \n``politically motivated,'' while at the same time he said he did not \nknow how the targeting happened.\n  Along with this impressive double-talk, he refused to apologize for \nthe abuses that went on under his watch.\n  Somebody has to be accountable. This is not a time for excuses; it is \na time for leadership. The President needs to fully cooperate with the \ncongressional investigations into the IRS scandal.\n  Last week, our entire caucus sent a letter to the White House that \ndemands at least this much from the administration. Washington's \ncredibility--what is left of it--is on the line. The American people \ndeserve to know what actions will be taken to ensure those who made \nthese decisions at the IRS will be held accountable.\n  The good news is people on both sides of the aisle--Republicans and \nDemocrats--are rightfully outraged. We are going to get to the bottom \nof this. People will be held accountable. At the very least those \nengaging in these unethical actions need to be fired. If they broke the \nlaw, they need to be prosecuted.\n  This scandal gives the already maligned IRS a black eye. It \nreinforces people's worst fears about Washington--that those in power \nwill use any means necessary to maintain that power.\n  Keep in mind this agency will be responsible for implementing and \nenforcing key provisions of the President's health care law, a law that \na majority of Arkansans do not support. If these types of abuses are \nallowed to go unchecked, what kind of bullying will go on when that \nimplementation begins, especially in light of the fact that the \nofficial who was in charge of the unit that targeted conservative \ngroups now runs the IRS office responsible for the health care law?\n  Everyone needs to be treated fairly under the law. Clearly, there are \nemployees at the IRS who do not subscribe to this principle. There must \nbe zero tolerance for the actions of those individuals.\n  Until we change the culture in Washington, we will not gain the \nconfidence of the American people. The onus is on us. Washington as a \nwhole--the White House, Congress, and every civil servant--has to \nremember whom we work for and to whom we are accountable. The actions \nof the IRS, along with the other scandals plaguing DC, only move us \nfurther from the goalpost, not closer.\n\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, I rise today to discuss a number of \nongoing controversies of national importance, including the IRS's \nunfair treatment of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status, \nthe secret gathering of journalists' phone records by the Department of \nJustice, and the administration's response to the attack on the U.S. \nconsulate in Benghazi.\n  Both the House and the Senate have held hearings with the former and \nacting IRS Commissioners, as well as the Treasury Department's \nInspector General for Tax Administration, who conducted an internal \naudit and authored the report revealing the pattern of government abuse \nwithin the IRS tax exempt division.\n  While I am pleased that Congress is judiciously exercising its \noversight powers, very few questions have been answered. The pattern of \ninconsistent explanations continues. We still do not know who exactly \ninitiated the practice of wrongfully targeting conservative groups.\n  Ironically, the Acting IRS Commissioner, Steven Miller, testified \nunder oath that there was absolutely no political motivation behind the \npractice; however, Mr. Miller could not identify the names of the \nindividuals whose motives he was supposedly vouching for. How is that \neven possible? Nebraskans know better than to buy that bill of goods.\n  We still do not know why this abusive policy was implemented in the \nfirst place. IRS officials have maintained that the extra scrutiny \ngiven to conservative groups was an attempt to deal with an influx of \napplications. As a number of fact checkers and media outlets have \nnoted, that surge in applications did not happen until well after the \ntargeting began. The reasoning for the practice put forth by the IRS \nsimply does not align with the facts.\n  We still do not know why the IRS believed it had the right to release \nconfidential data which it had wrongly requested in the first place. \nThey released that to third parties with adversarial interests to those \nconservative groups in question. The progressive publication ProPublica \nadmitted it obtained from the Internal Revenue Service illegally leaked \nconfidential tax forms from nine organizations.\n  All of the groups whose records were improperly released were \nconservative. Why did the IRS leak these records? What was their goal? \nWhy did only conservative organizations have their confidential \ninformation leaked? Why did the White House senior staff, including the \nWhite House Counsel and the White House Chief of Staff, fail to inform \nthe President of this egregious government overreach by the IRS?\n  Former Special Counsel to President Clinton, Lanny Davis, recently \nwrote an opinion piece in the Hill:\n\n       With all due respect to someone who has impeccable legal \n     credentials, if she did have such foreknowledge and didn't \n     inform the President immediately, I respectfully suggest Ms. \n     Ruemmler is in the wrong job and that she should resign.\n\n  Politico recently reported--the story keeps changing:\n\n       The White House explanation of what it knew about the IRS \n     story ahead of the first press reports on the controversy \n     shifted once again Thursday.\n\n  Let me repeat that, ``shifted once again.''\n  It seems that some folks from the White House cannot get their facts \nstraight. Why? The White House Press Secretary admitted yesterday that \nofficials in the White House discussed how and when the IRS would tell \nthe public the agency had been targeting conservative groups. The \neventual public disclosure was made by IRS Tax Exempt and Government \nEntities Division Director Lois Lerner, who revealed the pattern of \ngovernment abuse with an intentionally planted question at an otherwise \nlittle-noticed Washington, DC, lawyers conference.\n  It is outrageous that despite numerous congressional inquiries asking \nthe IRS for answers in both public hearings and formal letters, the IRS \nwould first reveal the truth through a charade of a ``planted'' \nquestion. Then Lerner went on to earn herself a ``bushel of \nPinocchios'' from the Washington Post fact checker for her series of \nmisstatements and ``weasley wording.''\n  Whatever happened to the President's worthy goals of promoting the \nmost accountable, the most transparent, the most open administration in \nhistory? I do not appreciate being misled, and Nebraskans do not \neither.\n  Regarding the secret collection of the Department of Justice of over \n100 Associated Press journalist phone records, two key questions \nremain. Why didn't the Department of Justice ask the Associated Press \nto voluntarily cooperate before issuing those subpoenas as the law \nrequires? And why did the Department of Justice fail to abide by the \nlaw\n\n[[Page S3708]]\n\nand inform the Associated Press that the records were subpoenaed, \ndenying them the opportunity to appeal that heavy-handed play?\n  Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson put it well:\n\n       The Obama administration has no business rummaging through \n     journalists' phone records, perusing their e-mails and \n     tracking their movements in an attempt to keep them from \n     gathering news. This heavy-handed business isn't chilling, \n     it's just plain cold.\n\n  But, once again, the overreach does not stop there. Recent news has \nsurfaced that a Fox News journalist was criminally investigated for \ndoing his job, lawfully soliciting information from a government \nsource. The Post describes the investigation in vivid detail. They used \nsecurity badge access records to track the reporter's comings and \ngoings from the State Department, according to a newly obtained court \naffidavit. They traced the timing of his calls with a State Department \nsecurity adviser suspected of sharing the classified report. They \nobtained a search warrant for the reporter's personal e-mails.\n  This assault on the First Amendment is unacceptable and the \nintimidation of reporters through unnecessary criminal investigations \nand excessive surveillance raises serious questions about the freedom \nof the press. The President and the Department of Justice have yet to \ncome forward with credible answers. The American people are still \nwaiting.\n  Finally, I would like to briefly touch on the tragic attack on our \nconsulate in Benghazi. Much attention has been paid to the internal \nWhite House e-mails and changes to U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice's talking \npoints explaining the source of the attacks.\n  I believe a key question still remains to be answered: Why for 2 \nweeks did the administration propagate the tale that it was a YouTube \nvideo-inspired attack when officials knew almost immediately it was \ncarried out by affiliates of al-Qaida? That is a pretty simple \nquestion.\n  Why were the American people told an anti-Islam YouTube video \nprompted the attacks when it was known it was not? No one has answered \nthis very basic question.\n  Instead of providing answers to these questions, a top White House \nadviser has impugned the integrity of those seeking the truth by \ndecrying persistent questioning as a ``witch hunt.'' It is time for the \nPresident to put politics aside, demand accountability from his staff, \nand step up and do his job.\n\n  Congress is doing its part by conducting serious oversight hearings \non both the IRS overreach and the Benghazi attack. Yet critical \ngovernment witnesses--such as the IRS Tax Exempt and Government \nEntities Division Director Lois Lerner--refuse to cooperate, insisting \non pleading the Fifth Amendment during hearings to set the record \nstraight.\n  It is up to the President. It is up to the President to transform \nthis culture of arrogance and change the above-the-law attitude that \nseems to have a grip over his departments and agencies. Ignorance, \nwillful or otherwise, is not going to cut it anymore. We simply cannot \nafford to have a President on the sidelines. This unraveling saga of \ngovernment gone wild demonstrates exactly one of two things: either the \nheight of government incompetence or gross abuse of power. Rather than \nsending surrogates out on the Sunday talk shows to claim ``the law is \nirrelevant'' with regard to that IRS overreach, I call on the President \nto work with Congress to build back the people's trust.\n  This includes taking responsibility for the actions of those working \nwithin the executive branch, enforcing the laws, and removing all those \nresponsible for this disturbing pattern of government overreach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3708-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3708-S3709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WHITE HOUSE SCANDALS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this last weekend White House adviser \nDan Pfeiffer visited all five Sunday morning talk shows. What he tried \nto do there was to defend the Obama administration's handling of the \nvarious scandals we are all too familiar with. Unfortunately for the \nPresident, I think he only made things worse.\n  For example, he said President Obama's whereabouts on the night of \nthe Benghazi terrorist attack were irrelevant. That is a strange use of \nthe word. Where the President is when a terrorist attack kills four \nAmerican citizens in Libya, to call that irrelevant strikes me as an \nodd choice of words.\n  He was also asked whether it is illegal for the IRS to target \nindividuals and organizations for political reasons. Again, he said, \n``It is irrelevant.'' Strange choice of words. In other words, if the \nAmerican people were hoping that this White House would finally provide \nstraight answers to basic questions, they were once again disappointed.\n  Let's review the facts starting with Benghazi, as the Senator from \nNebraska was just talking about.\n  Eight months, of course, have passed since four brave Americans were \nkilled by terrorists linked to al-Qaida. Eight months have passed since \nthe Obama administration blamed the attack on a spontaneous \ndemonstration incited by some amateur YouTube video.\n  Is it irrelevant that we don't know where the President of the United \nStates was on the night of the attack or what he did or did not do to \ncome to the aid of these four brave Americans who were at risk of \nlosing their lives and did, in fact, lose their lives? Is it irrelevant \nthat members of the Obama administration deliberately misled, time and \ntime again, the American people about this act of terrorism? Is it \nirrelevant that Ambassador Susan Rice was blaming the massacre on a \nYouTube video the very same day Libya's President was calling it a \npreplanned terrorist attack? Is it irrelevant that the former deputy to \nthe late Ambassador Chris Stevens has said that everybody at the U.S. \nEmbassy believed from the start that it was a terrorist attack? \nFinally, is it irrelevant that this former deputy, Gregory Hicks, was \npunished by the State Department for cooperating with congressional \ninvestigators so the truth could get out?\n  That is a strange choice of words--``irrelevant.'' I don't think the \nAmerican people believe that is irrelevant--any of these facts. In \nfact, I think what we can only conclude is that the culture the White \nHouse, unfortunately, has created is one where coverups, misdirection, \nprevarication and dissembling are OK, not being straight with the \nAmerican people.\n  No wonder the American people doubt their leadership in Washington \nand particularly in the White House if the White House is going to \ncreate a culture in which these sorts of coverups are OK or, in the \nwords of Dan Pfeiffer, simply irrelevant. When the American people \ncan't trust the White House to be honest with them--and refuses to \naccept responsibility for their mistakes--it is not irrelevant.\n  As for the IRS scandal, some people have tried to dismiss the \ntargeting of various conservative groups as a rogue operation managed \nby a few renegade staffers in the Cincinnati office. Yet the more we \nlearn about this scandal, the bigger it seems.\n  Anybody who has been around a big bureaucracy--and certainly the IRS \nqualifies as a big bureaucracy--knows that when you ask the bureaucrats \nsomething, the easiest answer is no because they don't get in trouble \nfor saying no. They may not be very helpful or responsive, but they \ndon't get in trouble.\n  What strikes me as so bizarre about this idea that there are a number \nof free agents in Cincinnati who decided to cook this up on their own \nis it really goes against the grain of everything we know about \nbureaucracies. Why in the world would they take the initiative to \ntarget political speech unless they thought they either had the \nexplicit or the implicit approval of their higher-ups? It just doesn't \nmake any sense otherwise.\n  Last week one Cincinnati IRS employee told the Washington Post--and I \nthink this has the ring of truth--that ``everything comes from the top. \nWe don't have any authority to make those decisions without someone \nsigning off on them. There has to be a directive.'' Now, that sounds \nlike the bureaucracy that I know and am familiar with.\n  So I would like to ask the White House if it is irrelevant that \nAmerica's tax collection agency was turned into a political attack \nmachine, deciding that they were the ones who could police political \nspeech and activity protected by\n\n[[Page S3709]]\n\nthe First Amendment to the Constitution? Is it irrelevant that an \nagency with the power to destroy people's lives adopted the tactics of \na dictator? Is it irrelevant that senior IRS officials learned about \nthese abuses at least 2 years ago and lied to Congress and the American \npeople when we asked them about them?\n  When I got reports from the King Street Patriots and True the Vote in \nHouston, TX, and the Waco and San Antonio tea parties in 2011 and 2012 \nabout some of the tactics they were being exposed to, I and other \nMembers of the Senate wrote to the Commissioner of the IRS Mr. Shulman, \nand Mr. Miller, the Acting Commissioner, and they failed to disclose \nwhat we now know is the truth. Senator Hatch, the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, yesterday told Mr. Miller that was a \nlie by omission at the very least. Certainly it was not telling the \nwhole truth to the Members of Congress, whose responsibility is to \nprovide oversight to the American people of the IRS and of the Federal \nGovernment. I don't think it is irrelevant when IRS Commissioner \nDouglas Shulman categorically denied these abuses in sworn testimony \nbefore the House Ways and Means Committee in March of 2012.\n  Furthermore, I don't think it is irrelevant that IRS officials may \nhave committed criminal offenses. I realize that is a serious statement \nand charge to make, but we know this morning that the director of the \nInternal Revenue Service division overseeing nonprofit organizations \nhas taken the Fifth Amendment when asked for sworn testimony by a \ncongressional oversight committee.\n  To refresh everybody's memory, the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution means that you cannot be compelled to incriminate yourself \nand possibly expose yourself by virtue of your own testimony to a \ncriminal prosecution. That is what taking the Fifth Amendment is.\n  While she is within her rights to take the Fifth Amendment, if she \nhas a credible fear of prosecution for violating the criminal laws, I \nbelieve this elevates this scandal to a new level.\n  Finally, I would suggest to our friends at the White House that it is \nnot irrelevant that a Texas businesswoman named Catherine Engelbrecht \nwas targeted not only by the IRS but by the FBI, the ATF, and OSHA \nafter she founded a pair of organizations in Houston, TX, known as the \nKing Street Patriots and True the Vote.\n  I think most Americans would agree that all of this information is \nquite relevant, quite reprehensible, and something that Congress ought \nto, on a bipartisan basis, investigate.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Max \nBaucus, a Democrat--not a member of my political party--and Senator \nOrrin Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, for the \nbipartisan way they have begun the investigation into this IRS scandal. \nWhat we all recognize, Republicans and Democrats alike, is that this is \na threat to the public's trust in government institutions and that this \nculture of intimidation is not something we can stand for, using the \nextraordinary power of the Federal Government to target American \ncitizens for exercising their constitutional rights. Indeed, if \nPresident Obama wants to know why the American people's trust in the \nFederal Government has plummeted to an alltime low, all he has to do is \nlook at these two scandals and consider how the administration is \nhandling them.\n  When government officials consistently mislead, stonewall, and abuse \ntheir power, people take notice, they don't forget, and the day of \nreckoning will surely come.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am here today to speak to the importance of bringing \nmuch needed reform to the Federal Sugar Program. I understand that this \nis not something the Presiding Officer supports and that this is not \nsomething the Agriculture Committee addressed in the farm bill. I think \nit is important to try to address some of the misinformation that is \nout there.\n  We have been hearing a lot of talk about the need to protect \nAmerica's sugar farmers. What we haven't heard is that sugar remains \nthe most tightly controlled commodity market in this country. We \ncurrently have what I believe is an outdated program that offers a \nsweet deal to a small group of sugar growers and processors at the \nexpense of too many other American businesses and at the expense of \nAmerican consumers.\n  What the amendment that I have offered with a number of cosponsors \nwill do is reform the Sugar Program to make U.S. manufacturers more \ncompetitive and to reduce prices for consumers. It will lower sugar \nprice support levels, and it will reform the excessive restrictions on \ndomestic supply and import quotas for sugars.\n  These reforms would save taxpayers money. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated that this legislation would save $82 million over \nthe next 10 years.\n  I think it is important to keep in mind the amendment we have \nintroduced does not eliminate the safety net for sugar producers. It \nsimply makes some moderate commonsense reforms in the program. Sugar \ngrowers would still be supported by the Sugar Loan Program and \nprotected by import restrictions and domestic market allotments. In \nfact, this amendment simply returns us to the same policies that sugar \nproducers themselves supported as recently as 2007.\n  Since 2008, sugar prices in the United States have soared to record \nhighs and they have consistently reached levels that are about twice \nthe world pricing of sugar. In fact, the Sugar Program has cost \nconsumers and businesses as much as $14 billion over the last 4 years. \nThis amendment would provide a smart, practical, and pragmatic fix to \nthe policies that are currently in place, and it is a bipartisan \nproposal. There are 18 other Senators from both sides of the aisle who \nhave joined on this amendment.\n  Again, we have been hearing about jobs that would be lost in the \nsugar industry if we make these moderate reforms, but the reality is we \nare already losing and have lost too many valuable manufacturing jobs \nacross this country as businesses close or move overseas in search of \nlower prices. We can see some of this illustrated on this chart. These \nare sugar-using jobs in the food industry, and there are more than 30 \ntimes as many of these jobs as there are in sugar production and \nprocessing. So we can see sugar-using food and beverage jobs, which is \nthe blue, compared to sugar farming, production, and processing, which \nis the red. That is 590,669 compared to 18,078. And where do these \nnumbers come from? Well, in fact, they are from the U.S. Census and the \nDepartment of Commerce.\n  Unfortunately, between 1997 and 2011, nearly 127,000 of these jobs, \nthe manufacturing jobs, were lost in sugar-using industries. In fact, \nthe U.S. Department of Commerce has estimated that for every one sugar-\ngrowing job that is saved through high sugar prices, approximately \nthree manufacturing jobs are lost. So again, let me put the numbers \ninto perspective, as this chart does. There are less than 5,000 sugar \ngrowers and processors in the country. U.S. data shows there are about \n18,000 total jobs in the sugar industry, compared with almost 600,000 \njobs in the sugar-using industry.\n  We have also been hearing this amendment would allow for an increase \nin foreign sugar into the U.S. market. This amendment maintains the \ncurrent import quotas for each country. Let me repeat that: It \nmaintains the current import quotas for each country. It allows the \nSecretary of Agriculture to modify these quotas if he or she determines \nit is necessary, just as they were able to do before 2008. The fact is \nthis amendment would have no impact on sugar imports from Mexico \nbecause under the North American Free Trade\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\nAgreement or NAFTA, Mexico currently is the only country without a \nquota for sugar importation, and that is true whether we pass this \namendment or not. That is true under the current system.\n  So even if we don't pass reforms, the argument that Mexico is coming \nin and bringing sugar into the country is true, there is sugar coming \nin from Mexico, but the fact is that is the way it is under the current \nprogram. Currently, sugar is the only--let me repeat, the only--\ncommodity program that was not reformed in the committee-passed farm \nbill that is under consideration now.\n  Let me be clear: I think the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry--Senator Stabenow and the committee--did a great job on that \nbill in most areas because they provided savings and they reformed the \nprogram. So it is particularly puzzling to me why they totally left the \nsugar subsidies out of the bill, that they did nothing to reform the \nSugar Program.\n  I don't think any program the Federal Government operates should be \nimmune from updates and improvements. We need to act, and we need to \nact now, to reform the Sugar Program and to protect those workers who \nare in the food industry that use sugar, and protect consumers who are \nspending more money than they should for the cost of sugar.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Madam President, Senator Collins and I are \nhere today to underscore the timeliness of a bipartisan solution we \nhave been pushing since March. While I firmly believe we should replace \nthe sequester with a balanced and comprehensive plan that delivers the \nsame deficit-reducing punch, it appears to me, and to all of us, the \nsequester is here to stay for at least the remainder of the fiscal year \nending September 30 of this year.\n  We need deficit reduction, but the way in which we are doing it under \nthe sequester is terrible policy and it is time to fix it. Just after \nthe fiscal year 2013 sequester was triggered, with Senator Collins' \nleadership, she and I introduced a commonsense plan that would empower \nFederal departments and agencies to replace the indiscriminate cuts of \nsequestration with more strategic cuts.\n  One only has to look at the way in which sequestration has endangered \ncritical programs for working families, our senior citizens, and the \nmiddle class to know we have to do more than we are doing today. \nThrowing up our hands and doing nothing is poor governing. Senator \nCollins and I believe we have a responsibility here as leaders to \ninject some measure of common sense into the process.\n  With that, Madam President, I wish to turn to my colleague Senator \nCollins for her thoughts on the necessity of the Collins-Udall \nlegislative proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, of course my friend and colleague from \nColorado is exactly right, and I want to thank him for his leadership \non this issue and for working with me to develop a bipartisan, \ncommonsense plan that would help to mitigate the harmful effects of the \nautomatic spending cuts known as sequestration that took effect on \nMarch 1.\n  I want to emphasize that under our proposal, budget targets would \nstill have to be met. We understand the need to confront our enormous \nFederal debt, which is approaching $17 trillion. But our plan does so \nin a sensible way. It recognizes that rather than imposing meat-ax \ncuts, we should be setting priorities. Our bill would give the heads of \nFederal agencies and departments affected by sequestration the \nflexibility to implement the required cuts in a much more thoughtful \nway by preserving vital programs and reducing or eliminating lower \npriority programs.\n  Our bill also ensures appropriate congressional oversight of these \ndecisions by requiring the agency heads to submit their spending plans \nto both the House and Senate appropriations committees 5 days before \nimplementing these decisions. These committees and their subcommittees \nknow the budgets of these agencies inside and out and will be able to \neffectively monitor their spending decisions, just as the committees \nnow oversee reprogramming requests.\n  Congress has already demonstrated that providing flexibility to \nFederal agencies in a commonsense way to address the unprecedented \nproblems caused by sequestration makes a great deal of sense. Recently \nCongress passed a bill we authored that gave the Department of \nTransportation the flexibility to end the furloughs of air traffic \ncontrollers and to, instead, reduce spending by transferring unused \nbalances from a grant program. That is the kind of decisionmaking \nflexibility we are talking about. In this case the furloughs were \ncausing terrible flight delays and had the potential to truly harm the \neconomies of Maine, Colorado, and countless other States that count on \ntourists visiting our amazing scenery, sampling our extraordinary food, \nand being with our great people. Had we not come together to pass this \nbill, the impacts could have been devastating to Maine and to Colorado \nbusinesses and their employees.\n  In Maine it would have affected everyone from our wait staff and our \ninnkeepers to our countless tourist attractions. It would have even \naffected Federal institutions such as the gem of Acadia National Park \nand our State parks as well. In our States, each season, but \nparticularly during those key peak summer months, we welcome with open \narms visitors from around the globe. If those visitors were going to \nhave to sit on a tarmac for 3 hours awaiting a flight, they most likely \nwere going to cancel their trips.\n  I am proud of the work Senator Udall and I did to pass this \nbipartisan bill, but more can and should be done to give other agencies \nthe same kind of flexibility to set wise spending priorities.\n  I would turn to the Senator from Colorado to ask him if he agrees \nthat isn't a better approach than across-the-board cuts with no \nflexibility?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. The Senator from Maine has it exactly right, \nand I commend her for her leadership.\n  I want to point out to those who were critical of what we did when it \ncame to the FAA, it is not just elite business travelers or Members of \nCongress who use our air transportation. It is families, it is seniors, \nit is businesswomen, and every American possible using our air \ntransportation system. We see the egalitarian nature of our air \ntransportation system when we are in our airports.\n  Senator Collins brokered a sensible compromise that kept our airports \nrunning, flights on time, and commerce flowing smoothly. I remember \nSenator Collins standing here on the floor, somewhat late at night, \nappealing to both of our leaders. So Senator Collins led the way.\n  We also moved in the furloughs for meat inspectors. If we can deal \nwith these small corners of sequestration, we can go all in. We have \nproven we can find consensus. It is time to finish that job.\n  I want to turn back to my colleague for any final thoughts she might \nhave to make about our bill and the importance of this effort we have \nunderway.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I want to thank my good friend and colleague. It \nwouldn't have happened without his support. We took a bipartisan \napproach, and that is the kind of approach we are taking today in \nurging our colleagues to look at our bill and our leaders to move it.\n  Many agencies face the same challenges that were encountered by the \nFAA, and many agencies know of better ways to meet the sequestration \ntargets. I have long believed these across-the-board cuts where we \ndon't prioritize simply do not make sense.\n  Last week, the Department of Defense announced that because the Navy \nwas able to identify cost-effective ways to meet its budget targets, \nthousands of hardworking men and women at our Nation's naval shipyards, \nsuch as the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME, would not have to \nbe furloughed. I had long argued the Department of Defense has the \nflexibility to minimize\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\nthe furloughs because we gave them that authority as part of the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  I would be remiss if I did not note, however, my disappointment that \nsome of the workers at the shipyard, and others, such as those in the \nNational Guard and at other facilities, such as the Defense Accounting \nServices Center in Limestone, ME, still face furloughs.\n  There are other important programs as well. Biomedical researchers \nand school superintendents are also in a quandary of having little or \nno flexibility to implement the sequestration targets.\n  Instead of enacting piecemeal fixes--whether it is the FAA or it is \nthe meat inspectors--our bill would empower administrators to head off \nthis problem and avoid indiscriminate spending cuts. We can mitigate \nthe harmful effects of sequestration, protect jobs, and avoid mindless \nspending cuts while tackling the very real problem of excessive and \nunnecessary spending by simply allowing managers to distinguish between \nvital programs, to be creative, and to cut those that are of lesser \nimportance.\n  I know my colleague from Colorado would agree that no business facing \nthe need to cut expenses would ever treat every program and function \nand service of that business as if they were of equal worth. Instead, \nthe business managers and executives and employees would evaluate all \nthe programs and set priorities. That is all we are asking.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado, my good friend Senator Udall, for \nhis strong partnership on our effort to protect the jobs of hard-\nworking Americans, prevent arbitrary spending cuts, yet deal with an \nunsustainable $16.8 trillion debt. We know our approach would go a long \nway toward allowing priorities to be set. After all, if we are not \ngoing to set priorities, to make the tough decisions and distinguish \namong absolutely vital programs and those that could be cut or \neliminated, then we might as well go home and just have a computer \napply a formula to the budget.\n  That is not why we are here and that is not what the American people \nexpect. They expect us to exercise judgment and make good decisions.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I believe our time has \nexpired or is beginning to expire, but I wish to underline what Senator \nCollins has said. We are passionate about this. Some say a passionate \nproblem solver is an oxymoron or a passionate moderate is an oxymoron. \nThat is not the case here. We want to solve this. We both have private \nsector experience. This is not how you would run a concern in the \nprivate sector. We can do this. We have shown we can do this. Let's \nmove forward and provide certainty, not just to the Federal agencies \nbut to the people in this country. At a time of tough economic \nchallenges with a fragile recovery underway, we need to create more \ncertainty and need to budget in a wiser, smarter way.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine for her leadership.

Madam President, I understand that Senator Baldwin is on \nher way to make her maiden speech, and I promise I will stop talking \nthe moment she enters the Chamber. I thank my colleague from Colorado.\n  Later today, the Senate will vote on a resolution that has been \nintroduced by Senators Menendez and Graham. I am pleased to join my \nSenate colleagues in cosponsoring this resolution, which reaffirms our \ncommitment to a strong U.S.-Israeli relationship and to preventing Iran \nfrom becoming a nuclear power.\n  At this time in our history, it is more important than ever that we \ndemonstrate a firm commitment to our allies--even if the neighborhood \nthey are in looks more like a tinderbox than it has in decades. This \nresolution reaffirms that the United States will be a reliable friend \nand a determined ally, even in dangerous times--indeed, especially in \ndangerous times.\n  We are at a critical juncture in our efforts to prevent Iran from \nobtaining a nuclear weapons capability. During my time in the Senate, I \nhave repeatedly supported legislation imposes sanctions on Iran and \nputs pressure on the regime to change course. I worked with my good \nfriend former-Senator Lieberman to pass legislation which ensures that \norganizations that inspect commercial ships for the U.S. government are \nnot also providing services to governments like Iran that sponsor \nterrorism.\n  This resolution reiterates the significance that we place on keeping \nthe full force of sanctions on Iran.\n  In the face of an existential threat to our country, the American \npeople would expect the U.S. to take action. This resolution says that \nwe will support Israel's right to do the same.\n  Let me read the powerful language in the resolution. Congress \n``declares that the United States has a vital national interest in, and \nunbreakable commitment to, ensuring the existence, survival, and \nsecurity of the State of Israel, and reaffirms United States support \nfor Israel's right to self-defense.''\n  Congress ``urges that, if the Government of Israel is compelled to \ntake military action in legitimate self-defense against Iran's nuclear \nweapons program, the United States Government should stand with Israel \nand provide, in accordance with United States law and the \nconstitutional responsibility of Congress to authorize the use of \nmilitary force, diplomatic, military, and economic support to the \nGovernment of Israel in its defense of its territory, people, and \nexistence.''\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the United \nStates Senate as well as with President Obama to close the loopholes in \ncurrent sanctions legislation and to ensure that the cooperation that \nhas existed between the United States and the State of Israel for over \n60 years remains steadfast and unshakeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as I make my first remarks on the \nSenate floor, I have the honor of occupying the same Senate seat, and \nin fact occupying the very Senate desk, once used by Senator Robert M. \nLaFollette, Sr. ``Fighting Bob LaFollette,'' as he was known, was a \nRepublican Senator from Wisconsin a century ago who is credited as the \nfounder of the Progressive Party and progressive movement in this \nNation. I admire Fighting Bob's legacy in many ways. But I wish to \nassure my colleagues who are present in the Chamber at this moment that \nI will not emulate his maiden speech, which went on for 3 successive \ndays.\n  Bob LaFollette ran for this office because he was concerned that \nwhile corporate interests were being well served in Washington, \nordinary people weren't even being heard. He traveled all around the \nState of Wisconsin, literally speaking from makeshift stages of soap \nboxes and hay wagons at county fairs. His message came to define my \nState's progressive tradition. The things he talked about in that day \nstill ring true.\n  As I have traveled the State Wisconsinites have told me that the \npowerful and well-connected seem still to write their own rules while \nthe concerns and struggles of middle-class families go unnoticed in \nWashington. They believe our economic system is tilted toward those at \nthe top and that our political system exists to protect those unfair \nadvantages instead of making sure everybody gets a fair shot.\n  They see Washington happy to let Wall Street write their own rules \nbut unable to help students pull themselves out of debt. They see \nWashington working to protect big tax breaks for powerful corporations \nbut unwilling to protect small manufacturers from getting ripped off by \nChina's cheating.\n\n[[Page S3712]]\n\nThey see Washington bouncing from one manufactured fiscal crisis to the \nnext but never addressing the real and ongoing crisis of our \ndisappearing middle class.\n  The truth is, while we hear a lot about the wide distance between \nDemocrats and Republicans, the widest and most important distance in \nour political system is between the content of the debate in Washington \nand the concerns of hard-working people in places such as Wisconsin. \nThat distance parallels the large and growing gaps between rich and \npoor, between rising costs and the stagnant incomes, between our Nation \nand our competitors when it comes to education and innovation--and it \nis truly hurting people.\n  When my grandparents were raising me, I learned that if you worked \nhard and played by the rules, one can get ahead. The Wisconsinites I \ntalked to grew up learning that very same thing. They are working as \nhard as ever to get ahead, but many are finding they are hardly getting \nby. People are still working for that middle-class dream: a job that \npays the bills, health coverage they can rely on, a home they can call \ntheir own, a chance to save for their kid's college education, and a \nsecure retirement. But, instead, too many are finding that even two \njobs are not enough to make ends meet, and those jobs are hard to find \nand hard to keep. They are finding the homes they worked so hard to own \nare not even worth what still remains on their mortgage. They are \nfinding that the cost of college is going up, and they are worried they \nmight never be able to retire comfortably.\n  That is the biggest gap of all, the gap between the economic security \nWisconsinites worked so hard to achieve and the economic uncertainty \nthey are asked to settle for.\n  If we cannot close that gap, we might someday talk about the middle \nclass as something we used to have, not something each generation can \naspire to. We all get it. We all see this happening. While \nWisconsinites do not agree about what we should do, they want to see us \nworking together to find a solution, even if it takes some spirited \ndebate.\n  But when they look across that yawning divide to Washington, they see \nus advancing talking points and playing politics instead of putting our \nvarying experiences and talents to work solving these problems.\n  But I am optimistic. I did not run for the Senate just because I \nagree with those complaints. I ran for the Senate because I think we \ncan do better. I know I have a great example to follow in the people of \nWisconsin. These are particularly tough times for my State. Even as the \nNational economy is rebounding, businesses in Wisconsin and middle-\nclass families in my State remain stuck in neutral.\n  The manufacturing sector that sustained our prosperity for \ngenerations has taken a lot of hits--some that could have been \nprevented and others that are simply a factor of our changing economy \nand our changing world. But we do not see Wisconsin workers and \nbusiness owners wallowing in crisis or looking for someone to blame. \nOur State motto is one word, ``Forward.'' That is the only thing we \nknow.\n  In the short time I have been here, I have made it my mission to \nfight to make sure Wisconsinites have the tools and skills they need to \nsucceed in a ``Made in Wisconsin'' economy that revitalizes our \nmanufacturing sector and rebuilds our prosperity--and this means \nrespecting our labor.\n  It means investing in regional hubs of collaborative research and \ndevelopment, supporting the technical colleges that are working to \nprovide a skilled workforce, and encouraging public and private \npartnerships to revitalize our manufacturing sector. But it all relies \non the talent of individuals who are working hard to help our \ncommunities move forward.\n  Years ago John Miller, a disabled Marine Corps veteran who lives near \nMilwaukee, invented a new kind of motorcycle windshield that uses LED \nlights embedded in acrylic. For years he has been working hard to find \ninvestors to bring his idea to market. He has been testing different \nacrylics, showing off his work at trade shows, and spending months \ntrying to get approvals from the Department of Transportation. \nInvestors are lining up at John's door. Harley-Davidson even wanted to \nbuy his patent. But he doesn't just want to make a profit, he wants to \nmake a difference. He is holding out until he knows that everything in \nhis product will be made and manufactured in the United States--\nhopefully by other disabled veterans, who often have a hard time \nfinding work when they come home.\n  Wisconsin is full of John Millers--ordinary people with ingenuity, \ndetermination, and civic spirit to become not just successful but \nengines of economic opportunity for their whole communities, committed \nto the common good.\n  I am so proud of all the remarkable potential I have seen in \nWisconsin: the Global Water Center in Milwaukee, which will open this \nsummer as an incubator for water technology businesses; the partnership \nof Johnson Controls and UW-Milwaukee for the Innovation Campus research \npark in Wauwatosa; the advances in energy-efficiency technology being \nrealized at Orion Energy Systems in Manitowoc, WI; the work on \nsustainable biofuels at the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center in \nMadison; and small business incubators at technical colleges across our \nState helping to build the dreams of entrepreneurs.\n  These stories of innovation and cooperation and these exciting \nopportunities to build an economy made to last are happening all over \nour country.\n  I am going to let people in on a little secret. We here in the Senate \ncan be innovative too. We can cooperate. We can get excited by these \nopportunities. It is true of Democrats and Republicans alike because \nnone of us came here just to audition for cable news or to win our next \nelection before the bumper stickers from the last one even come off the \ncars.\n  I have already had the great joy of working with colleagues from both \nparties, and I know neither party has a monopoly on compassion or \ncommon sense. There is nothing liberal or conservative about wanting to \nhelp our manufacturers compete and win on the world stage. There is not \na Senator in this body whose heart has not broken when listening to a \nconstituent who cannot seem to get ahead. We cannot fix all of those \ngaps in our economy with one bill. Not even ``Fighting Bob'' La \nFollette could close that divide in our political system with one \nspeech.\n  I am using this speech, my first here on the Senate floor, to say \nthat I am ready to work hard and work with anyone to make progress on \nthese challenges and help move this great country forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before the Senator from Wisconsin leaves \nthe floor, I would like to indicate how thrilled I am to have another \nGreat Lakes Senator with us in the Senate. Senator Baldwin is an \ninvaluable member of the Budget Committee. She is fighting hard for \nWisconsin agriculture. Now that we are in the middle of the efforts on \nthe farm bill, I know she is deeply involved and concerned about our \nmen and women who provide the food we put on our tables every day.\n  We thank the Senator for her leadership. We are so pleased to have \nSenator Baldwin in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3712-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I \nwas giving a speech, I say to the gentlelady who is managing this bill. \nIronically, it was Duncan, OK, where they had the first hydraulic \nfracturing in 1949. I was there talking to them, and this was Democrats \nand Republicans. When they asked about the farm bill, I said: What farm \nbill, because 80 percent of the farm bill is not a farm bill, it is a \nwelfare bill. We are talking about the food stamp program.\n  This is a shocker to people. They don't understand this. Why would \nthey call this a farm bill if 80 percent of it is talking about the \nfood stamp program? It is now at $800 billion over 10 years. In the \nfirst 5 years, enrollment in the food stamp program has grown by 70 \npercent. It has gone from 28 million families to 47 million families, \nand that is almost doubling in a period of 4 years. I don't say this \ncritically. There are some people who are very liberal and feel \ngovernment should have a greater involvement in our lives, and \ncertainly that is what this system is all about. We sort of weigh these \nthings and see. I cannot think of anyone who could rationally say that \nthis program of food stamps could justify being increased by 100 \npercent in a period of 4 years.\n  It reminds me of a time many years ago when most of us had gone \nthrough elementary school. At that time we heard about Alexis De \nTocquevile, a guy who came to this country. He looked at the wealth of \nAmerica, and in the last paragraph of the last chapter of his book, he \nsays: Once the people of this country finally vote themselves money out \nof the public trust, the system will fail. What he talked about there \nis that it gets to the point where 50 percent of the people are on the \nreceiving end of government. I know we all remember that, and maybe a \nlot of people think that times have changed, but we have to stop \nsomewhere.\n  I think this amendment is the most important amendment on the farm \nbill because it actually turns this into a farm bill. I would think \nthat people who are as concerned with agriculture as I am--my State of \nOklahoma is a big agriculture State, and I am very concerned about \nagriculture. I cannot find anyone in my State who says this should be \npart of a program that would be a charity bill and could be voted on on \nits own merits and not thrown in with the farm bill.\n  So over the same time period in the last 4 years, this has grown. It \nhas increased by 100 percent. The cost has gone from $37 billion to $75 \nbillion. That is a 100-percent increase in one program.\n  Enrollment in the program has even increased as the employment rate \nhas declined. In 2010, when the average unemployment rate was 9.6 \npercent across the country, enrollment was 40.3 million people or \nfamilies. In 2012, when the unemployment rate was 8 percent, which is \n1.5 percent lower than it was in 2010, enrollment had increased to 46 \nmillion people. Unfortunately, as the farm bill is written, it only \nmakes a 4-percent cut in the program over 10 years, which is a cut of \nless than 0.5 percent. I think those who say: Wait a minute, we are \ncutting that program--when it is cut by 0.5 percent, that is not really \na cut.\n  The amendment is very straightforward and very simple. It converts \nthe program into a block grant so that the States will have all the \nauthority they need to ensure the program prevents the impoverished \nfrom going hungry. The funding provided is sufficient to provide \nbenefits to the same number of participants as were enrolled in the \nmid-2000s. Money would be divided among the States proportionately \nbased on the number of individuals who are living below the Federal \npoverty line. It would have to be fair. It is not going to go according \nto population, it is not going to go according to size or wealth, but \nto those who are living below the poverty line.\n  The new program would give States the ability to keep the money they \nreceived for 5 years so they can build flexibility into their programs \nwhich will allow their programs to shrink and grow as the economy \nchanges. After 5 years, any unused money would return to the Treasury \nfor deficit reduction.\n  While the amendment is careful to give States maximum control over \nthe design and implementation of their own programs--which is what we \nwant to happen--it does require them to include work requirements, \nmandatory drug testing, and verification of citizenship prior to \nqualifying anyone to participate in the program.\n  If we go out in the street in any of the towns of any of the States \nin this country and ask people if it is unreasonable to require people \nto have work requirements--certainly the last time when President \nClinton was in office, we enacted some major reforms that included work \nrequirements, and most of the Democrats were very supportive of that. \nCertainly people should not be concerned about mandatory drug testing \nand verification of citizenship. The citizenship issue is something we \nhear quite often. Further, States would not be allowed to authorize \nusers to purchase alcohol, tobacco, dog food, and items like that.\n  In total, I expect this amendment to save some $300 billion over 10 \nyears relative to the current funding baseline.\n  I feel very strongly about this. This is one of those issues people \nare talking about all over the country. I know when my wife comes back \nand she talks about how people who are perfectly capable of working are \nbuying items such as beer, among other things, with their food stamps--\nthis is something that offends Democrats, Republicans, liberals, and \nconservatives alike throughout America.\n  That amendment is going to come up at noon, 15 minutes from now, and \nI encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment and turn the farm \nbill into a farm bill instead of a charity bill.\n  If no one else wants to speak, I would like to make one comment about \nwhat happened in Oklahoma.\n  I came back yesterday from my State of Oklahoma. We have all seen on \nthe media the disaster and the heart-wrenching things happening in \nMoore, OK. I remember so well that 14 years ago, in 1999, another \ntornado came through. If we look at it, it was on the same path as this \ntornado which came through 2 days ago, and it was just about the same \ndevastation. I stood there and recalled what I saw in 1999. It breaks \nmy heart when we see these people. They were trying to match missing \nparents with missing kids. Think about that.\n  We had two schools. When we looked at the rubbish, we felt that all \nthe kids could have been killed in there. It was hard to imagine that \nanyone could have survived. Yet some did survive.\n  The early reports of the deaths were a lot higher, and the deaths are \nvery important, but that is not the only thing. There are people in the \nhospitals right now who are trying--one of the hospitals had to \nevacuate every bed in that hospital when they saw it coming, and it is \na miracle that not one person--not one of the people who was in that \nhospital--was killed. No one can understand how that could have \nhappened.\n  We watched this going on and we saw parents--I have 20 kids and \ngrandkids and I can't imagine what it would be like to go through \nsomething like that. I have to say the Federal Government, the State \ngovernment, the county government, the city of Oklahoma City, the city \nof Moore, and all the private sector have joined in together. I have \nnever seen any effort, including the 1999 effort, that drew people \ntogether the way this has. We have seen companies represented by people \nwho are builders and developers who have heavy equipment and trucks and \nthings such as that and they are donating them to this cause to help \nthese people.\n  I want everyone to pray for these people, for the families, and for \nus to pull together and make this thing survivable. I know Oklahoma is \nin the tornado belt. Everybody reminds me of that all the time, and it \nis true. I remember being closely involved, either at the time of or \nright after, in almost every tornado in the last 25 or 30 years. A \nlittle town called Picher, OK, had a\n\n[[Page S3715]]\n\ntiny tornado, but it wiped out everything. That is the thing that is \ncharacteristic about tornadoes: No one survived, with one exception. \nThey are now talking about accelerating the number of safe rooms and \ntornado shelters.\n  This is a program that started in 1999, and I can't tell my \ncolleagues--we are trying to evaluate right now how many more people in \nOklahoma are alive today because they were taking advantage of that \nprogram and I am sure many more will as well.\n  I know others wish to speak on this bill, but I want to say that we \nin Oklahoma appreciate the love and the help on all government levels \nas well as the private sector levels and ask sincerely for the prayers \nof everyone within earshot.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, before speaking on the amendment, I \nwish to share--and I know everyone in the Senate wishes to share--their \nthoughts and prayers with the people of Oklahoma.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma knows, I have a strong \nconnection with Oklahoma. My mom grew up on a farm picking cotton in \nOklahoma, and we have talked before about my grandparents, until they \npassed away, being there. It was a wonderful trip for my family to go \nto Ponca City, OK, in later years to my grandparents to visit every \nsummer. I will never forget that in the backyard my grandparents had a \ntornado shelter, basically. It was on a little mound of dirt. We opened \nthe door and it was just like Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz, opening the \ndoor and going down into the cellar. A couple of times in the middle of \nthe night we had to get up and go use the cellar, and I know how \nfrightening it was for me as a child to experience that.\n  I know the storms have gotten more and more intense with more and \nmore devastation. We all hope for the very best in the recovery for all \nthe families involved.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, if I could quickly respond, I recall the \nSenator from Michigan speaking about her family background in Oklahoma. \nThe only thing I disagree with is we have always had these. Statistics \nshow they are not any more intense; they are not showing that they are \ngetting more intense, and worse, they are just bad. The storm shelters \nthe Senator from Michigan is speaking about, you drive through Oklahoma \nin the rural areas, everybody has them. We have dug them, because we \nhave been using them for many years.\n  The major difference here is in the major cities; they don't have \nthem as we do. I would say 95 percent of people in the rural areas have \nthem, but in the city, maybe half of 1 percent, so that will be getting \nsome attention from us.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for her thoughts.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I appreciate \nthe concerns raised by the Senator, but I rise in strong opposition to \nblock granting and cutting the food assistance program called SNAP, the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, for our country.\n  I have always viewed, as chair of the Agriculture Committee, two \nprograms very similarly. The first is crop insurance, which is there \nwhen there is a disaster for a farmer. The second one is SNAP or the \nSupplemental Food Assistance Program, which is there when there is a \ndisaster for a family. They both go up when the disasters go up, and \nthey go down when things get better. So when we have droughts, when we \nhave what has been happening to our farmers over the last year and \nbefore, we see costs go up for crop insurance. We don't cap that \narbitrarily saying, We don't like these droughts, we don't like these \nbreezes, we don't like all this stuff, so even though it is real \nimportant to the farmers, we are going to cap how much we will help \nthem. The crop insurance is there.\n  The same thing is true for a family. It wasn't that long ago--in \nfact, the beginning of 2009--when we in Michigan had the highest \nunemployment rate in the country. I believe it hit 15.7 percent \nunemployment at that time. We had an awful lot of people at that time--\nand many who have continued although things are getting a lot better--\nwho have paid taxes all of their lives; never thought in their wildest \ndreams they would ever need help putting food on the table for their \nfamilies, but they did. It was temporary. The average length of time \nsomeone needs help is 10 months. But I consider that to be a point of \npride for our country, that we have a value system which says we are \ngoing to make sure when families are hit with hard times through no \nfault of their own, they are not going to starve; they are going to be \nable to put food on the table for their children. I think that is the \nbest about us.\n  Now that things are getting better and the unemployment rate is \ncoming down, the cost of these programs is coming down. Our farm bill \nshows a cut in spending not because we have decided we are only going \nto help some people and not other people--some children, not other \nchildren--but because people are going back to work. They didn't need \nthe help anymore, so we are seeing those lines go down. By the way, as \ncrop insurance goes up because disasters and weather events have gone \nup, we are seeing family disasters going down, which is where we want \nit to go.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment would cap the amount of help we would \ngive on supplemental nutrition. It would cap it for 2014 at just over \nhalf of the current levels, so we would say we don't care how many \nfamilies have a problem, we don't care what happens; we don't care what \nhappens because of weather that wipes out a business and suddenly folks \nwho have worked hard all of their lives find they need some help they \nnever thought they would need. This would arbitrarily cap at just over \nhalf the current levels needed to maintain the current help. It would \nmean absolutely devastating results for millions of families who are \ntrying to feed their children.\n\n  If we consider the fact that about 47 percent of those who get help \nright now are children--almost half of the food help in this country is \nfor children--and then we add to that another 17 percent for senior \ncitizens and the disabled, and we put that together, we find this \namendment would be insufficient to even cover those individuals, let \nalone the other 37 percent of men and women who get help right now. \nUnfortunately, block granting this program would not only--and capping \nit and cutting it--would not only hurt families who are counting on us \nfor temporary help but it would create a situation where we couldn't \nrespond during an economic recession as we can right now.\n  Again, crop insurance means we respond. When there is a disaster, \ncosts and spending go up. I support that. But in this area, if we are \ncapping and block granting and sending it back to the States, there \nwould be no ability to be able to do that.\n  The other thing that I think is absolutely true for many of our \nStates--and certainly, unfortunately, I regret to say, in my own State \nright now; it is a fact--is that by block granting and not requiring \nthat the dollars be used for food assistance for families, there is no \nguarantee it will go to food assistance. None. When we look at the \npressures on budgets and other areas for critical needs or things \npeople feel are important, we have absolutely no guarantee that this \nwould go to food for families.\n  We have a very efficient program right now. It has one of the best \nerror rates of any Federal program right now--maybe the lowest--and we \nare able to efficiently support families and do it in a way that \nguarantees they actually get the nutritious food they need.\n  I am deeply concerned about the amendment. I do not support it. I \nthink it takes us in exactly the wrong direction as a country. It \nleaves a whole lot of families high and dry in an economic disaster, or \nany kind of disaster that could occur for them. At their most \nvulnerable point, when they are trying to figure out what to do to get \nback on their feet, we create a situation where they don't even have \nenough food for their families to be able to feed them during their \neconomic crisis.\n  I strongly urge colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would be happy to.\n\n[[Page S3716]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. In listening to the comments of the Senator from Michigan \nin opposition to this amendment, this occurred to me: Does the Senator \nfrom Michigan see that there is anything wrong with the fact that this \nprogram has increased by 100 percent in the last 4 years? And, \nsecondly, does the Senator from Michigan see nothing objectionable \nabout projecting this for another 4 years to be another 100-percent \nincrease in costs?\n  Ms. STABENOW. First, to my friend from Oklahoma, I would say the \nbudget office has indicated it will not only not go up another 100 \npercent, it is going down. So they have projected about an $11.5 \nbillion reduction which we have put into our farm bill. It is going \ndown because the economy is getting better.\n  We know that with food assistance, as the unemployment rate goes up, \none of the lagging indicators, the things that aren't affected as \nquickly in coming down, is food assistance for families. So it is now \ncoming down. In my judgment, it is coming down the way it should come \ndown, which is the fact that people are going back to work; that is why \nit is coming down.\n  Again, to arbitrarily cap something as basic as food going on the \ntable for a family is something that I, with all due respect, can't \nsupport.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, if I may ask my colleague one last \nquestion. The Senator from Michigan believes it is going to be going \ndown, but it did not go down when the unemployment rate went down \nbetween the 2 years of 2010 and 2011. What would be different about \nthis time?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Here is what we are finding--and it is not my belief, \nit is the CBO scoring. The Congressional Budget Office, which we rely \non, provides objective scoring--not my judgment--and it is telling us \nit is going down. The Senator is correct that it is slow to go down. As \nunemployment goes down, it takes a little longer before food help goes \ndown, because we provide some help to people as they are getting back \nto work even if they are not at full speed back to work. So it does go \ndown more slowly, but they have adjusted it over the next 10 years \nshowing that, in fact, the spending on food assistance is going down \nbecause the economy is getting better. That comes from the CBO and is \nbuilt into the dollars we have in the bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. One last question. Even though I disagree with the answer \nof the Senator from Michigan for the second question, the first \nquestion is whether the Senator from Michigan finds it objectionable \nthat it increased by 100 percent over the past 4 years from 2010?\n  Ms. STABENOW. What I find objectionable is so many people lost their \njobs. The reason it went up is because people were out of work. So I \nfind that objectionable because a lot of those folks were in my State.\n  I have worked very hard to do everything I can to support the private \nsector, and the good news is that manufacturing is coming back and \nagriculture is strong and moving forward. So in my judgment, yes, I \nfind it very concerning that more people needed help putting food on \ntheir table. The good news is that less of them are going to in the \nnext decade, and that is because people are going to be getting back to \nwork.\n  I believe our time has expired. I don't know if we have others who \nwish to speak at this point.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n               UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H. CON. RES. 25\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise to speak briefly about the Senate \nbudget. At the close of my comments, I will make yet another motion to \nput the Senate budget into conference with the House.\n  As we all know, we were here until 5 a.m. on March 23 to pass the \nfirst Senate budget through regular budgetary order in 4 years. It was \na full, open process both in committee, with numerous amendments, and \nthen on the Senate floor, with over 100 amendments voted on and over 70 \npassed.\n  It is now past time, many days past time, for us to begin a budget \nconference process. This will enable the Senate to return to normal \nbudgetary order, and it is what our voters, both Democratic and \nRepublican, in all of our States expect us to do to have a meaningful \nconference about this budget with the House.\n  Good news. We are seeing some recent examples of normal compromise in \nthis body that I think is worthy of some attention: the appropriations \nbill we passed through a regular order process for the remainder of \n2013 in March; the marketplace fairness bill we passed, the problem \nthat had been searching for a solution for 15 to 20 years; the WRDA \nbill we passed last week; and the debates we are having about the farm \nbill today. All have involved significant open processes in a \ncommittee, significant open processes on the Senate floor. The Senate \naction then moves in a regular order action into discussion with the \nHouse.\n  I think it is up to this body to show the public we don't just \nembrace regular order and normal processes on these important issues, \nbut that we also embrace them on something as critically important as \nthe Federal budget.\n  For that reason, I would ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that \nthe amendment which is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the \nbudget resolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; \nthat H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees on the part of the Senate; that following the \nauthorization, two motions to instruct conferees be in order: motion to \ninstruct relative to the debt limit and motion to instruct relative to \ntaxes/revenue; that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided between \nthe two leaders or their designees prior to votes in relation to those \nmotions; further, that no amendments be in order to either of the \nmotions prior to the votes; and all of the above occurring with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  I make that motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection by the Senator from \nFlorida?\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would \nask the Senator from Virginia if he would consider adding--I would ask \nconsent that the Senator modify his request that it not be in order for \nthe Senate to consider a conference report that includes reconciliation \ninstructions to raise the debt limit.\n  The reason I make that is as follows: First of all, I do respect \nregular order tremendously. In fact, I want to take this brief \nopportunity to congratulate the Judiciary Committee on the lengthy \nprocess with regard to the immigration bill, which I think will help us \nin the process of having a better product.\n  Obviously, also, although we disagree with the outcome because of the \nway it was constructed, I also disagree with the way this budget is \nconstructed. This issue of the debt limit is an extraordinary measure. \nThat is why I would ask the Senator from Virginia to modify his \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator still modify his request?\n  Mr. KAINE. I do not agree to the modification because I think that \nwould be modifying the budget that was passed by this body on March 23.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise again in regret. The normal \nregular order of this body after both sides of the Capitol have agreed \non a budget is to meet and that we have a proper process to instruct \nconferees to have a budget. A motion to appoint conferees to be bound \nby a requirement, no matter how worthy it is, is not the way the \nregular order functions in this body, and that is a fact.\n  For 4 years I sat here and beat up on the majority leader for his \nfailure to bring a budget to the floor of this Senate. We brought a \nbudget to the floor. We spent many hours on all kinds of amendments, \nand now we can't go to conference unless we agree not to raise the debt \nlimit.\n  Does my colleague from Florida believe the House of Representatives, \ndominated by Republicans, is going to raise the debt limit? Does my \ncolleague from Florida believe any conferees who are appointed, where \nwe have to place certain restrictions on those conferees, that would \napply to the other body as well? I don't think so.\n  I don't think that is the way this body is supposed to function. We \nare in a gridlock. Here we are, 4 years without a budget. We finally \nget a budget, we stay up all night, and because somebody doesn't want \nto raise the debt limit we are not going to go to conference. That is \nnot how this body should function.\n  The American people deserve better. They deserve a budget. Every \nfamily in America has to live on a budget. Here we are objecting \nbecause there is a concern about raising the debt limit.\n  All I can say to my friend from Florida is that the American people \ndon't like it, and I don't like it. Most of his colleagues and the \nRepublicans in this Senate don't like it that we are blocking budget \nconferees from going forward and doing what conferees are supposed to \ndo. I would imagine the majority leader will continue to raise this \nmotion to move forward.\n  By the way, it is the regular order to have motions to instruct the \nconferees. A motion to instruct the conferees on the debt limit should \nbe in order. A motion to instruct relative to taxes and revenue should \nbe in order. That is\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\nthe regular order to do it. It is not the regular order to demand \ncertain conditions on the conferees. We instruct the conferees.\n  The conferees are appointed by both the majority and Republican \nleader, and we place our confidence in those conferees to reflect the \nwill of the majority.\n\n  I have to say I am disappointed in the Senator from Florida, in his \nobjection and his demand that we do something that is not in the \nregular order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, thank you. To the Senator from Arizona, \nfor whom I have great respect, I would point out two things: The first \nis in his argument when stating the issue of the debt limit is a \nnonissue. Hence, I don't understand the objection to having language in \nthis motion that says there will not be a raising of the debt limit. \nThere should be a discussion of the debt limit in the context of the \nbroader issues this country is facing. As a result, I don't understand \nwhy we can't just put it in that we are not going to raise the debt \nlimit.\n  I would also further say that I do respect this institution \ntremendously, and I do believe in regular order to the extent that we \nare talking about procedure. The problem is that the regular order of \nWashington has given us a $17 trillion debt. In fact, that is one of \nthe reasons I ran for the Senate. I would submit to you, with all due \nrespect to all of my colleagues who serve here, I don't think we can \nrun up a $17 trillion debt without some bipartisan cooperation.\n  To some extent what I am concerned about is the regular order of \ndoing things in this city, where the debt limit has been raised \nconsistently without any conversation about the fact that this \ngovernment borrows 40 cents out of every dollar it spends. Never in the \nhistory of this country and of this Republic has a generation of \nleadership robbed a future generation like this generation of \nleadership has done.\n  That is my concern. My concern is that I do not have trust in \nWashington, DC. I do not have trust--I don't care who is in charge--\nthat we will not recklessly, once again, raise the debt limit of the \ngreatest country on Earth without any consideration for limiting the \nway we spend money in the future so that we do not bankrupt this \nextraordinary Nation, and the implications that could have on our \nchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will yield to the Senator from Tennessee in just 1 \nsecond.\n  The Senator from Florida is saying, if he has an issue he feels \nstrongly about, then that has to be included in any conference that is \nconvened over any bill that is passed by the Senate, the House, and \ngoes to conference. That is not a precedent I believe should be \nestablished in the Senate.\n  I think I share the concern of the Senator from Florida about the \ndebt and the deficit. I will match my record against anybody's as far \nas trying to eliminate the debt and the deficit, including that of the \nSenator from Florida.\n  We are about to establish a precedent that if any conferees are \nappointed on bills that are passed by the House and the Senate, that we \nare free then to put certain restrictions on those conferees. If the \nSenator from Florida believes that is the right way this body should \nfunction, then I would suggest to him that most people would disagree \nwith this kind of violation of the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am reluctant to break up this \nconversation among my fellow Republican Senators because they seem to \nbe at odds, but I do want to remind all of the Senators--and I think \nthe Senator from Arizona has alluded to this--we were slapped around \nunmercifully for not passing a Senate budget resolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And deservedly so.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I expected that. I would say to the Senator from Arizona \nthere were answers, and I thought good answers, but not good enough. We \npassed a budget resolution. The Senator was here. It passed by one \nvote. We stayed until early in the morning hours to get it done.\n  Senator Patty Murray did a masterful job in putting this together. Of \ncourse, our passing the resolution is only half of the story. The way \nthis is supposed to work is the so-called regular order, if it differs \nbetween the Senate and the House, is we come together in a conference \nto work out the differences. How long have we been trying--how many \nweeks have we been trying?\n\n  Mr. REID. Sixty-one days.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Sixty-one days we have been begging the Republicans--we \nhave been begging the Republicans, not all of them, to give us an \nopportunity to go to conference and work out our differences, if we \ncan.\n  That is the regular order. And each time we have asked, as Senator \nKaine of Virginia did this morning, there has been a condition to it: \nNo, you can't sit down to try to work out your differences unless you \nagree ahead of time to take certain things off the table. That is not \nreasonable. It is not reasonable if you are serious about the deficit, \nif you are serious about the debt of the United States.\n  I could dream up a half dozen things. All right, I won't allow us to \ngo to conference if it in any way is going to touch Social Security \nbenefits. All right? I think I would need a lot of support for that, \nand we wouldn't go to conference. But at the end of the day, if we are \nserious about the deficit, we are supposed to sit down and work out our \ndifferences, House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans. When Senator \nKaine makes this unanimous consent request to go to a conference \ncommittee, he is asking for the regular order of business around here.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask my friend from Illinois, isn't that what the \nregular order is, that makes it perfectly applicable, if we instruct \nthe conferees, which is what we are asking for in this unanimous \nconsent agreement?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. The Senate majority leader is on the floor, and he \nhas said if there is to be a motion to instruct conferees on the debt \nceiling, for example, then we can have a vote on the floor of the \nSenate. That is the regular order.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. But to condition the granting of the unanimous consent \nrequest to go to conference on the concern du jour of whichever Senator \ncomes to the floor is unproductive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I haven't yielded the floor as yet, and \nI think the Senator from Texas had a question for me.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Illinois, and I would ask him, if \nthe position he is championing is the regular order, then why is it the \nDemocrats are asking unanimous consent to set aside the regular order \nto go to conference?\n  The only reason unanimous consent is needed is because you are \nendeavoring to circumvent the regular order, and by doing so opening \nthe door for a procedural trick to raise the debt ceiling with 50 votes \nrather than 60.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I just checked with the majority leader to make sure my \nmemory is correct. The Senator from Texas will learn that when we go to \na conference committee, we are subjected to a possibility of a \nfilibuster. Does that ring a note of familiarity on your side of the \naisle? If we are going to face a filibuster and 60 votes, it is not \ngoing to happen.\n  What we are trying to do is to establish ahead of time we are going \nto a conference. So if we go through the so-called regular order to go \nto conference, we will reach the same impasse with the Republicans \nobjecting and the Republicans potentially raising the issue of a \nfilibuster. That is why we are trying for this unanimous consent, which \nI would think, from the Republican side, we would have bipartisan \nagreement that we move to a conference committee.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Would the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry, I am mistaken, and, thankfully, have been \ncorrected. It is not a filibuster. It would call for using the House \nresolution of 50 hours of debate and another vote-arama to go through \nthe regular order of things. It is not a filibuster. I stand corrected \non that.\n  But the net result of it is to drag out as long, if not longer, than \nthe earlier\n\n[[Page S3719]]\n\ndebate on the Senate budget resolution. That is why the unanimous \nconsent request has been made.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRUZ. So if I understand correctly, we are agreed now this is not \nthe regular order. The Senate is not following the regular order that \nwould have been taking up the House budget resolution and voting on \nthat. That is not what is being pursued here, which is why the majority \nis seeking unanimous consent to set aside the rules.\n  But let me ask the question, if I might----\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yielded for a question, and I will respond. Then you \nmay ask another, if you wish.\n  It is the regular order of things to ask for unanimous consent, and \nit is the usual and customary way the Senate works so that we don't \nhave to repeat all over again the debate on the budget resolution to \ntake up the House version. So it is not unusual. It is the regular \norder.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would suggest that unanimous consent is used to \ncircumvent the regular order----\n  Mr. DURBIN. No.\n  Mr. CRUZ. And in particular the debt ceiling was not contained in the \nbudget, it was not debated in the budget, it is not part of the budget, \nand the only question here--we could have gone to conference 60 days \nago if the Democrats had simply agreed not to use reconciliation as a \nbackdoor trick to raise the debt ceiling, which has happened three \ntimes in the past. So this is not a hypothetical risk. This is, I \nbelieve, the intention of the majority, and it is why we are objecting \nto raising the debt ceiling--to issuing an unlimited credit card--and \ndigging the hole deeper without actually fixing the problem.\n  Mr. DURBIN. To respond to the Senator from Texas, we have been \nthrough this before. In the House of Representatives they threatened \nnot to extend the debt ceiling of the United States and caused severe \ndamage to our economy. Business leaders, labor leaders, families across \nAmerica asked: How could the Congress do something so irresponsible as \nto not extend the debt ceiling of the United States? The President said \nhe is not going to get into a political bargain over the debt ceiling \nof the United States. He is right. This ought to be something both \nparties take very seriously, as to whether we would jeopardize the full \nfaith and credit of the United States of America, whether we----\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will in one moment, as soon as I finish replying to the \nSenator from Texas.\n  So the notion this debt ceiling is something we can casually say \nwhether it is approved and extended makes no difference--it makes a big \ndifference. And whether it is included in this, in terms of the budget \nresolution, remains to be seen. But we could have a motion to instruct \nthe conferees relative to the debt ceiling. I think that has already \nbeen discussed.\n  What I am saying is: Why in the world aren't we sitting at a table \nthis day, Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, trying to work \nout our differences? I think most American people would ask: Isn't that \nwhy we sent you to Washington? Yet we run into these objections to \nunanimous consent requests.\n  I yield to the Senator from Arizona for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it a little bizarre, this whole exercise we are \ngoing through, when some of us are asking to go to conference with a \nbody that is dominated by the Members of our own party? We don't have, \napparently, enough confidence the majority of the conference appointed \nby the other side of the Capitol will be a majority of Republicans and \nnot Democrats? Isn't that a little bizarre?\n  And really, what we are talking about here, I will be very honest \nwith my colleague from Illinois, is a minority within a minority. \nBecause the majority of my colleagues in the Senate on this side of the \naisle, with motions to instruct the conferees, want to move forward and \nappoint these conferees and do what every American family has to do in \nAmerica and that is to have a budget.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield the floor, because others wish to speak, but \nI will say that at this point in time we have passed a Senate budget \nresolution. We were challenged by the Republicans to do it, and we did \nit. It wasn't easy. It was a close vote, but we did it. Now we want to \nmove to the next logical step and sit down with the House, resolve our \ndifferences and move on so we can reduce the debt of this United States \nin a responsible and orderly way.\n  The objection on the other side of the aisle for 61 days should come \nto an end. I salute my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask my friend again, basically what we are saying \nhere on this side of the aisle is that we don't trust our colleagues on \nthe other side of the Capitol who are, in the majority, Republicans. I \nguess that is the lesson that can be learned here.\n  But far more importantly than that--far more importantly than that--\nin a recent poll I saw, 16 percent of the American people approve of \nCongress. When I go home and have townhall meetings and I say: You know \nwhat, my friends, we don't even have a budget. We can't even agree, \nRepublicans and Democrats--Republicans and Republicans in this case--to \nhave a budget, the same as every American family does. Does that \ncontribute to the approval and the respect the people of this country \nhave for us? The answer is obviously no.\n  So I urge my colleagues again, let's put some confidence in, if not \nthe conferees appointed here, the conferees who will be appointed on \nthe other side of the Capitol who are from our party, who are fiscal \nconservatives just as we are, instead of this blocking by what I assure \nmy colleagues--all three of them here--is a minority of the minority of \nRepublicans in the Senate who do not want to move forward with a budget \nthat we spent so many hours and so much effort in achieving. Do not \nblock it from going forward.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I salute the Senator from Arizona for \nhis intuitive, wise analysis of this situation. I am sorry we still \nhave an objection from the Republican side of the aisle to go to a \nconference committee with Republican House Members dominating that \nconference on their side. Apparently, they do not have confidence those \nHouse Members can speak for them, but I think it is important we do \nmove to this conference committee as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise to associate myself briefly with \nthe comments of both Senators McCain and Durbin. This is not primarily \nabout the budget. This is not primarily about Senate rules. This is \nabout compromise. In Congress, a bicameral body, the Framers \nestablished compromise was necessary to take action. Will we allow \nprocesses to go forward so we can listen to each other, dialog, and \nfind compromise, or will we use procedural mechanisms to block \nprocesses of dialog and compromise even from starting?\n  The Senate budget is a very different budget than the House budget. \nWe are all free to have our preferred option. But the way we get to a \nfinal budget is to have Senate and House conferees sit down together, \nin what no doubt will be a difficult discussion, and to compare budgets \nand debate and dialog and find compromise.\n  The Senate acted on the 23rd of March by a majority vote in accord \nwith the rules of this body to pass a Senate budget after 4 years. The \neffort to object to the beginning of a conference, make no mistake \nabout it, is fundamentally an effort to block processes of compromise. \nIn the living organism of government that was established by our \nFramers, compromise is the blood that keeps the organism alive. Efforts \nto block compromise are fundamentally efforts that are destructive of \nthis institution.\n  So I stand by the motion I have made. I ask my colleagues to allow \nprocesses of compromise to go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, the senior Senator from Arizona urged this \nbody to trust the Republicans. Let me be clear: I don't trust the \nRepublicans and I don't trust the Democrats. I think a whole lot of \nAmericans likewise don't trust Republicans and the Democrats because it \nis leadership in\n\n[[Page S3720]]\n\nboth parties that has gotten us in this mess.\n  My wife and I have two little girls at home. They are 5 and 2. When \nCaroline was born, our national debt was $10 trillion. Today it is \nnearly $17 trillion. In her short 5 years of life, the national debt \nhas grown by over 60 percent. What we are doing to our kids and \ngrandkids is immoral.\n  I commend the Democrats in this body for their candor. The Democrats \nand President Obama have been very explicit. It is their intention to \nraise the debt ceiling, and to do so with no conditions whatsoever--to \nkeep borrowing and borrowing and borrowing money without any structural \nreforms to fix the problems. That is an intellectually consistent \nposition. I think it is a dangerous position but it is at least candid. \nThat is the reason why every day, for 60 days, the Democrats have \nopposed taking the debt ceiling off the table in this discussion.\n  Unfortunately, one of the reasons we got into this mess is because a \nlot of Republicans were complicit in this spending spree. That is why \nso many Americans are disgusted with both sides of this body, because \nwe need leaders on both sides to do as my friend from Virginia said, to \nroll up our sleeves, to compromise and to work together and fix the \nproblem--fix the enormous fiscal and economic problems and stop \nbankrupting our country.\n  What this issue is all about is very simple: Will we allow the debt \nceiling to be raised in an unlimited amount with a 50-vote threshold? \nAnd if the answer to that is yes, we have, in effect, just voted to \nraise the debt ceiling because the Democrats hold a majority of this \nbody--55 seats--and the Democrats are explicit that they want to raise \nthe debt ceiling. If we go to conference without the debt ceiling being \ntaken off the plate, it is a 100-percent certainty the debt ceiling \nwill be raised. It has been done three times in recent history. Every \nRepublican who stands against holding the line here is saying: Let's \ngive the Democrats a blank check to borrow any money they want, with no \nreforms, no leadership to fix the problem. I don't think that is \nconsistent with any of our responsibilities.\n  A final point. Much has been said about the budget was debated, the \nbudget was considered, and that is surely true. But the budget contains \nnothing about the debt ceiling. The budget did not consider the debt \nceiling. When all of us were here all night debating the budget, we \ndidn't debate the debt ceiling. The question here is whether the \nmajority of the Senate will be able to bootstrap the debt ceiling--a \ntotally different issue--onto the budget. And the reason for doing it \nis to use a political trick. It would allow the majority to pass a debt \nceiling increase on just 50 votes.\n  I think it would be profoundly irresponsible for this body to raise \nthe debt ceiling without fixing the problem--without getting the \neconomy going, without getting jobs back, and without stopping the path \nwe are on of bankrupting this country. That is what this fight is \nabout.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I want to follow up on some of the comments \nmade by my friend and colleague, the junior Senator from Virginia. I \nagree wholeheartedly that we need to have this debate. We need a \nbudget. The American people want it, they deserve it, they have been \nwithout it for 4 years.\n  It is because we want this debate and it is because we want this \nissue debated in public that we have this concern. In other words, as \nthe Senator from Texas pointed out a moment ago, there are a lot of \nissues that were discussed and debated and voted on when we were \naddressing the budget resolution a couple of months ago. We were here \nuntil 5 in the morning making sure we could get through all the \namendments.\n  At no point during that very lengthy discussion in connection with \nthe budget resolution did we discuss or address or have a vote on or in \nany way make a decision regarding the debt ceiling. That is a separate \ndebate, one that did not come up in connection with the budget \nresolution. It is a debate that needs to happen. Just as the discussion \nof the budget resolution needs to move forward, we do need to have a \npublic debate and ultimately a vote with regard to the debt ceiling. \nThe American people expect us to have this debate. They expect us to \nhave it in the light of day and not under cover of darkness behind \nclosed doors, resulting in one of those infamous backroom deals that \nhave given Washington its often much-deserved bad name.\n  The debt ceiling was not in the bill. It was not in the budget \nresolution. We have not debated it. All we are asking for is that the \nother side agree that they will not use budget reconciliation as a \nmechanism for working a backroom deal to raise the debt limit. The \nAmerican people expect us to debate this, not in secret but in public. \nThat is what we are trying to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, since I raised the objection today, I \nwanted to close my comments by accurately describing to the people at \nhome or in the gallery or elsewhere what is happening here. Maybe some \nfolks are wondering what this is all about. It is pretty \nstraightforward. In fact, for over 1,000 days the Senate did not pass a \nbudget under the leadership of the current majority, and we did \ncomplain about that because that was problematic. Ultimately, this \nyear, they finally passed a budget--one which, quite frankly, doesn't \ndeal with our debt and doesn't help grow our economy, but they passed a \nbudget.\n  The House has passed its budget. The Senate has passed a budget. The \nway it works is that now both sides are supposed to sit down and \nnegotiate. What is happening is that a motion is being made to start \nthese negotiations. Nobody here is objecting to these negotiations. \nThat can begin today. This process they want can happen right this very \nmoment. The only thing we are asking is that it be clear that as part \nof that negotiation--an increase in the debt limit not be part of it. \nHere is why it is so important that it not be part of it: because we \nhave not discussed it. As the Senator from Texas pointed out, when we \ndebated the budget we did not debate the debt limit.\n  Let me tell you what the debt limit is. It is the credit line of the \nUnited States. It is how much money the government is allowed to \nborrow. This is not a trivial matter. I heard people stand here today, \nmy fellow Senators, and say: You can raise any objection to any issue \nyou want to stop the whole process. This is not a trivial objection. I \nam not asking that key lime pie be made the official pie of the United \nStates or some ridiculous thing. This is the debt limit, something that \nhas been called the single greatest national security problem facing \nthe United States of America by a national security official.\n  All we are saying is that you cannot come back from that conference \nwith an increase in the debt limit because if that happens, it will be \na 51-vote majority here to do it as a matter of routine.\n  Frankly, the problem is that the debt limit increases have become a \nmatter of routine, and that is how we get from $10 trillion to $16.5 \ntrillion in such a short period of time.\n  Ultimately, you are right. We should not treat the debt limit \ncasually. That means we should not just casually and cavalierly say we \nwill never raise it no matter what, no matter you do, but we also \nshould not just casually raise it as a matter of routine, and that is \nthe fundamental problem. The impact this is having on our economy is \nserious.\n  I deeply respect this institution. One of the reasons I ran for the \nSenate is I thought I could make a difference because in this Senate \neven a minority within the minority can make a difference.\n  Let me tell you, one day in the future I will not serve here anymore, \nand someday in the future my children, who today are very young, will \nhave to deal with the consequences of the decisions we make or fail to \nmake in my time in the Senate. If what they inherit is an economy \ncrippled by the horrifying decisions that have been made here now and \nin the past, I am going to have to answer for that. I am going to have \nto explain to them.\n  What did you do or what did you not do when you were in the Senate? \nHow could you have allowed this debt to go forward? What did you do to \ndo something about this debt issue?\n\n[[Page S3721]]\n\n  My answer to them cannot be, well, I followed the regular order. I \nplayed along to get along. I went ahead and acquiesced to what my \ncolleagues wanted.\n  That cannot be my answer. That will not be my answer.\n  The bottom line is that we can move to conference right now, we can \nbegin negotiating with the House this very day. All we are asking--all \nwe are asking is that as part of that negotiation, they cannot come \nback here with a debt limit as part of it. The debt limit is an \nimportant issue. It should be discussed on its own as it relates to the \nentire economy, not simply the 1-year budget of the United States of \nAmerica. That is the basis of our objection.\n  If the majority would reconsider their position and come to the floor \nand offer the same motion but with language that clearly says it cannot \ninclude reconciliation instructions to raise the debt limit, we will be \nin conference with the House this very day. But if they fail to do \nthat, we cannot move forward because what we cannot do is continue to \nroutinely raise the debt limit of this country without any serious \nconversation about how we are going to begin to put our fiscal House in \norder because the impact it is having on our economy is disastrous.\n  Our economy is not growing. There are people in America right now who \nare unemployed or underemployed because the debt is scaring people away \nfrom investing in our economy and in our future. If we do nothing about \nthat, then, my colleagues, we will be the first generation of Americans \nto leave the next generation worse off. That has never happened in our \nhistory.\n  I hope we can come together to prevent that from happening because I \nthink that if we do some simple but important things for our country, \nincluding bringing our debt under control, I believe that if we do \nthat, this new century, this 21st century, can also be an American \ncentury.\n  My hope is that at some point today or tomorrow or the next few days \nwe come to this floor and make a motion to go to conference with very \nsimple and straightforward language that says the conference report \ncannot include reconciliation instructions to raise the debt limit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I would like to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Tragedy in Oklahoma\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I want to talk about the tragedy this \nweek in Oklahoma. This is the 2-year anniversary of the Joplin tornado \nwe had 90 miles from my home, a district that I represented for a long \ntime before I came to the Senate and still get to represent now as part \nof our State. But I want to be sure we take time yet again today to let \npeople in Oklahoma know that our thoughts are with them, our prayers \nare with them.\n  First responders are continuing to search and rescue. Their recovery \nefforts are happening. Words clearly cannot describe the loss these \ncommunities and the community particularly of Moore, OK, have had in \nthe last few days. I know the Nation is praying for them. I am too--for \nthe people who lost children at the local elementary schools. The \nthought of sending somebody to school in the morning and them not \ncoming home that day is a tragedy that will affect people's lives \nforever. The friends who are lost, the family members who are lost will \nalways be part of the ongoing impact that they have on that family and \nthat community.\n  In Joplin, MO, 2 years ago we had 161 people die. The community has \ncome back in incredible ways, but you never want to minimize in any way \nthe loss of those 161 lives. Every one of them had a story to tell, \njust as every one of the people lost in Moore, OK, and in other places \nin Oklahoma in recent days has a story to tell.\n  It was a big storm. It affected people. Pretty quickly you figure out \nthat while you regret the property you lost, the property you lost is \nnot really all that important, but the lives that were lost are. In \naddition to the 161 people killed in Joplin, MO, on May 22, 2011, 7,000 \nhomes were gone. I was there the next day or the day after. They were \ngone. It was like a nuclear blast. The pictures from Moore, OK, remind \nme of that. Five hundred businesses were gone.\n  I will say for the people in Joplin, they immediately began to think \nabout Joplin tomorrow instead of Joplin yesterday. Two years later it \nis still a community dealing with loss, but it is a community that is \nbuilding new schools and new businesses, and houses are under \nconstruction. I talked to someone just yesterday. Their family member \nwas about to get into a house that Habitat helped them build.\n  One of the things I found out that I had never really thought about \neven though I had a lot of experience with storm loss--never anything \nlike 7,000 homes at one time--the people who are the least likely to \nhave insurance are the people who have their house paid for. In that \ngroup, they are the least likely, or the people who may have inherited \nthe house from their parents, because there is no banker to tell them \nthey have to have an insurance policy. Maybe it was just kind of a \nseamless moving back home or staying home and suddenly that house is \ngone.\n  By the way, this is something the Federal Government--really probably \nrightly--does not have a role in. If you do not have insurance, you \nmade that choice not to have insurance. When we talk about Federal aid, \nwe are almost always talking about cleaning up the streets, the water \nsystems, the power facilities, getting the community back in order. \nThere are some programs for public buildings that are available. It is \nnot that we are going to go in and help you rebuild your house if you \nchose not to have insurance. That is not what happens.\n  But volunteers immediately show up. The first volunteers are your \nneighbors. The first responders are your neighbors. It happened this \nweek in Oklahoma. It happened 2 years ago in Joplin. As soon as people \nhad brushed themselves off and found their own family members, they \nbegan to look up and down the street to see whom they could help, whom \nthey could help dig out of rubble or whom they could help secure \nsomething they were concerned about. Those are the first responders.\n  Then your neighbors from not too far away--in fact, Oklahoma is right \non the edge of our State. They are our neighbors. There were people \nfrom--public officials, fire and water and police from Joplin who were \nthere within 12 hours, and they will be back when they are needed.\n  There is a lot to be done. The one thing I would advise people who \nwant to know what they can personally do to help--there are places to \nsend money, there are charities to help. They are helping. All those \nthings are important and good. My personal advice if you want to help, \nif you can at all, find out before you go what it is you are going to \nbe doing. The last thing communities in this kind of situation need is \na lot of people wandering around, wondering what they can do to help. \nThere are plenty of people wandering around already. But if you come \nthrough your church, your civic club, through some organization you \nhave helped in the past, through Habitat for Humanity, through a group \nyou have worked with before that does this--link up with them and go. \nThat is probably the better thing to do.\n  There is a lot to be done. First responders, as I said, are your \nneighbors. By the way, they are also the last responders. The people \nstill there 2 years later helping build a Habitat for Humanity house \nare probably at that point your neighbors. They are probably not \nHabitat for Humanity from 1,000 miles away. They are local people who \nhave finally found another family who needs help, and they are helping \nthem.\n  This disaster, by all recent standards, deserves Federal assistance. \nFEMA is there, but beyond that, the Federal assistance that we give \nwhen a disaster is too big for a community to handle on its own and too \nbig for the community and the State they are in to handle on their own, \nthat is where the Federal Government should step in and does and will.\n  There are people all over the country who want to help, but they also \nare going to be helping as taxpayers. It appears that the resources to \ndo that are in the current pipeline. As I said, FEMA is there. We are \ngoing to be there, I am sure, working in this body with our colleagues, \nSenator Coburn\n\n[[Page S3722]]\n\nand Senator Inhofe, to do our best to reach out to our fellow Americans \nwho have a real tragedy, and that is a tragedy where all the American \npeople can step up and help by doing what we do when these disasters \nstrike.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \nwise words of my colleague from Missouri, whose State has experienced \nso much tragedy last year much like the devastation in Oklahoma. On \nbehalf of the State of Minnesota, our hearts and thoughts are with the \npeople of Oklahoma.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Blunt for cosponsoring an \namendment in the farm bill which will make it easier for seniors and \nthose with disabilities to receive groceries in their homes that is \ndelivered by volunteers. They pay for it with their SNAP dollars.\n  I am grateful to the whole Senate for adopting the farm bill package \nby unanimous consent. I am very grateful for that.\n  I am very pleased the Senate has taken up the farm bill, and I hope \nwe can pass this in the Senate and the House so our Nation's farmers \nhave the certainty they need to provide food for the rest of us.\n  There are so many important pieces to this bill which will be great \nfor Minnesota and Wisconsin. For example, it contains provisions to \nsupport beginning and young farmers to help them start farming \noperations. I think the average age of a farmer in Minnesota is about \n58. We need young and beginning farmers.\n  The farm bill also contains important conservation measures so \nfarmers can better protect their land. It also contains a comprehensive \nenergy title--that I helped to write--in order to make our agriculture \nsector and our Nation more energy independent.\n  Above all, the farm bill provides a safety net for farmers, and that \nsafety net is the centerpiece of this bill. The reason it is there is \nbecause agriculture is inherently risky. Just last year we witnessed a \nhistoric drought which devastated the Nation's corn and soybean crops \nand forced ranchers to cull their livestock. Agriculture is prone to \nweather disruption such as drought, flood, hail, pests, disease, and \nglobal market forces which can drastically disrupt prices, and that is \nwhy the farm bill safety net is so essential and important.\n  The farm bill safety net provides disaster assurance for livestock \nproducers, and it contains crop insurance so farmers have certainty \nover their planting decisions. It also contains a dairy program to make \nsure we have a healthy dairy economy in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Vermont, \nNew York, and other States.\n  That is why we have the Sugar Program, to help protect our sugar \ngrowers. The program is important to Minnesota's sugar growers and to \ngrowers across the Nation. In addition to protecting farmers, these \nprograms enhance the domestic supply of food that is so important to \nour Nation. Unfortunately, some of my colleagues don't support a strong \nfarm safety net, and they have decided to go after the Sugar Program in \nthe farm bill this year.\n  Let's be clear about one thing: By attacking the Sugar Program, or \nany other farm safety net, they are helping to send jobs overseas. \nIronically, this attack comes just a week after 60 Senators supported a \nprovision to make sure some of the funds used in water infrastructure \nprojects are used to purchase U.S. iron and U.S. steel. Some of the \nvery same Senators who are fighting for a domestic steel industry are \nnow turning their backs on our farmers by pulling the plug on our Sugar \nProgram. I also heard some argue that we should just let the free \nmarket work.\n  Madam President, did you know that the government of Mexico is \nMexico's biggest producer and exporter of sugar? That is not much of a \nfree market.\n  Brazil, the world's largest sugarcane producer, spends billions of \ndollars to subsidize its Sugar Program. Let's be clear: Removing the \nprotections we have for our domestic sugar producers will do nothing \nbut kill an American industry and outsource jobs to our competitors.\n  Some have depicted the amendment of Senator Shaheen and Toomey as \nnothing more than a rollback of U.S. policy to the pre-2008 policy.\n  Let's be clear: The reason Congress modified the U.S. sugar policy in \nthe 2008 farm bill was primarily because the provision in NAFTA, which \nallows subsidized Mexican sugar unfettered access to U.S. markets, \nkicked in in 2008. The reason the bill changed in 2008 is because the \nSugar Program changed. Let's be clear: Eliminating or weakening the \nSugar Program is going to kill rural jobs in America.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand for agriculture and American jobs. I \nask that my colleagues oppose the amendment of Senator Shaheen and \nSenator Toomey.\n  I see the Senator from Illinois is here and about to join us on the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The tragedy that hit Oklahoma earlier this week--killing \ninnocent people and children and destroying homes, businesses, and \nschools--just reminds us of how vulnerable we are to the forces of \nnature. It wasn't the first time the wind blew in Oklahoma. In fact, \nthat same community had been victimized by a tornado years ago.\n  If we go back in history to the 1920s, the State of Oklahoma faced \nwhat we have now characterized as the Dust Bowl. I didn't know much \nabout that, but I read about it. I kind of knew it destroyed lives, \nfarms, and many people had to pick up and leave. They moved to \nCalifornia and other places.\n  I ran across an excellent book written by a man named Tim Egan. Tim \nis from Seattle, WA. I don't know him personally, but Senator Murray \nand Senator Cantwell know him. He writes for the New York Times and \nalso writes excellent books. He wrote a book called ``The Worst Hard \nTime,'' which tells the story about the Dust Bowl.\n  What happened, as I understand it, was there was speculation on wheat \nduring World War I. There was a scarcity of wheat because of the war in \nEurope. People in the United States saw the prices of wheat going high, \nso they started planting. They planted on fragile ground. As a \nconsequence, they were churning up the ground to plant the wheat and \nwere not mindful of some serious possibilities that the topsoil would \nblow away.\n  One thing led to another and it became a natural disaster--the Dust \nBowl. As a consequence, many people left Oklahoma and many people saw \ntheir lives change forever. Tim Egan's book, ``The Worst Hard Time,'' \ntells about that in detail.\n  As a result of that experience in the 1920s, a couple of things \nhappened. First, we started taking conservation seriously; for example, \nhow to conserve the topsoil of our land so it doesn't blow away. \nUltimately, this gift from God is what gives us such fertile soil.\n  Secondly, because we know a farmer is at the mercy of nature, we \nstarted to think of ways--under President Franklin Roosevelt--to make \nsure the farmers could get through hard times, such as a bad year, a \nbad crop, or low prices.\n  Starting in the 1930s with the New Deal, we started dreaming up farm \nprograms, and there were many of them. I can recall when I was elected \nto Congress in 1982, I represented an agricultural district. At the \ntime I knew little or nothing about farming. I was trying to learn as \nfast as I could as to the options and history of these programs. I \nlearned some things, but I am certainly not an expert.\n  Over the years we have tried a lot of different ways of protecting \nfarmers from the vagaries of nature and the market. Not that long ago--\n10 or 15 years--we had a situation where we were seeing these natural \ndisasters--such as floods, droughts, and disease--that claimed crops. \nMany of the farmers affected by those came to Congress and asked for \nhelp. We were giving them disaster payments, we called them, to get \nthem through another year.\n  Well, the decision was made about 10 years ago that it would be \nbetter for us to deal with that unpredictability of nature and move \naway from disaster payments to a program which is known as the Crop \nInsurance Program. It speaks for itself. It is a program where a farmer \ncan buy insurance and with that insurance protect that farm from a bad \nproductive season or low prices in the market.\n  More and more farmers started looking for that protection, but they \nwere not that happy with crop insurance as\n\n[[Page S3723]]\n\nit was too expensive. So what we did was make a calculation that if we \nsubsidized the crop insurance premiums and if the Federal taxpayers \nkept them low, more farmers would buy it and we would pay less in \nnatural disaster payments since the insurance program would take care \nof that exposure.\n  That is basically what we decided 10 years ago, and since then there \nhas been a decrease in the cost of premiums and an increase in farmer \nparticipation and crop insurance, which is a good thing.\n  I might also say that during the same period of time we had some \nincome protection for farmers in what was known as direct support \npayments. Unfortunately, those payments were guaranteed even in good \ntimes, and they became indefensible. We had some farmers with record \nprofits on their farms and still getting a direct Federal support \npayment check.\n  We have the farm bill pending on the floor. Senator Stabenow of \nMichigan has done a remarkable job--again, for the second time--in \nwriting a farm bill. She wrote a farm bill last year, which we sent to \nthe House of Representatives after we passed it with a strong \nbipartisan vote, and they basically ignored it. They didn't want to \ncall it so it could be considered on the floor of the House, but they \ncould not come up with their own farm bill.\n  We are hoping for a better outcome this time. Once again, Senator \nStabenow sat down with the agriculture committee in the Senate and \nproduced this farm bill which is before us.\n  I am here today to describe an amendment which Senator Tom Coburn of \nOklahoma and I are offering. Senator Coburn, a very fiscally \nconservative Republican, and I have come to an agreement on an \namendment which we are offering to the Senate--a Republican and a \nDemocrat.\n  Here is what it comes down to: Our amendment would reduce the level \nof premium subsidy for crop insurance policies by 15 percentage points \nfor farmers with an adjusted gross income of over $750,000.\n  Let me explain what is behind this. Crop insurance is not a real \ninsurance program by private sector standards. In other words, the \npremiums being paid by the farmers do not create a reserve large enough \nto cover the amounts that are paid off or paid out for losses each \nyear, so the Federal Government makes up the difference.\n  Currently, on average, when it comes to crop insurance policies, the \nFederal taxpayers--not the farmers--pay 62 percent of the premiums and \nthe farmers pay 38 percent, so it is a heavily subsidized program. That \nis understandable because we want to keep the premium costs low so \nthere is more participation, but it is also the reality. So we are \ndealing with a program that is important to our farmers and important \nto our Nation with a heavy Federal subsidy.\n  Last year farmers put in $4 billion in the purchase of crop insurance \nacross America. The Federal taxpayers put in $7.1 billion in subsidies \nto the same Crop Insurance Program. So this is not a traditional \ninsurance program, it is one that is heavily subsidized and heavily \nleveraged by the Federal Treasury.\n  I might also add the taxpayers are on the line for the cost of \nadministering the program, which recently was $1.3 billion in a year, \nso $7.1 billion in premium subsidies and $1.3 billion in administrative \nexpenses. We are basically saying the taxpayers, by a margin of 2 to 1, \nare putting more money in the crop insurance program than the farmers \nwho are protected.\n  Going back to the Dust Bowl story, remember that one of the things we \ndecided to do was to protect fragile lands from wind and water and the \ntype of erosion that reduces their value. Over the years we had these \nconservation programs saying to farmers, if you have a wetland or a \nland that is particularly fragile or vulnerable, set it aside; don't \nplant on it. This bill Senator Stabenow brings to the floor makes this \nconservation practice a condition for buying crop insurance. I think \nthat is a good thing, and I totally support that. And, from the \nviewpoint of the Federal taxpayers, I don't think it is too much to ask \nthat the farmers participating in the crop insurance program also \nparticipate in conservation practices to protect farmland across this \ncountry. That is included.\n  Four percent of the most profitable farmers in America account for \nnearly 33 percent of all the premium support by the Federal Government. \nIn other words, there are a lot of small farmers with crop insurance \nwho don't have much exposure, don't pay much in premiums, but there are \na lot of large operations that are quite different.\n  This is a GAO study that was put out in March of 2012. They analyzed \nthe crop insurance program. Interesting reading. ``Savings would result \nfrom program changes and greater use of data mining.'' That was their \nconclusion, after investigating this program last year.\n  What they are talking about when they say ``data mining'' is taking a \nlook at the farmers who are buying crop insurance. Who are these \npeople? Well, they came up with some interesting examples, if I can \nfind them. In the year 2010, according to the GAO, the average value of \nthe premium subsidy received by participating farmers was $5,339. \nThirty-seven participating farmers each received more than $500,000 in \npremium subsidies--that is subsidies from taxpayers--37. The \nparticipating farmer receiving the most in premium subsidies, a total \nof $1.8 million in Federal subsidies for one farmer--was a farming \noperation organized as a corporation that insured cotton, tomatoes, and \nwheat across two counties in one State.\n  There is another one here. Another of the 37 participating farmers \nwas an individual who insured corn, forage, potatoes, soybeans, sugar \nbeets, and wheat across 23 counties in 6 States for a total of $1.6 \nmillion in taxpayer subsidies for his crop insurance. In addition, the \ncost of the administrative expense subsidies the government spent on \nbehalf of this farmer--one farmer--administrative expenses: $443,000. \nThis is a farmer farming in 23 counties across 6 States.\n  The point I am trying to get to is this: When we think of farmers and \nthe struggles they face, we shouldn't ignore the obvious. For the \nwealthiest 1 percent of the farmers in America, they are doing quite \nwell. I think--and Senator Coburn agrees--the Federal subsidy in crop \ninsurance to those farmers should be diminished some to save money for \nthe program and to reduce the deficit. That is what our amendment is \nall about.\n  What we are suggesting, as I said at the outset, is that instead of \n62 percent of the premium being paid by taxpayers for the richest \nfarmers in America, it be 47 percent of the premium. That is still \npretty generous, is it not, for someone who is getting $1.8 million in \nsubsidies already and $400,000 plus in administrative expenses? We are \nhelping that farmer in 23 counties over 6 States with over $2 million \nin Federal subsidies. I think he can afford to pay a little more. That \nis what this amendment says.\n  This farm bill is a good bill. It eliminates direct payments. I \nsalute Senator Stabenow for doing that. Eliminating direct payments \nmade regardless of need saves about $4.5 billion a year, $40.8 billion \nover 10 years. Hats off to Senator Stabenow. She is reducing the \ndeficit with this farm bill.\n  I think crop insurance is a much better safety net than direct \nsupport payments and much more defensible. But Senators who are \nconcerned about the growth of government and its costs ignore the fact \nthat this heavily subsidized crop insurance program cost the Federal \nGovernment more than $14 billion last year. While this growth is mostly \ndue to costs associated with drought, we have to find commonsense ways \nfor savings in the program. That is why we have suggested that farmers \nwith an adjusted gross income of over $750,000 pay 15 percent more when \nit comes to their premiums for crop insurance.\n  Let me add something which is not a very well-kept secret: Many of \nthese very large farming operations divide up their farms and their \nincome between husband and wife. So when we are saying $750,000 \nadjusted gross income, it is actually from a couple that is making over \n$1.5 million in adjusted gross income in many instances. Our amendment \nsays if the adjusted gross income; that is, after deducting business \nexpenses, health care costs, and other deductions, is at $750,000, \npremium support is reduced by 15 percentage points. The amendment is \nroughly estimated to impact the wealthiest 1 percent of farmers. Who is \ngoing to pay this? Who\n\n[[Page S3724]]\n\nis going to pay the extra premium? Twenty thousand farmers across \nAmerica will pay the extra premium. I just described a couple of them. \nTwenty thousand out of two million. Twenty thousand. Well, what is it \nworth to those 20,000 farmers to pay 15 percent more? It is worth $1 \nbillion over ten years; $1 billion coming into our Treasury.\n  When I think of the ways we are cutting spending to reduce our \ndeficit, which include taking 70,000 children out of Head Start as an \nexample, how can we possibly justify, for the wealthiest \nmultimillionaire farmers in America, not asking them to pay a little \nmore when it comes to their crop insurance premium? How can we excuse \nthem and say, No, no, no, these very rich farmers absolutely deserve \nthe maximum when it comes to the Federal taxpayer subsidy? I don't \nthink that is acceptable.\n  The amendment may sound familiar to some of my colleagues. It was \nadopted before by a vote of 66 to 33 in the Senate. Of the 33 who voted \nagainst the amendment, 29 voted for a nearly identical amendment that \nonly varied in the scope of the study. This is a study associated with \nour amendment.\n  Some may come to the floor and say that following last year's \ndrought, we shouldn't change crop insurance at all. Last year was the \nworst drought in over a decade. Eighty percent of agricultural \nproduction felt it and my State of Illinois certainly did. The USDA \ndeclared 2,245 counties in 39 States disaster areas. Crop insurance \nworked for those covered and has allowed those producers to plant again \nthis year without missing a beat. Our change in the law would not \nchange that circumstance at all.\n  I recognize the importance of crop insurance. It is far preferable to \ndisaster payments. But for goodness sake, if we can't say to 1 percent \nof farmers--the wealthiest in this country--that they are going to take \na slightly diminished Federal tax subsidy for their crop insurance, \nthen we aren't very good as budget cutters. We say to a lot of people \nwho have a lot less to work with in life, You are going to have to face \nup to the reality of the deficit. Can't we say it to 1 percent of the \nfarmers, that they are going to have to face up to the same basic \nreality? That is what this amendment is all about.\n  I asked my staff to come up with a couple of examples of farmers and \nthe premiums they pay for the Record. One example: An Illinois corn and \nsoybean grower received $740,000 in premium subsidies to cover the \ncrops he planted in 18 counties in Illinois. This is no small mom-and-\npop farmer; this is a big operator. And while I love my Illinois \nfarmers, I can't justify this kind of a subsidy of $740,000 to one \nfarmer in my State. While his exact additional costs are impossible to \ncalculate without knowing all the circumstances, even if he is caught \nby this amendment and purchased the same policy, instead of a $740,000 \ntaxpayer subsidy he would have a $639,000 Federal taxpayer subsidy.\n  Another example: A South Dakota corn and soybean farmer received $1.4 \nmillion in premium subsidies to cover crops in eight different \ncounties; $1.4 million Federal taxpayer subsidy for his crop insurance. \nThis producer would only receive $1.19 million in premium support under \nthis amendment. Would he stop participating in the program? Of course \nnot. If he is that large a producer he needs this program and the \nsubsidy is still very generous.\n  This is an issue which I know is a little complex, but when I listen \nto the speeches on the floor about the deficit--and we have heard \nplenty of them today and we will hear plenty of them tomorrow--I have \nto ask myself, Will Senators on both sides of the aisle stand with \nSenator Coburn and myself and say the wealthiest 1 percent of farmers \nin America should have their Federal subsidy for crop insurance reduced \nby 15 percent? Not unreasonable. They will still make a lot of money \nand the taxpayers will see $1 billion more coming into the Treasury.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, would the Senator allow me to \npropound a unanimous consent to be allowed to speak for 10 minutes as \nin morning business following the Senator from Connecticut?\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I have absolutely no objection.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                     Sexual Assault in the Military\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, in the past couple of weeks we have \nseen some major encouraging efforts in the Senate to rid our military \nof sexual assault, to punish it more aggressively and effectively, to \ndeter it, and to aid victims who may suffer from sexual assault--\nvictims of both sexes who may be survivors of this spreading scourge. \nLast year alone, an estimated 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact; \nonly about 3,300 of them reported. So the key to more effective \nprosecution and deterrence is more reporting as well as swifter, surer \npunishment and a better program within the military to deal with it.\n  I will be proposing over the next few weeks additional measures. I \nhave already cosponsored the Military Justice Improvement Act, a very \nimportant measure sponsored by our colleagues Senators Gillibrand and \nCollins that would transfer prosecuting and charging authority from \nmilitary commanders to a separate, trained, experienced cadre of \nprosecutors in the military.\n  I have also cosponsored the Combating Sexual Assault in the Military \nAct proposed by my colleagues Senator Murray and Senator Ayotte; again, \nvery important legislation providing special victims counseling to \nsurvivors or victims of sexual assault, and the Ruth Moore Act \nsponsored by my colleague Senator Tester, that provides aid for \ndisabled veterans who suffer from this problem.\n  Today I rise to praise Secretary of Defense Hagel for his decision \nand his leadership in avoiding furloughs of any of the civilian sexual \nassault prevention personnel as a result of the sequester. As we know, \nthe sequester has caused furloughs of many civilian employees at the \nDepartment of Defense as well as some similar personnel decisions \nacross the Federal Government. I wish to say that all of us who are \nadvocating this cause did express appreciation to our Secretary of \nDefense for his leadership as well as to the military leadership at all \nlevels for their focus on this issue. These measures are good, their \nintention is commendable, but it is not yet enough, as many of them \nwould acknowledge very candidly and have done so to all of us in the \nSenate who are interested in this issue.\n  We need to hire more civilians trained and qualified to help victims, \nnot just avoid the furloughs of the advocates and sexual assault \nresponse coordinators we have in place right now, but to hire more of \nthem.\n  I raise this issue because--and here is the statistic everyone should \nkeep in mind--the U.S. Army has hired only 80 out of the 446 whom it \nshould have in place right now among the sexual assault prevention \npersonnel--80 out of 446.\n  Let me give a little bit of the history. At the end of 2011, Congress \nset in Public Law 112-81 that new requirements should be expanded in \nthe provision of victims advocates and that they either be in uniform \nor civilian employees who have the proper training and qualifications \nto perform this important service. The Army announced in June of last \nyear--almost a year ago--that it would have 829 victims advocates. Of \nthose, 446 would be civilians. As a result, each brigade and \nequivalent-sized unit would be covered by a full-time victims advocate \nand below that level have the role of victims advocate performed as a \ncollateral duty.\n  So I was troubled to hear in April of this year, just a couple months \nago, when Secretary McHugh testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, that the Army's Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and \nPrevention Program--known as SHARP--had hired only 63 of that number; \nin other words, 63 out of 446. I understand the most updated number is \n80 out of 446.\n  These civilian sexual assault prevention personnel, very simply, are \nneeded\n\n[[Page S3725]]\n\ntoday. The military and our leadership know that this problem is a \nscourge that is a direct threat to the good order and discipline of our \nmilitary personnel. It has confronted this problem in many commendable \nways. But hiring victims advocates and sexual assault response \ncoordinators is vital to the effort. It is vital to encouraging both \nmen and women victims to come forward and have the courage and strength \nto report these incidents when they occur.\n  These incidents are more than just disciplinary infractions. They are \nvicious, predatory criminal acts. They should be punished as vicious, \npredatory criminal acts. Victims of them need advocates and counselors \nto have that strength and courage to come forward and participate in \nthe grueling and often painful process of supporting a successful \nprosecution. Without successful prosecutions, there can be no \npunishment, and successful prosecutions require witnesses and \ncooperation and support from the victim.\n  My hope is that the Army will swiftly stand up this force, that it \nwill do more than just avoid furloughs, that it will, in fact, recruit \nactively and successfully. Other branches of our military service \nshould also be asked: How are you doing in this process? And if you are \ndoing better, what are the keys to your success?\n  All across the military there must be a robust SHARP program, Sexual \nHarassment/Assault Response and Prevention Program. It is a mouthful. \nIt is a long term, but it stands for a program that must be \nsuccessfully and carefully built and sustained.\n  I will be introducing legislation tomorrow focusing on victims' \nrights and what can be done to bolster not only the substance of those \nrights but the remedies to make those rights real.\n  For today, I say thank you to the Secretary of Defense for the step \nhe has taken and hope we can count on additional steps to make these \nrights real, to guarantee successful prosecution, to make sure our \nmilitary rules and remedies against sexual assault and abuse are worthy \nof the greatest, strongest, best military in the world, staffed by men \nand women second to none in their training and dedication. The system \nof military justice must be worthy of their service and sacrifice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise to speak on S. 954, the \nlegislation to reauthorize agricultural programs.\n  As a former chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, \nI recognize how difficult it is to combine all the diverse interests \ninto a single piece of legislation that meets the needs of all crops, \nall regions, and all rural and urban communities the farm bill impacts.\n  I thank Chairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member Cochran for the work \nthey have done to craft a reform-minded bill that not only saves $24 \nbillion with sequestration cuts included but also provides an effective \nsafety net for farmers and ranchers all across the country to rely on \nin times of need.\n  This bill embodies reforms, streamlining, and consolidation, and with \nthe biggest issue facing our country today being our growing debt and \ndeficit, I commend the members of the Agriculture Committee for \nstepping up and doing the work necessary to find savings. While we take \nthese essential steps, we must also do it in an equitable and a fair \nmanner.\n  Agricultural producers face a combination of challenges such as \nunpredictable weather, variable input costs, and market volatility that \nall combine to determine profit or loss in any given year. The 2008 \nfarm bill provided a strong safety net for producers, and successor \nlegislation must adhere to and honor the same commitment we made 5 \nyears ago. It is also important to note that this bill must not only \nwork to protect producers in times of need, but it must responsibly \nserve as the Nation's safety net for the nutritional well-being of low-\nincome Americans.\n  Last year, when we went through this process, I was unable to support \nthe bill. However, I appreciate the chairwoman and ranking member for \nmaking improvements to last year's bill. While the bill before us is \nnot perfect, I believe everyone who is involved in agriculture \nunderstands that it addresses the needs of U.S. agriculture, which is \nwhat the policy coming out of this body should address.\n  While I understand there are different ideas about what safety net is \nbest, I urge my colleagues to recognize that one program does not work \nfor all crops. The bill before us attempts to provide producers with \noptions to find what works best for them, and that is a step in the \nright direction.\n  A new program known as Adverse Market Protection seeks to serve the \nneeds of those who are not protected by the Agriculture Risk Coverage--\nARC--and Crop Insurance Programs. It is imperative that the farm safety \nnet provide protection for multiyear declines, especially for southern \ncrops such as rice and peanuts, since the protection provided by ARC \nand crop insurance is not sufficient.\n  Also, I would like to recognize that the upland cotton policies \ncontained in the chairwoman's mark represent fundamental reform in the \nsupport provided to cotton farmers--reforms that contribute $2.8 \nbillion toward savings in the committee's budget target. The \nlegislation eliminates or changes all title I programs providing direct \nsupport to those involved in cotton production and puts us down the \npath to resolving our WTO dispute with Brazil.\n  Further, I would like to express my support for a provision in this \nbill that ties conservation compliance to crop insurance. My amendment \nlast year on the floor relinked the two, and since then 32 leading \nagricultural, conservation, and crop insurance groups have come to \nsupport this provision and have come together with ideas to form a \ncompromise on details of this linkage. The compromise will provide a \nstrong safety net for our farmers and natural resources, while allowing \nthem to be wise stewards of the taxpayer resources.\n  For those of us who enjoy hunting and fishing and the outdoors, this \nprovision will provide for future generations of Americans the same \nopportunity we have to hunt and fish today.\n  There is another provision that did not come up in the discussion in \nthe Agriculture Committee that I would like to briefly comment on, and \nthat is the dairy program. The dairy program is always an integral part \nof every farm bill, and I am not anywhere near an expert on the dairy \nprogram. In fact, I kind of leave that to States where it has a more \nsignificant impact. But in my State, when I came to Congress almost 20 \nyears ago, we had in excess of 700 dairies in Georgia. Today we have \nless than 300. In fact, it is closer to 250.\n  I do not know what the problem is, but I do think, as we move this \nbill off the floor and into conference--particularly with what has been \ngoing on in the House relative to dairy and the discussion over there--\nwe need to be mindful of the fact that we need to address this program \nlong term. If the way it is designed now is the best we can do, so be \nit. But I do think it is going to merit a significant discussion on \ndairy once we get to conference and have our ideas shared with the \nHouse and the House ideas shared with us.\n  This will be my fourth and final farm bill as a Member of Congress. \nAs a member of the Agriculture Committee and as a strong supporter of \nGeorgia agriculture for my nearly 20 years in Congress, I have \nwitnessed several disputes, especially regional disputes. However, I am \nconfident we can balance the needs and interests between commodities \nand regions to reach our common goal of getting a farm bill across the \nline.\n  Ultimately, the reason we are here is to represent those who work the \nland each and every day to provide the highest quality agricultural \nproducts and the safest agricultural products of any country in the \nworld. We have the opportunity to write a bill that is equal to their \ncommitment to provide the food, feed, and fiber that allow America to \nbe the greatest Nation on Earth.\n  Madam President, I thank you, and I look forward to the forthcoming \ndebate on the remaining amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I came here today first of all to \ntalk about the farm bill. I am a member of the Agriculture Committee. \nWe are very proud of this bill. It is a strong bill. As Senator \nChambliss just pointed\n\n[[Page S3726]]\n\nout, it enjoys broad bipartisan support. Of particular importance to \nthe State of Minnesota is the safety net that is in the bill; the focus \non ag research, which the Presiding Officer from the State of \nWisconsin, with her great universities, knows is very important; and \nthe work we have done with dairy in trying to improve the dairy \nprogram.\n  The dairy farmers have been the hardest hit in our State of any of \nthe agricultural groups. I have done some new things for new and \nbeginning farmers.\n  Then, of course, there is the Sugar Program--something that has been \na topic today, as some of our colleagues are trying to strip the Sugar \nProgram out of the bill. I would argue that this is 30,000 jobs in the \nRed River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota. American sugar is \nactually much less expensive than you see in the price on the global \nmarketplace. The Sugar Program works. It works for workers, it works \nfor America, and we need to continue it.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  I would like to turn to the focus of my remarks today, which is, \nfirst of all, on the budget. I thank Senator Murray for her leadership \non the Budget Committee and for all her hard work in advancing a smart, \nbalanced budget to meet our country's fiscal challenges.\n  This is not the first time I have come to the Senate floor in the \nlast year or in the last several years to stress the critical need for \nDemocrats and Republicans to come together and focus on smart solutions \nto reducing our debt. I think it is a good sign that both the House and \nthe Senate have passed budgets and that the President introduced his \nbudget last month.\n  I see this time as a real opportunity to come together to work \nthrough this budget process and get a deal done. That is why we must \ntake the next step in the process, which is to move forward under \nregular order and have the House and Senate conference on a budget \ndeal.\n  For years we have been hearing from our colleagues across the aisle \nabout how the Senate did not have a budget. Well, the Senate passed a \nbudget, and all we want to do is to move this into conference committee \nso that the House and the Senate can work together so that we can get a \nbudget for this country.\n  There is growing bipartisan support for going to conference and \nstarting the conversation so that we can come to an agreement on a \nlong-term budget. Last night Senators McCain and Collins came to the \nfloor and talked about how we need to return to regular order in the \nSenate, and regular order means going to conference to come to a budget \ndeal.\n  Doing so will allow us to stop lurching from crisis to crisis and \naddress our fiscal challenges in an open, bipartisan way. I believe \nthis is what folks outside of Washington, especially the people I talk \nto in Minnesota, want; for us to put politics aside for the good of the \ncountry and come together on a budget deal that reduces our deficit in \na balanced way but also lays a foundation for sustained economic \ngrowth.\n  In the past 2 years Congress has made some progress in reducing the \ndeficit. We have already achieved $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction, \nwith a goal of a $4 trillion reduction in 10 years within our grasp. \nLast week the Congressional Budget Office reported that deficit will \nfall to $642 billion this year, $200 billion less than what the CBO \nprojected just 3 months ago. The better numbers reflect good news in \nhousing and larger than expected increases in tax revenue.\n  But I believe that resting on those numbers would be a mistake. If we \nare to get closer to reaching a new deficit agreement, it is only going \nto happen if we work in a bipartisan way through regular order to get a \ndeal done. Along with addressing our fiscal challenges, working through \nthe budget process and coming to agreement will create a stronger, more \nresilient framework for economic renewal.\n  We certainly see how we got a major bill done through the Judiciary \nCommittee last night when we were able to get the immigration bill \ndone. There is no reason a conference committee should not be at work \nright now taking the Senate budget that we have heard for years needs \nto be done and paring it up with the House budget and coming together. \nIn the bigger picture, this presents an opportunity for us to reinforce \nour role as a world leader in innovation, entrepreneurship, exporting, \neducation; in other words, that which we have always taken pride in. We \nwant to be a nation that produces, that invents, that exports to the \nworld. Part of that is showing the world we have our fiscal house in \norder.\n  I believe the Senate proposal is the right blueprint for moving us \nforward. On the most immediate front, it will allow us to build on the \nprogress we are already seeing in the economy. Last month, the national \nunemployment rate dropped to 7.5 percent, the lowest level in 4 years. \nOur housing market is turning around. Consumer spending has picked up \nin the first months of the year as has private business investment. The \nunemployment rate in my State of Minnesota is at 5.4 percent.\n  But even with this progress, our economy remains vulnerable to \nheadwinds. We should keep this good economic momentum going but only if \nwe are willing to find common ground on a budget plan that also moves \nour economy forward.\n  We need to take a balanced approach to deficit reduction. You do not \nhave to take my word for it. Nearly every commission that has offered \nideas for reducing our debt has stressed the importance of balance. \nThis includes the original Bowles-Simpson plan, the Rivlin-Domenici \nplan, and even the revised Bowles-Simpson plan, which calls for another \n$2.4 trillion in deficit reduction, one-quarter of which would come \nfrom new revenue totaling $600 billion.\n  We do not just need a balanced budget; we need a budget that is in \nbalance. I believe the Senate's budget achieves that goal. It includes \nan equal mix of responsible spending cuts and new revenue from closing \nloopholes and ending wasteful spending in the Tax Code. Our budget \nbuilds on the $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction we have already \nachieved in the last 2 years, with an additional $975 billion in \ntargeted cuts and $975 billion in new revenue, surpassing the \nbipartisan goal of $4 trillion.\n  Just this morning I was at the Joint Economic Committee--I am the \nSenate chair of that committee--where Chairman Bernanke testified. He \nwarned us about the negative impact--that cuts solely focused in the \nshort term can negatively impact economic growth. He noted that \npolicies such as sequestration are creating headwinds against short-\nterm economic growth and that Congress needs to take a broader, long-\nterm view toward our debt and deficit.\n  That is what this conference committee is about. That is what regular \norder is about. We have a Senate budget. We have a House budget. We \nhave that opportunity to bring those budgets together in a conference \ncommittee. Some of the most important points in the Senate budget \ninclude the fact that it replaces the sequester with smart targeted \ncuts while also making critical investment in areas such as education, \nworkforce training, and infrastructure.\n  It produces savings in Medicare and Medicaid by eliminating waste and \nfraud, promoting efficiency, and emphasizing cost alignment. Our budget \nalso recognizes there is a massive amount of spending that takes place \nthrough the Tax Code, to the tune of over $1 trillion per year in tax \nexpenditures. The Senate budget eliminates wasteful tax loopholes and \nsubsidies.\n  All told, the Senate budget cuts the deficit by approximately $2 \ntrillion. This continues us on a downward path where our debt-to-GDP \nratio will be about 70 percent by 2023. Getting the Federal budget on a \nsustainable path will only promote growth and stability. The American \npeople want us to get this done. They want us to compromise. They want \nus to work together to get the economy on the right track.\n  I urge my colleagues to support moving to conference so we can begin \nthe work of finding solutions to a very important matter.\n\n\n                               Gas Prices\n\n  I wish to speak briefly on one other topic that is an important \neconomic issue for families and businesses in Minnesota; that is, the \nrecent spike in gas prices. We do have some good things in the farm \nbill that will help us, including the promotion of energy and biofuels, \nbut I came to discuss the recent spike in gas prices in Minnesota,\n\n[[Page S3727]]\n\na problem that is disrupting commerce and hurting consumers, small \nbusinesses, and farmers across the State and throughout our region.\n  In Minnesota, the average gas price is $4.25, 40 cents higher than 1 \nweek ago and over 80 cents more than only 1 month ago. In fact, a few \ndays ago it was the highest in the country, higher than Honolulu. It \nhappened all of a sudden, in literally a 2-week period. That is a \nsignificant increase which puts family budgets under severe pressure.\n  I am focused on immediate relief. I am taking actions now so we can \navoid similar gas price spikes in the future. With Memorial Day around \nthe corner and the start of the summer driving season upon us, this \nkind of price spike is simply outrageous. To cut back on costs, some \nfamilies are already putting off family trips and scaling back \nvacations. I have already heard from families who have canceled or \nscaled back their plans.\n\n  But there are some things people cannot put off, such as driving to \nwork, such as going to the doctor's office. More money to fill the tank \nmeans less money for food, housing, and everything else families need. \nFamilies in Minnesota cannot afford an 80-cent spike in the price of a \ngallon of gas, neither can business owners who need to ship their goods \nto market or farmers who rely on diesel fuel to keep their equipment \nrunning.\n  We know what is causing the price increase--supply shortages \nresulting from the simultaneous closing of several oil refineries in \nthe Midwest. We also know what is not causing the price increase. The \nprice of crude oil has not moved. We are about $96 a barrel, similar to \nwhere prices were 1 month ago. In fact, the national trend in gas \nprices, which tracks the price of crude, has not moved much either. \nOPEC has not been jacking up their prices. We did not have a hurricane \nor even a blizzard that would affect supplies or prices. The increase \nhas not been caused by a pipeline rupture or geopolitical threats.\n  Rather, the price spike has resulted largely from the combination of \na number of refineries going offline for scheduled and unscheduled \nmaintenance which serve the upper Midwest to prepare for the summer \nfuel blend. I understand that refineries need to adjust their blends \nand occasionally perform upgrades to protect worker safety and repair \nequipment.\n  But scheduled routine maintenance should not be an excuse for major \ngasoline shortages and price spikes. Three refineries in Indiana, \nIllinois, and Flint Hills, MN, currently are shut down for maintenance \nor upgrade. A fourth refinery in Wisconsin is currently offline as they \nturn their productions over to summer fuel blend. A fifth refinery in \nSt. Paul Park, MN, remained down longer than expected, but I understand \nthat refinery is again operational.\n  The result of all these closures is Minnesota and other parts of the \nUpper Midwest simply did not have enough refined gasoline to make it to \nthe market right now. In this day when we have a surplus of fuel, when \nwe are drilling record amounts in North Dakota, when we do not see a \nhuge increase in the price of oil, this just should not be happening. \nThat is why last Thursday I called on the Department of Energy to \nthoroughly review the timing of scheduled maintenance operations and to \ntake action to address future supply problems that are preventable. I \nhave also spoken with the Department of Energy about ways to resolve \nthe issue quickly and prevent disruptions down the road. I am working \nwith DOE and industry partners on legislation that addresses known \nscheduled closures of refineries for maintenance.\n  Having improved information could serve as an early warning system to \nprotect consumers from production problems within the refinery \nindustry. With more transparency and more lead time, fuel retailers \nwill have the opportunity to purchase fuel at prices that better \nreflect the underlying cost of crude oil and better reflect supply and \ndemand across the country.\n  I also believe refineries should give immediate notification of any \nunplanned outages. I am working to address this as well. I am also \nworking with the Secretary of Energy to look at the potential for \nadditional refined fuel storage capacity in our region. Minnesota has \nless storage capacity for refined products than other parts of the \ncountry, making us more vulnerable to the kinds of refinery outages we \nhave experienced this year, both planned and unplanned.\n  If we had additional storage in place, we could better ensure fair \nand consistent prices for our consumers. This week I talked to all of \nthe major oil companies that own these refineries. It looks as though \nadditional shipments from another pipeline are helping to increase \nsupplies. This should provide some relief.\n  Petroleum markets in Minnesota have reported the spot prices in the \nwholesale markets were down by 30 cents, but that drop has not yet \nreached our consumers. I believe we need an all-of-the-above plan to \nget serious about building a new energy agenda for America. This, of \ncourse, means less dependence on foreign oil, more domestic production \nof oil as we are seeing in North Dakota, natural gas, and, of course, \nbiofuels. It also means tougher vehicle efficiency standards that help \ncars to go farther on a tank of gas.\n  But my focus is on our immediate problem. We need to get refineries \nup and running and get gas prices down so we can all we begin to enjoy \nthis summer. I look forward to continuing to work with the Department \nof Energy and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address the \nrecent and unnecessary spike in gas prices and prevent this from \nhappening again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich).

Mr. President, for the information of Members, we are \nworking to set up a vote later this afternoon on this particular \namendment. I am working with Senator Cochran and his Republican \ncolleagues in order to set up that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss a very \nimportant topic and one that itself is coming to the Senate floor soon. \nThat is the problem of illegal immigration and proposals for so-called \ncomprehensive immigration reform. Specifically, of course, the Gang of \n8 bill, as it has been dubbed, is being reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee. We will be debating that bill, and hopefully a lot of \nimportant amendments to it soon, in June, on the floor.\n  Let me say at the outset, I think there are at least a couple of \nthings we can all agree on. No. 1, I think we can all agree that the \nUnited States is an immigrant nation with a proud history of \nimmigration--legal immigration. It is absolutely one of the core \nfeatures of our Nation that makes us unique and that makes us strong. \nSo I wish to say that upfront, very proudly, very strongly. I support \nthat tradition, that history of being an immigrant nation. All of us \nare the children of immigrants--not a question of if, it is just a \nquestion of when, because that is the nature of America. That goes to \nthe core of our strength.\n  No. 2, the other thing I think we can all agree with is our present \nimmigration system is broken. In fact, it is badly broken, and we need \nto fix the system.\n  As I said a minute ago, we have a proud history of immigration, legal \nimmigration. That is the tradition, the history we need to get back to. \nUnfortunately, right now we have a system of wide open illegal \nimmigration, almost open borders in some cases and some areas, and that \ndesperately needs to be fixed.\n  Having said that, I have real and fundamental concerns with the so-\ncalled Gang of 8 bill, and they fall into five or six big categories. I \nwant to talk about each of those important categories in turn.\n  First and foremost, my biggest and my most fundamental concern, I \nthink the so-called Gang of 8 bill repeats mistakes of the past \nbecause, at its core, it is amnesty now, enforcement later, and maybe \nnever. We have tried that model before. We have tried it several times \nbefore, and it has never worked.\n  The most clear example is the 1986 immigration overhaul. That bill, \nat its core, was the same model, amnesty now and enforcement later, and \nmaybe never. In fact, much of that enforcement was never. That is why \nit didn't work. The amnesty kicked in immediately, the millisecond the \nbill was signed into law. That was a powerful message to invite more \nand more illegal crossings across the border, more and more illegal \nimmigrants into the country. That part of the bill, that part of the \nmessage, was heard loudly and clearly. The promises of enforcement \nnever fully materialized. Many of them never materialized at all.\n  What happened when you had that combination of immediate amnesty with \npromises of enforcement that never materialized? Again, you attracted \nmore illegal crossings, and you had no capability or will to do \nanything about them.\n  The promise then was we are going to have to do this once; the system \nwill be fixed; we will never have to look back. We will never have to \nlook in the rearview mirror. The problem will be solved.\n  What happened? Well, we all know the problem wasn't solved. In fact, \nthe problem simply wasn't continued, the problem was quadrupled. What \nwere 3 million illegal immigrants then were mostly made legal. But that \nnumber 3 million quadrupled, and now today we have 11, 12 million \nillegal immigrants, some think more.\n  That, at its core, is the Gang of 8 bill, and immediate amnesty, \npromises of enforcement. That is not good enough, particularly when we \nhave decades--decades--the Federal Government, Republicans and \nDemocrats, who have promised us before and have never ever delivered. \nThe American people say we will trust but we want to verify. Trust but \nverify. We need to see this enforcement in action before we move on to \nanything else.\n  In fact, in some ways this Gang of 8 bill is worse in terms of that \nbasic\n\n[[Page S3729]]\n\nmodel than previous versions such as 1986. If you look at page 70 of \nthe bill, it actually has a period of an enforcement holiday, so 2\\1/2\\ \nyears of a pure enforcement holiday. Not only is this amnesty now and \nenforcement later, it may never apply to folks who are in the country \nillegally now. They can keep coming. The message will be sent out, and \nthey can come the day after the bill passes, the week after the bill \npasses, the year after the bill passes, 2 years after the bill passes, \nand it is part of the same amnesty. They would get the benefits of that \namnesty as well. That enforcement holiday, 2\\1/2\\ years, makes that \ncombination of a big amnesty now, with promises of an enforcement \nlater, even more potentially disastrous.\n  The second big problem I have with the bill as it is currently put \ntogether is it doesn't enforce the law, and it doesn't enforce the \nborder, particularly the troublesome southern border with Mexico. It \ndoesn't enforce other enforcement provisions. It doesn't actually \nguarantee that those are put into place and executed in an effective \nway.\n  The proponents of the bill talk about so-called triggers in the bill \nbefore the amnesty, before the new legal status is granted. When you \nlook hard at what the triggers are, they are triggers on a toy plastic \ngun, not real triggers in any meaningful sense of the term. The \ntriggers basically narrow down to two things. First of all, the \nSecretary has to submit two reports, two plans. The Secretary of \nHomeland Security has to submit plans or reports, a so-called \ncomprehensive ``southern border security strategy,'' so she has to \nsubmit a strategy. Great. This was promised for three decades but now \nshe has to submit a strategy, a piece of paper and a southern border \nfencing strategy, so that is one trigger.\n  The other triggers are certification that the border strategy is \n``substantially deployed'' and ``substantially operational.''\n  What is the problem with that? Two things. Who the heck knows what \n``substantially deployed'' means and, No. 2, even more troublesome, do \nyou know who has to certify that? The Secretary of Homeland Security, \nwho has not been effective at enforcement to date in any way, shape, or \nform. Those so-called triggers are absolutely meaningless.\n  The bill doesn't require a fence, as is actually required under \npresent law, so we are weakening that. We are walking away from that. \nIt weakens current law regarding border security. Operational control \nis the standard now, and that is being weakened, changed to effective \ncontrol. It doesn't require a biometric data system for entry and exit \nscreening. That has been pushed by Congress since 1996. Congress \nstarted mandating this in 1996, and it was one of the prime \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission, full deployment of the US-VISIT \nsystem. The 9/11 Commission said that needs to be a high priority. That \nis exactly how the 9/11 terrorists got into our country and overstayed \ntheir visas. It doesn't do any of that. Again, there is an enforcement \nholiday for 2\\1/2\\ years and no border security now before the amnesty \nkicks in.\n  No. 3, I am very concerned that we will continue the present status \nquo, which is significant benefits being available to these immigrants, \nwhich act as a magnet to incent other illegal immigrants to come into \nthe country. The so-called Gang of 8 made all sorts of promises about \ncertain promises not kicking in until full citizenship is granted down \nthe road. Many benefits would kick in immediately, certainly \nparticipation in the Social Security system, certainly all those Social \nSecurity benefits, and their loopholes about these benefits. I think \nmany illegal immigrants will clearly gain access to public benefits far \nsooner than any 13 years as advertised. That is another serious \nweakness of the bill.\n  Fourth, I am very concerned about the cost of this bill. Authors of \nthis bill have been very clever. They saw that cost issue coming, and \nthey devised the bill so the big costs of the bill are outside the 10-\nyear budget window. Why is that important? Well, not to get into the \nweeds, but it is very important because CBO scores legislation \nprimarily on its impact on taxes and spending in the first 10 years. \nThe authors of the bill were very careful, very clever in devising a \nbill that would look OK in the first 10 years with regard to cost. \nAfter that first 10-year window, the costs explode and none of that \nwill be reflected by this CBO score.\n\n  We have seen this movie before, because this is exactly the same \napproach to CBO scoring and costs of legislation, exactly the same \napproach the proponents of ObamaCare put forward. They were very clever \nto push many of the costs in the outyears beyond the first initial \nscoring window, and that is why they were able to wave CBO scores \naround to somehow suggest this would help lessen the deficit. It is \nperfectly clear now, ObamaCare is not going to make our fiscal \nsituation better, it is going to make it far worse and far more \nonerous.\n  I believe exactly the same thing is true with this bill in terms of \nthe costs, and I believe the proponents of the bill, quite frankly, \nhave gamed the system in the same way to hide those costs, given the \nway CBO scores legislation.\n  In contrast to that, there is an objective study of the full costs of \nthe bill, and that is a study by Robert Rector of the Heritage \nFoundation. He went into extreme detail tracking the full costs and \nfiscal benefits of the bill. His conclusion was that the full costs of \nthe bill are $6.3 trillion over the full life and the full impact of \nthe bill, $6.3 trillion, with a T. He concluded that the bill, because \nof all the folks it would legalize, would kick in $9.4 trillion in \nbenefits. There are more government benefits we are going to have to \npay out, $9.4 trillion.\n  These folks being legalized would pay some taxes into the system, \nwhich they do not pay now, and that would be $3.1 trillion. When you \nsubtract 3.1 from 9.4, that obviously doesn't net out to zero. That is \na net increase in the deficit, increased cost to the government, to \nsociety, to the taxpayer, of $6.3 trillion net. That is a serious \nimpact on these budget and fiscal issues we are already very concerned \nabout.\n  The Robert Rector study is very credible, it is very detailed. I have \nseen no comparable study in terms of the detail of the analysis. I \nwould challenge anyone who cares about this issue, wherever they are \ncoming from, to put up any other study that can compete with the Rector \nstudy in terms of detail and analysis. I think currently that is the \nlast and final word on costs of the bill.\n  Two final points. A fifth big concern I have about the bill is I \nbelieve this bill is very unfair to legal immigrants and folks who are \nwaiting in line in the legal immigration system now. It puts some \npeople--not everybody who would be made legal, but some people--ahead \nof them in line and dishonors the fact that these would-be legal \nimmigrants are following the rules now and following the law now.\n  Sixth and finally--and this is no trivial matter--I am very concerned \nthat this would depress wages in the United States for many hard-\nworking Americans, legal immigrants, others who have followed the law \nwho are working hard in a very tough economy now. I think it would \ndepress the general wage situation and make that more difficult for \nthem to deal with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. VITTER. In closing, I urge all my colleagues to look carefully at \nthese and other concerns and try to address them fully, directly, \ncompletely, on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, as we continue debate on the \nAgricultural Reform, Food and Jobs Act, I want to remind my colleagues \nhow important this bill is for our economy and for the 16 million \npeople whose jobs rely on agriculture. When we go home at night and sit \ndown at the dinner table, it is because those 16 million people have \nworked hard to make sure we had safe, affordable food on the table. \nThey are the men and women who farmed the land. They are also the \npeople who manufacture and sell the farm equipment, the people who ship \nthe crops from one place to another, the people who own the farmers \nmarkets and the local food hubs, the people who work in processing and \ncrop fertility, not to mention the researchers and the scientists who \nwork hard every day to fight pests and diseases that threaten our food \nsupply.\n\n[[Page S3730]]\n\n  I want to talk specifically for a few moments about the work we are \ndoing in the conservation title of the farm bill. Our farm bill \nimproves 1.9 million acres for fish and wildlife habitat. This is about \njobs as well. Healthy wildlife habitats, clean fishable waters, are not \nonly good for our environment, but they also support hunting, fishing, \nand all of our other outdoor recreation that benefits our economy and \ncreates jobs. In fact, outdoor recreation supports over 6 million jobs \nin our United States.\n\n  In this farm bill we are including a new historic agreement around \nconservation--the most powerful conservation work in decades. It is \ntruly amazing what can happen when people actually sit down and listen \nto one another and work together. If farmers want to participate in \ntitle I commodity programs, including the current Direct Payments \nProgram, they must take steps to use best conservation practices on \ntheir land when it comes to highly eroded soil and wetlands. This has \nbeen the case for many years.\n  Of course, the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act we are debating \nnow eliminates those subsidies.\n  Instead, we are strengthening crop insurance, which farmers need to \npurchase, and we are making market-oriented reforms to the commodity \nprograms. But here is the issue: If we eliminate direct payment \nsubsidies, we don't want to create unintended consequences by not \nhaving that link any longer. It is important for all of us that \nsensitive lands be managed in the best possible way. That is how we \navoided having a dust bowl during the droughts. It is important for us \nto continue protecting wetlands, which help prevent flooding and are \nimportant to wildlife habitats for ducks and other waterfowl.\n  Commodity groups and conservation groups were on different sides of \nthis issue for a long time. They looked at the issue from vastly \ndifferent viewpoints, and they didn't agree on the best approach. They \ncould have followed the very typical Washington playbook. They could \nhave gone to their corners, fired off e-mails and press releases, \nbrought the lobbyists in and demonized each other. But that is not what \nhappened.\n  Like farmers and families across the country, they sat down together \naround a table and did something we don't do enough. They listened to \neach other. They listened and tried to see the other's viewpoint and \nthey came to understand one another. It turned out their differences \nweren't so great after all. With a little compromise and a lot of hard \nwork these groups were able to come together with a plan that conserves \nsoil and water resources for generations to come and protects the \nsafety net on which our farmers rely.\n  This has been called the greatest advancement in conservation in \nthree decades. I want to underscore for my colleagues that this is an \nimportant historic agreement, and others deserve credit. As much as I \ncertainly would like to take credit for this, or I am sure Senator \nCochran would--and we certainly were very supportive in encouraging \nthis--the agreement came about from a group of people working together.\n  I know a number of my colleagues are planning to talk about \namendments on crop insurance. Some have already been on the floor \ntalking about amendments. I know a number of colleagues voted for some \nof those amendments the last time around, but this conservation \nagreement puts us in a very different situation this year. For one \nthing, we want to make sure the biggest landowners who control the most \nacres are using crop insurance.\n  Crop insurance is voluntary. Prior to crop insurance, there were \nsubsidies and then ad hoc disaster assistance. Now we are encouraging \nthem to purchase crop insurance, and we want them to have it, which \nmeans now they would need to use conservation practices to preserve \nsensitive lands and wetlands on those largest tracts as well as small \ntracts.\n  So amendments that weaken crop insurance would reduce the number of \nfarmers participating in crop insurance, raising premiums for family \nfarmers and reducing the environmental impact and the environmental \nbenefits of this historic conservation agreement. With this new \nagreement, the math is very simple: The more acres that are in crop \ninsurance, the more we have environmental and conservation benefits.\n  My dear friend from Illinois came to the floor a while ago and said: \nThe majority of crop insurance is with a small number of farmers. Well, \nthat is true. The larger the farm, the more one would use crop \ninsurance. It is just like saying anybody who buys insurance for a \nbigger home has more insurance than the smaller home. Bigger \nbusinesses--manufacturers--probably buy the biggest part of insurance \nrather than small businesses. I am not sure what the point is of saying \nthat. Of course, we have large farmers buying more crop insurance than \nsmall farmers. We want to make sure we have the environmental and \nconservation benefits on those large farms just as on smaller farms.\n  Here is another reason my colleagues should reevaluate these \namendments, and I would encourage, as they come before us, that we vote \nno. This chart shows the counties that were declared disaster areas \nlast year. An awful lot of red. And 2012 was one of the worst droughts \non record ever in the United States.\n  In the past, in situations such as this we would have passed ad hoc \ndisaster assistance for the corn growers, the wheat growers, the \nsoybean growers, and the other crop farmers. But we didn't have to do \nthat because crop insurance works.\n  Crop insurance is not a subsidy. When people have crop insurance they \nget a bill to pay. We share in that cost to make sure there is a \ndiscount so they can afford the bill, but they get a bill. They do not \nget a check. The only farmers last year who needed disaster assistance \nwere the ones who can't participate in crop insurance, which we fix in \nthis farm bill.\n  We address permanent livestock disaster assistance. They do not have \naccess to the same crop insurance. We address farmers, such as my \ncherry growers, who were wiped out when it got warm in the spring and \nthen froze again and completely wiped out the cherries. They do not \nhave crop insurance now. They need some extra help. In this farm bill \nwe are giving them access to crop insurance, which is the primary risk \nmanagement tool for farmers.\n  Producers purchase crop insurance so they are protected when there is \na disaster, but if we weaken crop insurance, resulting in premium hikes \nof as much as 40 percent on small farmers, we are going to be going \nback to the days of ad hoc disaster assistance, something we cannot \nafford in today's tight budget climate.\n  Finally, we need to keep this historic agreement in place through the \nconference committee. We owe that to the folks who sat down and worked \nout this agreement. So I ask colleagues to stand with the 34 different \norganizations that came together--and I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the names of the groups in the coalition that put \nthis together.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n              Groups in Conservation Compliance Coalition\n\n       American Association of Crop Insurers, American Farm Bureau \n     Federation, American Farmland Trust, American Society of \n     Agronomy, American Soybean Association, American Sugar \n     Alliance, Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Audubon, \n     Crop Insurance and Reinsurance Bureau, Crop Science Society \n     of America, Ducks Unlimited, Environmental Defense Fund, Land \n     Improvement Contractors of America, National Association of \n     State Conservation Agencies, National Association of \n     Conservation Districts, National Association of Resource \n     Conservation and Development Councils, National Bobwhite \n     Conservation Initiative.\n       National Conservation District Employees Association, \n     National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton Council, \n     National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, National Farmers \n     Union, National Wildlife Federation, Pheasants Forever, \n     Pollinator Partnership, Quail Forever, Soil and Water \n     Conservation Society, Soil Science Society of America, \n     Southern Peanut Farmers Federation, Theodore Roosevelt \n     Conservation Partnership, The Nature Conservancy, USA Rice \n     Federation, Wildlife Mississippi, World Wildlife Fund.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we need to make sure our colleagues in \nthe House, as well as in the Senate, stand with all of these groups who \nworked hard to compromise and forge this very historic constructive \nagreement. If we want to preserve conservation wins we have in this \nfarm bill, we\n\n[[Page S3731]]\n\nneed to support the farmers, the environmentalists, and the \nconservationists who have made it very clear this agreement is \nsomething they stand behind. We should not be weakening crop insurance \nor making it harder for large producers, who have the majority of the \nland we want to conserve, to have less of an incentive to participate \nin the program.\n  Let me just say--and I know my colleague from Vermont is here to \nspeak as well--that I want to thank again the 34 organizations--\neveryone from the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Soybean \nAssociation, the Audubon Society, Ducks Unlimited, the Environmental \nDefense Fund, National Wildlife Federation, National Cotton Council--\nand right on down the line--the National Farmers Union, Nature \nConservancy, World Wildlife Fund, and USA Rice Federation.\n  This is an incredible coalition, and it speaks very loudly both to \nthe fact we need to keep in place the No. 1 risk management tool for \nour growers but that we need to also make sure they are providing the \nconservation practices to protect our soil and our water which is so \ncritical for the future--for our children and grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating Senators \nStabenow and Cochran for their hard work on this very important piece \nof legislation, especially for rural States such as Vermont, but I \nguess for everybody who eats, which is the majority of the people in \nour country, I would imagine.\n  I want to spend a few minutes talking about some important amendments \nI am offering. I think one of them--the amendment I will talk about \nfirst--will be coming up for a vote either later tonight or tomorrow, \nand that deals with the right of States to label genetically engineered \nfood. That is amendment No. 965.\n  This year, the Vermont State House of Representatives passed a bill \nby a vote of 99 to 42 requiring that genetically engineered food be \nlabeled. I can tell you with absolute certainty the people of Vermont \nwant to know what is in their food and are extremely supportive of what \nthe State legislature has done. But this is an issue certainly not just \nlimited to Vermont.\n  Yesterday, as I understand it, the Connecticut State Senate, by an \noverwhelming vote of 35 to 1, also passed legislation to require \nlabeling of genetically engineered food. In California, our largest \nState, where the issue was on the ballot last November, 47 percent of \nthe people there voted for labeling, despite the biotech industry \nspending over $47 million in a campaign in opposition to that \nproposition. That is an enormous sum of money, and yet 47 percent of \nthe people voted for labeling of GMOs.\n  In the State of Washington, some 350,000 people signed a petition in \nsupport of initiative 522 to label genetically engineered foods in that \nState. In fact, according to a recent poll done earlier this year, \napproximately 82 percent of the American people believe labeling should \ntake place with regard to genetically engineered ingredients.\n  All over this country people are increasingly concerned about the \nquality of the food they are ingesting and the food they are giving to \ntheir kids. People want to know what is in their food, and I believe \nthat is a very reasonable request.\n  What I am proposing today--the amendment I am offering--is certainly \nnot a radical concept. In fact, the requirement of labeling genetically \nmodified food exists today in dozens and dozens of countries throughout \nthe world, including our closest allies in the European Union, \nincluding Russia, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Brazil, China, New \nZealand, and other countries. So this is not some kind of new and crazy \nidea. In fact, it exists all over the world.\n  At a time when many of my colleagues express their strong conviction \nabout States rights and that States should be allowed to have increased \nresponsibilities, this amendment should be supported by those people \nwho, in fact, believe in States rights. The reason for that is when the \nState of Vermont and other States go forward in passing legislation to \nlabel genetically modified food, they have been threatened by Monsanto \nand other large biotech companies with costly lawsuits. So States are \ngoing forward, doing what they think is proper for their own people, \nand then Monsanto and other very large biotech companies are coming \nforward and saying: We are going to sue you.\n  Now, Monsanto is arguing, as one of the major grounds for their \nlawsuit--which I believe is absolutely incorrect--that States do not \nhave the right to pass legislation such as this; that it is, in fact, a \nFederal prerogative and not something a State can legally do.\n  I believe very strongly that Monsanto is wrong, but that is precisely \nwhat this amendment clarifies.\n  Today we have an opportunity with this amendment to affirm once and \nfor all that States do have the right to label food that contains \ngenetically engineered ingredients.\n  Let me briefly tell you what is in this amendment. This amendment \nfinds that the 10th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States \nclearly reserves powers in the system of federalism to the States or to \nthe people. This amendment finds that States have the authority to \nrequire the labeling of foods produced through genetically engineering \nor derived from organisms that have been genetically engineered.\n  Furthermore, this amendment requires that 1 year after the enactment \nof this act, the Commissioner of the FDA and the Secretary of \nAgriculture shall undertake the necessary regulations to carry out this \namendment.\n  There is strong precedent for labeling GMOs. The FDA already required \nthe labeling of over 3,000 ingredients and additives. If you want to \nknow if your food contained gluten, aspartame, high-fructose corn \nsyrup, trans fats or MSG, you simply read the ingredient label. \nMillions of people every day look at labels: How many calories are \nthere in the food? What are the ingredients in the food? This simply \ndoes what we have been doing as a nation for many years, only right now \nAmericans are not afforded the same right for GE foods.\n  Monsanto and other companies claim there is nothing to be concerned \nabout with genetically engineered food. Yet FDA scientists and doctors \nhave warned us that GE foods could have new and different risks, such \nas hidden allergens, increased plant toxin levels, and the potential to \nhasten the spread of antibiotic-resistant disease.\n  This is a pretty simple amendment. It basically says the American \npeople have a right to know what they are eating. This is legislation I \nknow the people of Vermont, I gather the people of Connecticut, and I \nthink people all over this country would like to see agreed to. I ask \nfor its support.\n  There are a couple of other amendments I would like to briefly \ndiscuss, having to do with SNAP. One of them deals with the need for \nseniors to be better able to access SNAP. It is no secret that in our \ncountry today, millions of seniors are struggling to get by on limited \nincomes. The result of that is that after they pay their prescription \ndrug costs or their rent or their utilities, they do not have enough \nmoney to spend on food. It is estimated that some 1 million seniors are \ngoing hungry in the United States of America. That is something we \nshould be embarrassed about and an issue we should address as soon as \npossible.\n  Clearly, the toll that inadequate nutrition has for seniors impacts \ntheir overall health. My strong guess is that this amendment will end \nup saving us money because when seniors get good nutrition, they are \nless likely to fall, break their hips, end up in the emergency room, \nend up in the hospital.\n  I think from a moral perspective, from a cost perspective, we want to \nmake sure all seniors in this country, regardless of their income, have \nthe nutrition they need.\n  SNAP plays a crucial role in our country in reducing hunger. In 2011, \nSNAP raised nearly 5 million people out of poverty. But here is the \nmain point I wish to make: Only 35 percent of eligible individuals over \nage 60 participated in SNAP in 2010. In other words, there are many \nseniors out there who could benefit from SNAP but for a variety of \nreasons, one of which I am addressing right now, they do not \nparticipate.\n  As you may well know, the SNAP application process can be confusing \nand cumbersome for many households, especially for seniors. Individuals \napply\n\n[[Page S3732]]\n\nfor SNAP sometimes by visiting an application center, which is a \nchallenge for people with mobility issues. If you are a senior and not \nable to get out of your home, if you cannot afford transportation, \ngetting to that center can be very difficult.\n  It is also challenging when dealing with an application over the \ntelephone if you are hard of hearing--which clearly many seniors are. \nAt the same time, the complicated interview process costs local, State, \ntribal, and Federal governments additional administrative dollars.\n  The SNAP amendment I am offering is pretty simple. It will help \nalleviate hunger by allowing seniors to more easily apply for and \naccess SNAP benefits in order to reduce barriers for seniors applying \nfor SNAP.\n  This amendment proposes to do the following. It allows States to \ndeputize, which in this case means to certify nonprofit organizations \nand area agencies on aging that are meeting with seniors directly and \nhelping them with their SNAP application to conduct the interview on \nbehalf of the State. The State agency would still determine \neligibility.\n  Further, States would have the flexibility to deputize only the \nagencies that have the capacity to fulfill the State's interview \nrequirements on their behalf. This amendment does not waive any \ndocumentation requirements or ease any other requirements. Eligibility \nfor the benefits must still be verified. What it does do is reduce \nduplication of effort and ease the burden on vulnerable families and \nseniors for whom it is a challenge to travel to a State office or wait \nfor days at a friend's house who has a phone to make a call.\n  All this is doing is saying: If we want to make sure seniors stay \nhealthy, get the nutrition they need, stay out of the emergency room, \nstay out of the hospital, let us make it easier for them to take \nadvantage of the programs that are currently available. In this case, \nthe SNAP eligibility process for seniors is pretty complicated and \nsometimes people who want to be in the program simply are unable to do \nthat. I hope we could have support for that amendment.\n  The other SNAP amendment deals with an equally important issue of \npeople who are wrongfully dropped from the SNAP, often due to an \nadministrative error. The current system is inefficient. We are \nspending government money that should be going to help people buy food \nand instead we are spending it on paperwork and bureaucracy. \nImprovements I am proposing will help alleviate hunger as fewer people \nwill go without the benefits they need, and State and Federal resources \nwill be used more effectively.\n  My amendment requires the USDA to track information from States on \nthe problem of churn. That is the term used when eligible people are \ndropped from the program and then must reapply. The USDA and advocacy \ngroups have identified children as a key problem in the administration \nof SNAP benefits. Having people reapply who never should have been \ndropped from the benefit in the first place adds to the caseload \nburden.\n\n  Tracking the information is only a first step. Then we must find \nsolutions to reduce the problem so people do not lose their benefits, \nwhether that be improved training, clearer forms and notices or simpler \nrecertification processes. These improvements will reduce hunger by \nmaking sure people get the benefits for which they are eligible and \nwhich they so desperately need.\n  The last issue I briefly wish to touch on deals with the need for the \nUSDA to help us understand, through a study, the impact that global \nwarming is having on agriculture. We all know we are looking at record-\nsetting droughts in Australia, Brazil, and locations in America. U.S. \ncities matched or broke at least 29,000 high-temperature records last \nyear. Ice-free Arctic summers will be with us within a couple of years. \nThat is the reality of the moment.\n  The impact of global warming clearly will be felt far and wide, but \nfarmers across the country are among those who will suffer the most. \nWarmer temperatures, water shortages and droughts and other extreme \nweather disturbances will force producers to alter practices, change \ncrops, and spend more money to sustain their operations.\n  This amendment simply asks the USDA to do a study to provide us with \na better understanding of how changing climate will impact agriculture \nacross the country and help farmers plan and adapt to those changes. It \nwill help local communities and States make critical adjustments now, \nand it will reduce the vulnerability of the entire agriculture sector \nto the damaging consequences of climate change.\n  We think this is an important amendment. State farmers need to have \nthe information about what scientists believe will be happening, the \nwork they are doing for years to come. I ask for support for that \namendment.\n  In the past we have successfully offered an amendment on community \ngardens. In Vermont, now schools, communities are working on gardens \nall over the State. We had a national program passed last year as well. \nThis would simply expand that program to allow schools and communities \nto engage with limited help from the Federal Government in community \ngardens, teaching kids about the foods they are eating and about \nagriculture. It is a very inexpensive concept, which has been working \nvery successfully and I think needs to be expanded.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support for the sugar \nreform amendment being offered on the farm bill by Senator Shaheen. \nThis important amendment would begin a reform process that deals with a \ncomplicated and burdensome program that artificially raises sugar \nprices in the United States. For nearly three-quarters of a century \nnow, American businesses and consumers have paid a premium price for \nsugar. This inflated price is due to a tangled web of price \nmanipulation, stringent import quotas and tariffs. The net effect has \nbeen that Americans are paying as much as twice the world market base \nprice for sugar.\n  We all realize the amount of sugar that is used in a number of \nproducts across the United States, but let me bring this down \nspecifically to what impact it has on some of the confectioners in my \nhome State. Albanese Confectionary Group, Inc, is a renowned Indiana-\nbased manufacturer of a number of products that use a lot of sugars, \nincluding chocolates and Gummi bears--they call it the World's Best \nGummies--and a lot of other confections. Their estimate is that they \nwould save $3 trillion annually if they were able to buy sugar at the \nworld price.\n  Lewis Bakeries, headquartered in Evansville, IN, is one of the few \nremaining independent bakeries in our State and in the Midwest and is \nthe largest wholesale bakery we have. Artificially high prices for \nLewis Bakeries contributes directly to higher food and beverage costs \nthat weigh down family budgets. Even larger companies such as Kraft \nFoods, which has a marshmallow and caramel plant in Kendallville, IN, \nknows that phasing out the Sugar Program would enhance the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. sugar manufacturers.\n  Why is that important? Because these sugar prices for those in this \nbusiness of using large quantities of sugar is driving them offshore. \nThey are moving to Canada, they are moving to Mexico, they are moving \nto other places where they then can buy the most important ingredient \nfor their product at world market prices and save a great deal of \nmoney.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Shaheen amendment. It \npromotes jobs, fights consumer price inflation. It reduces the level of \ngovernment interference in private markets. I think we should be \npursuing policies that allow the free market to determine the cost of \nsugar rather than this complicated web of tariffs and regulations and \nothers that protect that price.\n  This amendment does not accomplish all of that, but it goes a long \nway toward beginning the process of unwinding this and making our \ncompanies more competitive around the world.\n  I would like to take a moment to address another issue with the farm \nbill. Senator Donnelly and I are cosponsors of a bill called planting \nflexibility. We are hoping this provision we have offered will be \nincluded in the managers' amendment. I appreciate all the work that has \nbeen done behind the scenes to\n\n[[Page S3733]]\n\naddress this important issue. Planting flexibility simply allows \nfarmers to respond to market signals when making their planting \ndecisions, rather than following requirements to grow a particular crop \nto participate in government programs.\n  For example, Hoosier tomato farmers were restricted on where they \ncould plant their crop. Red Gold, a family-owned and operated tomato \nbusiness in Elwood, IN, estimates that roughly 50 percent of its \ntomatoes are now grown on flexible acres. Red Gold produces a whole \nnumber of tomato products that are sold all over the United States and, \nin fact, all over the world.\n  Allowing this flexibility, again, is a free-market-based choice which \nproducers can follow based on supply and demand. It gives them the \nflexibility they need to address crops outside the coverage of this \nparticular bill.\n  I think both of these measures are commonsense, market-driven reforms \nthat I hope will be included in the farm bill, and I ask that my \ncolleagues support them.\n  Mr. President, unless the ranking member on the Agriculture Committee \nneeds the time, and since no one else is on the floor, I would be \nremiss in not speaking a little longer.\n  If I could speak as if in morning business, I wish to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Oklahoma Tragedy\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the first thing I want to do is extend our \nsincere regrets over the tragedy which occurred in Oklahoma. Sincere \nthoughts and prayers are coming from many Hoosiers for those people who \nhave suffered greatly.\n  Last year we had a serious tornado roar through southern Indiana \nalong a 50-mile path. Fortunately, we didn't have the level of \ndestruction they had in Oklahoma City. But having been there and viewed \nthe destruction of that tornado in Indiana and the impact it had on the \nlives of so many people and then comparing it with what happened in \nOklahoma, it certainly brings home the nature of this tragedy. Whenever \nMother Nature's vicious wrath strikes, it not only tears apart homes \nbut families.\n  During these times of tragedy--such as what I witnessed in southern \nIndiana and what we are witnessing on television as we watch what is \nhappening in Oklahoma--we see the extraordinary heroism, generosity, \nvolunteerism, and resolve of the American people to pitch in and help.\n  I ask all Hoosiers to keep our friends in Oklahoma in their hearts \nand prayers and to help wherever we can.\n\n\n                             Jobs and Debt\n\n  Mr. President, in the last few weeks there has been scandal after \nscandal unfolding in Washington. Obviously this is a difficult period \nfor the current administration, but more importantly, it has resulted \nin a difficult time for our Nation.\n  What we saw last week is further justification for the American \npeople's deeply disturbing distrust of government. Under this current \nadministration, there has been a pattern of misleading the American \npeople and there has been a culture of intimidation toward those who \ndisagree with their policies.\n  We saw it when the administration misled the American people with the \nevents in Benghazi, and we saw it when the administration avoided \nletting people know about the IRS targeting conservative groups. \nWhether it is the IRS, Benghazi, or other issues we have become aware \nof in the last few weeks and months, they call into question the \nintegrity of this administration. The American people deserve straight \ntalk and the truth as to what happened rather than the \nmischaracterization or lack of revelation of what has happened.\n  Through calls, emails, and letters, I am hearing from concerned \nHoosiers who are outraged with what they see taking place in \nWashington. Given the headlines they have seen in the last few weeks, \nthey have every right to be concerned.\n  The only way to eliminate this current trust deficit in Washington is \nto hold people accountable, get complete answers, and make changes to \nensure this abuse of power and misinformation which is coming out of \nthis administration will not continue. We need to continue with these \nongoing investigations until we get answers and determine who is \nresponsible.\n  In the midst of these investigations, let me state there is another \nscandal we must not overlook, and that is the ongoing chronic debt and \nunemployment crisis.\n  Four-and-a-half years after the end of an admittedly deep recession, \nthe fact that 22 million Americans are either unemployed or \nunderemployed is a scandal. More than $16.8 trillion of debt, with its \nimpact on future generations, is a scandal. Borrowing $40,000 per \nsecond and saddling each child born today in America with over $50,000 \nof debt is a scandal. These numbers are not partisan or political, they \nare the facts. Those are the facts that this body, as well as this \nadministration, have to deal with because we are careening on an \nunstable fiscal path which will bankrupt the critical programs our \nseniors and retirees depend on and rob them of the benefits they have \nbeen promised.\n  We are seeing meager gains in jobs only to find out more and more \nAmericans are being forced from full-time employment to part-time \nemployment. In April alone, nearly 280,000 Americans involuntarily \nentered into part-time employment. At the same time, the average work \nweek and weekly take-home pay continues to decline.\n  These two issues--our debt crisis and our jobs crisis--should consume \nthe work of this Congress and this administration. Instead, we careen \nfrom drama to drama. We wait for the fiscal cliff and debt limit \ndeadlines, and then we enact far short from what we need to do with \nlegislation that is often flawed, such as the across-the-board \nsequestration policy. None of this remotely solves the problem we face.\n  In a recent Gallup poll, when asked what they would like Congress and \nthe President to address, 86 percent of the American people named \ncreating jobs and growing the economy. From Fort Wayne to Evansville \nand from Gary to Jeffersonville, Hoosiers tell me they want Congress to \nbring growth and certainty to our economy and create meaningful jobs \nfor the underemployed and unemployed.\n  As we address the issues before us, let's not forget about this major \ndebt crisis which faces our country and impacts every American. Let's \nnot forget about those Americans who are looking for work and cannot \nfind it, or those who have been forced into part-time jobs which will \nnot begin to be enough to support a family. Let's not become distracted \nand drop the ball on tackling these issues because the daily headlines \nare simply pointing to something else.\n  The best way we can restore the trust deficit in this country is to \ndo our job here, make the tough decisions we know we need to make, and \naddress our greatest challenge.\n  We must come together on a credible, long-term plan to reduce our \ndebt and put our country back on a path toward growth and job creation. \nThe future of our country depends upon it. Each of us, starting with \nthe President, has a moral obligation to address this most critical \nissue. I hope we will be willing to stand up and do this.\n  Yes, we have other issues. We have the farm bill, which we need to \naddress. We will be talking about immigration a week after we come back \nfrom the break. We will be holding investigations and looking into some \nof these scandals that have surfaced over the last few weeks, but we \nstill have not focused on the real problem here.\n  While we have to do these other tasks, let us not forget what the \nreal challenge is before us: restoring economic growth and creating \njobs. We owe it to the American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. Res. 65\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous order, the Senate begin consideration of \nS. Res. 65 at 3:45\n\n[[Page S3734]]\n\np.m.; that there be 50 minutes for debate, that the Republicans control \n30 minutes and the majority control 20 minutes, and that of the \nmajority's time, Senator Menendez control 15 minutes and Senator \nBlumenthal control 5 minutes; that all other provisions under the \nprevious order remain in effect; and that upon disposition of S. Res. \n65 the Senate resume consideration of S. 954; that there be 2 minutes \nfor debate equally divided in the usual form and the Senate immediately \nproceed to vote in relation to the Shaheen amendment No. 925; and that \nthere be no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President. As a result of this \nagreement, if all time is used, at approximately 4:35 p.m. there will \nbe two rollcall votes, the first on adoption of S. Res. 65, the Iran \nsanctions resolution, and then in relation to the Shaheen amendment on \nthe Sugar Program.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 925\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to address the Shaheen amendment \nNo. 925 the chairman of the committee just referred to. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment. I wish to start by thanking \nSenator Shaheen for her leadership, Senator Kirk for his leadership, \nand Senator Durbin for his support and leadership. We have all worked \ntogether on this amendment. I wish to briefly explain why I think it is \nimportant and why this amendment deserves the support of this body.\n  First of all, people ought to understand we have an extensive and \ncomplicated system by which taxpayers and consumers are forced to prop \nup, to an artificially high price, the price of sugar in this country. \nWe subsidize a handful of wealthy sugar growers at the expense of \neverybody in America because I can't think of any consumer who doesn't \nconsume sugar. Everybody uses some amount of sugar. It is in virtually \nall processed food. It is obviously in any kind of confectionery or any \nkind of sweets. It is a staple, a fundamental staple. In fact, the \npoorest Americans spend the highest percentage of their limited income \non sugar because that is the nature of this food staple that is sugar.\n  Well, what do we do through our agricultural policy? One of the \nthings we do is we put a limit on how much we can bring in from \noverseas. It just so happens there are some places in the world that \ncan grow sugar cheaper than we can, and rather than take advantage of \nthe opportunity to have a lower cost staple for all Americans--\nincluding the poorest of Americans--instead we establish a quota and \nsay there is only so much we are going to bring in without imposing a \nbig, huge, expensive tariff on them, and since we don't grow enough \nourselves to meet the demand, when we hit that quota, we do, in fact, \nimpose that huge tariff on the additional sugar we need to buy.\n  But that is not all we do to subsidize these handful of growers at \nthe expense of American taxpayers and consumers. Another program we \nhave is an extensive loan program where ultimately the taxpayer lends \nmoney to sugar producers, and it is a ``heads-I-win, tails-you-lose'' \nprogram for the sugar producer. If the price drops too low on sugar \nthat the producer would actually have to reach into his own pocket to \npay back the loan, guess what. He doesn't have to do that. He can say: \nNevermind, I am not going to pay back the loan. I will just give you \nthe sugar. This is classic ``heads-they-win, tails-we-all-lose.''\n  It goes beyond that because in an effort to prop up the price at \nartificially high levels so we are all paying more than we need to for \nsugar, we have a program that is called the Feedstock Flexibility \nProgram. This program is one in which the USDA takes taxpayer money and \nbuys up huge quantities of sugar in order to drive up the price for all \nof us. I know it is hard to believe this is true. I am not making this \nup. I am not creative enough to make this up. This is real.\n  Then what does the USDA do with the massive quantity of sugar it \nmight buy? By the way, there was a front-page story in the Wall Street \nJournal just a few weeks ago about a huge purchase the USDA is \nseriously thinking about making, has the discretion to do it, and might \nvery well make. If they don't use all of the sugar, they don't have \nanything to do with it, so they sell it at a huge loss. They sell it to \nsomebody who is going to make ethanol or something with it. That is \nwhat we do with it. It is unbelievable, all the ways in which taxpayers \nor consumers are forced to subsidize a very wealthy group of sugar \ngrowers. So that is what we do as policy under existing law.\n  This amendment tries to push that back a little bit. That is all we \nare trying to do. What Senators Shaheen and Kirk and Durbin and I have \ndone with this amendment is say: Can we at least push back some of the \nmost egregious features? Can we go back to the policy we had prior to \nthe 2008 farm bill because prior to 2008, we did subsidize sugar, but \nat least not quite as much as we do today. So that is what we are \ntrying to do. Let's just go back to the policies we had before 2008, \nand specifically let's eliminate this Feed Stock Program, this program \nwhereby the USDA can go out and purchase huge quantities of sugar, \ndriving up the price, and then turn around and sell it at a huge loss. \nLet's end that, and let's have a little bit more flexibility on this \nquota so American consumers can have the opportunity to buy more sugar \nat prices that are at least a little closer to the world prices.\n  Here are a few facts we ought to keep in mind. The net effect of all \nof these programs on all of our consumers--and as I say, everybody \nconsumes sugar--is that we pay, on average, about 30 percent more than \nthe world market price for sugar. That is what we are doing to our \nconsumers now. By the way, that is separate and apart from the cost to \ntaxpayers. That is just what consumers are forced to pay.\n  Now, does that have the effect of maybe protecting a handful of jobs \namong sugar growers? It probably does. So the Commerce Department \ndecided to take a look at this, and they did a study. They discovered, \nsure enough, there are a certain number of jobs among sugar producers \nthat are protected by the fact that we don't allow a free market in \nsugar and we don't allow imports from more efficient producers. But \nhere is what else they discovered. They discovered for every job we \nsave among sugar producers, we lose three jobs among companies that \nmanufacture with sugar--companies that make cakes and desserts and \ncandies and all the other kinds of goods we manufacture that require \nsugar as an ingredient. The reason we lose those jobs is because those \ncompanies can't compete with foreign imports that don't have this crazy \nSugar Program.\n\n  So, for instance, we have candy companies that have left America and \nhave moved to Canada because Canada doesn't do this. When they relocate \nin Canada, they can buy sugar at a normal world price, the same as \nanyone else anywhere in the world outside of America--maybe not \nanybody, but lots of people outside of America can buy sugar that is \nmuch cheaper than what they have to pay for sugar when they are an \nAmerican citizen, an American company, so they can make candy much \ncheaper.\n  So we lose American jobs, which we have lost, they go to Canada or \nsomewhere else, and how can that possibly be a good outcome to lose \nthree jobs for every one we protect. It doesn't make any sense.\n  This is a badly flawed policy. I would advocate that we completely \nrepeal all of this. That would be my personal view. That is not what \nthis amendment does. All we do in this amendment is say let's just go \nback to where we were before the farm bill of 2008 expanded this \nprogram and created this new liability for taxpayers.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Shaheen amendment No. 925 for \nsome good, commonsense improvements to our existing sugar policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor of the \nSenate to talk not only about the farm bill, but specifically about the \nimportance of the Sugar Program to the compromise that is the farm \nbill. I talked about growers getting protections in terms of crop \ninsurance, I talked about the dairy program, I talked about specialty \ncrops, and I\n\n[[Page S3735]]\n\ntalked about the importance of protecting the domestic sugar industry \nand using a no-cost approach which has been the approach we have dealt \nwith for years in the Sugar Program.\n  Today I don't want to repeat all of that discussion. What I would \nlike to do, however, is respond directly to the Shaheen amendment and \nsome of the information we have been hearing about the Shaheen \namendment going forward. I think it is important because we have heard \nthe Shaheen amendment would simply roll back the Sugar Program to the \npolicies in place before the 2008 farm bill. In reality, this amendment \nwould do far more than what was included in the program prior to 2008 \nand would, in fact, threaten 142,000 American sugar-producing jobs in \n22 States.\n  I want to be very specific about the uniqueness of this compared to \npre-2008. So, specifically, the amendment institutes two new policies \nbeyond repealing the 2008 farm bill changes to the Sugar Program that \nare damaging to our farmers and sugar manufacturers in the United \nStates.\n  First, the amendment would mandate for the first time a 15.5-percent \nstocks-to-use ratio. Sugar supplies in the United States are already at \nhistorically high surplus levels at a stocks-to-use ratio in the 18-to-\n20 percent range. This proposal would mandate artificially inflated \nincreased inventories in order, really--realistically--to push down \nprices for food processing companies. At a stocks-to-use ratio of less \nthan 15.5 percent earlier this year, sugar producer prices were \ncollapsing below average levels of the 1980s and the 1990s.\n  We hear over and over again about how we have had this dramatic \nincrease in sugar prices, and that has led to the loss of American \nprocessing jobs. Really, nothing could be further from the truth. In \nfact, we have seen historically low prices. In fact, sugar prices \nearlier this year were collapsing below the levels of the 1980s and \n1990s.\n  Second, it would make U.S. sugar import quota rights tradable--\ntradable--on the open market, and I think that would risk potential \nfraud and abuse and denial of quota benefits to developing countries \nthat count on the quotas. So if a country could not, in fact, meet \ntheir quota, that quota could be traded on the open market. I think \nthat is a formula for interjecting a factor that has never been \ninstituted before in the sugar bill.\n  I think U.S. policy provides access to developing world countries to \nour sugar market, one of the largest in the world. Allowing governments \nof developing nations to trade their quotas does nothing to empower \nthose farmers in developing countries. Instead, the quota rights will \nbe traded to subsidized industries in powerful sugar companies such as \nBrazil, which could lead to further excess supply in the American \nmarket.\n  Because everybody seems to believe that pre-2008 was a panacea for \nsugar, and if we just went back there everything would once again be \nfine, I wish to set the stage for what the world was like before the \n2008 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill updated the Sugar Program in \nresponse to a change in the relationship between the United States and \nMexico regarding sugar. Under NAFTA, agricultural trade was liberalized \nbetween our two countries which removed barriers and allowed a more \nfree flow of goods. The NAFTA provisions regarding sugar were fully \nrealized in 2008.\n  If dropping the trade barriers resulted in a level playing field, \nthis would have been no problem because our American farmers are the \nmost efficient in the world, and we can win in a free market condition. \nHowever, a level playing field was not the case. Mexican sugar is \nhighly subsidized. In fact, the government owns approximately 20 \npercent of their sugar industry.\n  Candy and major food-producing companies are having some of their \nmost successful years in memory. When we hear the stories of lost jobs \nand additional burden, I think we need to look at reality, and I think \nreality is that nothing has--the price of sugar has not prevented them \nfrom achieving record profits, strong profits, and continued growth.\n  Another fact that doesn't get talked about much when we talk about \nthe Sugar Program is that today the price of sugar is roughly the same \nas what it was in 1985. What product can we say that is true of? Sugar \nis the exact price as it was in 1985.\n  Additionally, the domestic price of sugar is often lower than the \ninternational price when factoring in transportation costs. To claim \nthe Sugar Program is breaking the backs of American consumers, again, \nis not a fair or accurate statement.\n  The U.S. wholesale sugar price in April was 26 cents per pound. The \ninternationally traded sugar price in April was 22 cents per pound. The \ntransportation cost of bringing sugar to the United States from Brazil, \nthe Dominican Republic, or the Philippines--three of the largest \nimporters of sugar under the program--exceeds the 4 cents-per-pound \ndifference.\n  So I think it is important that we at least have some response to \nthis idea that, No. 1, things were good in 2008 so we should just roll \nback the program to 2008. If that were true, obviously, I do not think \nwe would be standing here fighting this amendment. But I do not think \nit is true. Plus, I think there are provisions in this amendment that \nhave not yet been revealed as provisions that were not included in the \npre-2008 Sugar Program, and that concerns me.\n  It concerns me that this amendment has not had a discussion in \ncommittee. This amendment has not been something that the experts on \nthe Agriculture Committee have deliberated.\n  Then I want to kind of pull back and look at a higher view, which is \nthe American farmer, American agriculture, and what the farm bill \nattempts to do to guarantee a sure and steady supply of food for our \ncountry and, arguably, for the world.\n  The farm bill is a compromise package. The farm bill represents, in \neach one of those elements, a different provision for different parts \nof our country: dairy, important in Wisconsin; dairy, important in \nVermont; dairy, not so important in North Dakota. But sugar is \ncritically important to the economy of North Dakota. Sugar is important \nto the economy of Minnesota, the economy of Florida, the economy of \nHawaii.\n  All of us have come together to fashion a farm bill that responds to \nthe need for certainty in American agricultural policy. The farm bill \nis critical not only to our farmers but to the 16 million jobs the farm \nbill supports, and we forget that. We forget that this is much bigger \nthan a sugar program, it is much bigger than any one individual \ncommodity. It is about food security, combined with an effort to do \nwhat we need to do to provide certainty and surety to American \nproducers.\n  My concern is that when you single out one commodity--whether it is \nsoybeans or corn or sugar or tobacco or rice--when you single out one \ncommodity, you threaten the effectiveness of the overall farm bill. So \nI would urge my colleagues to work within the structure of the \nAgriculture Committee, understand that where you may have individual \nconcerns about each piece of this--and I may have individual concerns \nabout varying pieces of this farm bill, this ag bill, but it is \ncritically important that we not single out one commodity on which to \nreduce our support. Sugar is too important to our economy, it is too \nimportant to our food processing to risk simply that we are going to \nhave enough sugar on the international market, that we are not going to \nhave a domestic supply because many of these provisions would drive the \ndomestic producer out of the market, making us beholden to foreign \nsources of sugar. I do not think that is why we have a farm bill. I \nthink we have a farm bill so we can guarantee that farm commodities and \nfarm products that we are able to grow in this country are available \nand local.\n  So I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. I think it is extreme. \nThis amendment, which has basically been reported to be a simple \nrollback to 2008, is not exactly as it appears. I believe it is \ncritically important that we keep the compromise, which is the farm \nbill as reported out of the committee, essentially intact by \nrecognizing the needs of all the commodity groups.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3736]]\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I want to take several minutes to respond to some of the \ncomments that were made here in regard to the farm bill, and \nspecifically the Sugar Program. We have got a vote coming up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We currently have an order to move to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 65 at 3:45 p.m.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, that is my resolution with Senator \nMenendez. I do not mind yielding a couple of minutes to the Senator to \nmake his points.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank my colleague. I do want to respond to some \ncomments that were made in regard to the Sugar Program and the cost of \nsugar for American consumers. It is very important to understand that \nthe price of sugar in the United States is actually less than the \ninternational price. So because of the Sugar Program we have, American \nconsumers benefit. Again, I want to reiterate that point.\n  Also I want to express how important it is to understand that we have \nlow-cost producers in this country who are precluded from selling their \nsugar in markets such as the European Union because of tariffs and \nrestrictions. As an individual who strongly supports international \ncommerce and trade, on many of these issues I am down here talking \nabout how we want to continue to expand our ability to export. I \nbelieve that. But at the same time, we have to make sure our companies \nand our farmers, our ranchers and our producers, particularly when we \nare talking about a farm bill, are treated fairly.\n  We have a situation where they operate internationally and they are \nprecluded from many markets throughout the world, even though they are \nlow-cost producers. That is what our Sugar Program is designed to do, \nto try to level that playing field. It does so effectively. The Sugar \nProgram has cost this country nothing over the last decade. In fact, \nconsumers in this country benefit from lower sugar prices than the \ninternational price, not higher prices.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3736-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3736-S3745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPORTING SANCTIONS ON IRAN\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 65\n\n       Whereas, on May 14, 1948, the people of Israel proclaimed \n     the establishment of the sovereign and independent State of \n     Israel;\n       Whereas, on March 28, 1949, the United States Government \n     recognized the establishment of the new State of Israel and \n     established full diplomatic relations;\n       Whereas, since its establishment nearly 65 years ago, the \n     modern State of Israel has rebuilt a nation, forged a new and \n     dynamic democratic society, and created a thriving economic, \n     political, cultural, and intellectual life despite the heavy \n     costs of war, terrorism, and unjustified diplomatic and \n     economic boycotts against the people of Israel;\n       Whereas the people of Israel have established a vibrant, \n     pluralistic, democratic political system, including freedom \n     of speech, association, and religion; a vigorously free \n     press; free, fair, and open elections; the rule of law; a \n     fully independent judiciary; and other democratic principles \n     and practices;\n       Whereas, since the 1979 revolution in Iran, the leaders of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran have repeatedly made threats \n     against the existence of the State of Israel and sponsored \n     acts of terrorism and violence against its citizens;\n       Whereas, on October 27, 2005, President of Iran Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinejad called for a world without America and Zionism;\n       Whereas, in February 2012, Supreme Leader of Iran Ali \n     Khamenei said of Israel, ``The Zionist regime is a true \n     cancer tumor on this region that should be cut off. And it \n     definitely will be cut off.'';\n       Whereas, in August 2012, Supreme Leader Khamenei said of \n     Israel, ``This bogus and fake Zionist outgrowth will \n     disappear off the landscape of geography.'';\n       Whereas, in August 2012, President Ahmadinejad said that \n     ``in the new Middle East . . . there will be no trace of the \n     American presence and the Zionists'';\n       Whereas the Department of State has designated the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 \n     and has characterized the Islamic Republic of Iran as the \n     ``most active state sponsor of terrorism'' in the world;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     provided weapons, training, funding, and direction to \n     terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hizballah, and Shiite \n     militias in Iraq that are responsible for the murder of \n     hundreds of United States service members and innocent \n     civilians;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     provided weapons, training, and funding to the regime of \n     Bashar al Assad that has been used to suppress and murder its \n     own people;\n       Whereas, since at least the late 1980s, the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran has engaged in a sustained and \n     well-documented pattern of illicit and deceptive activities \n     to acquire a nuclear weapons capability;\n       Whereas, since September 2005, the Board of Governors of \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran to be in non-compliance with its \n     safeguards agreement with the IAEA, which Iran is obligated \n     to undertake as a non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at \n     Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into \n     force March 5, 1970 (NPT);\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council has adopted \n     multiple resolutions since 2006 demanding of the Government \n     of the Islamic Republic of Iran its full and sustained \n     suspension of all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing \n     activities and its full cooperation with the IAEA on all \n     outstanding issues related to its nuclear activities, \n     particularly those concerning the possible military \n     dimensions of its nuclear program;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     refused to comply with United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions or to fully cooperate with the IAEA;\n       Whereas, in November 2011, the IAEA Director General issued \n     a report that documented ``serious concerns regarding \n     possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme,'' \n     and affirmed that information available to the IAEA indicates \n     that ``Iran has carried out activities relevant to the \n     development of a nuclear explosive device'' and that some \n     activities may be ongoing;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran stands in violation of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights for denying its \n     citizens basic freedoms, including the freedoms of \n     expression, religion, peaceful assembly and movement, and for \n     flagrantly abusing the rights of minorities and women;\n       Whereas in his State of the Union Address on January 24, \n     2012, President Barack Obama stated, ``Let there be no doubt: \n     America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear \n     weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve \n     that goal.'';\n       Whereas Congress has passed and the President has signed \n     into law legislation imposing significant economic and \n     diplomatic sanctions on Iran to encourage the Government of \n     Iran to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons and end its \n     support for terrorism;\n       Whereas these sanctions, while having significant effect, \n     have yet to persuade Iran to abandon its illicit pursuits and \n     comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       Whereas more stringent enforcement of sanctions \n     legislation, including elements targeting oil exports and \n     access to foreign exchange, could still lead the Government \n     of Iran to change course;\n       Whereas, in his State of the Union Address on February 12, \n     2013, President Obama reiterated, ``The leaders of Iran must \n     recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, \n     because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet \n     their obligations. And we will do what is necessary to \n     prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon.'';\n       Whereas, on March 4, 2012, President Obama stated, ``Iran's \n     leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of \n     containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a \n     nuclear weapon.'';\n       Whereas, on October 22, 2012, President Obama said of Iran, \n     ``The clock is ticking . . . And we're going to make sure \n     that if they do not meet the demands of the international \n     community, then we are going to take all options necessary to \n     make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.'';\n       Whereas, on May 19, 2011, President Obama stated, ``Every \n     state has the right to self-defense, and Israel must be able \n     to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.'';\n       Whereas, on September 21, 2011, President Obama stated, \n     ``America's commitment to Israel's security is unshakeable. \n     Our friendship with Israel is deep and enduring.'';\n       Whereas, on March 4, 2012, President Obama stated, ``And \n     whenever an effort is made to delegitimize the state of \n     Israel, my administration has opposed them. So there should \n     not be a shred of doubt by now: when the chips are down, I \n     have Israel's back.'';\n       Whereas, on October 22, 2012, President Obama stated, \n     ``Israel is a true friend.

I \n     will stand with Israel if they are attacked.'';\n       Whereas, in December 2012, 74 United States Senators wrote \n     to President Obama ``As you begin your second term as \n     President, we ask you to reiterate your readiness to take \n     military action against Iran if it continues its efforts to \n     acquire a nuclear weapon. In addition, we urge you to work \n     with our European and Middle Eastern allies to demonstrate to \n     the Iranians that a credible and capable multilateral \n     coalition exists that would support a military strike if, in \n     the end, this is unfortunately necessary.''; and\n       Whereas the United States-Israel Enhanced Security \n     Cooperation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-150) stated that it \n     is United States policy to support Israel's inherent right to \n     self-defense: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms the special bonds of friendship and \n     cooperation that have existed between the United States and \n     the State of Israel for more than sixty years and that enjoy \n     overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress and among the \n     people of the United States;\n       (2) strongly supports the close military, intelligence, and \n     security cooperation that President Obama has pursued with \n     Israel and urges this cooperation to continue and deepen;\n       (3) deplores and condemns, in the strongest possible terms, \n     the reprehensible statements and policies of the leaders of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran threatening the security and \n     existence of Israel;\n       (4) recognizes the tremendous threat posed to the United \n     States, the West, and Israel by the Government of Iran's \n     continuing pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability;\n       (5) reiterates that the policy of the United States is to \n     prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon capability and \n     to take such action as may be necessary to implement this \n     policy;\n       (6) reaffirms its strong support for the full \n     implementation of United States and international sanctions \n     on Iran and urges the President to continue and strengthen \n     enforcement of sanctions legislation;\n       (7) declares that the United States has a vital national \n     interest in, and unbreakable commitment to, ensuring the \n     existence, survival, and security of the State of Israel, and \n     reaffirms United States support for Israel's right to self-\n     defense; and\n       [(8) urges that, if the Government of Israel is compelled \n     to take military action in self-defense, the United States \n     Government should stand with Israel and provide diplomatic, \n     military, and economic support to the Government of Israel in \n     its defense of its territory, people, and existence.]\n       (8) urges that, if the Government of Israel is compelled to \n     take military action in legitimate self-defense against \n     Iran's nuclear weapons program, the United States Government \n     should stand with Israel and provide, in accordance with \n     United States law and the constitutional responsibility of \n     Congress to authorize the use of military force, diplomatic, \n     military, and economic support to the Government of Israel in \n     its defense of its territory, people, and existence.\n\n     SEC. 2. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this resolution shall be construed as an \n     authorization for the use of force or a declaration of war.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be now be \n50 minutes for debate, with the Republicans controlling 30 minutes and \nthe majority controlling 20 minutes.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this is a debate where it does not matter \nwho is speaking, Republican or Democrat, because we are speaking with \none voice. That very seldom happens in American politics today, \nunfortunately. There will be 50 minutes divided, but really there is no \ndivision here.\n  S. Res. 65 has 91 cosponsors. That is very difficult to do. The \nPresiding Officer, Senator Coons, was an original cosponsor of the \nlegislation.\n  What is S. Res. 65 all about? It is about the following: On March 4, \n2012, President Obama stated:\n\n       Whenever an effort is made to delegitimize the State of \n     Israel, my administration has opposed them. So there should \n     not be a shred of doubt by now. When the chips are down, I \n     have Israel's back.\n\n  This resolution is in support of the President's statement. When I \nheard that statement, it was music to my ears, because the Iranian \nnuclear program, the efforts of the Iranians to develop a nuclear \ncapability, marches on as I speak.\n  Today, May 22, there are two articles, one in the Associated Press, \none in Reuters, talking about AIEA reports and diplomats saying that \nIran is pressing forward with the construction of a research reactor \nthat would add to their nuclear capability in terms of enriching \nuranium to make a bomb, and that they have increased the number of \ncentrifuges dramatically since April.\n  We have been trying to sanction Iran--very successfully, I might add. \nSenator Menendez, my cosponsor here, the original cosponsor, will be \nhere around 4. As to Bob Menendez, there is no stronger supporter of \nthe U.S.-Israel relationship than Bob, who is chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  We have worked on a resolution. The guts of this resolution basically \nare as follows: It declares the United States has a vital national \ninterest in and an unbreakable commitment to ensuring the existence, \nsurvival, and security of the state of Israel. It reaffirms the support \nof the United States for Israel's right to legitimate self-defense. In \nthe last paragraph, it is not an authorization to use force, but it \nsays the following: That if Israel is compelled to take military action \nin self-defense, the United States will stand with Israel and provide \ndiplomatic, military, economic support in its defense of its territory, \npeople, and existence.\n  The whole resolution is about Israel having to defend herself against \na nuclear-capable Iran. So when our President said in 2012 that ``we \nhave Israel's back,'' that his administration has Israel's back, this \nis a chance for the Senate to say we also have Israel's back.\n  From my point of view, you cannot separate the threat the nuclear \nprogram in Iran creates from the United States and Israel. They are the \nsame. The same threat Israel faces from a nuclear-armed Iran, a \nnuclear-capable Iran, we face as a Nation. So people wonder, what will \nhappen if that day ever comes? What would America do? Well, this is a \nstatement by every Senator who votes yes--not an authorization to use \nforce, but a statement--that if that day comes and Israel has to \njustifiably defend itself from a breakout by the Iranian regime to \nbuild a nuclear weapon, which could be the end of the Jewish state, we \nwill have Israel's back economically, militarily, and diplomatically.\n  I cannot stress how important it is for that statement to be made by \nthe Senate. Time is running out. Time is not on our side. As to the \nthreat from Iran, since 1984 they have been characterized as the most \nactive state sponsor of terrorism in the world. As we have sanctioned \nthem to stop their nuclear ambitions, the amount of enriched uranium \nhas grown. As we talk, they enrich.\n  We are going to have several Senators come down to voice their \nsupport for this resolution.\n  With that, I would yield to Senater Hoeven for 2 minutes. The Senator \nhas been an unwavering supporter of the United States-Israel \nrelationship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I appreciate the opportunity to join my esteemed \ncolleague from the great State of South Carolina in support of S. Res. \n65, expressing our strong support for our close friend and ally, \nIsrael.\n  This resolution right up front says--I want to read from the \nsubheading in the resolution--``Strongly supports the full \nimplementation of the United States and international sanctions on \nIran, and urging the President to continue to strengthen enforcement of \nsanctions legislation.''\n  This is very important. I want to buttress a comment made by the good \nSenator from South Carolina, and that is through Kirk-Menendez and \nother legislation, we have provided authority for the administration to \nput the strongest possible sanctions in place against Iran to prevent \nIran from developing a nuclear weapon. We need to do it. We need to \nstand with Israel. We need to support our ally. This is not just about \nIsrael, this is about security for the United States. This is about \npreventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n  Essentially what these sanctions do is they provide any country or \ncompany that buys oil from Iran cannot do business with our banking \nsystem. Think about that. Countries that buy oil from Iran would not be \nable to transact with the United States and U.S. companies. That would \npreclude them from buying Iranian oil.\n  Okay. Think about that. If Iran cannot sell its oil, it has no \nrevenue. If it has no revenue, it is forced to stop its efforts to \nbuild a nuclear weapon. So the point is this: We cannot only have \nsanctions. What we are trying to do in this legislation is not only \nexpress support for Israel, again as the Senator\n\n[[Page S3738]]\n\nfrom South Carolina pointed out, but encourage and support the \nadministration in completely enforcing the strongest possible sanctions \nagainst Iran so we do not have to go to the option of a military strike \nto take out their nuclear weapon capability. That is what this is all \nabout. This is bipartisan--as the Senator said, 91 cosponsors. This is \nabout saying we can get this done but we have got to impose these \nsanctions as strongly as we can. We have got to do it now.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Now I wish to recognize Senator Ayotte for 4 minutes. We have got a \nlot of speakers here to talk about S. Res. 65. She has been there at \nevery step of the way.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Graham and Senator \nMenendez for their leadership on this important Senate resolution, S. \nRes. 65. This is a resolution that is very straightforward. It says to \nour friend and ally Israel: We have your back. That means right now. If \nyou look at the dangers confronting Israel, they are unprecedented \ndangers, from the situation in Syria, to threats from Hamas and \nHezbollah, to the situation in the Sinai. But the greatest threat of \nall is Iran acquiring nuclear weapons capability. It is a country that \nhas threatened to wipe Israel off the map.\n\n  Rightly so, the Israelis have said never again. As our country, we \nsay never again. Because it is not just that the Iranians could acquire \nnuclear weapons capability and launch a missile against our country, it \nis that they are the largest state sponsor of terrorism. They could \ngive that nuclear weapon to a terrorist. Then it is not just a threat \nto Israel, this is a threat to the safety of the world. That is why I \nfully support this resolution and why it has so many cosponsors in the \nSenate. To understand the deep friendship we have with Israel, what we \nshare in terms of democracy in the Middle East, ultimately this threat \nis not just a threat to Israel, this is a threat to the safety of the \nUnited States of America.\n  This resolution is clear. If Israel is compelled to take military \naction in self-defense against Iran's nuclear weapons program, it urges \nthe U.S. Government to stand with Israel, diplomatically, militarily, \nand economically. It also reiterates what my friend from North Dakota \ntalked about, which is the policy of the United States to prevent Iran \nfrom acquiring a nuclear weapon and reaffirms that we will continue to \npress for the toughest of economic sanctions.\n  To the leaders in Iran, understand there is much we do not agree on \nin this body. When we pass this resolution today, you need to know we \nare unified when it comes to stopping you from acquiring nuclear \nweapons capability, and that we will stand with our friend and ally \nIsrael to make sure you do not present that type of grave danger to the \nsafety of the entire world.\n  I thank my colleague from South Carolina. I thank my colleagues here \nwho have supported this incredibly important resolution. Think about \nit. How often do we come together with 91 Senators to support \nlegislation? This is about the security of this country. I look forward \nto this body passing this important resolution.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, at this time I wish to recognize a member \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, one of the strongest voices on \nnational security in the body, a new member but someone who understands \nthe world and is a tremendous supporter of the United States-Israel \nrelationship, Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I thank the Senator.\n  I rise in support of these sanctions as well. Americans are perhaps \ntempted these days to take a step back from the problems in places in \nthe Middle East and wonder why do we need to be active in resolving \nthese thorny issues that often seem unsolvable. But yesterday in the \nForeign Relations Committee, for example, we discussed Syrian \nlegislation and debated how to address the growing repercussions of our \npolicy of inaction as violence and instability spreads beyond Syria's \nborders. We cannot stand idly by and ignore the fallout from Syria. \nAmericans need to remember that Iran is not just Israel's problem, it \nis ours as well.\n  Iran has been sponsoring terrorism and killing Americans for decades, \nmost recently in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Iran has pursued \nan anti-American agenda, and its foreign policy has supported tyrants. \nIt has undermined U.S. allies, and not just in the Middle East, through \nits terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah and what they are doing now to \ndefend Asad in Syria, but they have even done it in our own hemisphere.\n  On top of these issues, Iranian leaders have denied that the \nHolocaust even happened. They threaten Israel's very existence. So we \ndo need to strengthen our sanctions. We need to actually follow through \nwith them. That is what this resolution calls on the administration to \ndo.\n  But we also have to ensure that our international partners do that as \nwell. I am pleased that this resolution calls on the administration to \nfully implement the sanctions we have already passed and approved.\n  These sanctions have not changed Iran's calculus. The sanctions alone \nare not enough because, as we have seen, Iran has added centrifuges, so \nthey continue to enrich uranium and they get closer to a nuclear \ncapability. Similarly, the approach of this administration to talk to \nIran, trying what our European partners have attempted to do in the \npast, has also been unsuccessful. For more than 10 years now we and the \nEuropeans have tried to negotiate--all with no results. Iran has only \ngotten closer and closer to a nuclear capability.\n  We need a new approach. One avenue that has not been adequately \nexplored is using perhaps our greatest weapon, what Ronald Reagan \ncalled ``the will and moral courage of free men and women.'' That means \nspeaking out more forcefully about the human rights situation in Iran.\n  This regime is brutally oppressive. It represses its own people. Read \nthe 2012 State Department report. It talks about disappearances; cruel, \ninhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment, including judicially \nsanctioned amputations and flogging; politically motivated violence and \nrepression, such as beatings and rape; harsh and life-threatening \nconditions in detention and prison facilities. This is not even a \ncomprehensive list of the abuses that exist in Iran.\n  Currently, there is an American pastor in Iran, Saeed Abedini, who is \nserving 8 years in prison because he is a Christian and practices \nChristianity.\n  Yesterday the Iranian Government disqualified two Presidential \ncandidates. This will be a sham election in the coming months. As one \nState Department official put it to the Foreign Relations Committee, \nthe Green Movement in Iran today is virtually nonexistent.\n  Instead of denigrating the freedom fighters in Iran who have suffered \nfrom inaction and lack of support, we need to be doing everything \npossible in the weeks to come to speak frankly about the lack of \nfundamental freedoms in Iran and reject the notion that this regime is \nlegitimate or a credible negotiating partner.\n  We need to make clear that a crackdown against the Iranian people \nsimilar to the one that occurred in June of 2009 after a fraudulent \nPresidential election will have real consequences this time. We can't \nbe everywhere. America can't be everywhere and do everything, but we \ncan't outsource the solutions to all our problems either.\n  Israel faces an unprecedented security environment. I saw this \nfirsthand during my recent visit to the Middle East in February. In \nevery direction, Israel sees uncertainty and potential instability, \nfrom an all-out civil war on its northern border in Syria, to neighbors \ngoing through delicate political transitions in the wake of the Arab \nspring. But even with all these changes in its neighborhood, the \ngreatest challenge facing Israel today is the threat of a nuclear Iran.\n  We need to stand with Israel and provide diplomatic, military, and \neconomic support in its defense of its territory, its people, and its \nexistence. We need to remind Tehran that the United States will not \nallow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons, as this resolution states, and \nthat is why I am supporting it. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nit as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for a terrific speech.\n\n[[Page S3739]]\n\n  I would ask whether Senator Menendez minds if Senator McCain speaks.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I am always willing to allow Senator McCain to speak.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We will do this by age. Senator McCain is recognized for \n5 minutes. That is not quite a minute a decade, but that will get us \ngoing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair, and I hope the Chair will discipline \nthis disrespect that is being displayed because of my advanced age. \nThis would never have happened in the Coolidge administration, in which \nI first served.\n  I thank the Senator. I also thank my dear friend Lindsey Graham for \nbringing this important resolution to the Senate.\n  Resolutions happen all the time. This is a very important one. It \nwouldn't have happened without the leadership and support of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I would like \nto thank him for his continued leadership, including the passage of the \nresolution that was passed through the Foreign Relations Committee \nyesterday concerning the situation in Syria.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthree articles that are of importance for our colleagues.\n  One is from the Washington Post: ``Iran paves over suspected nuclear \ntesting site despite U.N. protests.''\n  The second is another Washington Post article, by the Associated \nPress: ``Iran expands nuke technology for program that could be used to \nmake weapons.''\n  Of interest is another one, also from the Washington Post: ``Iranian \nsoldiers fighting for Assad in Syria, says State Department official.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 22, 2013]\n\n  Iran Paves Over Suspected Nuclear Testing Site Despite U.N. Protests\n\n                           (By Joby Warrick)\n\n       Iran has begun paving over a former military site where its \n     scientists are suspected to have conducted nuclear-weapons-\n     related experiments, according to a new U.N. report, a move \n     that could doom efforts to reconstruct a critical part of \n     Iran's nuclear history.\n       Satellite photos of the site, known as Parchin, show fresh \n     asphalt covering a broad area where suspicious tests were \n     carried out several years ago, the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency said in an internal report that was prepared \n     for diplomats.\n       The paving appears to have occurred within the past few \n     weeks, at a time when the United Nations' nuclear watchdog \n     was meeting with Iranian officials to try to negotiate access \n     to the site to investigate allegations of secret weapons \n     research.\n       Iran has repeatedly denied IAEA inspectors entry to the \n     site, and previous satellite photos have shown a series of \n     efforts to alter it by razing buildings and even scraping \n     away topsoil around what was once a chamber used for military \n     explosives testing. U.N. officials believe that the facility \n     may have been used to test a special kind of detonator used \n     in nuclear explosions.\n       Since February, Iran ``has conducted further spreading, \n     leveling and compacting of material over most of the site, a \n     significant proportion of which it has also asphalted,'' the \n     IAEA said in its report, a copy of which was obtained by The \n     Washington Post.\n       The alterations to the site ``have seriously undermined the \n     Agency's ability to undertake effective verification'' of \n     Iran's claims that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful, \n     the report said.\n       Iran denies that it ever conducted nuclear weapons research \n     and says the IAEA has no mandate for investigating a military \n     base with no ties to its nuclear program.\n       The IAEA, which conducts routine monitoring of Iran's \n     civilian nuclear facilities, met with Iranian officials \n     earlier this month in the latest in a string of failed \n     efforts to clear up concerns over suspicious experiments by \n     Iranian scientists. U.S. intelligence officials believe Iran \n     was testing components for nuclear weapons as recently as \n     2003, when the work was abruptly halted.\n       Since then, Iran has amassed a large stockpile of enriched \n     uranium--a key ingredient in nuclear weapons--but has not yet \n     decided whether to take the risk of building and testing a \n     bomb, U.S. officials say.\n       The IAEA report also documented Iran's continued progress \n     in increasing its supply of enriched uranium, including the \n     addition of still more advanced centrifuges that produce \n     nuclear fuel more efficiently than the outdated machines \n     formerly used by Iran. At the same time, Iran has continued \n     to convert some of its uranium stockpile into metal fuel \n     plates, a step that would make it more difficult to use the \n     material in a future weapons program.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 22, 2013]\n\n  Iran Expands Nuke Technology for Program That Could Be Used To Make \n                                Weapons\n\n                       (By The Associated Press)\n\n       Vienna.--The U.N. atomic agency on Wednesday detailed rapid \n     Iranian progress in two programs that the West fears are \n     geared toward making nuclear weapons, saying Tehran has \n     upgraded its uranium enrichment facilities and advanced in \n     building a plutonium-producing reactor.\n       In a confidential report obtained by The Associated Press, \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency said Tehran had \n     installed close to 700 high-tech centrifuges used for uranium \n     enrichment, which can produce the core of nuclear weapons. It \n     also said Tehran had added hundreds of older-generation \n     machines at its main enrichment site to bring the total \n     number to over 13,000.\n       Iran denies that either its enrichment program or the \n     reactor will be used to make nuclear arms. Most international \n     concern has focused on its enrichment, because it is further \n     advanced than the reactor and already has the capacity to \n     enrich to weapons-grade uranium.\n       But the IAEA devoted more space to the reactor Wednesday \n     than it has in previous reports. While its language was \n     technical, a senior diplomat who closely follows the IAEA's \n     monitoring of Iran's nuclear facilities said that reflected \n     increased international concerns about the potential \n     proliferation dangers it represents as a completion date \n     approaches.\n       He demanded anonymity because he was not authorized to \n     discuss confidential IAEA information.\n       The report also touched upon a more than six-year stalemate \n     in agency efforts to probe suspicions Tehran may have worked \n     on nuclear weapons. It said that--barring Iran's \n     cooperation--it may not be able to resolve questions about \n     ``possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program.''\n       The U.S., Israel and Iran's other critics say the reactor \n     at Arak, in central Iran, will be able to produce plutonium \n     for several bombs a year once it starts up. They have said \n     Tehran's plan to put it on line late next year is too \n     optimistic.\n       But the report said the Islamic Republic had told IAEA \n     experts that it was holding to that timeline. The IAEA noted \n     that much work needed to be done at the reactor site, but it \n     said Iranian technicians there already had taken delivery of \n     a huge reactor vessel to contain the facility's fuel. It also \n     detailed progress in Tehran's plans to test the fuel.\n       Installations of the new IR-2m centrifuges are also of \n     concern for nations fearing that Iran may want to make \n     nuclear arms, because they are believed to be able to enrich \n     two to five times faster than Tehran's old machines.\n       The IAEA first reported initial installations in February. \n     It said then that agency inspectors counted 180 of the \n     advanced IR-2m centrifuges at Natanz, Tehran's main \n     enrichment site, less than a month after Iran's Jan. 23 \n     announcement that it would start installing them.\n       Diplomats said none of the machines appeared to be \n     operating and some may only be partially set up. But the \n     rapid pace of installations indicates that Iran possesses the \n     technology and materials to mass-produce the centrifuges and \n     make its enrichment program much more potent.\n       Iranian nuclear chief Fereidoun Abbasi said earlier this \n     year that more than 3,000 high-tech centrifuges have already \n     been produced and will soon phase out its older-generation \n     enriching machines at Natanz, south of Tehran.\n       The report also noted Iran's decision to keep its stockpile \n     of uranium enriched to a level just a technical step away \n     from weapons-grade to below the amount needed for a bomb.\n       More than six years of international negotiations have \n     failed to persuade Tehran to stop enrichment and mothball the \n     Arak reactor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 21, 2013]\n\n  Iranian Soldiers Fighting for Assad in Syria, Says State Department \n                                Official\n\n                            (By Anne Gearan)\n\n       Muscat, Oman.--Iran has sent soldiers to Syria to fight \n     alongside forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and those \n     of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militia, a senior State \n     Department official said Tuesday.\n       An unknown number of Iranians are fighting in Syria, the \n     official said, citing accounts from members of the opposition \n     Free Syrian Army, which is backed by the United States. The \n     official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview a \n     strategy session that Secretary of State John F. Kerry is to \n     hold Wednesday with key supporters of the Syrian opposition.\n       Rebel forces have alleged for weeks that Iran is sending \n     trained fighters to Syria, and the Iran-backed Hezbollah has \n     said baldly that it will not let Assad fall.\n       But with the British, French and American governments \n     considering providing arms to the Syrian opposition on a \n     scale not yet seen in the civil war, the U.S. official's \n     allegation was a tacit acknowledgment that the two-year-old \n     Syrian conflict has become a regional war and a de facto U.S. \n     proxy fight with Iran.\n       ``This is an important thing to note: the direct \n     implication of foreigners fighting on Syrian soil now for the \n     regime,'' the official said.\n\n[[Page S3740]]\n\n       Kerry is in the Middle East this week to foster political \n     talks between Assad's resurgent regime and the embattled \n     rebels and to inaugurate a new round of peace talks between \n     Israel and the Palestinians.\n       The State Department official said the Syrian opposition, \n     which is badly split, has not finalized its representative to \n     the talks in Amman, Jordan, on Wednesday. The Amman session \n     is intended to align strategies ahead of a larger conference \n     in Switzerland that would bring together the Russian- and \n     Iranian-backed Assad regime and the Western-backed rebels.\n       Russia appears to be hedging its bets, as the U.S. official \n     acknowledged Tuesday. Assad's forces are being resupplied \n     from somewhere, the official said, and not all of the \n     armaments can be explained away as part of a continuation of \n     weapons contracts that predate the conflict.\n       Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov agreed two \n     weeks ago to jointly lobby the opposition and Assad's \n     government to sit down for negotiations. The goal would be a \n     transitional government with members chosen by mutual \n     consent. The United States says that would mean Assad's \n     eventual exit; Russia says not necessarily.\n       Kerry stopped in Oman on Tuesday to solidify a partnership \n     with a rare Sunni Arab nation that has friendly relations \n     with both Iran and the United States. He was readying plans \n     with Sultan Qaboos bin Said for Oman's purchase of an \n     estimated $2.1 billion air-defense system. The Raytheon-built \n     system is part of a coordinated, U.S.-led detection and \n     defense network intended to counter Iran's sophisticated \n     missile systems.\n       The State Department official would not say whether Iran \n     was welcome at the Syria conference in Geneva, tentatively \n     set for June.\n       In Washington on Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee passed legislation authorizing President Obama to \n     send weapons to vetted Syrian opposition groups. Although the \n     administration has not decided whether to provide lethal aid \n     and does not need congressional approval to do so, the \n     measure would strengthen Obama's case against those lawmakers \n     who disapprove of stepped-up U.S. involvement in Syria.\n       The bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), \n     the committee chairman, and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the \n     ranking minority member, also creates a $250 million annual \n     transition fund--from reprogrammed, not newly appropriated, \n     money--to help the civilian opposition preserve government \n     institutions and strengthen sanctions against anyone \n     providing arms or selling oil to Assad.\n       Menendez acknowledged concerns that U.S. weapons could fall \n     into the hands of Islamist extremists fighting on the side of \n     the opposition. But, he said, ``if we stand aside and do \n     nothing,'' such worries ``will become self-fulfilling \n     prophecy.''\n       The bill, which passed the committee on a bipartisan 15 to \n     3 vote, still requires approval by the entire Senate and by \n     the House, which has no companion version pending.\n       Karen DeYoung in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I join with 90 Members of the Senate to support this \nresolution. This resolution has extraordinary bipartisan support. The \nSenate will send a clear and unequivocal message to the regime in \nTehran, and that is this: The United States will not allow you to get a \nnuclear weapons capability.\n  The dangers of a nuclear Iran cannot be denied, diminished, or \ndismissed. We must continue to ratchet up the pressure through \nsanctions, as this resolution suggests. At the end of the day, \nsanctions are a means to an end, not an end unto themselves. \nUnfortunately, despite the unprecedented international sanctions that \nhave been put in place, Iran is today closer to a nuclear weapons \ncapacity than ever before, and the facts speak for themselves.\n  In January 2009, according to the IAEA, the Iranians had \napproximately 1,000 kilograms of uranium enriched to 3.5 percent. Today \nthey have more than 8,000 kilograms. In January 2009 Iran had not \nenriched to 20 percent. Today the IAEA reported that Iran has produced \n324 kilograms of 20 percent-enriched uranium. That is 44 kilograms more \nthan 3 months ago. It means they are moving unabated and unhindered \ntoward the development of a nuclear weapon, and they continue to deny \nIAEA inspectors entry into nuclear facilities while the centrifuges \ncontinue to increase dramatically. Just a few hours ago, the IAEA \nissued a report that says Iran has installed close to 700 high-tech \ncentrifuges, which will exponentially increase the speed with which \nIran will be able to enrich uranium.\n  Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability cannot be divorced from \nits other destabilizing actions. The threat from Iran is comprehensive. \nIt includes ongoing threats against Israel and other allied Arab \ngovernments across the region, it includes a decades-long campaign of \nunconventional warfare, and it includes Iran's ongoing role as the No. \n1 state sponsor of terrorism in the world.\n  Let's not forget that Iran has bolstered violent extremist groups \nsuch as Hezbollah and Shiite militias in Iraq who are responsible for \nthe murders of hundreds of young American forces and innocent civilians \nor that senior leaders of the Quds Force were implicated in a terrorist \nplot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the United States on \nU.S. soil.\n  The Iranian regime continues to undertake its full-fledged campaign \nof brutality to keep Bashar al-Asad in power in Syria. Senior Iranian \nofficials are advising and assisting the Syrian military with \nintelligence support and weapons. They have undertaken, together with \nHezbollah, a large-scale training effort of as many as 50,000 \nmilitiamen. As today's Washington Post makes clear, Iranian soldiers \nare fighting on the ground in Syria, supporting the regime as it \nmassacres its civilians.\n  I ask whether this is in America's national security interest.\n  The threat in Iran is more deadly and more serious than any I have \nseen in my lifetime. I don't think this threat will be fully resolved \nuntil a very different set of leaders is in power in Tehran and until \nwe see an Iranian Government that reflects the will of the Iranian \npeople. I am confident that the current regime that rules Iran will not \nlast forever for the simple reason that the Iranian people want the \nsame freedoms and rights as people elsewhere.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from South Carolina Mr. Graham for his \nhard work on this resolution for a change.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I wish to thank Senator McCain for his voice on this \ntopic and any other topic that keeps America safe. I also thank Senator \nMenendez, without whom there would be no resolution. Senator Reid is \nnot here, but I thank him for making the time available to have this \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, is there a division of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 20 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I recognize myself for such time as I may consume.\n  Let me start off by thanking and congratulating my colleague Senator \nGraham for joining with me, for engaging me on this critical question. \nHe knows my concerns about Iran's march toward nuclear weapons, and \ntogether we thought it was an important statement to make. I appreciate \nhis leadership on this issue and bringing us to a point where I think \nwe will have a remarkably strong bipartisan vote today to send a very \nclear message. The message is that we seek full implementation of U.S. \nand international sanctions on Iran and urge the President to continue \nto strengthen enforcement of those sanctions.\n  I cannot emphasize enough my strong concerns about Iran's nuclear \nprogram and the extraordinary threat it poses, yes, to Israel but, very \nimportantly, to the United States of America and to the entire \ninternational community. Iran's provocative actions threaten to not \njust undo regional stability, but they pose an existential threat to \nour ally Israel and clearly a very clear threat to the national \nsecurity of the United States. Iran continues to export terrorist \nactivity directly and through proxies, such as Hezbollah. It continues \nto actively support the Asad regime Syria with fighters, arms, and \npetroleum. It continues its unrelenting drive for nuclear weapons, \nplacing it at the top of our list of national security concerns. In my \nview it remains the paramount national security challenge we face, \ncertainly in the Middle East, if not the world.\n  We are at a crossroads in our Iran policy, and the question today is, \nWhat do we do next? The Obama administration, in concert with the \nCongress, has pursued a dual-track approach of diplomacy and sanctions. \nTwo weeks ago members of the Foreign Relations Committee met with Lady \nAshton, who has led the diplomatic track with the P5+1, along with \nUnder Secretary Sherman. The talks have been central in demonstrating \nto the world that it is\n\n[[Page S3741]]\n\nIran and not the United States that is acting in bad faith and it is \nIran that, through its obstinacy, has helped galvanize the \ninternational community to increase the pressure. But the talks have \nfailed to achieve their central objective, which is getting Iran to \nmake concessions on its nuclear program.\n  It is clear to me that we cannot allow the Iranians to continue to \ndrag their feet by talking, while all the while they grow their nuclear \nprogram. Iran is proceeding at a fast pace. Today, as has been \nmentioned, the International Atomic Energy Agency, in its quarterly \nreport, said that Iran has installed almost 700 advanced IR2m \ncentrifuges at Natanz, an increase of more than 500 centrifuges since \nFebruary of this year. These are centrifuges that can more efficiently \nand more quickly enrich uranium. The IAEA's report also again expressed \nconcern about the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear \nprogram.\n  We cannot allow Iran to buy more time by talking even as the \ncentrifuges keep spinning. There is no doubt and there has never been a \ndoubt--certainly not in my mind--that a nuclear-armed Iran is not an \noption for U.S. national security. That is why I have been fully \ndedicated to doing everything we can to stop Iran from ever crossing \nthat threshold. That is why I introduced, along with Senator Graham, \nthis resolution that makes clear that a nuclear Iran is not an option \nand that the United States has Israel's back. It is why I have come to \nthis floor time after time as an author of some of the toughest \nsanctions that one country has ever levied against another, the \nsanctions against Iran.\n  Working closely with my colleague Senator Kirk and with the Obama \nadministration, we have implemented these sanctions in a way that is \ntruly strangling the Iranian economy. Iran's leaders must understand \nthat unless they change their course, their situation will only get \nworse and economic struggles and international isolation will grow. \nThey must understand that at the end of the day their pursuit of a \nnuclear weapons capability will make them less, not more, secure.\n  I also want to say something about Iran's unacceptable and deplorable \napproach to the State of Israel and its continued threats to the Jewish \nState. As the President has made clear time and again, America's \ncommitment to Israel's security is unshakeable. I share the President's \ncommitment to Israel's security, and I know my colleagues do as well. \nEvery time Iran makes outrageous threats, it only succeeds in further \nuniting the world against it and strengthening America's resolve.\n  I strongly support the close and unprecedented security cooperation \nthat the administration has pursued with Israel, and I know this \ncooperation will only continue. I am deeply committed to doing \neverything I can to ensure that Israel is able to defend itself.\n  While this resolution makes absolutely clear we are not authorizing \nthe use of force, it does also make clear that we have Israel's back \nand, specifically, that if Israel is compelled to take military action \nin self-defense against Iran's nuclear program, we should stand with \nIsrael, using all the tools of our national power to assist Israel in \ndefense of its territory, its people, and its very existence.\n  The bottom line is that Israel should always understand the United \nStates has its back; that we will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear \nweapons capability, and if we are forced to, we will take whatever \nmeans necessary to prevent this outcome.\n  As the President has reiterated on numerous occasions, all options--\nall options--are on the table. That message, along with the solidarity \nof this Chamber, I intend to take with me on my visit to Israel later \nthis week.\n  The simple fact is we need to continue to apply pressure and we must \nbring along the international community in our effort. This has been \nincredibly important, because while we have led, we have had a \nmultiplier effect with the multilateral support of the European Union \nand others so our sanctions can bite, and they have been biting. Iran's \ncrude oil exports have been cut in half, from 2\\1/2\\ million barrels \nper day in 2011 to approximately 1.25 million barrels now per day. Iran \nstill had energy sector exports, however, of $83 billion in 2012, \nincluding $60 billion in oil and another $23 billion in natural gas, \nfuel oil, and condensates. The sanctions are working, but they aren't \nenough, and they aren't working fast enough.\n  In my view, we need to double down on four fronts.\n  First, we need to encourage further reductions in energy sector \npurchases from Iran, including purchases of petroleum, fuel oil, and \ncondensates and prevent Iran from engaging in trade in precious metals \nto circumvent sanctions; second, we need to ensure we have prohibited \ntrade with Iran with respect to all dual-use items that can be used in \nIran's nuclear program. That means adding additional industry sectors \nto the trade prohibition list; third, we need to ask the international \ncommunity to ramp up the pressure and change Teheran's calculus. A \nnuclear Iran, after all, isn't only an American problem; and fourth, \nthe time may have also come to look more seriously at all options and \nthat would include increasing military presence and pressure against \nIran.\n  I believe there still may be time for diplomacy to work, but \nincreased military pressure could signal to the supreme leader a \nnuclear program will undermine the security of his regime, not improve \nit.\n  Fundamentally, the challenge remains a difficult one and we are \nwalking a fine line. But this resolution says to the supreme leader of \nIran that we will not let up, we will continue to apply pressure, and \nthis continued pursuit of nuclear weapons is threatening the very \nexistence of his regime.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Graham-Menendez resolution and \nfull implementation of U.S. international sanctions on Iran. We are \nconsidering other options before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, as well as working with our colleagues on the Senate Banking \nCommittee to make it very clear we will exercise and exhaust all \noptions that are peaceful diplomacy to achieve our ultimate goal.\n  This resolution makes it very clear to the world we stand behind the \nPresident as he stands behind Israel, and it says to Israel: We \ncontinue to be your faithful ally. We recognize you as a clear \ndemocracy in a challenging part of the world, as a major security \npartner of the United States, and the one country most likely to be \nvoting with us in international organizations in common cause with \ncommon values.\n  That is what I think this vote will be about tonight.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time because I do believe I have a \ncolleague who wishes to speak, but I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  There is 8 minutes remaining on the Republican side and 9 minutes \nremaining on the majority side.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. At this time, I yield 2 minutes to my friend from \nMississippi, Senator Wicker, who is a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \nresolution because Iran represents the single largest threat to freedom \nand peace in the Middle East. Our State Department classifies Iran as \nthe most active state sponsor of terrorism, period.\n  A troubling news account from Reuters released just yesterday reveals \na United Nations nuclear agency report due this week is ``expected to \nshow Iran further increasing its capacity to produce material that . . \n. could eventually be put to developing atomic bombs.''\n  The clock is ticking. This is a moment to be resolute. The forceful \nwords we just heard from the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and previously from the distinguished senior \nSenator from Arizona, demonstrate our firm bipartisan position on this \nmatter. The world can ill afford the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran. \nThat is why it is incumbent on the Congress and the President to take \nevery action necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring a weapon of mass \ndestruction. All options must be on the table, as the resolution \nindicates, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.\n  Israel is a nation under siege by terrorist organizations, many of \nwhich are being directly funded by the Iranian regime. The United \nStates must not waiver in its support and obligation to our friends in \nIsrael. I am pleased this resolution reaffirms our commitment to \nIsrael, particularly in the event\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\nIsrael is forced to exercise its sovereign right to defend itself.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a firm stand against nuclear \nproliferation by voting for strengthened sanctions and for the adoption \nof this resolution.\n  I yield back whatever time I may have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor this resolution and to thank our colleagues Senator Graham and \nSenator Menendez for their leadership and to thank them also for giving \nme the privilege of working with them over the last years on this \nvitally important national security issue. It is vital not just to the \nexistence of Israel--it is an existential issue for Israel--but to the \nnational security of the United States.\n  I believe Israel is a crucial ally of the United States and a \nsuccessful democratic state in the Middle East. Recent turmoil in that \nregion adds urgency and importance to ensuring that Israel remains a \nsecure, stable, independent state.\n  This resolution is a reaffirmation of the readiness of the United \nStates of America to assist Israel, our steadfast partner in the \nregion, to thwart any measure of aggression made toward Israel by Iran.\n  It is also a reaffirmation of the policy long supported by this \nbody--by our colleagues here, by all of us in a very personal and \ndirect way--that we have the back of the President of the United States \nin his insisting on strong sanctions against Iran as long as it \ncontinues its development of a nuclear capability.\n  In the coming days, I will be introducing, along with my colleague \nthe senior Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Hoeven, a resolution that \ncalls for free and fair elections in Iran. Regardless of the outcome of \nthese elections--and they are likely to be sham elections--we can't \navoid the sad fact that Iran has maintained its course and commitment \nto nuclear development. The centrifuges are spinning, they are going, \nand more are brought online every day in this breakout for nuclear \ncapacity. So we have to be wary of false signals of hope and remain \nvigilant in our constant effort to secure against Iran faithfully \npursuing nuclear weapons.\n  Fruitless negotiations can't be our reason to call a halt to these \nsanctions. That can come only with compliance--verified compliance. We \nhave to remain vigilant and remember that Iran has threatened to attack \nnot only Israel but the United States. It has substantiated those words \nwith attacks on our troops in Iraq and on American civilians visiting \nor living in Israel.\n  It is Israel who helps diffuse those threats from Hamas and Hezbollah \nand all who have targeted America. If Iran chooses to declare war on \nIsrael, if it ignores the path of peace the international community has \nrepeatedly laid down for it, they must know they do it at their peril.\n  The United States supports our strategic partner Israel, and that is \nwhy I support S. Res. 65, because it demonstrates our full, unyielding, \nunstinting support for Israel if the unthinkable and the avoidable \nhappens.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. At this time, I yield 5 minutes to my good friend from \nTexas, a strong supporter of the United States-Israel relationship, \nSenator Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, back in October 2012, two Iran experts at \nthe Foundation for Defense of Democracies wrote a sobering article \nabout the Iranian nuclear program. They concluded that, despite years \nof international and unilateral sanctions, Iran's economy had been \nallowed to remain healthy enough to leave a vanishingly short period of \ntime for sanctions to do the work that might possibly head off military \naction.\n  Seven months have passed since that article was written, and over \nthat period of time the following things have happened: The Iranians \nhave upgraded their biggest uranium enrichment plant. The head of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency has found credible evidence that \nTehran has secretly been pursuing nuclear weapons technology. The \nUnited States renewed sanction waivers for countries that import \nsubstantial amounts of Iranian oil. President Obama installed a harsh \ncritic of Iran sanctions as his Secretary of Defense. The Iranians have \ncontinued to prop up Syria and its dictator Bashar Asad and transport \ndangerous weapons to Hezbollah as well.\n  In short, the Iranians are feeling emboldened, America's credibility \nis being tested, and time is running out. For these reasons, I am a \nproud cosponsor of S. Res. 65, which would send a clear message we are \ndetermined not just to contain Iran but to prevent the Iranians from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  It would also send a clear message the United States will stand with \nIsrael if our democratic ally is forced to take military action in \nlegitimate self-defense.\n  I would also add that I have joined my colleague from Illinois \nSenator Kirk in introducing a separate bill, the Iran Export Embargo \nAct, which would further expand U.S. sanctions by prohibiting companies \nfrom doing business with any entity that is owned or controlled by the \nGovernment of Iran.\n  More specifically, our bill would prohibit all export-related \ntransactions conducted on behalf of Iranian Government entities, and it \nwould block their assets.\n  One final point. The Iranians are not just waiting to see how we beef \nup sanctions, they are also waiting to see how we respond to Syria's \napparent use of poison gas. After all, President Obama famously warned \nthe Asad regime that deploying chemical weapons would be tantamount to \ncrossing a red line. Yet the White House is walking back its red line \ncomments and issuing retroactive qualifiers.\n  We can be sure the mullahs are taking notes, and we can be sure the \noutcome of the Syrian civil war will help determine the outcome of the \nIranian nuclear crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 65, an \nimportant and timely resolution that restates U.S. policy to prevent \nIran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability and expresses U.S. \nsupport should Israel be compelled to take military action against Iran \nin its own legitimate self-defense.\n  I would like to take this time to thank my colleagues Senator \nMenendez, Senator Graham, Senator Hoeven, and Senator Blumenthal for \njoining forces to introduce this important bipartisan resolution that \nrecognizes and reaffirms the special bonds of friendship and \ncooperation that have existed between the United States and the State \nof Israel for more than six decades.\n  Make no mistake--the diplomatic, security, and economic relationship \nbetween Israel and the United States is stronger than it has ever been, \nand nothing can break that everlasting bond. But let's be completely \nfrank. Right now, our friend Israel faces one of the gravest threats it \nhas confronted in more than a half a century.\n  The Islamic Republic of Iran is dangerously obsessed with the goal of \nacquiring a nuclear weapons capability. And we are getting closer and \ncloser to ``crunch time'' in terms of Iran developing that nuclear \nweapons capability.\n  Time is of the essence, but unfortunately the latest talks between \nthe United States, our international partners, and Iran in Almaty, \nKazakhstan, failed to achieve any progress toward curbing Tehran's \nnuclear ambitions. ``Talks'' about the ``future talks'' are ongoing, \nbut the centrifuges continue to spin in Iran, with more advanced \ncentrifuges on the way.\n  And who can deny the horrific actions of the Iranian regime. From its \nsupport of the vicious Asad regime in Syria, which is spearheading a \nhuman rights catastrophe that has led to the deaths of more than 70,000 \npeople, to its backing of murderous terrorist organizations like Hamas \nand Hezbollah, the Iranian regime is getting more and more dangerous by \nthe day. All the while, Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad continues \nto guide his people down a very perilous path.\n  That is why this bipartisan resolution is so timely. It recognizes \nthe tremendous threat posed to the United States, the West, and Israel \nby Iran's continuing pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability, and it \ndeplores and condemns in the strongest possible terms\n\n[[Page S3743]]\n\nthe reprehensible statements and policies of the leaders of the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran threatening the security and existence of Israel.\n  The United States must do everything we can--as quickly as we can--to \nconvince the Iranian Government that it is in its interest to abandon \nits pursuit of nuclear weapons. This resolution sends a blunt message \nto the Government of Iran the United States will take whatever steps \nare necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons \ncapability.\n  This resolution states that nothing in this text shall be construed \nas an authorization for the use of force or a declaration of war. But \nrest assured, I believe that when it comes to Iran, we should never \ntake the military option off the table. President Obama has stated that \nIsrael is a true friend. And if Israel is attacked, America will stand \nwith Israel. Most importantly, President Obama has said that Iran's \nleaders should understand that he does not have a policy of \ncontainment; rather President Obama has a policy to prevent Iran from \nobtaining a nuclear weapon.'' I take the President at his word, and so \nshould the Government of Iran. But we need to ratchet up the sanctions \nand the pressure on Iran now.\n  And rest assured--Congress has given the President a powerful package \nof economic sanctions that will paralyze the Iranian economy and I am \nconfident we in Congress will do more and this Administration will do \nmore to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this important \nresolution and I look forward to its swift passage.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in advocacy for each of my \ncolleagues to come to the floor this afternoon and vote in support of \nSenate Resolution 65. This vital resolution makes a clear statement to \nIran--both to the current regime and to Iranian citizens who wish for \nreal and true change from the status quo--that the United States will \nnot tolerate its development of a nuclear weapon. Additionally, Senate \nResolution 65 expresses the United States' unconditional support for \nIsrael's right to self-defense against the threat of a nuclear Iran.\n  These vital statements come at a time when change could happen with \nIran's elections next month. But unfortunately, there is little reason \nto believe things will change. According to the State Department, Iran \nremains the most active state sponsor of terrorism. This is a statistic \nthat must be addressed. Iran's continual material and financial support \nto Hezbollah and Hamas, expanding involvement in Syria, and serial \ndeception of its nuclear program are unlikely to be different a month \nfrom now; a year from now; perhaps, a decade from now. Especially as \nIran continues to reject the United Nation's International Atomic \nEnergy Agency's, IAEA, regulatory authority and oversight, the United \nStates must reiterate the plain and simple fact that a nuclear Iran is \nunacceptable.\n  When looking at the bigger picture, the recent terrorist attacks and \nkillings in Boston and Benghazi remind all Americans that our war on \nterrorism continues. Even as troop numbers dwindle in Afghanistan, this \nfight and its core focus are far from over. We must continue to combat \nthe terrorist threat around the world and strengthen our allied \nrelationships as this fight continues. Iran's funneling of weapons and \naid to terrorist cells increases their threat beyond the neighborhood. \nIran is not only a threat to Israel but to the United States as well. \nSenate Resolution 65 reminds us of this fact and of the long and \nimportant strategic relationship our nations have shared, one which has \nbeen built of mutual trust and strengthened through security \ncooperation.\n  I strongly support the United States' determination to prevent Iran \nfrom obtaining a nuclear weapon. I strongly support this resolution as \nit makes our determination unequivocal. All options are on the table.\n  To avoid our option of last resort, armed conflict, it is important \nthat this Congress continue to push for full implementation of \nsanctions against the current regime in Iran to cripple their ability \nto acquire a nuclear weapon. I encourage all of my colleagues to join \nme in advocating for this--not only this administration, but for the \nEuropean Union and democracies around the world to strengthen their \nsanctions on this rogue regime, as Iran's beliefs, rhetoric, and \nactions threaten every nation who calls for democracy and freedom.\n  Of greatest importance, this resolution makes it crystal clear that \nthe United States stands firmly behind Israel and her right to self-\ndefense by pledging full support should Israel take military action \nagainst the threat of Iran's nuclear program. This is not an \nauthorization for use of military force or a declaration of war. \nHowever, it sends the right message to Iran and the rest of the world. \nThe United States stands strong behind our allies. Even in this time of \nnecessary financial restraint, the United States will never leave an \nally to fight alone.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. Res. 65, a \nresolution which sends Israel, Iran, and the region a clear message: We \nstand with our friends in Israel as they face the looming threat of a \nnuclear-capable Iran.\n  I thank Senators Graham and Menendez for submitting this critical \nresolution, which comes as we face a dangerous crossroads in the Middle \nEast.\n  Iran's quest for a nuclear weapons capability is moving closer and \ncloser to fruition. Talks with Iran have yet to achieve the progress \nnecessary to restrain Iran's nuclear ambitions and to compel Iran to \ncomply with the standards and norms expected of members of the world \ncommunity. And while sanctions are having a significant impact on \nIran's economy, they have not yet caused Iran's leaders to alter their \ncourse.\n  Just yesterday, Iran's leaders again showed their uncompromising and \nhard-line stance by excluding viable opposition candidates from their \nupcoming Presidential election.\n  There has been a special bond of friendship and cooperation between \nthe U.S. and the State of Israel for over 60 years, which continues to \nretain broad bipartisan support. We should continue to support and \nexpand the close military, intelligence, and security cooperation \nbetween our two countries.\n  In this context, S. Res. 65 makes three vital points.\n  First, it reiterates that it is U.S. policy to prevent Iran from \nachieving a nuclear weapons capability.\n  Second, it calls for the full implementation of United States and \ninternational sanctions on Iran and urges the President to continue and \nstrengthen enforcement of sanctions legislation, including closing \nloopholes that allow the regime to skirt sanctions.\n  And third, it makes clear the U.S. should stand in support of Israel \nin case Israel is compelled to take military action in self-defense, in \naccordance with U.S. law and Congress's constitutional responsibility \nto authorize the use of force.\n  Now is not the time for America to project any ambiguity concerning \nIran's nuclear program.\n  While we hope that sanctions will ultimately prove successful in \npersuading the regime to halt its nuclear ambitions, we must at the \nsame time make clear to Tehran that we will stand with Israel. Any \nother message will simply encourage the mullahs to believe that Iran \ncan pursue its nuclear ambitions with impunity--and may facilitate \nprecisely the sort of crisis that we all hope to avoid.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with Israel by voting in favor of S. \nRes. 65.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the resolution on Iran that we \nare voting on today, and I hope it sends a strong message to Iran as it \ncontinues to flout the international community in pursuit of a nuclear \nprogram that is a significant challenge to our Nation, our allies, and \nthe world.\n  While a diplomatic arrangement in which Iran rejoins the responsible \ncommunity of nations remains far and away the preferred outcome, there \nis a consensus in that a nuclear-armed Iran is not acceptable and that \nall options--including military options--must remain available to \nprevent such an outcome.\n  However, according to a New York Times report today, Iran is pressing \nahead with the construction of a research reactor that could offer it \nanother way to produce material for a nuclear weapon should it decide \nto do so.\n\n[[Page S3744]]\n\nIf true, this is further evidence that Iran is not interested in a \ndiplomatic solution, but rather in walking up to the line of a nuclear \nweapon capability to fuel an arms race in the region, increase the risk \nof proliferation, and challenge the global community.\n  Over the past 2 years, the National Defense Authorization Act has \nincluded sanctions provisions that have ratcheted up the pressure on \nIran's ability to facilitate and support its illicit network of nuclear \nsuppliers and has made it more difficult for the government of Iran to \nconduct business as usual until Iran changes its course. I will \ncontinue to support additional unilateral and multilateral sanctions \nregimes that further increase the pressure on Iran's economy.\n  I look forward to supporting this resolution today, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank Senator Cornyn and every person who spoke today \nand all the Senators who cosponsored this resolution. I thank Senator \nReid for making the time available. Senator Menendez has been a \nterrific partner, the strongest voice one could hope for in having a \npartner on the Democratic side to stand at a time when it matters.\n  In conclusion, on March 4, 2012, the President, President Obama, said \n``when the chips are down, I have Israel's back.''\n  Mr. President, you were right then. Today the Senate will speak with \none voice echoing what you said.\n  There is a lot of wonderment about what is going to happen with the \nIranian nuclear program. I hope and pray they stop their nuclear \nambitions because they don't want a nuclear reactor, they want a \nnuclear weapon. If they ever get one we will never be safe, Israel will \nbe under the gun for the rest of its existence, and they will share the \ntechnology with the terrorists. Every Sunni Arab state will want a \nnuclear weapon to counter the Shia Persians and all hell will break out \nbeyond what it is today in the Mid-East.\n  How do we prevent that? Sanctions, diplomacy, but the one thing we \ncannot have in doubt is what we would do if Israel had to act in her \nself-defense to stop the nuclear ambitions of an Iranian regime that \nhas promised to wipe the State of Israel off the map.\n  After today, in about 10 or 15 minutes, I believe every Member of the \nSenate will be telling the Iranians we are not going to allow them to \nget a nuclear weapon because if we do, they will throw the world in \nchaos. It will threaten our very existence, as well as the State of \nIsrael, but most important we are going to tell everybody in the Mid-\nEast, throughout the world, in Tehran, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv that if \nthere is a conflict where Israel is justified in defending herself \nagainst a nuclear-capable Iran, we will be there for them. We will have \ntheir back. Where I come from, when we tell somebody, ``I have your \nback,'' that means if they get into a fight for their very life, they \ncan count on us to be there.\n  In this case, Israel can count on the American people, the Senate, \nand our Commander in Chief to be there. If that day ever comes, and I \npray it does not, but if that day ever comes where Israel has to take \nmilitary action, to our friends in Israel: We will be there with you \nevery step of the way, diplomatically, economically, and, yes, \nmilitarily.\n  To the Iranian people: We would love to have a better relationship \nwith you. To the Iranian regime: You are one of the biggest evils on \nthe planet. We will stand up to you. We will stand by our friends. And \nyour desire to throw the world in chaos is never going to happen \nbecause we will be there when necessary to stop your ambitions.\n  To every colleague who has taken time out to sponsor this resolution, \ntaken time out to speak on the floor: Thank you. There is not much we \nagree on 100 percent, but I think today will be a major milestone in \nour efforts to secure Israel and the United States. I think today we \nwill have 100 percent support by the Senate and stand by our friends in \nIsrael and stand up to the thugs in Iran.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from South Carolina \nfor bringing this forward. We have implemented now another set of \nsanctions. There is still some question as to whether sanctions will \nsucceed and bring about the result we want, but I particularly commend \nmy colleague for his statement just a few moments ago relative to the \ncommitment of the United States toward the security, safety and \npreservation of Israel in light of this threat that exists in Iran.\n  For years and years the clock has been ticking as the Iranians pursue \nnuclear weapons capability. We know that for a fact. We need to exert \nevery possible measure that we can to give them reason not to go \nforward and do this. That involves everything from diplomacy to \npressure through multinational organizations, through sanctions and \never-tightening, ever-ratcheting sanctions against them, but also the \ncommitment to use whatever force may be necessary. I, along with my \ncolleague, pray this does not happen. But Iran absolutely has to know \nthat the United States will be standing shoulder to shoulder with the \nnation of Israel. If they level their gun sights at Israel, they are \ngoing to see us in the scope, standing shoulder to shoulder. We are \ncommitted to that. We are committed to doing everything we possibly can \nto prohibit and prevent Iran from achieving this nuclear capability. We \nwill take whatever steps are necessary if they use it--if they gain \nthat and use it for inappropriate purposes or any purposes other than \nproduction of medical devices and products as well as providing nuclear \npower.\n  I trust also that we have a 100-percent vote on this so we send a \nvery strong signal to the Iranians that we will not tolerate them going \nforward with this plan.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, notwithstanding the previous order with \nrespect to S. Res. 65, I ask consent that the committee-reported \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I do not see any other speakers. I yield the remainder of \nthe time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nadoption of S. Res. 65, as amended.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 65), as amended, with its preamble, reads as \nfollows:\n\n                               S. Res. 65\n\n       Whereas, on May 14, 1948, the people of Israel proclaimed \n     the establishment of the sovereign and independent State of \n     Israel;\n       Whereas, on March 28, 1949, the United States Government \n     recognized the establishment of the new State of Israel and \n     established full diplomatic relations;\n       Whereas, since its establishment nearly 65 years ago, the \n     modern State of Israel has rebuilt a nation, forged a new and \n     dynamic democratic society, and created a thriving economic, \n     political, cultural, and intellectual life despite the heavy \n     costs of war, terrorism, and unjustified diplomatic and \n     economic boycotts against the people of Israel;\n       Whereas the people of Israel have established a vibrant, \n     pluralistic, democratic political system, including freedom \n     of speech, association, and religion; a vigorously free \n     press; free, fair, and open elections; the rule of law; a \n     fully independent judiciary; and other democratic principles \n     and practices;\n       Whereas, since the 1979 revolution in Iran, the leaders of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran have repeatedly made threats \n     against the existence of the State of Israel and sponsored \n     acts of terrorism and violence against its citizens;\n       Whereas, on October 27, 2005, President of Iran Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinejad called for a world without America and Zionism;\n       Whereas, in February 2012, Supreme Leader of Iran Ali \n     Khamenei said of Israel, ``The Zionist regime is a true \n     cancer tumor on this region that should be cut off. And it \n     definitely will be cut off.'';\n       Whereas, in August 2012, Supreme Leader Khamenei said of \n     Israel, ``This bogus and fake Zionist outgrowth will \n     disappear off the landscape of geography.'';\n       Whereas, in August 2012, President Ahmadinejad said that \n     ``in the new Middle East . . . there will be no trace of the \n     American presence and the Zionists'';\n       Whereas the Department of State has designated the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 \n     and has characterized the Islamic Republic of Iran as the \n     ``most active state sponsor of terrorism'' in the world;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     provided weapons, training, funding, and direction to \n     terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hizballah, and Shiite \n     militias in Iraq that are responsible for the murder of \n     hundreds of United States service members and innocent \n     civilians;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     provided weapons, training, and funding to the regime of \n     Bashar al Assad that has been used to suppress and murder its \n     own people;\n       Whereas, since at least the late 1980s, the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran has engaged in a sustained and \n     well-documented pattern of illicit and deceptive activities \n     to acquire a nuclear weapons capability;\n       Whereas, since September 2005, the Board of Governors of \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran to be in non-compliance with its \n     safeguards agreement with the IAEA, which Iran is obligated \n     to undertake as a non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at \n     Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into \n     force March 5, 1970 (NPT);\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council has adopted \n     multiple resolutions since 2006 demanding of the Government \n     of the Islamic Republic of Iran its full and sustained \n     suspension of all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing \n     activities and its full cooperation with the IAEA on all \n     outstanding issues related to its nuclear activities, \n     particularly those concerning the possible military \n     dimensions of its nuclear program;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     refused to comply with United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions or to fully cooperate with the IAEA;\n       Whereas, in November 2011, the IAEA Director General issued \n     a report that documented ``serious concerns regarding \n     possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme,'' \n     and affirmed that information available to the IAEA indicates \n     that ``Iran has carried out activities relevant to the \n     development of a nuclear explosive device'' and that some \n     activities may be ongoing;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran stands in violation of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights for denying its \n     citizens basic freedoms, including the freedoms of \n     expression, religion, peaceful assembly and movement, and for \n     flagrantly abusing the rights of minorities and women;\n       Whereas in his State of the Union Address on January 24, \n     2012, President Barack Obama stated, ``Let there be no doubt: \n     America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear \n     weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve \n     that goal.'';\n       Whereas Congress has passed and the President has signed \n     into law legislation imposing significant economic and \n     diplomatic sanctions on Iran to encourage the Government of \n     Iran to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons and end its \n     support for terrorism;\n       Whereas these sanctions, while having significant effect, \n     have yet to persuade Iran to abandon its illicit pursuits and \n     comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       Whereas more stringent enforcement of sanctions \n     legislation, including elements targeting oil exports and \n     access to foreign exchange, could still lead the Government \n     of Iran to change course;\n       Whereas, in his State of the Union Address on February 12, \n     2013, President Obama reiterated, ``The leaders of Iran must \n     recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, \n     because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet \n     their obligations. And we will do what is necessary to \n     prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon.'';\n       Whereas, on March 4, 2012, President Obama stated, ``Iran's \n     leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of \n     containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a \n     nuclear weapon.'';\n       Whereas, on October 22, 2012, President Obama said of Iran, \n     ``The clock is ticking . . . And we're going to make sure \n     that if they do not meet the demands of the international \n     community, then we are going to take all options necessary to \n     make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.'';\n       Whereas, on May 19, 2011, President Obama stated, ``Every \n     state has the right to self-defense, and Israel must be able \n     to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.'';\n       Whereas, on September 21, 2011, President Obama stated, \n     ``America's commitment to Israel's security is unshakeable. \n     Our friendship with Israel is deep and enduring.'';\n       Whereas, on March 4, 2012, President Obama stated, ``And \n     whenever an effort is made to delegitimize the state of \n     Israel, my administration has opposed them. So there should \n     not be a shred of doubt by now: when the chips are down, I \n     have Israel's back.'';\n       Whereas, on October 22, 2012, President Obama stated, \n     ``Israel is a true friend. And if Israel is attacked, America \n     will stand with Israel. I've made that clear throughout my \n     presidency . . . I will stand with Israel if they are \n     attacked.'';\n       Whereas, in December 2012, 74 United States Senators wrote \n     to President Obama ``As you begin your second term as \n     President, we ask you to reiterate your readiness to take \n     military action against Iran if it continues its efforts to \n     acquire a nuclear weapon. In addition, we urge you to work \n     with our European and Middle Eastern allies to demonstrate to \n     the Iranians that a credible and capable multilateral \n     coalition exists that would support a military strike if, in \n     the end, this is unfortunately necessary.''; and\n       Whereas the United States-Israel Enhanced Security \n     Cooperation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-150) stated that it \n     is United States policy to support Israel's inherent right to \n     self-defense: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, my understanding is Senator Shaheen is \ngoing to take the first 30 seconds of 1 minute on behalf of speaking in \nfavor. I don't see her on the floor. I will take the second half.\n  I believe I see her now, so at this time, if she is ready, I yield to \nthe Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  This amendment would address the only program within the farm bill \nthat hasn't been reformed: the Sugar Program. What we have now is a \nsweet deal for sugar growers and a bad deal for consumers.\n  Right now, according to the Department of Commerce, we are losing \nthree jobs in manufacturing for every one job we save in the sugar \ngrower industry. That is not a good deal for job creation in this \ncountry. We need to change it.\n  I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. \nShe is absolutely right. It makes no sense to have a program that \nforces American consumers to pay at least 30 percent more than the \ngoing rate for sugar to force taxpayers to subsidize these producers. \nAlso, we can lose jobs because, as the Senator pointed out, our own \nCommerce Department has found that for every job it saves, three \nmanufacturing jobs are lost. This is a modest amendment that takes us \nback to the 2008 levels.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on our side, let me tell my colleagues \nif they want to preserve jobs, vote against the Shaheen-Toomey \namendment. The U.S. policy on sugar defends more than 142,000 jobs in \n22 States and nearly $20 billion in annual economic activity. Their \namendment is bad policy. The taxpayers do not pay a penny on the Sugar \nProgram. Domestic production is supported by import restrictions which \nhave been used wisely over time, so this amendment would effectively \nkill America's no-cost Sugar Program.\n  Senator Cochran will take the last 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment is being portrayed as a \nreform of sugar policy, but it is far more harmful than that. These \nproposed changes would undermine the policy of our domestic industry by \ntransferring American sugar-producing jobs to other countries. Those \nproducers are less efficient and heavily subsidized.\n  U.S. sugar policy has operated at zero cost to taxpayers for the past \ndecade and has provided American consumers dependable supplies of safe \nhigh-quality sugar at low prices.\n  I urge Senators to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, if it pleases the Chair, I would like to \nsay a few remarks about sugar, but I am not sure about the chairwoman's \nplans.\n  I thank the chairwoman of the committee and the ranking member. I \nknow they are deciding what other amendments we are going to take up \nlater this evening and how the votes will proceed. But let me again \njust thank my colleague from Michigan for her great lead and leadership \non the farm bill.\n  This sugar amendment was very important to the people of Louisiana \nwhom I represent, and I want to just thank my colleagues for their vote \nto keep a program in place that has worked at no cost to the taxpayer--\nno direct cash. It is monitored or organized or designed through an \nimport restriction program that allows for the robust production of \nsugarcane and sugar beets in our Nation.\n  I thank Senator Shaheen for the wonderful way she handled the debate. \nWe have different views about this, but we are colleagues and we work \ntogether very well. There are two sides to this issue. I think the \nevidence on our side is stronger. She would probably disagree. But I \nthank our colleagues for supporting the sugar caucus.\n  In Louisiana, sugarcane is being produced on over 427,000 acres in 22 \nparishes. Production is about 14 million tons, which is about 20 \npercent of the total sugar grown in the United States.\n  Last year, in 2012, Louisiana sugar mills produced 1.6 million tons \nof raw sugar, the largest amount we have ever produced in our State. \nThis production represents a huge part of our State's economy. The loss \nof market for this product would be devastating. Let me say that the \nState of Hawaii, the State of Florida, states such as Minnesota and \nNorth Dakota and South Dakota that have strong sugar beet crops, it is \nvery important for them as well.\n  Are the consumers hurt by this? Absolutely not. The U.S. sugar price \nis 14 percent below the world average, and 24 percent below the average \nfor developed nations. So our policy is a good balance of encouraging \ndomestic production and keeping prices stable and affordable for the \nconsumer.\n  Let me say for candy production--and I have a small amount of candy \nproduced in Louisiana. I am very proud of these companies. American \nfood manufacturers say they are shedding jobs, but in my view this has \nnothing to do with U.S. sugar policy. In fact, U.S. sweetened product \nmanufacturers are prospering and expanding. Candy production is rising, \nnot falling, up by 9 percent since 2004. In addition, sugar represents \njust a tiny portion of the price these food retailers charge for their \nproducts--1 percent of the cost of a cupcake, 2 percent of the cost of \na candy bar, 3 percent of the cost of a carton of ice cream, and 5 \npercent of a bag of hard candy. So I think our arguments won the day. I \nappreciate our colleagues supporting the sugar caucus. We thank you for \nkeeping this bill intact with the balance it needs to move forward so \nwe can have a robust farm agriculture reauthorization bill for this \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as we heard last summer and again \nthroughout this week's debate, government subsidies are at the heart of \nboth our agricultural and nutritional policies here in the United \nStates. Subsidizing food costs in the form of payments for groceries is \nthe core of our supplemental nutrition assistance program. Insurance \npremiums paid by our corn\n\n[[Page S3747]]\n\nand soybean growers are directly subsidized in the farm bill on the \nfloor today. And adverse market payments, what we once called direct \npayments, are available to crops such as peanuts and rice if the price \nfor those commodities fall below a certain threshold. These government \nsubsidies are used all across our country--from Iowa to North and South \nCarolina; and from Missouri down through Kansas, Arkansas, and Texas.\n  Now we have heard from several members from these and other States \nthe many opinions about the validity or usefulness of these subsidies. \nAnd I certainly have my own opinion about how the agricultural policy \nin the United States should be reformed and shaped. However, today, I \nstand to discuss a unique program--our country's Sugar Program. For \nthose of you who are not familiar with the program, it consists of \nthree components--a domestic allocation component, a tariff quota \ncomponent, and a loan component. Now, aside from the loan component, \nuniquely, the Sugar Program in the United States does not require a \ndirect government subsidy. In fact, from 2002 to 2011, the Sugar \nProgram in the United States cost the government zero dollars, a \nglaringly low amount compared to the various other commodity programs \nthat I previously listed.\n  There is a reason for this difference. Our Sugar Program is not an \nagricultural program--it is a trade program. We do not set the price of \nsugar in the United States artificially high by sending taxpayer money \ndirectly to that industry as we do with corn, soybeans, peanuts, or all \nthe other various agricultural commodities here in the United States. \nWe set the price of sugar in the United States by limiting the amount \nof sugar that we import from foreign countries.\n  This distinction cannot be ignored. This distinction creates a \nfundamentally different set of policy decisions for my colleagues here \nin the Senate as we continue this important debate on our Sugar \nProgram.\n  Furthermore, this distinction requires acknowledgement in the sense \nthat it changes our discussion about the Sugar Program here in the \nUnited States from how it impacts our domestic industries to how it \ninteracts with same industries and policies in the international \ncommunity. We cannot support any policy that ignores international \nrealities at the detriment of our own domestic industries.\n  In implementation, and by necessity, this reality means two things: \nOne, in debating the sugar policy here in the United States, because it \nis inherently a trade policy, we must do so with international \nrealities in mind, and No. 2--when viewed through this lens, does any \namendment that would reform this program without consideration of these \ninternational realities make the best sense and, more importantly, set \na positive precedent?\n  I would argue it does not and would offer my colleagues, in the \ncontext of trade, the following facts: The Brazil Government, through \nthe form of direct payments, forgiven loans and pension payments, and \nfuel mandates, subsidized the sugar industry in their country to a tune \nof $2.5 billion last year alone. Brazil controls 50 percent of all the \nworld's sugar exports. To put that into context, Saudi Arabia controls \nonly about 19 percent of the world's oil exports. Countries such as \nChina, Thailand, and India, countries that the United States does not \nhave free-trade agreements with, all subsidize their sugar industries \nin some form. And even in Mexico, the government owns and operates 20 \npercent of the country's sugar industry.\n  These countries, regardless of whether we repeal our sugar program \nhere in the United States, will continue to generously subsidize sugar \nproduction for their own countries. In this context, I would ask my \ncolleagues to seriously question the appropriateness, the benefits, and \nmore importantly the risks to American jobs, if reforms to our Sugar \nProgram were to pass without any link to the overall international \ndialogue. The 142,000 jobs and the $20 billion annually that our \ndomestic industry provides to our economy would be at risk while at no \npoint in our discussion have we accounted for the protectionist \npolicies that exist for the sugar industry in other countries all \naround the world.\n  To be clear, I am not arguing that, as a country, we need to be trade \nprotectionists. To the contrary, I think our country will excel in the \n21st century only if we eliminate barriers to trade and increase the \nflow of goods all around the world. But what I am saying is that if we \nare going to eliminate a trade program, let us do it in the context of \na trade debate. Otherwise, we will lose jobs, industries, and overall \nleverage to other countries without even bringing them to the table to \nnegotiate. I would argue it would be more appropriate to address reform \nof our Sugar Program in the context of international trade.\n  Very simply, we should repeal our entire Sugar Program if the largest \nsugar-producing countries in the world eliminated their own trade \nprotectionist policies as well. We must ensure that we do not negotiate \nagainst ourselves in this international context by eliminating a \nprogram important to an industry in our country that is unfortunately \nforced to deal with these international realities. And I encourage my \ncolleagues to consider the precedent they would set for their own \nindustries in their own States when they consider the various \namendments offered in this debate introduced to reform our Sugar \nProgram. We must put this debate in the proper context while at the \nsame time acknowledging the benefits of free trade to the United States \nand to citizens in countries all across the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I am here to talk about the importance \nof a bipartisan, commonsense, 5-year farm bill to Indiana's agriculture \nand rural communities as well as our entire country.\n  This bill, passed with bipartisan support in the Agriculture \nCommittee, protects the estimated 16 million agriculture-related jobs \nacross the country. Last year, Indiana and many other States were \nplagued by severe drought, leading to a loss of crops and livestock, \nhurting our food supply and the livelihoods of farmers and their \ncommunities. Farmers in Indiana and around the Nation need the \ncertainty of a 5-year farm bill that reflects and addresses the \ninherent risk of feeding and fueling our world. The Agriculture Reform, \nFood, and Jobs Act of 2013 strikes the right balance, ending direct \npayments and improving risk management tools to give farmers what they \nneed to manage natural disasters or severe market downturns that are \ncompletely outside of their control.\n  In this budget environment, where we are looking for ways to cut \nspending and make government more efficient, it is important to note \nthis bill would reduce the deficit by $23 billion. We made the tough \ndecisions necessary to cut spending, increase accountability, and \neliminate duplicative or unnecessary programs to continue our efforts \nto get our fiscal house in order.\n  In my home State of Indiana, this bill is critical. Nearly 190,000 \nHoosiers work in agriculture. Eighty-three percent of the State's land \nis devoted to farms or forests. Agriculture contributed nearly $38 \nbillion to Indiana's economy in 2011. Clearly, the certainty of a 5-\nyear farm bill is important not only for the producers in our State but \nto the entire State's economy and overall well-being.\n  While no bill is perfect, there are a few areas of this bill I worked \nto improve based on feedback from Hoosiers. During the Agriculture \nCommittee debate, I introduced an amendment with Senator Roberts that \nwould give the next generation of bio-energy crops access to base \nlevels of risk management so a reasonable safety net will be in place \nfor energy crops. This bipartisan amendment, passed as part of the \noverall bill, would amend the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance \nProgram to offer coverage for crops producing feedstock for energy \npurposes.\n  Further, the amendment would direct USDA to research and develop risk \nmanagement tools for promising new sorghum crops. I support the many \nIndiana farmers who have and continue to contribute to our domestic \nenergy security. Also, during the committee discussion, I helped \nintroduce an amendment that would put the USDA, not the OMB, in charge \nof conservation program technical assistance funding levels. This gives \nUSDA the authority to make sure that technical assistance\n\n[[Page S3748]]\n\nreflects the needs of producers in the field and the stakeholder \ncommunity, while allowing conservation practices to be adopted on a \nbroader scale. We need robust technical assistance to give producers \nthe assurances they need to know they are implementing practices \ncorrectly. These decisions should be made more reflective of needs on \nthe ground.\n  Further, I have continued my efforts from the 2008 farm bill to \nensure that there are not restrictions on Hoosier farmers who want to \ngrow fruits and vegetables. After a successful Farm Flex pilot program, \nI worked to expand full planting flexibility for farmers in Indiana and \nacross the country wanting to grow what they want to grow on their own \nfarms.\n  Finally, I am proud to cosponsor an amendment with Senator Grassley. \nWe should pass this amendment. It protects livestock and poultry \nfarmers from having their personal information released by the EPA. It \nis outrageous that earlier this year the EPA released the personal \ncontact information of over 80,000 livestock and poultry owners from \nacross the Nation, including many from Indiana. This blatant violation \nof privacy must not happen again. I hope my colleagues will support the \nGrassley-Donnelly amendment when it comes up for a vote.\n  Put simply, this farm bill makes sense. It is an example of \nRepublicans and Democrats working together to do good things for the \nAmerican economy and America's people. I look forward to working with \nour colleagues in the House on a farm bill that we can get signed into \nlaw. No one is going to get 100 percent of what they want, but it is \n100 percent necessary to get this farm bill done. I urge prompt passage \nof this bill by the Senate and for our colleagues in the House to do \nthe same.\n  Farmers in Indiana and across our great Nation deserve more than \npartisan political gridlock that prevented a 5-year bill last year. \nThis year we need to get it done.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Startup Act\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Thank you very much.\n  I want to tell a story. It goes back to the summer of 2011. Back at \nthat point in time, we had 30 straight months of unemployment above 8 \npercent. I decided it was important to work on legislation to jumpstart \nthe economy and to work in every way possible with my colleagues to put \nAmericans back to work.\n  With a foundation of compelling data showing that nearly all of the \nnew net jobs created since 1980 had been created by companies less than \n5 years old, Senator Warner and I introduced the Startup Act in \nDecember of 2011. The Startup Act was a jobs bill written to help \nentrepreneurs who have been responsible for most of the job creation in \nour country over the last 30 years.\n  The legislation made changes to the Federal regulatory process so \nthat the cost of new regulations did not outweigh the benefits and \nencouraged Federal agencies to consider the impact of proposed \nregulations on startups, particularly.\n  Our bill made commonsense changes to the Tax Code to encourage \ninvestment in startups and reward patient capital. The Startup Act also \nsought to improve the process of commercializing federally funded \nresearch so that more good ideas out of the laboratories were put into \nmarket where these innovations could be turned into jobs by companies \nand spur economic growth.\n  Finally, the Startup Act provided new opportunities for highly \neducated and entrepreneurial immigrants to stay in the United States \nwhere their talent and new job ideas could fuel economic growth and \ncreate American jobs.\n  When I began work on the Startup Act, I did not intend to write an \nimmigration bill. My goal was simple: Find the most cost-effective way \nto jumpstart the economy and create American jobs. After reviewing the \nacademic and economic data, it became clear that these strategies to \ncreate American jobs must include highly skilled and entrepreneurial \nimmigrants. Immigrants to the United States have a long history of \ncreating business in our country. We can all think of examples of \nindividuals who have done so: Sergey Brin cofounded Google; Elon Must \ncofounded PayPal, SolarCity, SpaceX, and Tesla; Min Kao founded Garmin \nin my home State of Kansas. There is a long list of people from other \ncountries who created businesses here in the United States that now \nemploy thousands and thousands and thousands of Kansans and Americans. \nOf the current Fortune 500 companies, more than 40 percent were founded \nby first-or second-generation Americans. Immigrants are now more than \ntwice as likely as native-born Americans to start a business. In 2011, \nimmigrants were responsible for more than one in every four U.S. \nbusinesses founded.\n  Today, one in every 10 Americans employed at privately owned U.S. \ncompanies works at an immigrant-owned firm. The immigration bill \ndrafted by eight of our colleagues and reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee recognizes the importance of entrepreneurial immigrants. The \nlegislation creates new visas for immigrant entrepreneurs and awards \npoints for the merit-based visa for successful entrepreneurship. Yet \nthis bill could be improved significantly to reflect more accurately \nhow new businesses grow and hire workers.\n  Done right, an entrepreneur's visa has the potential to create \nhundreds of thousands of needed jobs for Americans. Now in its third \nversion, Startup 3.0 creates an entrepreneur's visa for foreign-born \nentrepreneurs currently in the United States. Those individuals with a \ngood idea, with capital and a willingness to hire Americans, would be \nable to stay in the United States and grow their businesses. Each \nimmigrant entrepreneur would be required to create jobs for Americans.\n  In many instances our country already has made a commitment to these \nentrepreneurs, allowing them to study in our universities and work \ntemporarily at American companies. Providing a way for immigrant \nentrepreneurs to stay in the United States and create American jobs \nmakes economic sense.\n  Earlier this year the Kauffman Foundation studied the economic impact \nof immigrant visas in the entrepreneur's visa in Startup 3.0. Using \nconservative estimates, the Kauffman Foundation predicts that the \nentrepreneur's visa could generate 500,000 to 1.6 million jobs over the \nnext 10 years. These are real jobs with real economic impact that could \naffect real American families and boost our GDP by 1.5 percent or more, \na 1.5-percent increase in our gross domestic product by this provision \nof the legislation alone.\n  Anticipating floor consideration of the immigration bill, I have been \nspeaking with entrepreneurs, investors, and startup policy experts to \ndevelop an amendment that would improve the legislation. In my view, we \nhave an opportunity to create jobs for Americans by making certain \nhighly skilled and entrepreneurial immigrants are able to start a new \nbusiness and contribute to the growth of American companies. If we miss \nthis opportunity, we risk losing the next generation of great \nentrepreneurs and the jobs they will create. I will offer an amendment \nto the immigration bill to accomplish these goals and hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting the changes to the legislation \nthat would result in the creation of jobs for Americans.\n  While it is important to provide a straightforward and workable way \nfor entrepreneurial immigrants to stay in the United States so they can \nemploy Americans, we also need to make sure the immigration bill \naddresses the needs of growing American businesses.\n  The current problem is twofold. American schools are not producing \nenough students with the skills our economy demands. While American \nuniversities do a great job of attracting foreign students to study \nadvanced subjects, few pathways exist for these talented graduates to \nremain in the United States and contribute to American prosperity.\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\n  One reason for this problem is our Nation's high schools have fallen \nbehind in STEM education--science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics. Forty percent of high school seniors test at or below \nbasic levels in math. Fifty percent of our high school seniors test at \nor below basic levels in science. By 12th grade only 16 percent of \nstudents are both math proficient and interested in a STEM career, and \nfewer than 15 percent of high school graduates have enough math and \nscience to pursue scientific or technical degrees in college. It is no \nwonder that by the time American students go to college few are \nchoosing to major in a STEM area subject. According to the National \nScience Foundation, college students majoring in non-STEM fields \noutnumber their math and science-minded counterparts 5 to 1.\n  Moreover, the growth rate of new STEM majors remains among the \nslowest in any category. Unfortunately, research shows that this gap \ncontinues to widen at a time when the number of job openings requiring \nSTEM degrees is increasing at three times the rate of the rest of the \njob market. The number of students pursuing math, science, and \nengineering is declining. The demand for the jobs is increasing. Should \nthis trend continue, American businesses are projected to need an \nestimated 800,000 workers with advanced STEM degrees by 2018, about 4 \nyears away, but will only find 550,000 American graduates with those \ndegrees they need.\n  How do we solve this problem and prepare America for the future? \nFirst and foremost, we need to do more to prepare Americans for careers \nin STEM fields. This will take time, but our efforts to improve STEM \nwill yield positive results across the economy, even for those without \nSTEM skills.\n  Second, as we work to equip Americans with the skills for the 21st \ncentury economy, we also need to create a pathway for highly educated \nforeign students to stay in America where their ideas and talents can \nfuel economic growth.\n  Startup 3.0, the legislation Senator Warner and I have introduced, \naddresses this immediate need by creating STEM visas. Foreign students \nwho graduate from an American university with a master's or a Ph.D. in \nscience, technology, engineering, or mathematics would be granted \nconditional status contingent upon them filling a needed gap in the \nU.S. workforce. By working for 5 consecutive years in a STEM field, the \nimmigrant would be granted a green card with the option of becoming an \nAmerican citizen.\n  The immigration bill we will soon consider attempts to address the \nimmediate needs for more qualified STEM workers and the longer term \nneed for Americans to develop the skills needed to fill those jobs. I \nam hopeful these aspects of this bill will be strengthened in order to \nprovide growing American businesses with the skilled employees they \nneed now and in the future. If growing American companies are unable to \nhire qualified workers they need, these businesses will open locations \noverseas.\n  I was in Silicon Valley last year, and executives at Facebook told me \nthey were ready to hire close to 80 foreign-born but United States-\neducated individuals, when their visas were denied. Rather than forgo \nhiring these skilled workers, the company hired them anyway, but they \nplaced them in a location in Dublin, Ireland, instead of the United \nStates. Facebook was ultimately able to get the visas for these workers \nafter training them in Ireland.\n  All too often companies end up housing these jobs permanently \noverseas. When this happens, it is not only those specific jobs we lose \nbut also the many supporting jobs and economic activity associated with \nthem. Even more damaging, more damning to me than the loss of those \nhighly skilled workers who are now working in some other country, the \nend result is that someone among that group will start another company \nsuch as Google, be an entrepreneur, and start another company that \ncreates jobs, but not in the United States--in Canada or in Dublin, \nIreland. The United States loses both employment today and an \nopportunity for American jobs to be created in the future because our \nimmigration policies failed to help our country retain highly educated \nand skilled individuals.\n  To me, this story and many others like it illustrate the importance \nof getting the policy right. Creating workable ways to retain highly \nskilled, American-educated workers and entrepreneurs is about creating \njobs for Americans and growing our Nation's economy.\n  The United States is in a global battle for talent. If we fail to \nimprove our immigration system, one that currently tells these \nentrepreneurs and highly skilled individuals we don't want you, they \nwill take their intellect and skills to another country and create jobs \nand opportunities there.\n\n  Some of my colleagues may think I am exaggerating what is at stake, \nbut this week Canada's Immigration Minister was in Silicon Valley \nrecruiting entrepreneurs and promoting Canada's new startup visas. They \nhave billboards in California encouraging those STEM-educated \nindividuals to move to Canada where they have an immigration policy \nbeneficial to them and their jobs. This Minister's message was simple: \nThe United States immigration system is broken, so bring your startups \nto Canada, where we will get you permanent residency and the \nopportunity to build your business. Canada put up billboards along \nHighway 101 between Silicon Valley and San Francisco enticing \nentrepreneurs to ``pivot to Canada.''\n  In fact, six other countries besides Canada in the short time I have \nbeen a Member of the Senate have changed their laws and policies to \nencourage these individuals to find jobs and create businesses in their \ncountries. We have done nothing. For the sake of our country and the \nmillions of Americans looking for work, we cannot afford to lose \ntalented entrepreneurs.\n  As the Senate begins debate of the immigration bill in the near \nfuture, I encourage my colleagues to keep in mind the other 11 million, \nthose 11.7 million American workers who are looking for work and the \nmany others who have become so discouraged they have given up.\n  The United States is the birthplace and home of the American dream. \nFor years our country has been seen as the land of opportunity for \ninnovators and entrepreneurs. We must do everything possible to make \ncertain that remains true in the face of growing competition. When the \nimmigration bill comes to the Senate floor, I will offer amendments to \nimprove the bill and encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting \ncommonsense changes that will allow the United States to win the global \nbattle for talent. Doing so will make certain that immigrant \nentrepreneurs have a home in the United States. In their pursuit of the \nAmerican dream, they will create jobs for Americans and strengthen the \nAmerican economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 965\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President I call up amendment No. 965 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will be very brief, as I spoke on this \nissue before. Here is the story, using my own State of Vermont as an \nexample, but it exists all over the country. This year the Vermont \nHouse of Representatives passed a bill by a vote of 99 to 42 requiring \nthat genetically engineered food be labeled.\n  Yesterday, as I understand it, the Connecticut State Senate, by an \noverwhelming vote of 35 to 1, also passed legislation to require \nlabeling of genetically engineered food. In California this issue was \non the ballot. Monsanto and the other biotech companies spent something \nlike $47 million against the right of people of California to have \nlabeling on GMO products, and they won. The people who support labeling \ngot 47 percent of the vote despite a huge amount of money being spent \nagainst them.\n  In the State of Washington, over 300,000 people have signed petitions \nin support of an initiative there to label genetically engineered food \nin that State.\n  A poll done earlier this year indicated that some 82 percent of the \nAmerican people believe labeling should take place with regard to \ngenetically engineered ingredients.\n  This is a pretty simple issue, and the issue is do the American \npeople have a right to know what they are eating, what is in the food \nthey are ingesting and what their kids are eating.\n  The problem is that a number of States, including Vermont, have gone \nforward on this issue. They have been met with large biotech companies \nlike Monsanto who say if you go forward, we are going to sue you. And \nit will be a very costly lawsuit, because we do not believe you have \nthe right as a State to go forward in this direction because you are \npreempting a Federal prerogative.\n  I happen not to believe that is correct. What this amendment does is \nvery simple. It basically says States that choose to go forward on this \nissue do have the right. It is not condemning GMOs or anything else. It \nis simply saying that States have the right to go forward.\n  There have been some arguments against this amendment, and let me \nbriefly touch on them. Genetically engineered food labels will not \nincrease costs to shoppers, as we all know. Companies change their \nlabels every day. They market their products differently. Adding a \nlabel does not change this. Everybody looks at labels. They change all \nthe time. This would simply be an addition, new information on that \nlabel. In fact, many products already voluntarily label their food as \nGMO-free.\n  Further, genetically engineered crops are not better for the \nenvironment. Some will say, well, this is good for the environment. The \nuse of Monsanto Roundup-ready soybeans engineered to withstand exposure \nto the herbicide Roundup has caused the spread of Roundup-resistant \nweeds which now infest 22 States, 10 million acres in 22 States, with \npredictions for 40 million acres or more by mid-decade. Resistant weeds \nincrease the use of herbicides and the use of older and more toxic \nherbicides.\n  Further, there are no international agreements that permit the \nmandatory identification of foods produced through genetic engineering.\n  As I mentioned earlier, throughout Europe and in dozens of other \ncountries around the world, this exists. It is not a very radical \nconcept. It exists throughout the European Union and I believe, very \nsimply, that States in this country should be able to go forward in \nlabeling genetically modified foods if they want, and this amendment \nsimply makes it clear they have the right to do that.\n  I look forward to the support of my colleagues with that amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Let me say, for purposes of the Members, now that we \nhave completed our official voting for today, I want to thank everyone \nfor all of their hard work and the staff for all of their hard work. It \nis a continuing pleasure to work with my ranking member Senator \nCochran. We are in the process of securing a time for a vote, hopefully \nin the morning, and then we have a number of votes tomorrow.\n\n  We are on a path to getting this done. With the cooperation of the \nMembers, we are hopeful we will have a number of votes tomorrow and be \nable to complete this very important bill.\n  I would just remind colleagues that 16 million people work in this \ncountry because of agriculture. It is probably the biggest jobs bill \nthat will come before this body, and we are very grateful for \neveryone's patience and willingness to work with us to bring this bill \nto completion.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairwoman of \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry for her great \nwork in bringing a bill to the floor today that does a lot of justice \nfor families in Connecticut and across the country who are fighting \nevery single day to put food on the table for their loved ones.\n  The fact is, although people have an impression that our State is a \nwealthy one, we have a handful of the poorest cities in the country, \nand we have tens of thousands of people who have been ravaged by this \neconomy. These nutrition programs funded in the underlying bill are an \nabsolute lifeline for families who have been, largely temporarily, hit \nstraight across the brow by this devastating recession.\n  In Connecticut, though, for some people who don't know our State, it \nis hard to imagine that 11 percent of the population is today receiving \nSNAP benefits. One out of every ten people--one out of every ten \nfamilies in Connecticut--right now relies on food stamps to either pay \nfor their food in whole or in part. That is over 400,000 people in \nConnecticut.\n\n[[Page S3751]]\n\n  These are people such as the 87-year-old retiree from Southbury, CT, \nwho lives in a small, very reasonable condo. She lives on about $1,100 \na month. She has gone through a $100,000 home equity line of credit, \nbut her condo fees and her electric bill--because she lives in a little \ncondo that is heated by electricity alone--basically eat up the \nentirety of her budget. She couldn't eat without foods stamps. She \ncouldn't eat without these benefits. They keep her alive, as they do \nfor millions of seniors all across this country.\n  On the other end of the age spectrum is another Southbury resident. \nSouthbury, frankly--Connecticut, in general--doesn't have a reputation \nas being a town in need, but they have hundreds of SNAP recipients, \njust as in every town across Connecticut. Mrs. Smith is an unemployed \nmother. She made a six-figure salary for decades. When her husband \nbecame disabled, she was the sole breadwinner for her family. The \nrecession hit her, just as it has hit hundreds of thousands of others \nacross the country, and she lost her job. It is now the $300 she gets \nper month in SNAP benefits that allows her to feed her kids.\n  She is out there doing everything we ask. She is looking for a job. \nShe is trying to get back to work, but she has lost her unemployment \nbenefits. They have been exhausted, and now she needs this money in \norder to live.\n  The fact is 61 percent of all SNAP participants are families with \nchildren, and 33 percent of all SNAP recipients are families with \nelderly or disabled members in their families. These are the most \nvulnerable in our country, and they need a strong SNAP program in this \nbill.\n  I am one of a handful of Senators who cast a vote yesterday to add \nsome money back, but the fact is the real comparison is not the \ndifference between the underlying bill and that amendment. The real \ncomparison is between the bill we are debating now and the budget \npending before the House of Representatives today.\n  The House Republican budget would absolutely devastate, eviscerate, \nobliterate the Food Stamp Program--basically rescinding this Nation's \nlongstanding commitment to making sure kids have enough to eat when \ntheir families are out of work or have hit hard times.\n  One of the reasons Republicans in the House in particular have come \nso hard, so consistently against foods stamps is because they \ncategorize it as an overly generous handout to people who don't need \nit. Well, this week I am testing that theory. This week, because we are \ndebating this bill on the floor of the Senate, I decided to see what it \nwould be like to live on the average food stamp benefit for people in \nmy State of Connecticut.\n  That average benefit in Connecticut is about $4.80 a day. I am \nfinding out--now 3 days into this--even on this budget for just a week, \nit is pretty hard to eat enough to just not be hungry, never mind \neating healthy foods. I went to the grocery store to buy some fruit and \nvegetables for the week and could barely find anything that fit within \nthat budget. I was able to buy some bananas for 69 cents a pound. I \nwanted to get some peanut butter, but the only kind of peanut butter I \ncould get was the kind loaded with preservatives because the stuff that \nis better for you costs a lot more.\n  Over and over again, people who are right now on food stamps are \ngoing hungry, never mind the kind of hunger they would be confronted \nwith if we further cut this program. They have to make choices every \nday when feeding their kids: Do I give them enough calories so they \nwill go without hunger pains for the day or do I try to get them a \nsmaller amount of food that is maybe a bit better for them? That is \nwhat these families have to think about every single day.\n  I am not suggesting doing this budget for a week allows me to walk \nmore than a few steps in their shoes, but it is an education on how \nlittle one gets out of this benefit today, and it is a caution for this \nbody to stand up to the House of Representatives, if the farm bill gets \nto conference, to make sure these cuts don't get any worse.\n  The stories of the senior citizen and the unemployed mother in \nSouthbury, CT, are two of millions of stories all across this country. \nThese are people who have paid their dues, who are playing by the \nrules, but who just need a little help from us in a bad economy. By no \nmeans is this program an overly luxurious handout.\n  Let me tell you, from a very brief anecdotal experience, it is pretty \nhard to go without hunger on $4.80 a day, never mind trying to provide \na healthy meal for your kids.\n  I just wanted to come to the floor this evening and applaud the \nefforts of our colleagues who are trying to push through a bill that \nwill get to conference so we can be in a strong position to defend the \nnutrition titles of this bill which are keeping people--kids, the \ndisabled, and the elderly--alive today.\n  There are those of us who would have liked to have seen even more \nsupport in this bill for nutrition programs. We failed in that attempt \nearlier this week, but we are united in the fact that a farm bill that \ncomes out of the House and the Senate and goes to the President's desk \nhas to keep the promise we have made to generations of kids across this \ncountry--we are going to make sure you have enough to eat.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on \nThursday, May 23, following the cloture vote on the Srinivasan \nnomination, and notwithstanding cloture having been invoked, if \ninvoked, the Senate resume legislative session and consideration of S. \n954; further, that the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the \npending Sanders amendment No. 965; that there be no second-degree \namendments to the Sanders amendment prior to the vote; that the \namendment be subject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold; finally, that \nthe time consumed during consideration of S. 954 count postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to discuss my amendment regarding \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's release of farmers' information. \nBy now, many of my colleagues have heard about the Environmental \nProtection Agency's release of individual personal information to \nenvironmental activists.\n  This should not have happened. The EPA released information on over \n80,000 farmers nationwide, and over 9,000 Iowans. I can't even \ncharacterize some of these Iowans as livestock producers; many of them \nare simply hobby farmers. There is a person on the list who has 12 \nhorses; another gentleman on the list has one pig.\n  It is downright absurd that EPA would collect this kind of \ninformation and then hand it over to environmental activists. Given \nwhat we have seen recently with the egregious actions by the Internal \nRevenue Service, we should all be outraged by the continuing pattern of \noverreach by this administration.\n  This whole situation just doesn't pass the commonsense test. We have \nseen acts of eco-terrorism in the past against farmers. Farmers \nshouldn't have to fear their personal information being released to \ngroups who may want to use the information to harass or terrorize \nfamily farmers. This amendment would restrict EPA's ability to release \nsuch data.\n  Since EPA can't put an end to this reckless behavior, then Congress \nneeds to step in and fix the problem for EPA. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss amendment No. \n945, which was accepted by the Senate yesterday via unanimous consent. \nThis is an important amendment, and I would like to thank the chairman \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Stabenow, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Cochran, for their willingness to work with me to see \nthat this amendment was accepted.\n  My amendment will help farmers in Alabama and many other States \nbenefit from Federal agricultural irrigation programs. Expanding \nirrigation can help protect against drought and can dramatically \nincrease agricultural production, which is why I supported\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\nthe creation of the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program, AWEP, \nseveral years ago.\n  AWEP, which receives approximately $60 million annually, is a \n``voluntary conservation initiative that provides financial and \ntechnical assistance to agricultural producers to implement \nagricultural water enhancement activities on agricultural land to \nconserve surface and ground water and improve water quality,'' \naccording to the USDA. AWEP assists farmers with the use of upland \nwater storage ponds, irrigation system improvements, water quality \nimprovement, and other similar efforts. It is a good program. According \nto ALFA--the association representing Alabama's farmers:\n  Since 2009, the AWEP Initiative has made available over $3.5 million \nto benefit the local economy. In Alabama, 102 farmers have improved \nefficiency in their irrigation operations which resulted in savings of \nabout 875 million gallons of water per year.\n  However, USDA currently limits access to AWEP to farms that have been \nirrigated previously a requirement that prevents most Alabama farmers \nfrom being eligible for this useful program. Farmers are often required \nto show past irrigation records, irrigation water management plan \ndocumentation, or a map showing farm acres with irrigation history. \nThis prior history requirement prevents some worthwhile agricultural \nwater enhancement projects from being eligible for AWEP assistance, \nparticularly in States where irrigation has not been significantly \nused. According to data in the 2007 USDA Agriculture Census, many farm \nacres throughout the country do not have a history of agricultural \nirrigation. This is especially true in my State. According to ALFA, \n``only about 5% of Alabama's farms have irrigated cropland,'' and this \nprior history requirement ``has prevented the program from being more \nwidely utilized'' in Alabama.\n  My amendment No. 945, which was accepted, as modified, by unanimous \nagreement in the Senate yesterday, eliminates this unwarranted \nrestriction and will help ensure that more farmers are eligible for \nUSDA irrigation assistance programs. I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember for their work in modifying my amendment to ensure that this \nclarification of law only applies ``in states where irrigation has not \nbeen used significantly for agricultural purposes, as determined by the \nSecretary.'' As a State with relatively little agricultural irrigation \nin present use, Alabama and other similarly-situated States are clearly \ncovered by the relief provided by my amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3752-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President, I rise to honor Adam Scott, a former member \nof the University of Nevada, Las Vegas golf team, and the first \nAustralian to win the Masters Tournament.\n  Through his determination and will to win, Adam was able to come back \nfrom a heartbreaking loss at the 2012 Open Championship to win the 2013 \nMasters in truly stunning fashion. In a tie for the lead heading into \nthe 72nd hole, Adam birdied with a 20-foot putt. At that point, I \nthought Adam had clinched the title, but another great golfer, Angel \nCabrera, was able to force a playoff with his own birdie. It was not \nuntil the second hole of that playoff that Adam, through yet another \nbirdie, was able to call himself the Master's champion. This was his \nninth PGA Tour win, but first major championship.\n  Adam hails from Adelaide, Australia, later moving to Queensland at \nthe age of 9. In 1998, Adam came to my home State of Nevada to study \nand play golf at UNLV. While at UNLV, Adam was an All-American, \nfinishing 11th at the 1999 NCAA Golf Championships. His victory at the \nMasters was the first major championship to be won by a former UNLV \nmen's golfer.\n  UNLV's golf program has produced a lot of great players over the \nyears, but until now, none had ever won a major championship. There \nhave been several second-place and third-place showings, but never a \nchampion. As a Nevadan, it is amazing to see a former UNLV player \nwearing the famous Augusta National Gold Club's green jacket.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I congratulate Adam Scott on his victory at \nthe Masters Tournament and look forward to continuing to follow a \ncareer that has already made Australia and the University of Nevada, \nLas Vegas very proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3752-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the men and women \nof our Armed Forces who have given their lives in defense of the United \nStates. Memorial Day has, since its inception in the years immediately \nafter the end of the Civil War, been a special time for us to remember \nand honor all Americans who have died in military service. Nearly 150 \nyears after the first ``Decoration Day'' was observed, it remains \nimportant that we as citizens of this great Nation take time to reflect \non the brave servicemen and women who made the ultimate sacrifice on \nour behalf.\n  As I have noted, Memorial Day grew out of a practice started in April \n1866 in Columbus, MS, with the decoration of the graves of Confederate \nand Union soldiers alike. The tradition of honoring both those who fell \non both sides of that conflict evolved into our modern observance of \nthis sacred day.\n  Today, tens of thousands of American men and women continue to put \ntheir lives on the line to preserve and perpetuate the freedoms and \nliberties established with the birth of our Nation. The freedoms we \nenjoy in this country have often been paid for with the lives of these \nservicemembers. Their selfless example of service, whether made at \nBunker Hill, Vicksburg, Iwo Jima, Inchon or the remotest regions of \nAfghanistan, inspires us to sacrifice and work for the good of our \nNation.\n  This Memorial Day, Mississippians will again honor all brave fallen \nwarriors, including the men and women from our State who have recently \ndied in the service of our nation in Afghanistan and around the world.\n  For the Record, I offer the names of three brave heroes with roots in \nMississippi, who have fallen since the nation commemorated Memorial Day \nlast year. They are:\n\n       SSG Ricardo Seija, 31, of Tampa, FL, who died July 9, 2012\n       SFC Coater B. DeBose, 55, of State Line, MS, died Aug. 19, \n     2012\n       Specialist Patricia L. Horne, 20, of Greenwood, MS, died \n     Aug. 24, 2012\n\n  We mourn their loss and honor them for their courage, dedication and \nsacrifice, and resolve that their lives were not given in vain.\n  This Memorial Day, the people of my State and throughout our great \nNation will rightly set aside their day-to-day tasks to remember and \nsay a prayer of thanksgiving for those who have laid down their lives \nfor their country. We will also think of their families who share most \nacutely in their loss. I join them in saying thank you to those who \nmade these great sacrifices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3752-4", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3752-S3753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RICHARD BENDER\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, when Richard Bender retires at the end of \nthis month, the Senate will say farewell to one of its most respected, \ntalented, and accomplished staff members. And I personally will be \nsaying farewell to my longest serving legislative counselor.\n  They say that there are no indispensable people here in Washington. \nDon't believe it. For the last three and a half decades, Rich Bender \nhas been my indispensable person--a staffer with an encyclopedic \nknowledge of parliamentary procedure, the legislative process, the \nFederal budget, as well as the rules and traditions of this body.\n  I am by no means the only Senator who has found Richard \nindispensable. In fact, he is a legend among Senators and staffers \nalike. Many times, the distinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, has \ncome to me with some version of this request: Tom, I am having trouble \nwith this bill. Opponents are raising all kinds of legislative and \nparliamentary hurdles. Have Bender give me a call. And, by the way, \nLeader\n\n[[Page S3753]]\n\nReid asking you for advice on parliamentary procedure is about like \nWynton Marsalis asking you for advice on how he can play the trumpet \nbetter.\n  In my Senate office, Richard has managed a broad portfolio, including \nbudget and taxes, infrastructure, economic development, and a good \nshare of appropriations. He has completed more than 37 years in public \nservice in Congress, beginning in 1975 as a special assistant to Iowa \nSenator John Culver. In 1977, when I was still in the House of \nRepresentatives, he came to work in my congressional office in Ames, \nwhere he met his future wife, Laura Forman. Richard moved to my \nWashington office in 1980. He has been with me, now, for three and a \nhalf decades, making him the longest serving Harkin staffer on record.\n  Richard often says, with pride, that he is the guy in the office who \nhandles asphalt and cement. What those two items translate into are new \nroads and bridges, revitalized downtowns, economic development, jobs \nand opportunity. Cities across Iowa, from Dubuque to downtown Des \nMoines and across to western Iowa, all bear abundant evidence of \nRichard's excellent work over the decades.\n  I have never encountered a staffer who can match Richard's mastery of \nthe appropriations process--not just the know-how and know-who of \nappropriations, but even more importantly the tenacity and persistence \nrequired to advance specific projects over the course of many years and \nsometimes for more than a decade.\n  I don't know how many times folks in Iowa have thanked me for things \nthat Richard played a huge role in getting done. Let me name just a few \nof them.\n  He deserves special credit for his many contributions to making \ndowntown Des Moines the attractive, economically vibrant urban \nlandscape it is today, including the downtown loop on the Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., Parkway, as well as projects like Riverpoint and the Science \nCenter, all of which have spurred development on the south side of \ntown. He played a similar role in assisting the revitalization of \nDubuque by securing funds for the brilliant development of the city's \nMississippi waterfront.\n  Richard is fond of describing roads, rivers, and canals as the \n``arteries and veins of commerce,'' and he has been devoted to securing \nrobust investments in essential infrastructure projects all across \nIowa. I would mention, for example, Federal funding for the Des Moines \nto Burlington four-lane highway, and Highway 61 improvement in eastern \nIowa.\n  Twice during Richard's tenure in my office, he has played a critical \nrole in helping Iowa to recover from catastrophic floods. Following the \ndevastating weather and flooding in 1993, he helped to secure major \nFederal funding to help Iowa cities, towns, and farms to recover. \nLikewise, after the once-in-a-century flood of 2008, Richard dedicated \nhimself to securing resources to help Cedar Rapids, Iowa City, and many \nother communities to rebuild better than ever.\n  Let me mention several other achievements:\n  Richard played a key role in defeating a 1994 appropriations \namendment that would have severely damaged ethanol's expansion in the \nU.S. gasoline market. The vote on the motion to table was 50 to 50, \nwith the Vice President casting the deciding ``aye'' vote.\n  He secured vital funding for airport expansion and upgrading in Des \nMoines and at other Iowa airports.\n  Richard played the key role in securing nearly one-half billion \ndollars to upgrade USDA's National Animal Disease Center at Ames.\n  He obtained Federal funds for the High Trestle Bridge over the Des \nMoines River on the recreational trail between Ankeny and Woodward.\n  Earlier this year, he successfully persuaded the Army Corps of \nEngineers to keep the lower Mississippi River open for navigation \nduring a time of persistently low water.\n  Thanks to Richard's dogged efforts, we were able to secure funding \nfor the new Federal courthouse in Cedar Rapids.\n  These accomplishments are Richard Bender's living legacy.\n  And no recounting of Richard's legacy in Iowa would be complete \nwithout mentioning his central role in devising and implementing the \nmodern Iowa caucuses system. In 1971, Richard was working as a staffer \nfor the Iowa Democratic Party, which was seeking a way to increase the \nactive involvement of rank-and-file members in choosing our party's \nPresidential candidate. The party also needed a timely and effective \nway of reporting voting results. Richard's creativity, as well as his \ntraining in mathematics and statistics, made him the key player in \ndeveloping the Iowa Democratic Party caucuses. Today, the caucuses are \nlittle changed from what he developed four decades ago.\n  Richard Bender is the quintessential selfless public servant. For \nhim, it is never about personal gain or glory; it is about serving \nothers. Nobody works harder. Nobody puts in longer hours. And nobody \nproduces more consistent results than Richard.\n  Indeed, I also add a debt of gratitude to Richard's wonderful wife, \nLaura, and his beloved son, Michael. They, too, have sacrificed as \nRichard has spent such long hours both in the office and working at \nhome on weekends and in the evening. Lots of people, when they retire, \nsay that they are looking forward to spending much more time with their \nfamily. Richard really means it. I know that he has big plans for Laura \nand Michael, including travel, in the years ahead.\n  It is difficult to find words that do justice to how profoundly \ngrateful I am to Richard for his wise counsel and loyal service on my \nstaff over the last three and a half decades. In addition, on behalf of \nmy colleagues here in the Senate as well as in the House, so many of \nwhom have also benefited from his counsel, I want to thank him for his \nexceptional service to the Congress and the American people.\n  Richard, I am deeply grateful to you for a job extraordinarily well \ndone. I join with the entire Senate family in wishing you, Laura, and \nMichael much happiness in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3753-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3753-S3755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRESSIONAL BADGES OF BRAVERY\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor six outstanding \nmembers of the U.S. Marshals Service--Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal \nPatrick James and Deputy U.S. Marshals Theodore Abegg, Travis Franke, \nNicholas Garrett, Jeremy Wyatt, and John Perry--who played an \ninstrumental role in the March 8, 2011, apprehension of a fugitive in \nSt. Louis, MO, an incident that claimed the life of Deputy U.S. Marshal \nJohn Perry and resulted in the wounding of Deputy U.S. Marshal Theodore \nAbegg, as well as St. Louis Police Officer Jeff Helbling.\n  I commend the heroic service and incredible sacrifice of all these \nmarshals, four of whom are from my home State of Missouri: Supervisory \nDeputy U.S. Marshal Patrick James and Deputy U.S. Marshals Theodore \nAbegg, Travis Franke, and Nicholas Garrett. Deputy U.S. Marshal Jeremy \nWyatt and fallen Deputy U.S. Marshal John Perry hail from Illinois. \nLast week, my colleague Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois joined me at an \nawards ceremony in St. Louis to honor these distinguished U.S. \nmarshals.\n  Before I talk about the bravery these law enforcement officials \ndemonstrated in the line of duty, I need to mention the tremendous \nservice the U.S. Marshals Service provides to the people of this \ncountry every day. As the Nation's oldest Federal law enforcement \nagency, the U.S. Marshals Service plays several crucial roles, \nincluding protecting Federal judges, operating the Witness Security \nProgram, seizing illegally obtained assets from criminals, and \napprehending Federal fugitives--a function which led to its cooperation \nwith the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department and the formation of \nthe U.S. Marshals Service Fugitive Task Force in St. Louis. Since the \nMarshals Service's inception in 1789, over 200 federal marshals, deputy \nmarshals, special deputy marshals, and marshals guards have lost their \nlives in the line of duty. When the U.S. Marshals Service's steadfast \ndevotion to crime prevention and mitigation is considered alongside its \ntraditional witness protection and judicial security duties, the law \nenforcement officials of this agency truly exemplify the values of \n``Justice, Integrity, Service.''\n  From my days as a prosecutor, I know how critically important the \nU.S.\n\n[[Page S3754]]\n\nMarshals Service is to the Federal justice system and the impact these \nofficials have in communities across Missouri. These highly trained men \nand women help form the backbone of our legal system, and I salute the \ncountless acts of bravery performed by Federal law enforcement officers \nacross Missouri and this Nation.\n  On March 8, 2011, members of the U.S. Marshals Service Fugitive Task \nForce, which included St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department \nofficers, engaged in an effort to apprehend a dangerous fugitive in St. \nLouis. In approaching the fugitive's residence, the officers and \ndeputies, discovering there were two children at the home, safely \nremoved them and entered the home behind a ballistic shield. Team \nLeader Deputy John Perry provided cover for Deputy Garrett, who used \nthe shield to approach the second floor location of the fugitive. While \nascending a stairwell, the officers and deputies were fired upon by the \nfugitive. Both Deputy John Perry and St. Louis Police Officer Jeff \nHelbling were wounded in the initial exchange of gunfire. While other \ntask force members engaged the fugitive, Supervisory Deputy James \nprompted Officer Anna Kimble to alert supporting officers of the \nshooting over the radio system.\n  With two task force members injured, Deputies Abegg and Franke \nentered the home, and Supervisory Deputy James authorized Deputy Abegg \nto launch a rescue operation to secure Deputy Perry. Using ballistic \nshields, Deputies Abegg and Garrett, followed closely by Deputies \nFranke, Wyatt, and Supervisory Deputy James, entered the residence in \norder to retrieve the wounded marshal. In the course of the rescue \nattempt, Deputy Abegg was wounded in the leg. Deputy U.S. Marshal \nMelissa Duffy administered first aid to Officer Helbling, and Deputy \nU.S. Marshal Shawn Jackson provided protective cover, allowing wounded \nDeputy U.S. Marshal Abegg to withdraw. In the end, task force team \nmembers subdued the fugitive, although, tragically, Deputy Perry's \nwounds later proved fatal.\n  The sincere dedication of these marshals to duty and their strong \nsense of justice are an inspiration to the American people. Marshals \nlike these place themselves in harm's way every day, forsaking the \nsafety many of us take for granted. They and their families make \nprecious sacrifices so that we, the American public, may enjoy the \nfreedom to live our lives to an extent made possible by the knowledge \nthat someone stands watchful and ready on our behalf.\n  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Supervisory \nDeputy U.S. Marshal Patrick James and Deputy U.S. Marshals Theodore \nAbegg, Travis Franke, Nicholas Garrett, Jeremy Wyatt, and John Perry \nfor their distinguished service to the people of this country.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week was National Police Week, and \nlast Wednesday was National Peace Officers Memorial Day. On Monday, May \n13, 2013, I joined my colleague, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, \nat a ceremony in St. Louis to honor six brave deputy U.S. marshals who \nwere awarded the Federal Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of \nBravery.\n  Fewer than two dozen of these badges have been awarded since Congress \ncreated them 2 years ago. In fact, these six deputy marshals honored in \nSt. Louis are the first law enforcement officers from either Missouri \nor Illinois to receive the Congressional Badge of Bravery.\n  Two of the six men are from my State of Illinois. Deputy U.S. Marshal \nJohn Brookman Perry lived in Edwardsville; Jeremy Wyatt is from Granite \nCity.\n  On March 8, 2011, they and four other deputy U.S. marshals, Theodore \nAbegg, Travis Franke, Nicholas Garrett, Supervisory Deputy Marshal \nPatrick James, joined members of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police \nDepartment to arrest a dangerous fugitive in south St. Louis. The \nofficers knew there could be trouble that day when they went to serve \nthe arrest warrant. The man they were looking for had a long criminal \nhistory and a record that included assaults on law enforcement \nofficers. But they went anyway because that is their job: bringing in \nthe bad guys so that others can feel safer walking down the street.\n  Deputy Perry was team leader for the Federal marshals. Tragically, \nthough, he never made it home. He was killed and Deputy Marshal Abegg \nwas wounded in a shootout with the man they went to arrest. His story \ndeserves to be told, so that everyone can know the sort of man and law \nenforcement officer he was.\n  John Perry grew up in Glen Ellyn in northern Illinois. He had public \nservice in his blood. His grandfather was the son of an Alabama coal \nminer who went on to be a Federal district judge in northern Illinois. \nHis father was an administrative law judge. He earned a bachelor's \ndegree in earth science and a master's degree in environmental science \nfrom SIU. But he wanted to work in law enforcement. He spent 16 years \nas a probation officer in Madison County, IL before joining the U.S. \nMarshals Service in 2001. The Federal marshals who worked with him said \nthere was no one better when it came to tracking dangerous felons and \nbringing them in.\n  John was a great marshal, but apparently he had a little trouble with \nthe ``good cop/bad cop'' style of interrogation. At his memorial \nservice, one speaker recalled how, after what was supposed to have been \na hard-core interrogation, the suspect emerged and told John's partner: \n``Your partner is the nicest guy in the world.'' Just imagine what the \nworld would be like if the worst thing people could say about us was, \n``Sometimes he's too nice.''\n  One of his last gifts to his community was that he was an organ \ndonor. After he died, his heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, and kidneys \nwere donated to people who would have died without them, along with \nskin and bone tissue to help as many as 100 more people. His spirit--\nand his commitment to duty--lives on in those people. It lives on in \nhis friends and family, especially his three children. It lives on in \nthe countless law enforcement officers whose back he watched and with \nwhom he shared his professional knowledge and bad jokes. And it \ncontinues to be exemplified every day by his fellow deputy marshals who \nsuccessfully apprehended their suspect on that fateful March day.\n  John Perry didn't lose his life. He laid down his life to keep his \nfellow officers and our communities safe.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Deputy U.S. Marshals \nJohn Perry, Jeremy Wyatt, Theodore Abegg, Travis Franke, Nicholas \nGarrett, and Supervisory Deputy U.S Marshal Patrick James. They and all \nthe law enforcement officers who risk their lives to protect ours \ndeserve our respect and gratitude this week and every week.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I also wish honor three St. Louis \nMetropolitan Police Detectives who played an instrumental role in the \nMarch 8, 2011, apprehension of a fugitive in St. Louis, MO, an incident \nthat claimed the life of Deputy U.S. Marshal John Perry and resulted in \nthe wounding of Deputy U.S. Marshal Theodore, Ted, Abegg, as well as \nSt. Louis Police Officer Jeff Helbling. Before I talk about the heroic \nservice and incredible sacrifice of these three officers, I have to \nmention the tremendous service the St. Louis Metropolitan Police \nDepartment provides to the people of St. Louis every day. As the \nprincipal law enforcement agency serving the City of St. Louis, the St. \nLouis Metropolitan Police Department, in addition to its routine \nfunctions, provides a variety of specialized services, including acting \nas a liaison with the U.S. Marshals Service Fugitive Task Force. Since \nits inception in 1836, over 160 St. Louis police officers have lost \ntheir lives in the line of duty. When the St. Louis Metropolitan Police \nDepartment's steadfast dedication to community involvement is \nconsidered alongside its traditional crime prevention and mitigation \nduties, the officers of this department truly exemplify the mission \n``To Protect and Serve.''\n  I know how valuable police officers and other first responders are to \ncommunities across Missouri. While I was Jackson County prosecutor, I \nwitnessed firsthand the essential skills and hands-on training needed \nto keep our neighborhoods safe from crime. I know that our first \nresponders form the backbone of our communities, and I salute the \ncountless acts of bravery performed by law enforcement officers across \nMissouri.\n  On March 8, 2011, members of the U.S. Marshals Service Fugitive Task\n\n[[Page S3755]]\n\nForce, which included St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department \nofficers, engaged in an effort to apprehend a dangerous fugitive in St. \nLouis. In approaching the fugitive's residence, the officers and \ndeputies, discovering there were two children at the home, safely \nremoved them and entered the home behind a ballistic shield. Upon \nentering the home and ascending a stairwell, the officers and deputies \nwere fired upon by the fugitive. Both Deputy U.S. Marshal John Perry \nand St. Louis Police Officer Jeff Helbling were wounded in the initial \nexchange of gunfire. Tragically, Deputy Perry's wounds later proved \nfatal. While other task force members engaged the fugitive, Officer \nAnna Kimble alerted supporting officers of the shooting over the radio \nsystem and Officer Joe Kuster provided perimeter security. A rescue \nattempt was mounted by the U.S. Marshals, during which another deputy \nU.S. Marshal was wounded. In the course of the rescue attempt, the \nfugitive was subdued by task force team members.\n  I am proud these three officers hail from my home State of Missouri. \nTheir sincere dedication to duty and endless compassion for the \nresidents of the city they serve are an inspiration to the people of \nSt. Louis. First responders like these place themselves in harm's way \nevery day, forsaking the safety many of us take for granted. They and \ntheir families make precious sacrifices so that we, the American \npublic, may enjoy the freedom to live our lives to an extent made \npossible by the knowledge that someone stands watchful and ready on our \nbehalf.\n  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring St. Louis \nMetropolitan Police Department Detectives Jeff Helbling, Anna Kimble, \nand Joe Kuster for their distinguished service to the people of St. \nLouis. I thank them, and I thank all of you for joining me in \nrecognizing these outstanding Missourians.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I wish to honor two deputy U.S. marshals who \nplayed an instrumental role in the March 8, 2011, apprehension of a \nfugitive in St. Louis, MO, an incident that claimed the life of Deputy \nU.S. Marshal John Perry and resulted in the wounding of Deputy U.S. \nMarshal Theodore ``Ted'' Abegg, as well as St. Louis Police Officer \nJeff Helbling. Before I talk about the heroic service and incredible \nsacrifice of these two deputies, I have to mention the tremendous \nservice the U.S. Marshals Service provides to the people of this \ncountry every day. As the Nation's oldest Federal law enforcement \nagency, the U.S. Marshals Service provides a variety of crucial \nservices, including protecting Federal judges, operating the Witness \nSecurity Program, seizing illegally obtained assets from criminals, and \napprehending Federal fugitives--a function which led to its cooperation \nwith the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department and the formation of \nthe U.S. Marshals Service Fugitive Task Force in St. Louis. Since its \ninception in 1789, over 200 Federal marshals, deputy marshals, special \ndeputy marshals, and marshals guards have lost their lives in the line \nof duty. When the U.S. Marshals Service's steadfast devotion to crime \nprevention and mitigation is considered alongside its traditional \nwitness protection and judicial security duties, the law enforcement \nofficials of this agency truly exemplify the values of ``Justice, \nIntegrity, Service.''\n  I know how critically important the Marshals Service is to the \nFederal justice system and the impact these officials have in \ncommunities across Missouri. These highly trained men and women help \nform the backbone of our legal system, and I salute the countless acts \nof bravery performed by Federal law enforcement officers across \nMissouri and this Nation.\n  On March 8, 2011, members of the U.S. Marshals Service Fugitive Task \nForce, which included St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department \nofficers, engaged in an effort to apprehend a dangerous fugitive in St. \nLouis. In approaching the fugitive's residence, the officers and \ndeputies, discovering there were two children at the home, safely \nremoved them and entered the home behind a ballistic shield. Upon \nentering the home and ascending a stairwell, the officers and deputies \nwere fired upon by the fugitive. Both Deputy U.S. Marshal John Perry \nand St. Louis Police Officer Jeff Helbling were wounded in the initial \nexchange of gunfire. Tragically, Deputy Perry's wounds later proved \nfatal. While other task force members engaged the fugitive, Officer \nAnna Kimble alerted supporting officers of the shooting over the radio \nsystem, Deputy U.S. Marshal Melissa Duffy administered first aid to \nOfficer Helbling, and Deputy U.S. Marshal Shawn Jackson provided \nprotective cover allowing wounded Deputy U.S. Marshal Abegg to \nwithdraw. A rescue attempt was mounted by the U.S. marshals, during \nwhich another deputy U.S. marshal was wounded. In the course of the \nrescue attempt, the fugitive was subdued by task force team members.\n  I am proud these two deputies are based in my home State of Missouri. \nTheir sincere dedication to duty and strong sense of justice are an \ninspiration to the American people. Marshals like these place \nthemselves in harm's way every day, forsaking the safety many of us \ntake for granted. They and their families make precious sacrifices so \nthat we, the American public, may enjoy the freedom to live our lives \nto an extent made possible by the knowledge that someone stands \nwatchful and ready on our behalf.\n  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Deputy U.S. \nMarshals Melissa Duffy and Shawn Jackson for their distinguished \nservice to the people of this country. I thank them, and I thank all of \nyou for joining me in recognizing these outstanding individuals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3755-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING JIM McCUSKER, JR.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Jim was an inspiring \nleader and model of public service, and I am grateful for our \nfriendship. My heart goes out to Jim's wife, Judy, and their children \nand grandchildren, whom he loved tremendously. Countless friends, \ntouched by his generosity and big heart, will also miss him deeply.\n  Jim will be remembered always for his lifelong dedication to the town \nand people of Clinton. As first selectman, he expertly managed the town \nbudget and contributed tremendously in energy and spirit. He had a \nmagnetic gift of connecting with his community and neighbors.\n  In addition to his leadership as first selectman, Jim spent more than \na decade on both the Clinton Board of Finance and the Clinton Board of \nSelectmen. He was also involved with the Clinton Education Federation, \nFamilies Helping Families, Meals on Wheels, and St. Mary's Knights of \nColumbus.\n  In tribute to Jim's service to his country as a United States Marine, \nflags were hung at half staff. He was always there to give a smile and \nengage in earnest conversation. Jim loved to sing Irish songs on St. \nPatrick's Day. As a patriot and veteran, he will be particularly missed \nthis Memorial Day. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and \nhonoring Jim McCusker's long-time, selfless service. Although missed, \nhe will not be forgotten. Jim's sense of humor, warmth with others, and \ndedication to country will be felt throughout Clinton for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3755-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3755-S3756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REMEMBERING LANCE CORPORAL LAWRENCE R.

Philippon of West \nHartford, CT, who gave his life 8 years ago this May while supporting \nOperation Iraqi Freedom as a courageous member of the United States \nMarines. In the Marine Corps color guard, Lance Corporal Philippon \ncarried the flag at the funeral for President Reagan, but yearned to be \non the front lines. It was there, as a brave member of the 3rd \nBattalion, 2nd Marine Division, 2nd Marine expeditionary force that he \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for his country.\n  As Memorial Day nears, we dedicate ourselves in gratitude to our \nheroes--our servicemen and women, both recent and throughout history--\nwho have sacrificed and served for our freedom, protecting the founding \nprinciples we hold dear.\n  This special poem was written by Albert Carey Caswell, a longtime \nmember\n\n[[Page S3756]]\n\nof the Capitol Guide Service, and prolific poet whose work has been \nrecited many times on the Senate floor. It is a privilege to present \nBert's touching piece, written in memory of Lance Corporal Philippon. I \ninvite my colleagues to remember and honor Lance Corporal Philippon and \nall current and former members of the military, and their families, \ntoday and always.\n\n\n                            This Is My Blood\n\n     This . . .\n     This Is My Blood,\n     that I so bled!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     And this is my life,\n     that I so led!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     And these are all of the moments,\n     which I no longer so have!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     As for you,\n     I so gave up all that I had!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     That Last Full Measure,\n     My Life . . .\n     The Greatest of All Treasures,\n     that one so has!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     And I'm so very sorry Sister and Brother,\n     My Dearest Mother and Dad!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     And I know that you all so miss me,\n     and so want to be with me so very bad!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     And I know that it make's you all so very sad!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     And these,\n     are all of your tears that you now so weep,\n     that you so have!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     All because your baby boy . . .\n     your son, your most precious joy . . .\n     your bother this one,\n     has so died hurting you all so very bad!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     All because,\n     in warm arms holding each other again we'll never have!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     But, find comfort . . .\n     Because,\n     one day up in Heaven we will all be together so very glad!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     For no Parent,\n     no Sister, nor Brother of another . . .\n     should so have to so watch their loved ones being buried in \n           the ground!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     And these are,\n     the Sons and Daughters that I shall never so see!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     And this is the Wife,\n     that I'll never so grow old with so happy to be!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     But take heart,\n     for all that I've given up . . .\n     Heaven so awaits all so for me!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     So wipe away all of those tears now so very deep!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     Moments are all that we all so have!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     To Make A Difference!\n     To Change The World!\n     To March Off So Very Boldly,\n     With But Our Flags So Unfurled!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     So very proud,\n     wearing those most magnificent shades of green,\n     to so show the world what the word honor all so means!\n     ALLELUIA!\n     And to be One of The Few,\n     Hoo Rahhhh . . .

Mr. President, today I wish to honor William Lee \nRich, a career Navy man. Bill, on behalf of all Montanans and all \nAmericans, I stand to say thank you for your service to this Nation.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Bill Rich's service in the U.S. \nNavy, because no story of heroism should ever fall through the cracks.\n  Bill was born in Jamestown, NY, in 1947. After moving around the \ncountry with his family, he graduated from Spring Valley High School in \nNew York and enlisted with the U.S. Navy in Poughkeepsie in 1966.\n  Bill trained with the Seabees in Davisville, RI, before transferring \nto Mobile Construction Battalion 121 at Seabee Headquarters in \nGulfport, MS. From there he was deployed to Phu Bai with MCB 121, just \nsouth of Hue City in Vietnam. While in Vietnam, Bill's unit was \nresponsible for transporting South Vietnamese refugees out of Hue.\n  In February 1968, his unit saw heavy action during the Tet Counter \nOffensive. They were responsible for transporting a group of South \nVietnamese out of Hue to the refuge center at Phu Bai. It was for their \ntime in Hue that the MCB 121 received the Presidential Unit Citation. \nBill also earned his Combat Action Ribbon.\n  Bill's deployment ended after 9 months, and his unit returned to \nGulfport, MS before going back to Vietnam, this time to Camp Eagle in \nthe Gia Lai Province. During his 8 months at Camp Eagle, Bill worked on \nvarious construction and electrical projects, both around the camp and \nin Hue. He also worked with the American-Vietnamese Civic Action \nProgram to help construct engineering projects in the region.\n  After his two tours in Vietnam, Bill transferred to Naval Reserve \nConstruction Battalion 19 for 4 years before returning to Active Duty.\n  Back with the Seabees, Bill was assigned to Italy and New Zealand \nbefore spending a year in Antarctica as part of Operation Deep Freeze. \nHe was then assigned to Harold E. Holt station in Australia where he \nmarried his wife, Debby, a Helena native.\n  From Australia, Bill went to Winter Harbor, ME, and then to MCB 74 in \nGulfport. He deployed from Gulfport to Japan and Puerto Rico. From \nbattalion he went to Manama, Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf as a contract \ninspector.\n  From Bahrain, Bill went to the Naval Headquarters in London, England, \nfor 4 years where his daughter Mariah was born.\n  Bill's last assignment was part of a five-man Active-Duty staff for \nReserve Construction Battalion 13 at Camp Smith, Peekskill, NY. Before \nhe retired, Bill received both the New York State Conspicuous Service \nCross and the Long and Faithful Service Medal.\n  Upon his retirement, he received both the Navy and Army Achievement \nMedals. Bill retired with the rank of E-6, construction electrician \nfirst class.\n  Bill transferred to Fleet Reserve and retired after a 30-year naval \ncareer.\n  Petty Officer Bill Rich moved to Helena to start his new life with \nhis wife and daughter. He currently works for the State of Montana \nDepartment of Military Affairs here at Fort Harrison as an electrician.\n  After his service, Bill never received all of the medals he earned \nfrom the Navy.\n  Earlier this month, in the presence of his friends and family, it was \nmy honor to finally present to Bill his Vietnam Campaign Medal with \n1960 Device,\n\n[[Page S3757]]\n\nNavy Expert Rifle Medal with Three Bronze Stars, Navy Expert Pistol \nMedal, Humanitarian Service Medal, and his Navy & Marine Corps Overseas \nService Ribbon with One Silver and Four Bronze Stars.\n  It was also my honor to present the Antarctica Service Medal with \nBronze Clasp, the Vietnam Service Medal with One Silver and Two Bronze \nStars, the Navy Good Conduct Medal with Four Bronze Stars, the Naval \nReserve Meritorious Service Medal, and the National Defense Service \nMedal with One Bronze Star.\n  Earlier this month I also presented to Bill the Combat Action Ribbon, \nPresidential Unit Citation, Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon with one \nBronze Star, and the Meritorious Unit Commendation with One Bronze \nStar.\n  These decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of \ntrue heroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3757-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:46 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 982.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KING (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1007. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include \nbiomass heating appliances for tax credits available for energy-\nefficient building property and energy property; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise today in support of energy \ninnovation, energy independence, national security, and local \neconomies.\n  The legislation I am introducing, the Biomass Thermal Utilization Act \nof 2013--known as the BTU Act--would give tax parity to biomass heating \nsystems under sections 25d and 48 of the Internal Revenue Code and \nwould help to encourage a very promising industry.\n  By adding biomass heating systems to the eligible renewable \ntechnologies for residential and commercial tax credits, we can help \nmake clean, home-grown heating more cost effective for hard-working \nAmericans.\n  By way of example, Maine has the highest home heating oil dependence \nof any State in the country--and nearly 80 cents of every $1 spent on \nheating oil goes out of State. Much of this money also leaves the \ncountry and goes to nations that are less than friendly with the U.S. \nYet we have plenty of renewable heating sources here at home.\n  In Maine, wood pellet boilers are the most widely used biomass \nheating systems. Wood pellet boilers run on trees grown in the State, \ncut by local loggers, processed into pellets in local mills, then \npurchased and used to heat local homes. Nearly every single heating \ndollar stays within the local economy. This supports good-paying jobs, \nworking, productive forests, and it helps move the country toward \nenergy independence.\n  We are not talking about traditional woodstoves here. These are \nhighly innovative, clean-burning systems that are simple to run. They \ncan even be integrated with your smart phone so you can turn the heat \nup on your way home from work.\n  In addition, thermal biomass systems--particularly wood pellet \nboilers--have very small carbon footprints. New trees are planted to \nreplace the trees processed into pellets. These new trees capture the \ncarbon released by the pellets. Compared to fossil fuels, such as home \nheating oil, this yields an extremely small carbon footprint.\n  I am excited to offer this legislation and to be joined by Senator \nCollins.\n  This bill could greatly benefit any State with a strong forestry \nindustry but also States with industries that turn agricultural waste \nand nonfood stock plants into thermal biomass fuels. I look forward to \nworking with colleagues from around the country to level the playing \nfield for the biomass industry.\n  Let us work together to keep our energy dollars here at home and \ncreate jobs in our backyard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 1013. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, to add \nprocedural requirements for patent infringement suits; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1013\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce sports-related concussions in youth, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as parents, we can see the scrapes \nand cuts our children get--the unavoidable byproducts of growing up. A \nlittle bit of ointment and some bandages usually do the trick. But what \nof the injuries we can't see? The ones we can't readily tell, no matter \nhow well we know our kids.\n  Each year, as many as 3.8 million Americans suffer sports- and \nrecreation-related brain injuries. Some are horrific, deadly, and \nvisible to the naked eye. But the vast majority are concussions caused \nby an awkward hit, a freak fall, or a routine blow to the head on the \nfield. They cannot be seen, but the damage is there in the very place \nthat houses our minds and for our children their future.\n  Most susceptible are our young athletes, whose bodies and brains are \nstill growing, with each concussion increasing the likelihood of \nsuffering yet another. This past school year alone, more than 300,000 \nof our high school athletes were diagnosed with concussions. Since \n2005, over 1.3 million concussions have been diagnosed among high \nschool athletes in just the top nine most common sports. However, \nresearchers say these figures likely underestimate--vastly--the true \nextent of the epidemic because so many head injuries go unreported or \nignored. And when a concussion occurs, few ever lose consciousness, and \nthe telltale signs can seem minor in the immediate aftermath. It is \nonly later on, perhaps the next day or weeks thereafter, when the \nconsequences become clearer and more alarming.\n  The urgency to act only grows the more we learn about brain injuries. \nConcussions aren't minor bumps and dings. They aren't something kids \nshould just ``play through,'' as some coaches advise. They are injuries \nto the brain that animate our very existence, and they can impair their \ncognitive abilities just when our children need a good head on their \nshoulders. And we, as a society, have already seen the potential \ntragedies that repeated concussions can bring to athletes--their limbs \nparalyzed or their lives cut short by the inner demons the injuries \neventually bear.\n  The role of sports, and all of its innate benefits, is an important \npart of growing up in America. They teach us lessons that can't be \ntaught in the classroom, they make us healthier, and they show us the \nvalue of teamwork, grit, and responsibility. But the pervasiveness of \nconcussions and their effects, particularly among children, should no \nlonger be disregarded. And, as policymakers and parents, we must ensure \nthat we are doing everything we can to learn more and safeguard our \nkids and athletes.\n  Senator Tom Udall and I are proud to introduce the Youth Sports \nConcussion Act, which will help ensure that protective sports equipment \ntake heed of the latest science and are not sold based on false or \ndeceptive premises.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, we have already revealed and investigated bad actors \nwho peddle products with false safety claims to parents of young \nathletes. Under this legislation, the Federal Trade Commission would be \nable to go after them with greater force and ensure this practice comes \nto an end.\n  This bill would also direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \nreview a forthcoming study from the National Academies of Science on \nyouth concussions. Based on the study's recommendations, the CPSC would \nthen be permitted to consider new safety standards for sports equipment \nif manufacturers fail to come up with their own.\n  The legislation--I am happy to say--has the strong support of major \nsports leagues and players associations. Pediatricians, scientists, and \nconsumer groups have endorsed it, too. Our athletes, whether peewee or \nprofessional, whether under the lights or on the pitch, inspire and \nbring Americans together, and their efforts to help pass this sensible \nbill will surely garner the appreciation of present and future athletes \nto come.\n  This fall, some 3 million children under the age of 14 will don their \npads and snap on their helmets to play tackle football. For a sport so \nimportant--and for lives so precious--to our country, let us make sure \nwe act as soon as we can. The lessons imparted and the fitness gained \non the field are moot without the health of our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. SHAHEEN:\n  S. 1021. A bill to provide for a Next Generation Cooperative Threat \nReduction Strategy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the threat posed \nby the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction around the globe \nand to introduce legislation aimed at modernizing the way the United \nStates addresses this critical national security challenge. My bill, \nthe Next Generation Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2013, requires \nthe President to establish a multi-year comprehensive and well-\nresourced regional assistance strategy to coordinate and advance \ncooperative threat reduction and related nonproliferation efforts in \none of the most critical regions to U.S. national security interests: \nthe Middle East and North Africa.\n  Fifty years ago, in 1963, President Kennedy famously said that he was \n``haunted'' by the possibility that the United States could soon face a \nrapidly growing number of nuclear powers in our world. At the time, he \npredicted that by 1975, there could be as many as twenty countries with \nnuclear weapons. However, thanks to strong, forward-thinking and \ninnovative American leadership on the nonproliferation agenda, \nincluding efforts like the Nonproliferation Treaty and the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram, we have so far averted Kennedy's nuclear nightmare.\n  Recent WMD-related developments, including Syria's chemical weapons \nstockpile and Iran's nuclear program, have begun to test the limits of \nour nonproliferation regime. I am afraid we may be quickly reaching an \nimportant crossroads--one where we either prove President Kennedy wrong \nfor a little while longer, or find out that his nightmare prediction \nwas simply a half-century too soon.\n  As WMD-related materials and know-how continue to spread, the \nchallenge of WMD proliferation is getting more\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\ndiffuse and harder to track. Our focus and our resource commitment need \nto match the severity of this emerging threat. Now is the time for us \nto recommit to an aggressive nonproliferation agenda and to demonstrate \nto the world that the U.S. will continue to lead in curbing the threat \nposed by nuclear, chemical and biological weapons around the world.\n  We should start in one of the most dangerous, most unstable regions \nin the world today: the Middle East and North Africa.\n  Nowhere is the proliferation challenge more glaring than in the \ncountries of the Middle East and North Africa, where political \ninstability and deeply-rooted violent extremism sit atop a complex web \nof ethnic differences, a history of violence and extremism, robust \nmilitary capabilities, a growing collection of unsecured conventional \nand possible WMD-related weapons and a variety of inexperienced and \npotentially unstable governments brought into power by the Arab Spring.\n  Continued upheaval in Syria and the threat posed by the Assad \nregime's substantial chemical weapons stockpile pose a grave challenge \nto U.S. interests. Iran's continued illicit development of its nuclear \nprogram and its movement towards an advanced nuclear weapons capability \nthreatens the U.S. and our allies and could lead to a nuclear arms race \nin the region. Terrorist groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and al Qaeda \ncontinue to operate throughout the Middle East and North Africa, and \ntheir direct ties to the Iranian and Syrian regimes only exacerbates \nthe threat posed by these groups as they seek to acquire weapons of \nmass destruction or know-how.\n  Add to these threats the fact that the Arab Spring and continued \nrevolutions across the region have brought popularly elected, yet \nuntested governments into power that possess minimal capability and \nvery little experience in countering WMD proliferation.\n  In the face of this growing and complex challenge, it is obvious that \nthe Middle East and North African region represents the next generation \nof WMD-related tests for the United States. Yet, our resources and our \nprogramming are not getting ahead of the threat. In fact, the \nnonpartisan ``Project on U.S. Middle East Nonproliferation Strategy'' \nestimates that, excluding programs in Iraq, only two percent of last \nyear's nonproliferation-related programming, or approximately \n$20,000,000 of an estimated $1,000,000,000, was spent in Middle East \nand North Africa countries.\n  Luckily for us, we have a successful model for engagement on this \nissue that we can fall back on. Just over two decades ago, Senators Sam \nNunn and Dick Lugar initiated what has proven to be one of the \ncountry's most effective foreign policy efforts. The Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction, CTR, Program has led to the successful \ndeactivation of well over 13,000 nuclear warheads, as well as the \ndestruction of over 1,400 intercontinental ballistic missiles and \nalmost 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapon agents. Because of Nunn-\nLugar, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus are nuclear weapons free and \nAlbania is chemical weapons free.\n  The principles of Nunn-Lugar can and should be more fully translated \ninto the Middle East and North Africa. Congress has long supported \nexpanding CTR into the Middle East, but it was only last fall that the \nAdministration finally completed the bureaucratic changes necessary to \nmore robustly engage in this region.\n  It is time we expand and ramp up our CTR efforts to prevent the \npotential proliferation of WMD-related weapons, technologies, \nmaterials, and know-how in this difficult and volatile part of the \nworld. That is why I am introducing the Next Generation Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Act of 2013, which is aimed at modernizing our CTR and \nnonproliferation programs and expanding them more comprehensively \nthroughout this region.\n  The bill calls for the President to develop and implement a multi-\nyear comprehensive regional assistance strategy to coordinate and \nadvance CTR and nonproliferation in the Middle East and North Africa. \nThe strategy requires an integrated, whole-of-government commitment to \nbuilding on the cooperative threat model demonstrated by Nunn-Lugar's \nsuccesses, the initiation of new CTR programs with newly elected \npartners in the region, and plans to ensure burden-sharing and \nleveraging of additional outside resources.\n  The bill allows for the support of innovative and creative assistance \nprograms aimed at enhancing the capacity of governments in the region \nto prevent, detect, and interdict illicit WMD-related trade. Activities \ncould include:\n  Encouraging and assisting with security and destruction of chemical \nweapons stockpiles; Promoting the adoption and implementation of \nenhanced and comprehensive strategic trade control laws and \nstrengthening export controls and border security, including maritime \nsecurity; Promoting government-to-government engagement among emerging \npolitical and public policy leaders, including the possibility of \ntraining courses for parliamentarians and national technical advisors; \nPromoting activities that seek to work with civil society \norganizations, media representatives, and public diplomacy officials to \nhelp develop a culture of nonproliferation responsibility among the \ngeneral public; The possible establishment of nuclear, chemical, or \nbiological security Centers of Excellence in the Middle East; \nSupporting, enhancing, or building upon regional nonproliferation \nprograms and institutions already in place, including such multilateral \ninitiatives as the December 2010 Gulf Cooperation Council conference on \nthe implementation of UNSCR 1540 or the Arab Atomic Energy Agency and \nits Arab Network of Nuclear Regulators; Supporting, enhancing, or \nbuilding upon previous multilateral initiatives, including the Group of \nEight's Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials \nof Mass Destruction or the White House-led Nuclear Security Summits in \n2010 and 2012 to more fully incorporate and include countries of the \nMiddle East and North Africa region; Encouraging countries to adopt and \nadhere to the IAEA Additional Protocol; Promoting and supporting WMD-\nrelated regional confidence-building measures and Track Two regional \ndialogues on nonproliferation and related issues; Working \ncollaboratively with businesses, foundations, universities, think tanks \nand other sectors, including the possibility of prizes and challenges \nto spur innovation in achieving appropriate Middle East and North \nAfrica nonproliferation objectives; Supporting and expanding successful \nexisting Middle East and North Africa partnerships, including the \nMiddle East Consortium for Infectious Disease Surveillance; Promoting \nthe establishment of professional networks that foster voluntary \nregional interaction on weapons of mass destruction-related issues; or \nenhancing United States-Europe cooperation on combating proliferation \nin the Middle East and North Africa region.\n  The threat posed by WMD-related materials falling into the hands of \nterrorists remains our greatest and gravest threat. As former Defense \nSecretary Robert Gates said, ``Every senior leader, when you're asked \nwhat keeps you awake at night, it's the thought of a terrorist ending \nup with a weapon of mass destruction, especially nuclear.''\n  To date, we have largely kept WMD materials out of terrorists' hands. \nUnfortunately, however, being successful ``to date'' is not good \nenough. When it comes to terrorism and WMD in our world, the reality is \nthat the international community cannot afford to make a single \nmistake. We cannot be complacent because one miscalculation . . . one \nunprotected border . . . one unsecured facility . . . could all lead to \na mushroom cloud somewhere in our world.\n  We need to remain vigilant, to think ahead, and to anticipate where \nthe next threats will come from and adapt to get ahead of it.\n  That is why I would urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up and \npass the Next Generation Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2013. We \nneed to demonstrate that the United States will continue to lead the \ninternational community in curbing the threat posed by WMD \nproliferation. My legislation does just that. I hope the Senate will \nsupport this important effort.\n  Before yielding the floor, I want to thank my colleagues in the U.S. \nSenate, the U.S. House of Representatives, at the White House and at \nthe Departments of State and Defense who contributed to this \nlegislation. I also want\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\nto give special thanks to the Co-Chairs of the Project on U.S. Middle \nEast Nonproliferation Strategy, including David Albright, Mark \nDubowitz, Orde Kittrie, Leonard Spector and Michael Yaffe, whose \nreport, ``U.S. Nonproliferation Strategy for the Changing Middle \nEast,'' served as the inspiration for this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3767-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 152--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 28, 2013, AS ``NATIONAL \n HOLOPROSENCEPHALY AWARENESS DAY'' TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND EDUCATION \n                            OF THE DISORDER\n\n  Mr. COWAN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 152\n\n       Whereas Holoprosencephaly (commonly known as ``HPE'') is a \n     birth defect of the brain in which the prosencephalon (also \n     known as the ``embryonic forebrain'') does not sufficiently \n     develop into 2 hemispheres resulting in a single-lobed brain \n     structure and severe skull and facial defects;\n       Whereas in most cases of HPE, the malformations are so \n     severe that babies die before birth;\n       Whereas in less severe cases of HPE, babies are born with \n     normal or near-normal brain development and facial \n     deformities that may affect the eyes, nose, and upper lip;\n       Whereas the 3 classifications of HPE that vary in severity \n     and impairment to cognitive abilities are Alobar (in which \n     the brain has not divided at all), Semilobar (in which the \n     hemispheres of the brain have somewhat divided), and Lobar \n     (in which there is considerable evidence of separate brain \n     hemispheres);\n       Whereas HPE affects approximatley 1 out of every 250 \n     pregnancies during early embryo development, with many of \n     those pregnancies ending in miscarriage;\n       Whereas HPE affects 1 in 10,000-20,000 live births;\n       Whereas the prognosis for a child diagnosed with HPE \n     depends on the severity of the brain and facial malformations \n     and associated clinical complications, with the most severely \n     affected children living several months or years and the \n     least affected children living a normal life span;\n       Whereas there is no standard course of treatment for HPE \n     because treatment must be individualized to the unique degree \n     of malformations of each child;\n       Whereas the Federal Government, acting through the National \n     Institutes of Health and the National Institute of \n     Neurological Disorders and Strokes, supports and conducts a \n     wide range of research on normal brain development and recent \n     research has identified specific genes that cause HPE; and\n       Whereas November 28, 2013, would be an appropriate day to \n     designate as `National Holoprosencephaly Awareness Day': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of November 28, 2013, as \n     ``National Holoprosencephaly Awareness Day'';\n       (2) urges Federal agencies--\n       (A) to continue supporting research to better understand \n     the causes of HPE;\n       (B) to provide better counseling to families with the \n     genetic forms of HPE; and\n       (C) to develop new ways to treat, and potentially prevent, \n     HPE; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States, interested \n     groups, and affected persons--\n       (A) to promote awareness of HPE;\n       (B) to take an active role in the fight to end the \n     devastating effects of HPE; and\n       (C) to observe ``National Holoprosencephaly Awareness Day'' \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. COWAN. Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to \ndiscuss a rare birth defect of the brain, known as holoprosencephaly or \nHPE.\n  I became aware of this rare disorder through the outreach of my \nconstituent, Angel Marie Kelley from Bellingham, MA. Angel has a child \nliving with HPE and has become a resource to others in her community \nwho are touched by this disorder.\n  HPE occurs during the first few weeks of a pregnancy when the fetal \nbrain does not sufficiently divide into two hemispheres, resulting in \nsevere skull and facial defects. In most cases of HPE, the \nmalformations are so severe that babies die before birth. In less \nsevere cases, babies are born with normal or near-normal brain \ndevelopment and facial deformities that may affect the eyes, nose, and \nupper lip.\n  HPE affects about 1 out of every 250 pregnancies during early embryo \ndevelopment, with many of these pregnancies ending in miscarriage. The \ndisorder affects between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 20,000 live births.\n  There is no cure or standard course of treatment for HPE. The \nprognosis for a child diagnosed with the disorder depends on the \nseverity of the brain and facial malformations and associated clinical \ncomplications. The most severely affected children could live several \nmonths or years and the least affected children are capable of \nachieving a normal life span. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive \nand must be individualized to each child's unique degree of \nmalformations.\n  I would like to recognize the ongoing work of the Federal Government \nthrough the National Institutes of Health, NIH, and the National \nInstitute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes, NINDS, on HPE. These \nagencies support and conduct a wide range of innovative and promising \nresearch on HPE--recently identifying the specific genes that cause \nHPE.\n  I am submitting this resolution today to designate November 28, 2013 \nas National Holoprosencephaly Awareness Day. This resolution urges \nFederal agencies to support HPE research, to provide better counseling \nto families with the genetic forms of HPE, and to develop new ways to \ntreat, and potentially prevent this disorder. It also calls on the \npeople of the United States to promote awareness of this birth defect \nand to observe National Holoprosencephaly Awareness Day with \nappropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass \nthis important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/22/senate-section/article/S3767-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3767-S3768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1059.

CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL PROCEDURE FOR MAJOR RULES.\n\n       (a)(1) For purposes of this section, the term ``joint \n     resolution'' means only a joint resolution addressing a \n     report classifying a rule as major pursuant to section \n     12302(a)(1)(A)(iii) that--\n       (A) bears no preamble;\n       (B) bears the following title (with blanks filled as \n     appropriate): ``Approving the rule submitted by ___ relating \n     to ___.'';\n       (C) includes after its resolving clause only the following \n     (with blanks filled as appropriate): ``That Congress approves \n     the rule submitted by ___ relating to ___.''; and\n       (D) is introduced pursuant to paragraph (2).\n       (2) After a House of Congress receives a report classifying \n     a rule as major pursuant to section 12302(a)(1)(A)(iii), the \n     majority leader of that House (or his or her respective \n     designee) shall introduce (by request, if appropriate) a \n     joint resolution described in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) in the case of the House of Representatives, within \n     three legislative days; and\n       (B) in the case of the Senate, within three session days.\n       (3) A joint resolution described in paragraph (1) shall not \n     be subject to amendment at any stage of proceeding.\n       (b) A joint resolution described in subsection (a) shall be \n     referred in each House of Congress to the committees having \n     jurisdiction over the provision of law under which the rule \n     is issued.\n       (c) In the Senate, if the committee or committees to which \n     a joint resolution described in subsection (a) has been \n     referred have not reported it at the end of 15 session days \n     after its introduction, such committee or committees shall be \n     automatically discharged from further consideration of the \n     resolution and it shall be placed on the calendar. A vote on \n     final passage of the resolution shall be taken on or before \n     the close of the 15th session day after the resolution is \n     reported by the committee or committees to which it was \n     referred, or after such committee or committees have been \n     discharged from further consideration of the resolution.\n       (d)(1) In the Senate, when the committee or committees to \n     which a joint resolution is referred have reported, or when a \n     committee or committees are discharged (under subsection (c)) \n     from further consideration of a joint resolution described in \n     subsection (a), it is at any time thereafter in order (even \n     though a previous motion to the same effect has been \n     disagreed to) for a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n     the joint resolution, and all points of order against the \n     joint resolution (and against consideration of the joint \n     resolution) are waived. The motion is not subject to \n     amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n     disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to \n     the consideration of the joint resolution is agreed to, the \n     joint resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the \n     Senate until disposed of.\n       (2) In the Senate, debate on the joint resolution, and on \n     all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, \n     shall be limited to not more than 2 hours, which shall be \n     divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the \n     joint resolution. A motion to further limit debate is in \n     order and not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to \n     postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n     other business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution \n     is not in order.\n       (3) In the Senate, immediately following the conclusion of \n     the debate on a joint resolution described in subsection (a), \n     and a single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate, the \n     vote on final passage of the joint resolution shall occur.\n       (4) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the \n     application of the rules of the Senate to the procedure \n     relating to a joint\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\n     resolution described in subsection (a) shall be decided \n     without debate.\n       (e) In the House of Representatives, if any committee to \n     which a joint resolution described in subsection (a) has been \n     referred has not reported it to the House at the end of 15 \n     legislative days after its introduction, such committee shall \n     be discharged from further consideration of the joint \n     resolution, and it shall be placed on the appropriate \n     calendar. On the second and fourth Thursdays of each month it \n     shall be in order at any time for the Speaker to recognize a \n     Member who favors passage of a joint resolution that has \n     appeared on the calendar for at least 5 legislative days to \n     call up that joint resolution for immediate consideration in \n     the House without intervention of any point of order. When so \n     called up a joint resolution shall be considered as read and \n     shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled \n     by the proponent and an opponent, and the previous question \n     shall be considered as ordered to its passage without \n     intervening motion. It shall not be in order to reconsider \n     the vote on passage. If a vote on final passage of the joint \n     resolution has not been taken by the third Thursday on which \n     the Speaker may recognize a Member under this subsection, \n     such vote shall be taken on that day.\n       (f)(1) If, before passing a joint resolution described in \n     subsection (a), one House receives from the other a joint \n     resolution having the same text, then--\n       (A) the joint resolution of the other House shall not be \n     referred to a committee; and\n       (B) the procedure in the receiving House shall be the same \n     as if no joint resolution had been received from the other \n     House until the vote on passage, when the joint resolution \n     received from the other House shall supplant the joint \n     resolution of the receiving House.\n       (2) This subsection shall not apply to the House of \n     Representatives if the joint resolution received from the \n     Senate is a revenue measure.\n       (g) If either House has not taken a vote on final passage \n     of the joint resolution by the last day of the period \n     described in section 12302(b)(2), then such vote shall be \n     taken on that day.\n       (h) This section and section 12304 are enacted by \n     Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such is \n     deemed to be part of the rules of each House, respectively, \n     but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be \n     followed in that House in the case of a joint resolution \n     described in subsection (a) and superseding other rules only \n     where explicitly so; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the Constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n\n     SEC. 12304.

The motion \n     is not subject to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or \n     to a motion to proceed to the consideration of other \n     business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion \n     is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of the joint \n     resolution is agreed to, the joint resolution shall remain \n     the unfinished business of the Senate until disposed of.\n       (2) In the Senate, debate on the joint resolution, and on \n     all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, \n     shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be \n     divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the \n     joint resolution.
