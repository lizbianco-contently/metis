On one final subject, to ensure this Nation's continued \neconomic recovery and long-term success, it is crucial that America \ninvest in our educated workforce, and we need to continue to have an \neducated workforce. In this country a college education is the surest \npath to a better life. But higher education has never been more \nexpensive or further out of reach for middle-class families. So it is \ncrucial Congress act before July 1 to keep the interest rates low for 7 \nmillion college students who can't afford to pile on more debt.\n  Democrats have a commonsense plan to prevent loan rates from doubling \nfor 2 years without adding a single penny to the deficit. We will \nconsider that legislation, as I have just indicated, later this \nmorning.\n  The Republican alternative proposal, by contrast, would be worse than \ndoing nothing at all. It would be worse than letting the rates double, \nwhich would happen if we do nothing. The Republican proposal will \nsaddle students with even more debt--about $6,500 more debt--than they \nhave today. That is a serious blow, considering that Americans have \nmore than $1 trillion in student loan debt.\n  Keeping college affordable is the best investment we can make in our \ncountry. Congress should remove the obstacles from keeping young people \nfrom getting an education and not put more barriers in their way. I \nhope our Republican colleagues will work to invest in America's future \ninstead of, once again, sticking it to the students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3970-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Earlier this week, I came to the floor and asked \nSenate Democrats to work with us on permanent student loan reform. This \nis an issue ripe for bipartisan cooperation.\n  Both the President and Republicans want to prevent rates from going \nup in July, and the ideas Republicans have put forward on the issue are \nactually very similar to what the President has already proposed. This \nactually should be a slam dunk.\n  Instead, Senate Democrats have put forward a bill that fails the very \nbenchmarks that the President himself set--a bill that is nothing more \nthan a short-term political patch funded by permanent tax hikes. The \nbill would cost taxpayers more than $8 billion, yet only save students \nabout $6 a month. Worse still, it is a bill Senate Democrats know will \nfail. In fact, they actually seem to be indicating they want it to \nfail.\n  Why would that be? Undoubtedly so they could keep this issue alive \nfor the permanent campaign that never seems to end. Top Senate \nDemocrats have stated themselves that they are ``not looking for \ncompromise'' and that they are determined to show ``the difference \nbetween the two parties on a key issue,'' even when there isn't one.\n  Two of the most senior Democrats said those things. Those are direct \nquotes, so basically they are determined to force a partisan fight \nregardless of the costs to students. By the way they set up this \nmorning's votes, it is pretty clear those votes are intentionally \ndesigned to fail.\n  So when the Senate Democrats get their wish and the bill fails this \nevening, I hope the President will step in to work with us on a serious \npermanent solution because, as I said, our ideas for reform are not all \nthat different from his on this issue. Students should not be made to \nsuffer just because some in this town seem to see them as rooks and \npawns in a political chess match.\n  Look, this isn't a fight young Americans need, and they especially \ndon't need this fight right now. Young men and women are already having \na rough enough go in the Obama economy. Those who make it through \ncollege face a highly uncertain future once they get out in the real \nworld, as their parents like to call it. They are having a real tough \ntime finding a job.\n  Once ObamaCare comes online, experts predict their health care \npremiums are set to skyrocket. Young men in their mid-20s to mid-30s \ncould see rate increases of 50 percent or more, depending on which \nstudy we look at.\n  Here is the thing: Even if premiums end up going up by just a small \nfraction of that amount, it is still going to create an enormous \nheadache for the next generation. While the administration's allies \npromised subsidies, studies indicate those payments from taxpayers may \nnot make up for the higher costs.\n  Many young folks seem to be living largely from paycheck to paycheck \nthese days, often because they literally have no other choice. These \nmen and women are just getting by as it is. Do we expect these \nAmericans to be able to afford to pay even more?\n  Apparently Washington Democrats do. Because if young folks don't \ncough up money for health insurance, they are going to get hit with a \npenalty tax. So one way or the other, many are going to start paying \nmore. That is just one more reason why Senate Democrats need to get \nserious about the student loan issue.\n  This summer alone more than 9 million college students will take out\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\nnearly $7,000 worth of loans and about $25,000 in total by the time \nthey earn their degrees. That is a smart investment, but it is also a \nlot of money. We owe them certainty and stability and permanent reform \nalong the lines Republicans and President Obama have called for, and \nthose two proposals, as I said, are not that far apart and actually \naccomplish that result. It is time for the Democrats in Washington to \nput the campaigning aside and work with us to enact that kind of \nreform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3971-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UPHOLDING A COMMITMENT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have said repeatedly--and I will say \nagain today--the Senate needs to know whether the majority leader \nintends to uphold a commitment he has now twice made, and this \ncommitment was that he would not break the rules of the Senate to \nchange the rules.\n  Specifically, both at the beginning of the last Congress and at the \nbeginning of this Congress, he committed to the Senate and to the \nAmerican people that he would not use what is referred to as the \n``nuclear option.'' These were very clear commitments. They were not \ncontingent commitments or commitments made with caveats. They were not \ncontingent commitments or commitments made with caveats.\n  Here we have the exact words of the majority leader on this chart. At \nthe beginning of the previous Congress, on January 27, 2011, the \nmajority leader said:\n\n       I agree that the proper way to change Senate rules is \n     through the procedures established in those rules, and I will \n     oppose any effort in this Congress or the next--\n\nand listen to this, I say to the Presiding Officer and my colleagues--\n\n     or the next--\n\nor the next, meaning the Congress we are in now--\n\n     to change the Senate's rules other than through the regular \n     order.\n\n  No contingencies, no caveats, no saying unless I decide I don't like \ncertain behavior.\n  In this Congress there was an exchange between myself and the \nmajority leader. Here is what I said on January 24 of 2013, this year:\n\n       Finally, I would confirm with the majority leader that the \n     Senate would not consider other resolutions relating to any \n     standing order or rules this Congress unless they went \n     through the regular order process?\n\n  At the beginning of this session, we passed a couple of rules \nchanges, a couple of standing orders. We made some changes and we made \nthose changes in return for the majority leader's commitment, which \nfollows. The majority leader said:\n\n       That is correct. Any other resolutions related to Senate \n     procedure would be subject to a regular order process \n     including consideration by the Rules Committee.\n\n  In other words, an unequivocal, noncontingent commitment, so that \neveryone knew the rules of the Senate for the entire Congress. There \nwas no sort of hanging a sword of Damocles over our heads and saying, \nif Members don't behave as I wish, I will break my word. Now the \nsuggestion apparently is, Members have to behave in a certain way to \nsatisfy me or my word doesn't mean anything.\n  This is a serious matter. We are only one-half of 1 year through a 2-\nyear Congress, and the Senate and the American people deserve to know \nwhether the word of the majority leader will be kept.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3971-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SIXTY-NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY AND THE HONOR FLIGHT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today is the 69th anniversary of the D-\nday invasion. On June 6, 1944, 160,000 allied troops landed along a 50-\nmile stretch of heavily fortified French coastline in a surprise attack \nagainst the forces of Nazi Germany. The cost was exceedingly high--more \nthan 9,000 allied soldiers were killed or wounded that day--but the \nNormandy invasion was the beginning of a successful conclusion of the \nwar.\n  I am also honored to recognize the distinguished group of World War \nII veterans from my home State of Kentucky who have made the trip to \nour Nation's Capital today--appropriately enough on D-day--to visit the \nNational World War II Memorial on the Mall. This memorial celebrates \ntheir service, as well as the service of the brave warriors who landed \non Normandy Beach, and every man and woman in uniform who fought to \ndefend freedom in World War II.\n  This group includes 26 veterans who were able to make the trip to see \ntheir memorial thanks to the Honor Flight Program. The Bluegrass \nChapter of Honor Flight has brought over 1,000 veterans, most of them \nfrom Kentucky, to Washington, DC for this purpose. This program \nprovides transportation, lodging, and food for the veterans. Without \nHonor Flight many of these veterans would never be able to visit the \nCapitol or see the World War II Memorial.\n  As have many of my colleagues, I have been privileged to visit with \ngroups of Honor Flight veterans on several occasions before, and I am \npleased to report that I will be meeting with today's group at the \nMemorial as well. My father served in World War II. He got there after \nD-day and after the Battle of the Bulge. He was there from March of \n1945 through the end of war when we were pushing the Germans back into \ntheir own country. I wish he had lived long enough to have had an \nopportunity to visit the World War II Memorial. I know it would have \nmeant a lot to him, as it does to today's surviving veterans.\n  As World War II recedes further into the past, sadly, we are losing \nmore of these living legends. We have just had to say goodbye to our \nfriend Senator Frank Lautenberg, the last World War II veteran to serve \nin this body. The passage of time makes it all the more important to \nthank these heroes for their service before it is too late.\n  Today is a perfect occasion to do just that, and I look forward to \nmeeting this group of courageous Kentucky veterans from towns such as \nOwensboro, Hartford, Louisville, Covington, Berksville, Lexington, \nSpringfield, Mount Washington, and Taylorsville.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3971-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there are only 3 weeks left until interest \nrates on new subsidized student loans will double. If we fail to act, \nthe cost of college will increase for millions of students. There are \nstrong proposals on the table that would keep interest rates low while \nCongress has time to work out a permanent solution. Yet Congress fails \nto act. Why? Two issues: Money and values.\n\n       First, money. Some have argued we can't afford to keep \n     interest rates low, but let's be clear. Right now, the \n     Federal Government is making a profit from our students. Last \n     month the Congressional Budget Office calculated the \n     government will make $51 billion this year off student loans. \n     Think about that: $51 billion--and that is $16 billion higher \n     than the earlier estimate. We have the money to cut interest \n     rates if we are willing to reduce the profits we make from \n     our students.\n\n  Unfortunately, Republicans see it differently. Two weeks ago House \nRepublicans passed a plan that would produce higher profits off the \nbacks of our college students. And here in the Senate, Senator Coburn \nhas introduced a similar bill that makes student loans more \nprofitable--all at the expense of our college students. This is wrong. \nWe should reject Republican plans to make more profits off our \nstudents.\n  Senator Coburn talks about how his plan is similar to the low-\ninterest rate\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\nbanks offer through the Federal Reserve, but he has that wrong. The big \nbanks borrow at less than 1 percent, but Senator Coburn would charge \nstudents an additional 3 percent on top of the 10-year Treasury rates. \nHis plan would produce billions more in profits for the government--\nmoney that comes straight out of the pockets of our struggling \nstudents. We have the money to help our students. We don't need to \nsqueeze them harder.\n  The second issue is values. Our college students already see that the \nsystem is rigged against them. They watched Wall Street bankers get \nbailed out while their parents lost jobs and struggled to hang on to \ntheir homes. They see special subsidies for companies that ship jobs \noverseas and exploit tax loopholes while the investment in their \nfuture--in jobs here at home--disappears.\n  Now Senator Coburn plans to squeeze more profits out of our students. \nHe is fine with the government handing out loans to big banks at \nincredibly low rates, but he wants our students to pay more. That is \nnot who we are. This does not reflect our values. We see students \ndrowning in debt and we should be there to help.\n  Senator Harkin and Senator Reed have shown great leadership on this \nissue. They offer simple solutions to prevent interest rates from \ndoubling. Their plan would maintain the current 3.4-percent interest \nrate for 2 more years.\n  I have also introduced a short-term plan that would cut interest \nrates even more by offering the exact same low rates the big banks get \nthrough the Federal Reserve discount window. I introduced this 1-year \ndeal because we need immediate relief while we develop a long-term \nplan.\n  So I rise today in support of the Reed-Harkin proposal to freeze \ninterest rates on subsidized loans for 2 more years. Their proposal \nprevents the rates from doubling on July 1 and it also gives us time to \ndevelop a plan that aligns with our values and supports our students.\n  This is about our values. Have we become a people who will support \nour big banks with nearly free loans while we crush our kids who are \ntrying to get an education? The student loan program makes obscene \nprofits on the backs of our students. This is morally wrong and we must \nput a stop to it.\n  Our students don't have high-paying lobbyists to look out for their \ninterests, but they do have their voices. Petitions urging Congress to \npass a short-term plan for interest rates to prevent them from doubling \nhave already collected more than 1 million signatures. Our students and \ntheir families are asking for what is right. They are asking for \nsomething we can easily afford. Let's show them government can work for \nthem.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me first commend Senator Warren for her \nvery thoughtful discussion on this increasingly important topic of \nstudent debt and her efforts to assist us in extending the current \ninterest rate of 3.4 percent while we work on a much longer and much \nmore thoughtful approach to reform. She will be at the heart of those \nefforts.\n  July 1 is a little more than 3 weeks away. Unless Congress acts, the \ninterest rate on subsidized student loans will double from 3.4 percent \nto 6.8 percent, making college more expensive for more than 7 million \nstudents across the Nation, including more than 42,000 students in my \nhome State of Rhode Island.\n  This will hit low- and moderate-income families the hardest. Indeed, \n60 percent of dependent subsidized loan borrowers come from families \nwith incomes of less than $60,000, while 80 percent of independent \nsubsidized loan borrowers come from families with incomes below \n$40,000.\n  There is no reason to allow this rate to double, and there is no \nreason to rush to a long-term solution that would actually make the \nproblem worse.\n  There are several long-term proposals on the table, with substantial \ndifferences. The House passed a bill that, according to an analysis by \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, would leave students \nworse off than letting the rate double. The President has, in fact, \nsaid he would veto this legislation, but if the House bill went into \neffect it would be worse than doing nothing, which I think is a strong \nargument to do something other than the House bill.\n  My Republican colleagues in this body have proposed a long-term \nsolution that would expose students to unchecked interest rates in the \nfuture, there would be no cap, and their proposal would have students \npay $15.6 billion more in interest payments for deficit reduction. I \ndon't believe student loan borrowers should pay higher interest to \nreduce the deficit, nor do I think the Federal Government should be \ngenerating Federal revenue from student loan programs. We should not be \nprofiting on the backs of these students, particularly as student debt \nexplodes.\n  I have proposed setting interest rates based on the actual cost of \nproviding the loans with a cap to protect students during periods of \nhigh interest rates.\n  Any long-term solution for student loans should leave students better \noff in the long run. The Republican proposals do not pass this test.\n  According to a recent analysis by the Institute for College Access \nand Success, the Senate Republican proposal would cost students \nentering college this fall and graduating in 2017 $2,200 more in \ninterest payments. For a freshman starting in the fall of 2018 and \ngraduating 4 years later, the increased interest payment would balloon \nto $6,700.\n  Make no mistake, the ``savings'' generated from the Senate Republican \nproposal means students pay more.\n  As I have come to the floor to discuss many times, with student loan \ndebt eclipsing credit card debt and auto loan debt, we should take the \ntime to thoughtfully and comprehensively address student debt and \ncollege costs.\n  How we set student loan interest rates is only one part of the \nsolution. We need to address rising college costs as well. If we do \nnot, even with grants and loans, families will be priced out of a \ncollege education and out of the middle class.\n  We need to ask more from States and from colleges and universities. I \nwill be introducing legislation to revitalize the Federal-State \npartnership for higher education and to make sure colleges and \nuniversities have more skin in the game when it comes to student loans. \nThese are big, complex issues, and we should work together to develop \nbipartisan solutions. But that work--that careful work, that thoughtful \nwork, that thorough work--will take time--more than the 25 days we have \nbetween now and July 1.\n  Right now we can and we must take action to reassure students and \nfamilies who rely on need-based loans to pay for college that the rate \nwill not double on July 1.\n  I have worked with Chairman Harkin, Senator Warren, Leader Reid, and \nmany of my colleagues to develop a fully offset 2-year extension of the \ncurrent student loan interest rate. Instead of charging low- and \nmoderate-income students more for their loans, the Student Loan \nAffordability Act will keep rates steady while closing loopholes in the \nFederal Tax Code.\n  Specifically, the bill would limit the use of tax-deferred retirement \naccounts as a complicated estate planning tool, close a corporate \noffshore tax loophole by restricting what is called earnings stripping \nby expatriated entities, and close an oil and gas industry tax loophole \nby treating oil from tar sands the same as other petroleum products. \nThese are sensible measures in and of themselves, but when they will \nallow us to stabilize the student interest rate, they take on even more \nrelevance and I think more importance. We should not be collecting \nadditional revenue from students when we cannot or will not eliminate \nwasteful spending in the Tax Code, and we should not allow interest \nrates to double on July 1.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will support this commonsense 2-year \nextension that is fair to students and taxpayers, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote yes on the motion to proceed to S. 953, the Student \nLoan Affordability Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I am here to say to my colleagues that \nalthough we are going to go through a very expedited process of voting \non two options\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\non student loans, I want to urge my colleagues to take this seriously. \nThis has a huge financial impact on families across this country, and I \nsay ``families'' because we are focused on the students, and in many \ncases it is the parents taking out loans, and the truth is that under \none option today parents are left out.\n  You see, the debate on this floor today is over two bills--one \noffered by my friends in the majority, which would extend the 3.4-\npercent interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans. That is 39 percent \nof all the student loans taken out. It does not speak to the 61 percent \nthat is still under the 6.8 percent rate. It is parents, it is students \nwho take out unsubsidized Stafford loans. They are still at 6.8 \npercent.\n  But more importantly, you need to look at the financial \nsustainability of the program. When this was originally enacted in \n2006, the campaign rhetoric was, we are going to drastically cut \nstudent loans for everybody--until they realized how much it was going \nto cost. Then they limited it to subsidized Stafford loans. When the \nauthorization for that runs out, we have this debate about whether we \nare going to extend the 3.4-percent student loan rate. We just forget \nto tell everybody it is for a subsection of everybody who is taking out \nstudent loans.\n  So let me suggest that the other option today will be to put student \nloans on a financially firm footing, something we can certify for the \nfuture is financially sustainable not just for the students and for \ntheir parents but for the American taxpayer. They should have a voice \nin this.\n  So what Ranking Member Alexander and Senator Coburn and I have \nintroduced is a comprehensive piece of legislation that ties the rate \nof student loan borrowing to the rate of the 10-year bond in May of \nthat year.\n  So this past month we would take the rate of the 10-year bond--which \nwas about 1.79 percent--we would add 3 percent to it, and for the next \nyear the rate for everybody taking out student loans would be 4.79 \npercent. Some Members of the Senate cannot add. And for the next 12 \nmonths anybody who took out a student loan would be at 4.79 percent--\nnot some at 3.4 percent, not the rest at 6.8 percent. That 4.79 percent \nwould be a fixed rate for the life of the loan. It would not go away in \n12 months and have to be renegotiated based upon what the will of \nCongress was and the legislative mandate of what the interest rate was \ngoing to be. Every year that somebody went--whether it was a parent, \nwhether it was for a nonsubsidized Stafford loan or a subsidized \nStafford loan--whatever that May establishment of the 10-year bond rate \nwas, you would add 3 percent to it. It would be very predictable. You \nwould not be at the whim of, is Congress going to extend this?\n  Let me predict to you. I know what we are going to do. We are going \nto have two options up today, and neither one of them is going to get \n60 votes. That means it is not going to pass. And the day before or 2 \ndays before the expiration of the 3.4-percent rate, people are going to \nrush to the floor and say: We cannot let this happen.\n  We have an opportunity to fix it, to fix it on a permanent basis, to \nsay to parents, to say to those with the nonsubsidized Stafford loans \nand, yes, to those with the subsidized Stafford loans: We are putting \nthis on financially sound ground, and we are going to do it in a \ntransparent way that lets you know every May exactly what you can \nborrow money for for your college education.\n  Some might conclude, well, if you borrow every year for 4 years, you \nare going to have different rates. You are right. The reality is that \nin this bill you have an option, at any point you choose to do it, to \nconsolidate those loans at a guaranteed 8.5 percent. So if it is more \nattractive to have four different packages of loans with lower interest \nrates or the blend of them might be higher, you can consolidate them \nand take a guaranteed rate.\n  I heard my good friend quote the Congressional Research Service. They \ncame out with an analysis of the two pieces of legislation last night, \nand they came to this conclusion: that for the subsidized Stafford \nloans, the Alexander-Burr-Coburn proposal was not very different from \nwhat my friends on the other side presented, but for everybody else--\nfor the 61 percent--it saved them $80 a month.\n  Let me say that again. For everybody else who is not in the \nsubsidized Stafford loans, the Congressional Research Service said our \nbill saves parents and students--those who are in the nonsubsidized \nstudent loan program--$80 a month. That is almost $1,000 a year. This \nis real money. This is what Congress should pay attention to.\n  Let me suggest this. Congress should not be sitting in Washington \ndeciding with a dartboard: Here is what the student loan rate is going \nto be this year. Should the price of money in the marketplace not have \nsome impact on it? What we are simply saying is, tie it to a very \npredictable, transparent number--the 10-year cost of borrowing money, \nplus 3 percent.\n  You see, unlike throughout the 1990s and half of the 2000s, we do not \nhave private sector competition against the government model. We \ndecided that having financial institutions come in and offer more \nattractive interest rates or waiving origination fees or the \nadministration fees of a student loan--no, no, no, we did not want that \nto happen even though in many cases it saved students money. We said we \nwant to centralize this in the Federal Government. We want to take over \nthe whole thing. And then the Congress decided: Do you know what, we \nwant to set the rates.\n\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues that this is nothing more than a \npolitical tool right now. The last people we are trying to look at are \nthe students or their families who actually need loans to send their \nkids to college.\n  Today's vote is a defining moment. If we take advantage of passing \none that structures this to where the rates we set are out of \ncongressional control and set by the marketplace in a predictable, \ntransparent way, then this is sustainable. If it is not, this will be \nthe subject of every 2 years and campaign rhetoric, where some win and \nsome lose.\n  I did not come here to pick winners and losers. I came here to give \nequal opportunity and unlimited opportunity to the next generation and \nthe generation after that. To suggest that only people who qualify for \nsubsidized Stafford loans are the ones we should give favorable \ntreatment to is ludicrous. What we would like to do is to provide a \npredictable mechanism to set rates but one that does not pick winners \nand losers, one that treats everybody who is in the student loan need \ncategory the same.\n  I see the ranking member is here, and I am going to yield to him. But \nI do want to say to my colleagues that this is not just another 15-\nminute vote. You should not feel good if you vote for one and vote \nagainst another and nothing passes because we are going to be back here \nbefore July 1, and the likelihood is that it is going to be presented \nto us in a way where we are not going to have the option of doing the \nright thing. They are just going to say: Do you want to suffer the \npolitical consequences of letting the rates go from 3.4 percent to 6.8 \npercent on 39 percent of the American people? I would tell you that a \nparent borrowing money for their children today is just as vulnerable \nas a student who is qualified and borrows under a subsidized Stafford \nloan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the \nSenator from North Carolina for his proposal. The two votes we are \nhaving today are like the opening act at the circus, and hopefully the \nmain event will attract some Senators who are willing to conduct this \nin a grownup way. We do not really have a disagreement here; we have a \nserious issue. We have students graduating all over the country from \nhigh school at about this time, and about 70 percent of them will go to \ncollege next year. The taxpayers want to encourage that. We spend about \n$35 billion in Pell grants to help pay for that. Then three out of four \nof those students who go to college will go to public colleges and \nuniversities--like the Universities of Michigan or Mississippi or North \nCarolina or Tennessee--the taxpayer helps foot the bill for that. Then \nthe taxpayer is going to loan $133 billion this year in student loans \nto students of all kinds.\n  What the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator from Oklahoma\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\nhave suggested--and I have joined them--is that we take advantage of \ntoday's low rates and that we lower rates on all the new loans to \nsomething below 5 percent, fix that rate for those students who get \ntheir loans this year, and allow them to participate in the income \nrepayment program so when they take a job they will not have to spend \ntoo much of their money repaying back the loan. In some cases, it can \nultimately be forgiven. There is also a cap on a consolidated loan, if \nthey choose to do that, which many do.\n  If we had a real disagreement about that, it would be one thing, but \nwe do not have a real disagreement. The House of Representatives, which \nis Republican, has passed a bill based on the same idea. The President \nof the United States, President Obama, presented a budget to the Senate \ntwo months ago based on the same idea.\n  The idea is very simple. If we are going to loan $133 billion this \nyear, let's loan the money to students at exactly what it costs the \ngovernment, which today is at about 1.75 percent, and let's add 3 \npercent to that--all of which goes back to the Department of Education \nfor the cost of collections, defaults, administration, so there is no \nprofit on the students.\n  Then, let's fix that loan rate. We say that if it is 4.75 today, it \nis 4.75 next year and 4.75 the next year for that loan. If the rates go \nup, the rates on new loans next year will reflect that increase. So it \nis fair to the students, and it is fair to the taxpayers. It is a \npermanent solution. It is the same idea the House has already passed. \nIt is the same idea the President has recommended. Yet our friends on \nthe other side are so intent on playing political games that they want \nto have two votes today. If I may say so, they should hire somebody to \ncome up with a better idea than they came up with. This is one of their \nweakest attempts at a political game I have seen in 10 years.\n  We have a permanent solution supported by the President, supported by \nthe House Republicans--all the same idea. Senate Democrats have come up \nwith a short-term fix for 40 percent of the loans. They leave 60 \npercent hanging high and dry. They raise taxes to do it. It is \nunconstitutional for them to do it because it originates a revenue bill \nin the Senate instead of the House. That is their weak idea.\n  Why are they not following the example of the Senator from Michigan \nand the Senator from Mississippi and working in a bipartisan way to get \na result? Why are they not following the same idea of the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Louisiana on the water resources bill \nand working in a bipartisan way to get a result? Why are they not \nfollowing the same idea the four Republicans and four Democrats did on \nthe immigration bill and working to get a result? Instead, they hold a \npolitical stunt at the White House. They now hold another political \nstunt on the Senate floor at a time when students are graduating from \nhigh school, looking forward to college, and would like to have a \npermanent solution on interest rates by July 1, which we can easily do.\n  I guess it is inevitable that the opening acts of the circus are \nsometimes going to be like this, but I regret it. I really did not come \nto the Senate to engage in this kind of thing. I would much rather sit \ndown with my Democratic colleagues, which I believe we can do, and I \nwould much rather sit down with the White House officials, which I \nbelieve we can do, and with the House of Representatives and spend the \nnext 3 weeks saying: Look, we all have the same idea. We have a serious \nissue. It affects millions of students.\n  So let's work together and show the country we can do this. It would \nbe a nice prelude to the immigration debate to show that we can not \nonly pass a water resources development bill and a farm bill but that \nwe can also solve the student loan problem on a bipartisan basis. Then, \nwe can take up this more difficult immigration question where we have \nsome real differences of opinion and really need to have a debate.\n  I am here to congratulate the Senator from North Carolina and the \nSenator from Oklahoma for their suggestion and to fully support it. I \nwill conclude by saying that there are two aspects to their bill that I \nbelieve are preferable to the version of this idea that passed the \nHouse and the version of this idea that was proposed by the President. \nRemember, it is the same idea in all three places--the President's \nbudget, the House of Representatives bill, and the Burr and Coburn \nproposal.\n  The first thing that Burr and Coburn propose is to have a single \ninterest rate for all student loans.\n  There are three types of student loans. It is very confusing even for \nthose of us who have been around this issue for a long time. Let's \nassume there is a single student rate and you are graduating from \nMaryville High School. What is the cost of money? Right now, if you get \na loan of any kind, it is going to be 4.75 percent. It is whatever it \ncosts the government to borrow the money plus 3 percent to cover the \nDepartment of Education's costs. I like that proposal.\n  Then the second thing they propose that I would suggest is preferable \nto the House of Representatives bill is that if you get a loan at 4.75 \npercent in 2013, it is still set at 4.75 percent in 2014, 2015, 2016, \nand 2017. It does not change over the life of the loan. The House bill \nwould have the interest rate on a loan going up each year. I do not \nlike that idea. I do not think many students would.\n  But I wish all of our serious issues opened with proposals from the \nPresident and the House of Representatives and Senate Republicans that \nwere as close together as we are on this issue. If we cannot come to an \nagreement on this issue before July 1, based on these three major \ncenters of influence all making the same proposals, then we ought to go \nback to seventh grade civics class. I do not think we all need to do \nthat. I think we know how to do our jobs.\n  This is the opening act of the circus. It will not take too long. It \nwill be a little embarrassing that we have to go through it, but after \nwe go through it, maybe we can sit down and a Senate full of grownups \nwill say: Let's take the President's idea and the House idea and the \nidea suggested by Senators Burr and Coburn, let's put it together, \nlet's congratulate all of those students who are going to colleges, and \nlet's encourage them and hope it is a ticket to the middle class. Let's \nshow that our country supports those students as they seek to advance \ntheir higher education.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an op-ed from \nthe New York Times yesterday written by Senator Coburn and Senator Burr \nand me.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 4, 2013]\n\n                   Playing Politics With Student Debt\n\n           (By Lamar Alexander, Tom Coburn and Richard Burr)\n\n       Washington.--This summer, more than nine million \n     undergraduates will take out an average of $6,700 each in \n     federal loans to pay for college next year. They will borrow, \n     on average, $24,803 to earn their degrees. While this \n     continues to be one of the smartest investments they will \n     ever make, Congress should take one step toward making it an \n     even smarter one.\n       We have introduced a proposal that would get rid of the \n     confusing and arbitrary way interest rates are determined on \n     federal student loans, and instead allow rates to be set by \n     the market. We commend President Obama for introducing a \n     similar proposal in his budget, and the House of \n     Representatives for recently passing similar legislation, on \n     a bipartisan basis, that offers a long-term, market-based \n     solution.\n       But we are worried that Senate Democrats, who could vote on \n     the issue as early as this week, will oppose a permanent \n     solution for 100 percent of loans and instead will merely \n     extend the existing, arbitrary rate for a minority of loans, \n     and for just two years--a politically easy move that will \n     only hurt students in the long run.\n       Over the past four years, the Federal Reserve has kept \n     interest rates at record-low levels, allowing banks to borrow \n     money from the federal government at nearly zero percent \n     interest and, in turn, offer low rates to individuals \n     borrowing money for the purchase of a home or a car or to \n     start a business.\n       But if you're a college student who has taken out a federal \n     loan during that time, you've seen no benefit at all from the \n     dirt-cheap borrowing costs. Instead, your interest rate was \n     set by Congress, which temporarily set some rates at 3.4 \n     percent for low-income students but left most rates at either \n     6.8 percent or 7.9 percent.\n       In other words, you could borrow money to buy a used car to \n     drive yourself to college and pay about 3 percent interest \n     over five years, while at the same time you could be paying \n     nearly 7 or 8 percent interest on the cost of your education.\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\n       That is, except on your federally subsidized Stafford \n     loans. Last year Congress extended a temporary provision, \n     first passed in 2007, to lower the 6.8 percent interest rate \n     on newly issued Stafford loans for low-income undergraduate \n     borrowers to 3.4 percent, for one year. The government pays \n     the interest for these loans while the borrower is in school.\n       Congress extended the interest rates for a year not because \n     it was good policy, or because 3.4 percent is some ideal rate \n     for loans, but largely because student debt had become a \n     political issue in the presidential campaign. In the end, the \n     one-year extension cost taxpayers nearly $6 billion, but \n     saved a mere $9 a month in future repayments for the 40 \n     percent of student borrowers who receive subsidized Stafford \n     loans.\n       Congress is now approaching the end of that temporary \n     ``fix.'' On July 1, those rates will return to 6.8 percent--\n     which is why it is important for the Senate to make the right \n     fix, right now.\n       Student debt shouldn't be grist for the political mill. \n     Congress must provide certainty and stability to student \n     borrowers.\n       Our legislation would tie all federal student-loan interest \n     rates to the 10-year Treasury rate (currently 1.75 percent), \n     plus 3 percentage points to cover the costs of collections, \n     defaults and other risk factors. That would benefit students \n     and families by cutting rates on almost all federal student \n     loans to a little under 5 percent for the coming school year.\n       Under our proposal, interest rates will remain the same \n     over the lifetime of a loan, but the rate on a loan taken out \n     in 2013 might differ from one taken out in 2014, because \n     market rates vary.\n       One big advantage of our proposal is consistency: the \n     confusion over differing rates on Stafford loans and \n     unsubsidized federal PLUS loans would end, since one rate \n     formula would be used for all federal education loans.\n       Our plan would also protect students by using the existing \n     income-based repayment program, which allows borrowers to \n     reduce their monthly payments based on a capped percentage of \n     their discretionary income and ultimately have those loans \n     forgiven after a period of time. This is a better solution \n     than capping future increases in interest rates, and one that \n     the president's own budget proposal endorses.\n       Taxpayers would be protected, too. When the economy \n     recovers and interest rates return to historical norms, \n     taxpayers will no longer be subsidizing artificially low \n     interest rates.\n       Our proposal has some differences from the president's plan \n     and the House-passed bill--for example, the president \n     proposes three different interest rates for different types \n     of loans, while ours has just one interest rate for all \n     direct federal student loans, and the House bill applies a \n     variable interest rate that resets each year, while our \n     interest rate remains the same for the life of the loan.\n       But all of us embrace the same idea: we should stop playing \n     politics with student loan debt and move to a simpler and \n     fairer system, one that will immediately lower borrowing \n     costs for all students while protecting taxpayers and \n     providing certainty for the future. We hope Senate Democrats \n     will agree.\n       Lamar Alexander, Tom Coburn and Richard Burr are Republican \n     senators from Tennessee, Oklahoma and North Carolina, \n     respectively.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided between the votes scheduled for 10 a.m. and \nthat all after the first vote be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, as we come to our vote now on cloture on \nthe bill--what we have dubbed the farm bill, the Agriculture Reform, \nFood and Jobs Act--I first wish to thank my ranking member, the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, for a wonderful working \nrelationship as we have moved to this point. He and his staff have been \nworking diligently, as has my staff. We are proud of all of our staffs, \nwho I think are terrific and have done a wonderful job to get us to \nthis point.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that the vote we are about to take \naffects 16 million jobs. I have said that so many times, but it is \nimportant to say again. I do not think there will be a single bill on \nthis floor that affects more jobs for Americans than the one on which \nwe are about to vote--16 million jobs in America. That is how many \npeople depend on agriculture and the food industry for their jobs. They \nare watching us today. They are hoping that once again this body on a \nbipartisan basis will do what is right and provide the leadership to \nmove this bill forward.\n  This particular bill includes 38 amendments that were passed on the \nfloor during our debate last year, as we considered 73 amendments just \na few months ago, and another 14 amendments that we added to the bill \nthis year. So I appreciate the input colleagues have had to make this a \nstrong farm bill with major reforms and real deficit reduction. This is \nan opportunity to cut spending by more than $24 billion. We in \nAgriculture have done more than any other part of the Federal budget to \nnot only meet what are the across-the-board sequester numbers but \nprovide deficit reduction that is four times more than that while \nstreamlining and providing effective policy for agriculture, \nconservation, nutrition, and the other parts of this bill.\n  So we are not only standing with 16 million people whose jobs depend \non agriculture, we are doing it in a responsible way that cuts the \ndeficit. We are eliminating direct payments, moving toward a market-\nbased risk management system for our farmers. We are strengthening \nconservation to protect our soil and water resources for generations to \ncome, with a streamlined conservation title and a new historic \nagreement between conservation and farm groups. We are focusing on \nbeginning farmers to get more people into farming. We all have a stake \nin making sure that happens.\n  We are helping our veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan to \nget started in agriculture as well. I am very proud of this portion of \nthe bill which will reach out to those coming home, most from small \ncommunities around our country, to help them be able to get started in \nfarming and keep us with the most affordable, most abundant, and safest \nfood supply in the world.\n  Agriculture is truly one of the brightest spots of our economy. It is \none of the few areas in which we actually have a trade surplus. The \npolicies in this legislation are a big part of that. That is why more \nthan 100 groups representing agriculture, conservation, nutrition, and \nevery part of the economy represented by this bill have called on the \nSenate this morning to vote yes on cloture.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter we \nreceived be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 5, 2013.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sen. Reid: The undersigned organizations are writing \n     to strongly urge you to vote for cloture tomorrow on the \n     consideration of S. 954, the Agriculture Reform, Food, and \n     Jobs Act of 2013.\n       This bill was crafted in a bipartisan fashion and reported \n     out of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \n     Forestry by a vote of 15-5. It contains major reforms as well \n     as spending cuts to be used to reduce the Federal budget \n     deficit.\n       This bill affects 16 million Americans whose livelihoods \n     depend on agriculture. We must pass a farm bill this year to \n     provide certainty to those individuals. We must cut \n     unnecessary spending. We must ensure that consumers will \n     continue to have a safe, healthy and affordable food supply. \n     We must provide an effective farm and natural resource safety \n     net. We must invest in initiatives that boost exports, and \n     spur innovations in new industries.\n       It is vitally important that the Senate support the cloture \n     motion and finish the farm bill in the next few days.\n           Sincerely,\n       Advocates for Better Children's Diets; AGP; AgFirst; \n     AgriBank; AgStar Financial Services; American Association of \n     Crop Insurers; American Beekeeping Federation; American Farm \n     Bureau Federation; American Farmland Trust; American Feed \n     Industry Association; American Malting Barley Association; \n     American Pulse Association; American Society of Agronomy; \n     American Society of Farm Manager and Rural Appraisers; \n     American Soybean Association; American Sugar Alliance; \n     American Veterinary Medical Association; Apple Processors \n     Association; Associated Milk Producers Inc.; Association of \n     Equipment Manufacturers; Association of Fish and Wildlife \n     Agencies; American Sheep Industry Association; American \n     Soybean Association; Audubon; Blue Diamond Growers; \n     California Association of Winegrape Growers; California \n     Avocado Commission; California Canning Peach Association; \n     California Date Commission; California Dried Plum Board; \n     California Fig Advisory Board; California Strawberry \n     Commission; California Walnut Commission.\n       Ceres Solutions LLP; CHS; CoBank; Continental Dairy \n     Products; Cooperative Network; Crop Insurance Professionals \n     Association; Crop Science Society of America; CropLife \n     America; Dairy Farmers of America, Inc.; Dairy Farmers \n     Working Together; Dairy Producers of New Mexico; Dairylea \n     Cooperative Inc.; Ducks Unlimited; Farm Credit Bank of Texas; \n     Farm Credit Council; Farm Credit East; Farm Credit West; \n     FarmFirst\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\n     Dairy Cooperative; Farmer Mac; Florida Fruit and Vegetable \n     Association; Growth Energy; GROWMARK; Holstein Association \n     USA, Inc.; Idaho Dairymen's Association; Irrigation \n     Association; Iowa State Dairy Association; Izaak Walton \n     League of America; Kansas Cooperative Council; Land O'Lakes, \n     Inc.; Land Improvement Contractors of America; Land Trust \n     Alliance; Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Cooperative \n     Association, Inc.; Michigan Milk Producers Association; \n     Midwest Dairy Coalition Milk Producers Council; Missouri \n     Dairy Association; Montana Stockgrowers Association; National \n     Association of Conservation Districts; National Association \n     of RC Councils; National Association of Wheat Growers; \n     National Barley Growers Association; National Cattlemen's \n     Beef Association; National Conservation District Employees \n     Association; National Corn Growers Association; National \n     Cotton Council; National Council of Farmer Cooperatives; \n     National Farmers Union.\n       National Grape Cooperative Association Inc.; National Milk \n     Producers Federation; National Pork Producers Council; \n     National Sorghum Producers; National Sunflower Association; \n     National Turkey Federation; National Wildlife Federation; \n     Nebraska Cooperative Council; North American Blueberry \n     Council; Northwest Dairy Association/Darigold; Oregon Cherry \n     Growers, Inc.; Oregon Dairy Farmers Association; Pheasants \n     Forever; Plains Cotton Cooperative Association; Public Lands \n     Council; Quails Forever; Select Milk Producers, Inc.; Soil \n     and Water Conservation Society; Soil Science Society of \n     America; South Dakota Wheat Growers; South East Dairy Farmers \n     Association; Southern Peanut Farmers Federation; Southern \n     States; Southwest Council of Agribusiness; Sunkist Growers; \n     Sunsweet Growers Inc.; The Nature Conservancy; The Trust for \n     Public Land; Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership; US \n     Cattlemen's Association; US Canola Association; US Dry Bean \n     Council; USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council; USA Rice Federation; \n     US Rice Producers Association; United Dairymen of Arizona; \n     Valley Fig Growers Virginia State Dairymen's Association; \n     Welch Foods Inc., A Cooperative; Western Growers; Western \n     Peanut Growers Association; Yankee Farm Credit.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would ask colleagues once again to come together and \nvote yes on the 16 million jobs that agriculture and the food industry \nsupport. I would ask colleagues to vote yes on major reforms. We have \neliminated over 100 authorizations and programs that were duplicative, \ndid not work anymore, and were not the right thing to do from a \ntaxpayer standpoint. We have consolidated in a way that has not been \ndone, I would argue, for decades in this area of policy. We have \nreduced the deficit by more than the last bill--$24 billion.\n  I would ask colleagues to come together to keep this bill moving and \nto keep agriculture growing our economy and creating jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan in urging the Senate to move forward with this \ncompromise bill that has been developed by the Committee on Agriculture \nand is now before the Senate for a cloture vote. We need to pass this \nbill. It provides a framework to help farmers and ranchers in all \nregions of the country manage their risks more effectively. It \nconsolidates 23 conservation programs into 13. It contains improvements \nto nutrition programs. It addresses fraud and abuse. It also reduces \nthe cost of covered programs by $24 billion.\n  This bill reflects a real sense of fiscal responsibility but still \nprovides a strong safety net for producers. I thank and congratulate \nthe distinguished Senator from Michigan, the chair of our committee, \nfor her hard work and her strong leadership. She has managed the \nlegislation with skill and a commitment to meet the needs of \nagriculture producers as well as American consumers.\n  I urge the Senate to approve the motion to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Two minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will claim our first minute, obviously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the bill before us now, like the House GOP \nbill, fails the first policy test of do no harm. It is worse for \nstudents over the long term than if we even let the rate double. These \nare CBO projections. If we, again, adopt the next bill which leaves the \ninterest rates at 3.4 percent--that is this sign here--that is what \nstudents would pay in interest. If we let it double--this is the white \nline. If we adopt the Republican bill, as you can see, in 2 years \nstudents will be paying more over the next 10 years in interest rates \nthan if we even let it double.\n  Here is the bottom line on it: If we keep the rates at 3.4 percent, a \nstudent\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\nwho starts college next year, goes for 4 years, borrows the maximum of \n$19,000, will pay $3,510 in interest over 10 years. That is the life of \na Stafford loan. If we adopt the Republicans' bill, that same student \nborrowing that same amount of money will pay $6,590 in interest over 10 \nyears. This is the worst possible approach. You shouldn't reduce the \ndeficit on the backs of students who can't even discharge this in \nbankruptcy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I urge a ``yes'' vote because this is a \npermanent solution for 100 percent of the student loans. It reduces \nrates for every single student's new loan. It has no profit on the \nstudent. It fixes the rate for the time of the loan, and it is the same \nidea as already passed by the House. It is the same idea as supported \nby the President's budget. There are only minor differences between the \nPresident, the House, and this proposal. If we can't agree on this, we \ncan't agree on anything.\n  This is a manufactured crisis. Their proposal is a short-term \npolitical fix for 40 percent of the loans. This proposal is a permanent \nsolution for 100 percent of the loans that would lower rates to below 5 \npercent; the same idea as in the President's budget, the same idea as \npassed by the House.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, in 1992 the Congress created the Direct Loan \nProgram. When this program was originated, the loans to students were \nat variable rates. Let me say to my colleagues this morning, Congress \nnow sets the rates. We changed that in 2006.\n  The bill you will talk about now--let me just pose this to you: If \nyou believe it is appropriate for Congress to pick winners and losers, \nthen support this bill. If you believe it is appropriate for Congress \nto subsidize 40 percent of the student loan population and overcharge \nthe other 60 percent of the student loan population, then vote for this \nbill. If you believe that is not the congressional role and that we \nneed a long-term, permanent, transparent, predictable solution, then \nvote against this bill and let's sit down between now and July 1 and \nwrite a bipartisan approach that solves this problem once and for all.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate will have a cloture vote \non the motion to proceed to S. 953, the Student Loan Affordability Act, \ncontinuing a disturbing pattern when it comes to the consideration and \nprocessing of legislation under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, of which I am the ranking member.\n  This legislation contains revenue-raising measures that should be \nconsidered in the Finance Committee before coming to the floor. Yet, \nonce again, the Senate Democratic leadership has opted to bypass the \ncommittee by way of Senate rule XIV.\n  If the majority leader succeeds in proceeding to S. 953, I plan to \noffer a motion to commit the bill to the Finance Committee.\n  There is bipartisan support for reforming tax incentives for \neducation. If the opportunity arises, my motion could be crafted in \nsuch a way to focus the Finance Committee's efforts on reforming these \nincentives in short order. Millions of American families and students \nwould be well-served by such reforms.\n  In any event, any legislation addressing these incentives should be \nconsidered through regular order, which means full and fair \nconsideration in the Senate Finance Committee. I intend to work to make \nsure that takes place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, On July 1, the interest rates will double \nfor the most vulnerable students in our society. Access to college, \nwhich is fundamental to our growth, our prosperity, and individual \nadvancement will be compromised for 7 million low-and moderate income \nstudents in this country.\n  Republicans have a long-term proposal, but they do not have a long-\nterm solution because it is not just about interest rates, it is about \ncollege costs. It is about refinancing the huge amount of debt that \nfamilies have today--not just families but students--debt they may \nnever be able to pay off. First, we need the time to work on a long-\nterm solution; but, second, we need to reassure vulnerable individuals \nand families that their rates will not double. Student debt today is \nthe second largest debt for American households. We cannot let it go \nany further. Their proposal not only will not solve the problem because \nit doesn't deal with all aspects, but it will increase student debt for \nborrowers with financial need on July 1.\n  Instead, I urge passage of our proposal, the Student Loan \nAffordability Act.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak about an amazing West \nVirginia family who is celebrating the 75th anniversary of their small \nbusiness this week on June 8. Jim Tweel founded Jim's Steak and \nSpaghetti House in 1938 when he purchased the Kennedy Dairy Store and \nrenamed it Jim's Dairy Bar.\n  The restaurant specialized in burgers and milkshakes until 1944, when \nRoberto Elmoro, an Italian native, approached Jim about starting a \nspaghetti house using Elmoro's own personal recipes. Jim agreed and \nexpanded the restaurant to the room next-door. Hence, the Spaghetti \nHouse opened in July of 1944.\n  Since that time the restaurant has been renamed and remodeled, but \nthe values of the restaurant have remained the same: to give customers \nexcellent service and outstanding food. Located in the heart of \nHuntington on 5th Avenue, Jim's Steak and Spaghetti House offers great \nfood, from homemade spaghetti, soup and sandwiches, to fresh coleslaw, \npickled beets, and tasty pies. Over the years I think I have tasted and \nenjoyed all of them.\n  But this family-owned-and-operated business offers so much more to \nits loyal clientele and visitors alike, because this is not just a \nrestaurant, this is a landmark and an institution. As you step in the \ndoors, you travel through time and are greeted by a smile from \neverybody. With its 1950-style decor, Jim's walls are adorned with \nphotos of the restaurant's creator posing with some of the most \nrenowned public figures and celebrities who have stopped by for a meal, \npeople such as President John F. Kennedy, President Bill Clinton, \nPresident George Bush, Dustin Hoffman, Bill Cosby, and Muhammad Ali.\n  In fact, many West Virginians also travel from miles away to get to \nJim's because the restaurant is one of the most famous spots in our \nState. Folks from the Tweel family are not only successful business \nleaders but also community advocates who are committed to making a \npositive difference in Huntington and the Tri-State region.\n  Jim Tweel established his recipe of success 75 years ago based on \nfive principles: good service, good food, courtesy, cleanness, and \nambience. Even though Jim Tweel is no longer with us, those same \nprinciples still guide the family-owned and community institution that \nis now run by Jim's daughter Jimmie.\n  Small businesses are the heart and soul of West Virginia's economy. \nIt has always been one of my top priorities to make sure small \nbusinesses have the support they need to be successful and create good-\npaying jobs in West Virginia.\n  I wish to congratulate and recognize the Tweel family for their \nsuccesses, especially 95-year-old Sally Rahall Tweel, Jim's wife and \none of the current owners, as well as Jim's children: Jimmie Tweel \nCarter, the restaurant manager; Larry Tweel, the company president; and \nRon Tweel, an officer of the corporation.\n  Their strong work ethic, their passion for the business, and their \nlove of their community, all of which have been passed down from \ngeneration to generation, represent the very best our State, the great \nState of West Virginia, has to offer. Congratulations on 75 wonderful \nyears.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak briefly about a \nheartrending situation in Pennsylvania to wich I wish to call my \ncolleagues' attention. As I speak this morning, there is a brave little \n10-year-old girl who is fighting for her life in Children's Hospital of \nPhiladelphia.\n  Sarah Murnaghan suffers from cystic fibrosis. She has been in the \nhospital for 3 months now. Recently, she has been put on a machine that \nhelps her breathe, with great difficulty. But she is at a point now \nwhere she needs a lung transplant. There is no question\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\nabout that. The doctors, in fact, have said she may only have a few \nweeks to live without a new lung.\n  At this moment, her government is failing her. Here is the reason I \nsay that. We have law and we have policy that requires that the Health \nand Human Services branch of the Federal Government, through a third \nparty, develop rules governing how organs are transplanted. This \norganization which has the direct authority is the Organ Procurement \nand Transportation Network.\n  So they set the rules by which we deal with this excruciating \nsituation where there is always more demand for transplanted organs \nthan the supply of organs. Prior to a decision yesterday afternoon, \nwhich I will comment on, despite a very high need for a transplant and \ndespite the fact that her doctors believe she is a very good candidate \nfor a transplant, Sarah's name was not on the list of people to receive \na transplant simply by virtue of one fact; that is, she has not yet \nreached the age of 12.\n  See, the current policy has one very sensible feature. The current \npolicy is meant to establish as the highest priority for recipients \npeople who have the most urgent need. That makes sense. You could have \nother criteria, such as how long you have been waiting or how much you \nare willing to pay, but I do not think those would be better. Those \nwould be worse.\n  The right criteria is who has the most urgent need. So that is right. \nThe problem is it applies only to people who are 12 and over. But there \nare children under the age of 12 who are very good candidates for adult \nlung transplants. The medical science is very clear. You take a portion \nof the lung if the child is too small for a full lung transplant. This \nis well established. This works. This girl is a good candidate for \nthis, but she is not on the list.\n  Yesterday, something very important happened. Sarah's parents filed a \nsuit against Health and Human Services challenging the rule that \nexcludes their daughter from this list. The judge considering this, a \njudge in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, a Federal judge, Judge \nBaylson, granted a temporary restraining order enjoining the Secretary \nand the Organ Procurement and Transportation Network from applying the \nrule that excludes Sarah.\n  So this is terrific. This is a big breakthrough for 10 days now. This \nis the thing. It is a temporary order for 10 days now Sarah cannot be \nexcluded from this list. So what that means is she can go on the list \nand she will go wherever on the list the urgency of her circumstances \nputs her. That is as it should be.\n  The problem is this is only for 10 days, and then the judge is going \nto have a hearing. We don't know how that is all going to turn out\n  I am asking Secretary Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, to exercise the authority that is given to her in legislation \nto recognize that there is a flaw in this policy.\n  I am not asking Secretary Sebelius to make an exception for one \nindividual. I would be the first to suggest that would be a dangerous \nplace to go. We don't want individual Cabinet members, politicians, or \nanyone else making decisions about who is going to get an organ and who \nis not. We want a system that works. The current system doesn't work \nfor kids who are good transplant candidates and have the acute need but \naren't yet 12 years old.\n  I am urging Secretary Sebelius, as strongly as I can, to exercise the \ndiscretion that the law gives to her to change the policy. Don't change \nit for one person, change it for a category. I think any child who is a \nviable candidate for the adult transplant and who has sufficient \nurgency ought to be able to go on the adult list. That is not to say \nthat they automatically go to the top of the list. Their ranking on the \nlist ought to be determined by the urgency of their circumstances, as \nit should be for everyone else.\n  I would argue we are not suggesting that we make an exception for \nSarah. What I am suggesting in a way is the opposite: Stop making \nexceptions that exclude Sarah. She is a good candidate. The doctors \nbelieve this.\n  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is one of the best children's \nhospitals in the world. Nobody disputes that. Her doctors are some of \nthe best doctors in the world. This is vitally important. The life of a \nsmall child depends on this. I don't know how many other children might \nbe in similar circumstances.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to rise and make this case. Again, I \njust want to stress that we are not asking for an exception for one \nindividual to be chosen over others. We are asking for a change in a \npolicy that is flawed; that is currently excluding somebody from being \non the list to be an organ donor recipient who ought to be on that \nlist.\n  I am grateful to Judge Baylson for the decision he made, but that is \na temporary restraining order that will only last 10 days. If a \ntransplant does not occur within that 10 days, then Sarah and any other \nchildren in her circumstances, their future becomes uncertain after \nthat.\n  I urge the Secretary to take the action that is necessary.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3979-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3979-S3981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I had hoped to be able to come down today \nand call up an amendment to the pending legislation, the farm bill. I \nunderstand we are not currently on the bill but, rather, in morning \nbusiness. I hope to have the opportunity to try to get an amendment \npending.\n  We have been trying now for several days to have amendments \nconsidered to the farm bill. This is a germane amendment. It is very \nrelevant to the bill. It is one that I think the Senate, the full \nSenate, ought to have an opportunity to debate and ultimately to vote \non. It is very unfortunate, in my view, that we are where we are on a \npiece of legislation that has this much consequence for our economy, \nfor farm country, and for consumers across this country.\n  This is a bill that is a major piece of legislation. Unfortunately, \nwe have not had the opportunity in the course of the days that we have \nbeen on the bill to get up amendments pending, debated, and voted on.\n  I can't tell you how disappointing that is to those of us who come \nfrom farm country and wish to try to shape the best farm bill we \npossibly can in the Senate, so that when we go to conference, which I \nhope we will, with the House of Representatives, we would be in the \nbest position possible to have a bill that addresses the important \nneeds of farmers and ranchers across this country with regard to \ncertainty from a multiyear farm bill. This would also be a bill that we \ncan defend to the American taxpayers, a bill that is reform oriented. \nIt moves us into the future of agriculture, not the past.\n  The amendment I had hoped to offer today, amendment No. 1092, amends \nthe commodity title of the farm bill that we have been debating. Last \nyear the Senate passed its farm bill by a vote of 64 to 35. Sixty-four \nSenators voted for a farm bill that most of us believe offered a level \nof reform that we could support and defend to the American taxpayer.\n  As several of my colleagues and I pointed out during the debate on \nthe farm bill in the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, we \nhave deep concerns over what we believe is a step backwards in the \ncommodity title with the creation of the adverse market payments, or \nwhat we refer to as the AMP Program. This program takes a step \nbackwards from last year's farm bill by recreating a program with \ncountercyclical payments and fixed target prices.\n  In fact, I would argue this is a policy that goes back. This policy \npredates cell phones. This policy predates the Internet. This is going \nback to 1980s-type farm policies. Last year's Senate farm bill \ncompletely eliminated this program, which meant we could honestly say \nwe had passed a reform-minded farm bill, a farm bill that is more \ninterested in policies that are about the future rather than the past, \nthat are about the market, that are about making sure we have a \nnecessary safety net in place for our farmers but\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\ndoing it in a way that is defensible to the American taxpayer and moves \nus on the path to reform.\n  Our concerns are not crop specific. There has been a lot of \ndiscussion about this being something between the Midwest or the South \nor regional. This is not a crop-specific concern; this is a policy-\nspecific concern. An outdated target price program is not--is not--what \nmost producers in this country asked us for in a new farm bill--just \nthe opposite.\n  Almost every member of the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \nCommittee was told by our producers that a sound crop insurance program \nis a much higher priority. Amendment No. 1092 is simply a response to \nthe wishes of most farmers in the United States. This amendment strikes \nthe newly created AMP Program and places peanuts and rice back into the \nARC Program or, to put it simply, this amendment replaces the commodity \ntitle in the bill that we have before us and replaces it with a reform-\nminded, market-oriented commodity title that was included in the farm \nbill that we passed last year.\n  I do not believe Congress is capable of setting accurate fixed prices \nfor the next 5 years because that is precisely what the commodity title \nis in this bill. The House bill commodity title is even much worse in \nthat respect. It has Congress setting, by statute--we, as Members of \nCongress are basically setting fixed prices for the next 5 years. The \nmarket, not Congress and not the USDA, should be setting prices for \ntitle I commodities.\n\n  If fixed target prices are set too high and commodity prices drop, \nhistory has proven farmers will once again begin planting for a \ngovernment program rather than in response to market signals. This not \nonly creates a potential unnecessary liability for taxpayers, but it \nalso increases the risk of overproduction and negative impacts on \nglobal markets, making certain crops subject to possible WTO disputes.\n  This amendment not only moves us to the reforms we included in last \nyear's farm bill, it also saves taxpayers more than $3 billion. That \nincreases the total savings in this bill by more than 12 percent. That \nis $3 billion that most of our farmers have told us we don't need to \nspend. This is something the American farmer, the producers out there \nhave made very, very clear and of which I would argue the American \ntaxpayer would be very supportive.\n  I urge my colleagues, if we get the opportunity to debate this, to \nultimately support this amendment because it would recapture the level \nof reform we had in last year's farm bill and save $3 billion at the \nsame time.\n  There are many amendments that were filed to this bill that are not \ngetting debated, that are not getting voted on. This is one in \nparticular to the commodity title of the bill that saves over $3 \nbillion from the bill before us today--over $3 billion in savings--by \nmoving toward a market-oriented policy as opposed to a high fixed \ntarget price policy where the Congress sets in statute the target \nprices rather than having the market determine what those prices ought \nto be. That is one amendment I have offered to the commodity title of \nthe bill.\n  I have another amendment to the SNAP or food title or nutrition title \nof the bill which would save $2 billion out of overhead administrative \ncosts. It doesn't affect beneficiaries or income or asset eligibility \nstandards; it simply finds savings in the food stamp program that are \nrelated to overhead administrative costs and saves $2 billion. We ought \nto be voting on that.\n  We ought to have an opportunity to debate these things and vote on \nthese amendments. I know colleagues of mine as well have offered \namendments that save dollars and make this a more responsible farm \npolicy--a policy that is oriented toward reform and that achieves a \nsignificant amount of savings for the American taxpayer.\n  So I want to say again what I said at the beginning of my remarks; \nthat is, it is unfortunate that we are where we are--debating a bill \nthat over a decade will cost nearly $1 trillion. Of course, about 80 \npercent of that is in the nutrition title of the bill. But we have an \nopportunity to actually improve this as it moves across the floor of \nthe Senate and proceeds into a conference with the House of \nRepresentatives, where they will have passed a bill out of the \nAgriculture Committee which will head to the floor and has high fixed \ntarget prices--higher fixed target prices than are included in the \nSenate bill--and high fixed target prices for all commodities, as \nopposed to the Senate bill, which has them simply for rice and for \npeanuts.\n  We are looking at heading down a path that takes us not to the future \nbut to the past--to a time when farmers were farming for the government \nprogram rather than farming for the market; to a time when there were \nlots of potential disputes because these are trade-distorting, market-\ndistorting policies that are driven by government as opposed to being \ndriven by the market. We can do so much better, and we should do so \nmuch better for our producers across this country and for the taxpayers \nwho ultimately foot the bill.\n  The amendment I have would do that. It would save over $3 billion in \nthe commodity title of the bill, it is market-oriented reform, and it \nis something we ought to be considering and debating in the Senate. It \nis incredibly unfortunate that we are not having that opportunity.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an amendment to \nthe farm bill on a subject important not only to the farmers of Maine \nbut also to the participants in the WIC program. I am pleased that \nSenator Mark Udall has joined as the lead cosponsor of the amendment, \nwhich would require that all fresh fruits and vegetables, including \nfresh white potatoes, be included in the final USDA rule. Specifically, \nthe amendment would only allow fresh, whole, or cut vegetables to be \nincluded--vegetables with added sugars, fats, or oils would be \nprohibited.\n  The proposed final USDA rule for the Special Supplemental Nutrition \nProgram for Women, Infants, and Children, WIC, food package, which went \ninto effect in December 2009, includes a ban on the purchase of fresh \nwhite potatoes by WIC participants. Fresh potatoes are the only fruit \nor vegetable to be excluded, which sends a message to WIC participants \nthat USDA believes that potatoes are not healthy.\n  The USDA has said that the proposed ban on fresh white potatoes is \nbased on a 2005 National Academies' Institute of Medicine, IOM, report, \nwhich considered recommendations of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for \nAmericans, DGA, and includes consumption data nearly 20 years old. The \nsubsequently published 2010 DGA, however, recommends 5 to 6 cups of \nstarchy vegetables per week for women with a daily caloric intake of \n1,800 to 2,400 calories--an increase of 2 to 3 cups per week from the \n2005 DGA. USDA has yet to update the rule to reflect the most recent \nDGA.\n  The 2010 DGA lists four ``nutrients of concern''--potassium, dietary \nfiber, calcium, and Vitamin D. The guidelines state that dietary intake \nof these four nutrients ``are low enough to be of public health concern \nfor both adults and children.'' Since USDA is concerned about a lack of \nthese nutrients in the American diet, it would make sense for the \nDepartment to promote good sources of these critical nutrients. Yet the \nDepartment's proposed WIC rule eliminates a vegetable such as the \npotato that is an excellent source of these nutrients. USDA should not \nlimit the availability of the potato but instead should encourage its \nhealthy preparation and consumption. In a rather puzzling example of \ninconsistency, while the newest WIC regulations will no longer allow \nWIC mothers, infants, and children to buy white potatoes, if those same \nparticipants get benefits from the WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition \nProgram, some States may allow them to purchase white potatoes at a \nfarmers' market.\n  Consider the following nutritional facts about potatoes that are \noften overlooked: potatoes have more potassium than bananas, a food \ncommonly associated with this nutrient; potatoes are cholesterol free, \nfat free, and sodium free, and can be served in countless healthy ways; \na medium-baked potato contains 15 percent of the daily recommended \nvalue of dietary fiber, 27 percent of the daily recommended value for \nVitamin B6, and 28 percent of the daily recommended value of Vitamin C.\n  It only makes common sense to include a healthy, locally grown, and \nnutritious vegetable such as the fresh white potato in the WIC package \nand I\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\nbelieve the sound recommendations in the 2010 DGA support this. The \nCollins-Udall of Colorado amendment would achieve this by requiring \nthat all fresh fruits and vegetables, including fresh white potatoes, \nbe included in the final USDA rule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3981-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   PRIVATE FIRST CLASS CODY J. TOWSE\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I address the \nSenate today, as I rise to honor a recently fallen soldier. PFC Cody J. \nTowse, one of Utah's finest, was killed last month when his patrol was \nhit by an improvised explosive device in Kandahar Province, \nAfghanistan.\n  PFC Towse loved to help others. He served as a combat medic in the \nArmy, and was a certified EMT and a volunteer firefighter prior to \nenlistment. He put his special skills to use in serving the United \nStates by saving other soldiers. He recently received a Combat Medic \naward for performing his medical duties while being actively engaged by \nthe enemy.\n  Before enlisting in the Army, Cody started a blog to chronicle his \ntime in the military, which he hoped would help other prospective \nrecruits. His blog is filled with comical posts, as well as insightful \ntruths and prophetic statements. In his first post, he wrote, ``I've \nnever been quite so excited for anything in my life. I've grown tired \nof living a mediocre life and can't wait to start a journey full of \nresponsibility, honor, and dedication.'' PFC Towse lived up to that \nideal, and left a shining example for the world to follow.\n  A Utah newspaper wrote that PFC Towse ``was known as the `Candy \nDoctor'--a name he earned by showering the children with countless \nhandfuls of fruity or chocolate treats.'' His father, Jim Towse said \nthat Cody ``was my boy. He was me. I love old cars, he loves old cars. \nSeems like everything I love, he loved.'' Their special relationship \nwas the kind that only a father and his son could have. Jim also said, \n``It comforts me to know [Cody] went for a noble cause. He told me, \n`You know, Dad, if I go out in a blaze of glory, don't worry. If I can \nsave somebody doing it, all the better.' ''\n  In another blog post, written just before leaving for Afghanistan, \nPFC Towse poignantly wrote of the deeper thoughts and conflicting \nfeelings our soldiers often face:\n\n       I feel like we all walk a fine edge, emotionally at least. \n     A man can't sit around and contemplate the impending \n     possibility of his death all day or he'll go crazy. It can be \n     just as bad for a man to sit around and joke like nothing \n     could ever happen to him and breed a lackadaisical outlook on \n     his mission and get himself or his buddies killed.\n       Now I'm just rambling. I guess in short I just wanted to \n     say that sometimes the biggest obstacle a man faces is \n     himself and his mind. Yeah, that sounded educated, I'll go \n     with that.\n\n  Indeed, each of us would do well to remember and apply the truth of \nwhich PFC Towse wrote. In order to overcome challenges in our lives, we \nmust first overcome our own fears and perceived inadequacies. I believe \nthat Cody Towse lived his life according to this truth.\n  His commander in Afghanistan reported that when the patrol was \nattacked, PFC Towse began assisting the wounded. As PFC Towse was \nperforming his duties, a second IED was detonated and the resulting \ninjuries took his life. When I heard of Cody's story, I was reminded of \nChrist's teaching: ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay \ndown his life for his friends.'' PFC Towse's dutiful actions were \nunquestionably an ultimate display of love for his brothers in arms.\n  I imagine that Cody, like many of our service men and women, would \ndeny the claim that he is a hero. To Cody, and all of our soldiers, I \nwould say that you are among the few heroes left in our modern world. \nAs Americans, we all feel a profound sense of pride and honor when we \nsee a uniformed soldier, and we would be wise to remember our heroes in \nall that we do, especially in this body.\n  I thank PFC Cody J. Towse for his honorable service in defense of the \nConstitution and our freedom, and I thank all of our men and women who \nhave also given the ultimate sacrifice. I would like to convey my \ncondolences and profound gratitude to Cody's parents, Jim and Jamie, \nhis brothers Will and Christian, and his sister Callan. Our thoughts \nand prayers are with you. It is my solemn hope that we, as Senators, \nwill always remember the tremendous sacrifice, laid upon the altar of \nfreedom, of our brave soldiers and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3981-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OFFICE OF RURAL EDUCATION POLICY ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I was proud to join Senator Baucus \nfrom Montana in introducing legislation on Tuesday to establish an \nOffice of Rural Education Policy at the Department of Education. \nSenator Baucus has been a tireless advocate for many issues affecting \nrural States like Montana and West Virginia, and I have been proud to \nwork with him on several rural issues over the years. Notably, Senator \nBaucus and I are fortunate to have terrific partners in our work to \nimprove rural education, including a diverse array of organizations \nthat support this bill.\n  Nearly one quarter of the students in America attend rural schools \nand the share of students in rural schools is increasing and more than \nhalf of the schools in West Virginia are in rural areas. This \nlegislation will support these schools because it creates an Office in \nthe Department of Education to make sure that Federal programs related \nto education are working for students in schools in rural areas.\n  Schools in rural communities face special challenges but, they also \nhave unique capabilities. Many of them continue to face shrinking local \ntax bases, difficulties recruiting and retaining teachers and \nprincipals, limited access to advanced courses, and proportionally \nhigher transportation costs. At the same time, while smaller schools \nlack economies of scale, they may benefit from this small size and \ncloseness to their communities. Parental involvement and support is \ntypically high, and the potential for innovation is great.\n  I am very proud of the communities in West Virginia and how they come \ntogether, often on their own time and with their own resources, to \nimprove and support their local schools. Schools in West Virginia are \nalso leaders in the use of distance learning given the geographical \nobstacles of our mountainous State. But, we need to make sure rural \nschools, including many in West Virginia, have the tools to succeed and \naccess to the same opportunities that many schools in urban areas have, \nincluding health care, technology, and education.\n  The Office of Rural Education Policy is modeled after the successful \nOffice of Rural Health Policy at the Department of Health and Human \nServices, which Congress established in 1987. The Office will be led by \na director charged with coordinating the activities of the Department \nof Education concerning rural education. It will establish and maintain \na clearinghouse for issues faced by rural schools, such as teacher and \nprincipal recruitment and retention; partnerships with community-based \norganizations; and financing of rural schools.\n  The office will identify innovative research and demonstration \nprojects on rural schools, and recommend research to bridge any gaps. \nIt will issue an annual report on the condition of rural education, and \nan analysis of the impact on rural education from proposed regulations \nand other activities will be made public.\n  Rural schools have been a part of our national fabric since its very \nbeginning. These students deserve the attention from the Department of \nEducation this legislation will provide. It has been said that \neducation in rural America is ``too large to be ignored but too small \nand diverse to be highly visible.'' We need to establish this Office so \nthat education in these communities can thrive and so that its \nsuccesses are more visible. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3981-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3981-S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FORTY-EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY OF GRISWOLD v. CONNECTICUT\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the 48th \nanniversary of the landmark Griswold v. Connecticut Supreme Court \ndecision. Nearly 50 years ago, the Court greatly expanded women's \naccess to health care by legalizing the use of contraception by married \ncouples, basing this decision on a fundamental right to privacy in \nfamily planning decisions made between a man and a wife.\n  We have come a long way since 1965. Today, options for birth control \nare\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\nsafer, more effective, and available to far more people than just \nmarried couples. The simple facts are that 99 percent of women will use \ncontraceptives over the course of their lifetime, and the vast majority \nof Americans find the use of contraceptives morally acceptable. This \nprogress shows just how important contraceptive products and services \nhave become to our country.\n  Preserving this access should be a noncontroversial, bipartisan \nissue. And yet access to contraceptives and to Federal programs such as \ntitle X that support reproductive health care services are under attack \nnot only by the loud voices of a small minority but also by some \nMembers of Congress and in the courts. We have an alarming situation on \nour hands. Now more than ever, it is important that we continue to \nfight back against these outrageous attacks and talk about these issues \nin terms of the proven scientific facts.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I have remained dedicated to helping protect a \nwoman's right to direct her reproductive health care, a battle that I \nalso fought for years as attorney general in Connecticut. I challenged \nboth the Bush administration and the Obama administration on their \npolicies related to a Federal rule that interfered with State laws \nprotecting access to birth control and reproductive health services.\n  Having served on both the State and Federal levels, I see how \ncritically important the right to contraception is to our economy, our \nfamilies, and our society as a whole. Whether the threat comes from a \nFederal law overstepping States' jurisdiction or from a State law \nviolating constitutional rights--as was the case in Griswold v. \nConnecticut--we must continue to protect the right to safe, \ncomprehensive birth control.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3982-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           ALASKA'S CLASSICS\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I would like to honor all the \nAlaskans, clubs, and other organizations that collect, restore, show \noff, and otherwise love their classic and antique automobiles.\n  All over the State, there are clubs dedicated to antique autos, \nclassic cars, muscle cars, street rods, and all kinds of specialty \nvehicles. I really get a kick out of some of the expressive club names: \nthe Juneau Dipsticks, the Antique Auto Mushers of Alaska, and the \nValley Cruzers, to name a few.\n  But it is what they do that is great. Restoring cars and trucks and \nkeeping them in good running order contributes to preserving the \nhistory of automotive technology and our culture. And their efforts \nmean we get to view a wide variety of vintage vehicles at all sorts of \nvenues.\n  Maybe it is the iconic 1957 Chevy you saw at a local meet that caught \nyour fancy. Perhaps you feasted your eyes on a Ford Model T at a \nFather's Day car show. Or you glimpsed an old Jeep amongst a caravan of \nrestored military vehicles. Who hasn't marveled at antique cars in \nparades? As an elected official, I have ridden in many an old car or \ntruck on the Fourth of July. The beauty of classic car collections is \nthat there is something for everyone.\n  In Fairbanks, the Fountainhead Antique Auto Museum has a world-class \ncollection including Alaska's first automobile, one-of-a-kind and sole-\nsurviving autos, the first American V16-powered car--and much more.\n  Also in Fairbanks, students in an automotive technology class at \nHutchison High School are restoring a 1963 Chevy truck, and they are \ndoing it for more than just the learning experience. They are honoring \na former student who passed away in 2011. He bought two dilapidated \npickups to work on but was unable to continue the project.\n  In Delta Junction, the Buffalo Center Gas Station sponsors an Annual \nClassic Car Night in support of the Juvenile Diabetes Research \nFoundation.\n  Car collecting is so popular in America that the Senate has annually \nproclaimed a day in July as ``Collector Car Appreciation Day'' to raise \nawareness of the role automotive restoration and collection plays in \nAmerican society.\n  Whether it is the Vernon Nash Antique Automobile Club, the Midnight \nSun Street Rod Association, or the Anchorage Corvette Club, it is \ntypical of members to trade parts, knowledge, and stories. That makes \nfor lifetime friendships.\n  I encourage Alaskans to join car clubs and take the time to thank \ncollectors and restorers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3982-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3982-S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RECOGNIZING OARnet\n\n Mr. BROWN. Madam President, Ohio has a robust history of \npioneering innovation--as the home of Thomas Edison, the Wright \nBrothers, aerospace leaders including former Senator John Glenn, Neil \nArmstrong and more. Today, Ohio is transforming from the Rust Belt into \nthe Innovation Belt.\n  This week, OARnet, a member of Ohio Technology Consortium or OH-TECH, \nis being honored here in the Nation's Capital for its new ultra-fast \nbroadband network as an honored 2013 laureate by IDG's Computerworld, \nan international source of technology news and information for \ninformational technology influencers.\n  This Emerging Technology Award is based on Ohio's innovative efforts \nto meet the growing economic and research opportunities offered by \n``Big Data.'' In 2012, Ohio invested more than $13 million to increase \ntenfold the speed and network capacity of OARnet, a statewide broadband \nnetwork, to 100 gigabits per second, Gbps. Although several research \ninstitutions in other States are experimenting with this new gold \nstandard of broadband speeds, Ohio is the first in the Nation to \nharness this capacity on a statewide scale. Ohio touts connections to \n10 major cities, 90 of Ohio's higher education institutions, commercial \napplications, and Internet2's international network.\n  These broadband speeds are expected to create many opportunities for \nOhio. At 100 Gbps, each of Ohio's 1.8 million enrolled K-12 students \ncould download an e-book simultaneously in just over 2 minutes; data \nequivalent to 80 million file cabinets filled with text can be \ntransferred daily; 300,000 X-rays can be transmitted in just 1 minute; \n8.5 million electronic medical records can be transmitted in 1 minute; \nand data can be sent at 50,000 times faster than current average \nsmartphone speeds.\n  OH-TECH's international recognition is further testament to Ohio's \nevolution into a high-tech environment that supports next-generation \nbusiness applications to attract new employers, connects the State's \nhigher education institutions, our cutting edge medical corridor, and \nserves as a platform for developing large-scale scientific research.\n  Ohio is also celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Ohio \nSupercomputer Center with the launch of a new cluster supercomputer. \nThis new supercomputer, which can perform 88 trillion calculations per \nsecond, allows researchers statewide to innovate and compete for grants \nand national supercomputing resources in the areas of the biosciences, \nadvanced materials, energy, and the environment. I am proud to have \nworked closely with the White House to secure a $5 million grant to the \nOhio Supercomputer Center and several partner organizations to support \nthe advanced manufacturing efforts of Midwestern small- and medium-\nsized manufacturers, SMEs. I have also helped secure Federal funding to \nhelp small polymer companies address the technical barriers, costs, and \ntraining needed to use advanced manufacturing technologies. Through \npartnerships with the government and collaborations with technology \nleaders like Procter & Gamble, we can work together to help strengthen \nOhio's manufacturing sector and provide the tools needed to compete in \nthe global marketplace.\n  My home State is one of the largest investors and active partners in \nthe National Digital Engineering and Manufacturing Consortium, NDEMC, a \nbroad public-private partnership supporting the use of modeling and \nsimulation by small- and medium-sized manufacturers. This project gives \nmanufacturers the ability to conduct complex simulations to test \nvirtual prototypes and maximize production methods, all through cost-\neffective means. These platforms reduce manufacturers' time and labor \ncosts and help them bring products to market faster, making them more \ncompetitive with our overseas counterparts.\n  A Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial proclaimed, ``Ohio is wired for \nbusiness. Goodbye Rust Belt, Hello Nerd-\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\nvana.'' The Columbus Dispatch similarly noted, ``For those inventing \nthe future, Ohio is the hot spot.''\n  They are correct. Ken Murray, Transformatix founder and CEO, \nexplained:\n\n       One reason we located our new company, BioLinQ, in Ohio, \n     rather than California, is because Ohio demonstrated the most \n     forward-thinking approach to technology and high-speed \n     innovation.\n\n  Ray Leto, president of Total Sim, echoed those sentiments:\n\n       Our business focuses on modeling and simulation for the \n     automotive industry, and we chose Ohio over the North \n     Carolina Research Triangle because of the advanced technology \n     infrastructure available here.\n\n  The knowledge economy is the pathway to restoring our national \nprosperity, and I am proud to represent Ohio--a pioneering State that \nis providing the tools and leading the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3983-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE REHOBOTH ART LEAGUE\n\n Mr. CARPER. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Coons, \nCongressman Carney, and myself, I wish to recognize the Rehoboth Art \nLeague, its staff and artist members who on June 21, 2013, will \ncelebrate its founding in 1938 and the 75 subsequent years of \ncultivating the arts in Sussex County and the State of Delaware.\n  The Rehoboth Art League was Sussex County's first organized cultural \narts center and has been recognized by the State of Delaware Division \nof Historical and Cultural Affairs for its significance and influence \nthat extends far beyond Rehoboth and even the borders of our State. The \nRehoboth Art League grew out of the tradition of the Federal Arts \nProject, which was a subset of the Works Progress Administration during \nthe Great Depression. This tradition of art appreciation, support for \nworking artists, and the concept of enriched community living, inspired \nthe late Mrs. Louise Corkran to organize the Rehoboth Art League, with \nthe help of her husband, COL Wilbur Corkran. Her involvement with the \nfounding of the Delaware Art Museum, as well as her collaboration \nthrough the years with such renowned national artists as Howard Pyle, \nFrank Schoonover, N.C. Wyeth and others from the Brandywine and Hudson \nValley Schools, were a significant factor in the Rehoboth Art League's \ndevelopment. Over the years, it has become a place that attracts and \nnurtures artists from all over the country, and inspires art \nappreciation through its many educational offerings.\n  The Rehoboth Art League sits in the small village of Henlopen Acres, \nDE, on an historic campus overlooking the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal and the \nValley of the Swans, and maintains two colonial period buildings, The \nPaynter Studio, 1791, the Peter Marsh Homestead and Stables, 1743, as \nwell as Louise Corkran's garden, which is one of the only public \ngardens in Sussex County. The Rehoboth Art League owns and cares for a \nsignificant collection of Delaware art and archives, with pieces by \nHoward Pyle, Jack Lewis, Howard Schroeder, Ethel P. B. Leach, and \nothers. Its collection includes the renowned ``Doors of Fame,'' \nproviding tangible evidence of the legacy and history of the Rehoboth \nArt League. The tradition of signing doors was prevalent in art \ncolonies around the country in the first half of the twentieth century. \nThe Rehoboth Art League has, since its dedication in 1938, provided \nthree doors for signatures by artists, dignitaries, and national and \ninternational visitors. These doors record the persons who have \ncontributed to its success over the years. Today there are nearly 300 \nsignatures, often accompanied by a personal artistic flourish or \ndrawing. These signatures include six Delaware Governors, along with \nmany artists from the State and national pantheon, educators, \nscientists, musicians, and other notables.\n  Today, the Rehoboth Art League continues to attract artists and \nvisitors from all over the country. Its members hail from 19 different \nStates. It partners with 13 other organizations from the arts, \neducation, and health and human services across the region to provide a \nvariety of programming, both on the campus and around the county. Works \nfrom its collection have been on display at the Biggs Museum, Buena \nVista Conference Center, the Governor's mansion, and the Federal \noffices of Senator Chris Coons. The Rehoboth Art League also \ncollaborates with First State Community Action Agency to take arts \neducation to 600 at-risk students in Sussex County and to many senior \ncitizens in the region as well.\n  Today we are delighted to recognize the Rehoboth Art League, which \nfor more than 75 years has been a community of artists who share their \nart, inspire and support one another and enrich the lives of us \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3983-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL PETER FORD\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join in \nrecognizing LTC Peter Ford of South Carolina for his extraordinary \nservice to the Nation while serving in the United States Army Reserves \nand National Guard for the past 32 years.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Ford started his military career in 1981 as an \nenlisted soldier--an infantryman--in the Virginia National Guard. After \ngraduating from Gustavus Adolphus College, where he was the only ROTC \ncadet, Lieutenant Colonel Ford was commissioned as a second lieutenant \nin the Army Ordinance Corps. After attending the Officer Basic Course, \nLieutenant Colonel Ford, in his civilian capacity, was sworn in as a \nspecial agent with the State Department Diplomatic Security Service.\n  While serving as the Regional Security Officer, RSO, at the embassy \nin Switzerland, Lieutenant Colonel Ford was assigned as a military \nintelligence officer at the Military Intelligence Group at the 7th Army \nReserve Command in Germany. In 1997, he mobilized to support the war in \nBosnia. Following his return to the United States, he joined the \nOffice, Chief of the Army Reserves, as a reserve congressional liaison \nofficer and also served as a reservist with the 157th Individual \nMobilization Augmentee Detachment.\n  In 2003, Lieutenant Colonel Ford was assigned as a congressional \ndetailee to the Committee on Homeland Security and was named executive \nofficer of the 157th. After serving as RSO in Armenia, he was detailed \nto the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  In the fall of 2007, at the beginning of the surge during Operation \nIraqi Freedom, Lieutenant Colonel Ford volunteered to serve as an Army \nreservist in Iraq. He was attached to the American Embassy in Baghdad \nand, as the director of the Office of Hostage Affairs, was responsible \nfor U.S. kidnapping cases throughout the country. Following the \ncompletion of his military tour, Lieutenant Colonel Ford continued his \nservice in Iraq. For an additional year, he worked as a DSS agent with \nthe State Department in the same position.\n  Returning to the United States, Lieutenant Colonel Ford obtained a \nmasters degree from the National Defense Intelligence College and \njoined Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Affairs as a drilling \nReservist. He was subsequently assigned to the Diplomatic Security's \nOverseas Security Advisory Council, OSAC. In October 2011, Lieutenant \nColonel Ford took command of the 157th Individual Mobilization \nAugmentee Detachment. During his military and civilian careers, \nLieutenant Ford has worked in over 110 countries.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in saying \nthank you to LTC Peter Ford for his extraordinary dedication to duty \nand service to the country throughout his distinguished career in the \nUnited States Army.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3983-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3983-S3984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE BOMKAMP\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, today I wish to recognize \nKatherine Bomkamp, a West Virginia University student who has, out of \nprofound compassion for wounded veterans and incredible talent in STEM \nsciences, created a prosthetic device to address phantom pain felt by \nmillions of the world's amputees.\n  At a young age, Katherine spent a significant amount of time at the \nWalter Reed Army Medical Center with her father, a U.S. Air Force \nveteran. There, she discovered her passion and eagerness to help \nsuffering soldiers as she listened to the difficult challenges many of \nthem were facing upon returning home.\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\n  The conversations between Katherine and the many veterans she \nencountered are what inspired her to create the Pain Free Socket, an \ninvention that incorporates thermal biofeedback to eliminate phantom \npain. This device began as a tenth grade science project and has made \nher a hero to veterans in distress.\n  Since patenting the invention, Katherine has started her own company \nand will soon begin clinical trials.\n  Not surprisingly, Katherine has received a lot of media attention as \na result of her innovation and achievement, including global coverage \nby CNN, the New York Times, BBC, and many others.\n  The West Virginia University junior was even featured in Glamour \nMagazine as one of the Top 10 College Women in the country and won \n$2,500 from the L'Oreal Paris Beauty of Giving Award.\n  Katherine, who came to West Virginia from Waldorf, MD, is an \nextraordinary example of success in the STEM fields of science, \ntechnology, engineering and mathematics, not just in my home State, but \nacross the Nation and the world.\n  A Newman Civic Fellow, she is one of the youngest ever to present to \nthe Royal Society of Medicine's Medical Innovations Summit in London, \nEngland.\n  I am so proud of Katherine and her dedication to helping those who \nhave fought courageously and honorably for this country. She has found \na way to serve those who have served this great Nation--and who have \nrisked it all in doing so.\n  On behalf of the State of West Virginia, I congratulate Katherine on \nall her achievements and wish her the best of luck in her very bright \nfuture. And I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking Katherine \nfor her compassion to work for the brave men and women of our Armed \nForces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3984-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA\n\n Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the 50th anniversary of the University of \nCentral Florida, UCF. As a shining success story in America's higher \neducation system, UCF has recently become the Nation's second-largest \nuniversity. Not only has UCF grown in size, but also diversity, quality \nof education, and reputation. Today, UCF serves nearly 60,000 students, \nincluding a 39 percent minority population.\n  I was pleased to learn the first class of medical students graduated \nfrom UCF earlier this year, those graduates were a part of a historical \nundertaking. The impact of UCF's medical school in the region is \nhistoric as well. UCF's College of Medicine plays a vital role in \nOrlando's ``Medical City'' at Lake Nona, a cluster of research \ninstitutions that will help to position Central Florida as a leader in \nmedical care. UCF hopes for the medical school to not only increase \nopportunities for medical education in Florida, but to create a climate \nof excellence among regional research, education and medical care that \nwill make it one of the premier institutions in the world.\n  I would also like to mention the Institute for Simulation and \nTraining at UCF, who has recently celebrated 30 years of Modeling and \nSimulation Training and is an internationally recognized research \ninstitute who has partnered with both military contractors and the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Congratulations to the University of Central Florida on reaching this \nmilestone and on its many distinguished achievements in research, \nteaching, and public service as it celebrates its Golden Anniversary. I \nlook forward to 50 more years of accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3984-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO KATHRYN A. CONDON\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, as chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize Ms. Kathryn A. Condon, who has retired after over 30 years of \npublic service. Specifically, I would like to thank Ms. Condon for her \nsteadfast leadership as the Executive Director of Arlington National \nCemetery.\n  Arlington National Cemetery embodies one of our commitments to those \nwho defend our Nation--to provide them with a final resting place that \nhonors their service. With approximately 27 to 30 funeral services a \nday, Arlington is one of many active cemeteries for our fallen heroes. \nIt is also considered a national treasure for its rich history, dating \nback to the Civil War, and historic memorials, such as: the Tomb of the \nUnknowns; the Women in Military Service Memorial, which honors the \nbrave women who have honorably worn our Nation's uniform; and Chaplains \nHill, the eternal resting place of Chaplains from four different wars.\n  Although Arlington is now a shining example of how we honor those who \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice, it has not always been so. In 2010, \nthe Army's inspector general discovered grievous errors, dysfunction, \nand mismanagement at Arlington. These highly publicized problems were \nlinked to antiquated procedures and failure by the cemetery's senior \nleadership.\n  Ms. Condon's steadfast commitment and dedication as Arlington's top \nexecutive has reinstated Arlington as a national shrine for those who \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice. Her leadership has led to the \ncorrection of all of the issues highlighted by the Army inspector \ngeneral's 2010 report and the creation of processes that will ensure \nthe longevity of this national shrine and make certain that previous \nmistakes are not repeated.\n  Particularly, I would like to highlight Arlington's new burial record \nsystem, ANC Explorer. In 2010, Arlington relied on a paper-based record \nsystem that caused confusion and led to the misplacement of burials. \nThanks to Ms. Condon, Arlington now operates a new geospatial tracking \nsystem, which permits the families of our fallen heroes and cemetery \nstaff to, among other things: receive turn-by-turn direction to any \nburial site or monument; view events, in real-time, occurring through \nthe cemetery; and easily track and maintain burial space.\n  On behalf of our Nation's veterans and their families, I would like \nto thank Ms. Condon for her devotion to reaffirming Arlington National \nCemetery's status as a national treasure and commend her on an \nillustrious career in public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3984-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3984-S3985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CAROL MACK\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, today I wish to to recognize \nCarol Mack, principal of Matthew Thornton Elementary School in \nLondonderry, NH. Carol's dedication to the school's faculty, the Town \nof Londonderry and the students and families who comprise the school \ncommunity has shone throughout her 25 years of service to Matthew \nThornton. While I know that her leadership will be missed by the school \ncommunity, I join Carol's family and friends in recognizing her impact \nand achievements and celebrating her retirement.\n  Carol's connection to Matthew Thornton began in 1983, when her son \nJack was a first grade student at the school and she served as a \nvolunteer. Carol then accepted a position as a teaching assistant at \nthe school, and eventually decided to return to graduate school to \nattain a Master's Degree in education. Upon completion of her \nprofessional degree, Carol rose quickly at Matthew Thornton, serving \nfirst as a substitute teacher, then a first grade teacher, and \neventually becoming the school's assistant principal. Carol's \ndedication and hard work was recognized statewide when she was named \nAssistant Principal of the Year by the New Hampshire Association of \nSchool Principals in 2002.\n  In 2004, Carol moved into a new role as principal of Matthew Thornton \nElementary School. Her leadership, vision and commitment to the \nschool's betterment was recognized again in 2012 when the New Hampshire \nParent Teacher Association named Carol its Administrator of the Year. \nBut as a former public school teacher, Carol's rewards have come from \nthe students with whom she works on a daily basis. Her vision and \nleadership undoubtedly inspired generations of students to make the \nworld a better place.\n  I would like to thank Carol Mack for her hard work on behalf of \ncountless residents of New Hampshire. I am sure that she will be truly \nmissed by the families, staff, and most importantly, the students, of \nMatthew Thornton Elementary School. I know that her family, including \nher husband Andy and\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\nher children Karen, Cindy and Jack, and their spouses Andrew, Chris and \nMissy, and her friends, colleagues and community join me in \ncongratulating and celebrating her notable work and the positive impact \nthat she has had on thousands of young lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3985-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to ensure that every child is ready for college or a career; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to say on behalf of \nseveral Republican Senators, including Senators Burr, Isakson, Kirk, \nRoberts, Hatch, and Enzi that I am introducing today the Every Child \nReady for College or Career Act. This bill would let States decide \nwhether schools and teachers are succeeding or failing. It would end \nthe accumulation of Federal mandates that have piled up on States and \nlocal school districts and has created, in effect, a national school \nboard. It would help 50 million children in 100,000 public schools \nlearn what they need to know and be able to do by restoring \nresponsibility to States and\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\ncommunities and giving teachers and parents more freedom, flexibility, \nand choices.\n  I will have more to say about this on Monday in a floor speech, but I \nwanted to call it to the attention of our colleagues.\n  While it is being offered by Republican Senators, we do not see it as \na Republican bill. We see it as a piece of legislation that will \nattract the support of classroom teachers, principals, Governors, \nlegislators, and others who have been working for 30 years to set high \nstandards, create better tests, create accountability systems, and \npioneering in developing teacher evaluation systems.\n  We believe it is the proper role of the Federal Government to create \nan environment for better schools, but not to issue orders from \nWashington. The combination of No Child Left Behind mandates, Race to \nthe Top mandates, and mandates as a result of the Secretary of \nEducation's waivers have created such congestion in the U.S. Department \nof Education that it has become, in effect, a national school board.\n  We want to head in the other direction. We want to give back to \nStates and local governments the responsibility for deciding whether \nschools and teachers are succeeding or failing. I hope all of our \ncolleagues will read the Every Child Ready for College or Career Act.\n  Senator Harkin and I look forward to the markup next Tuesday in the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. We will offer \ncompeting versions. His is more than 1,100 pages, and ours is 220 \npages. This is a symbol of the differences in our approaches. We will \nbegin a debate which I hope goes through the committee, moves to the \nSenate floor, combines with the House in conference, and produces a \nresult that reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nthis year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3989-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1174.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: \nCalendar Nos. 141, 142, and 143; that the nominations be confirmed, en \nbloc; the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be \nin order to any of the nominations; that any related statements be \nprinted in the Record; that President Obama be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm Judge Charles \nBreyer, Rachel Barkow, and Judge William Pryor to the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission. While it is good that the Senate is acting to confirm Judge \nPryor and Rachel Barkow following their unanimous approval by the \nJudiciary Committee 2 weeks ago, it is wrong that Senate Republicans \nforced Judge Breyer to wait so long for confirmation. Judge Breyer was \nfirst reported unanimously last July, nearly 11 months ago. Despite \nthat unanimous support, Senate Republicans, as they have done so many \ntimes, refused to act on his nomination on the floor and forced the \nPresident to renominate him this year for no good reason.\n  Judge Breyer has an outstanding record in public service, and has \nserved as a U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California \nsince 1998, assuming senior status last year. He has\n\n[[Page S3991]]\n\nalso worked in private practice and as a prosecutor--both in the San \nFrancisco District Attorney's office and on the Watergate Special \nProsecution Force. After graduating from law school he served as a law \nclerk to Chief Judge Oliver J. Carter of the U.S. District Court for \nthe Northern District of California. Additionally, from 1969 to 1973, \nJudge Breyer was a Captain in the U.S. Army's Judge Advocate General's \nCorps. Judge Breyer will be an outstanding addition to the Sentencing \nCommission.\n  Rachel Barkow has been a law professor at the New York University \nSchool of Law for the past 11 years. She previously worked as an \nassociate in private practice at Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd & Evans, \nP.L.L.C. in Washington, D.C. In 2001, she took leave from private \npractice to serve as the John M. Olin Fellow in Law at Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center. Following law school, Professor Barkow served as \na law clerk for D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Laurence H. \nSilberman and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n  William Pryor is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Eleventh Circuit, a position to which he was confirmed in 2005. \nPrior to becoming a judge, he served as the Attorney General of Alabama \nfrom 1997 to 2004, where he led the effort to create Alabama's \nsentencing commission.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The nominations considered and confirmed are as follows:\n\n\n                  united states sentencing commission\n\n       Rachel Elise Barkow, of New York, to be a Member of the \n     United States Sentencing Commission for a term expiring \n     October 31, 2017.\n       Charles R.

Madam President, tomorrow there will be another class of \npages who will graduate after serving the Senate so well. We expect a \nlot of our pages, who often work as hard as Senators and staff. Their \ncontributions to make the Senate run smoothly day in and day out are \ngreatly appreciated. I commend them for their hard work, thank them for \ntheir efforts, and wish them the best of luck in their next endeavor.\n  Speaking from a personal perspective, my two oldest grandchildren \nserved as pages. It really changed their lives. Even though their \ngrandfather was heavily involved in politics--and that was all my adult \nlife--they really were not in tune with what was going on or I guess \nthey really didn't care that much. But after having served here as \npages, they became avid readers of the press, listened to the news, and \nbecame interested in what goes on here.\n  These jobs as pages are really life-changing. There are lots of \nexamples of that. Senator Chris Dodd, who recently retired, was a \nlongtime Member of Congress and Senator from Connecticut. His serving \nas a page really paved the way for him to be a Peace Corps volunteer, a \nMember of Congress, and a Member of the Senate. Each of these young men \nand women has a golden opportunity.\n  I appreciate very much how hard they have worked. These young men and \nwomen have gone to school, and it has been hard. It is not easy to \ncomplete the semester of school that they do here--it is very hard. \nPeople who run that school cut them no slack. Whether it is English or \nmath, they work them very hard. They go through a drill, living in the \ndorm. It is not easy. They are strictly supervised.\n  I am proud of every one of them. I wish I had more time to spend with \nthem individually because it is really important for this institution \nthat the page program continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/06/senate-section/article/S3993-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JUNE 7, 2013\n\n  Mr. REID.
